This pregnancy was my 2nd only in my life.  I am wondering if you MX3 capsules are safe to take as part of my 4 month preconception plan?  Do you know what benefits it could provide me with?  thanks so much.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.MX3 is a supplement derived from the Mangosteen fruit, which is used as a traditional medicine in certain cultures.Unfortunately, because this supplement is not truly a drug, it is not been tested for safety or effectiveness in a conventional scientific way. Therefore, there is no way to know what its effects may be on trying to conceive and pregnancy.  In addition, there is no evidence that this herbal supplement actually has any of the effects that are listed on the bottle, because supplements are not required to undergo testing in the same way as conventional drugs.Certainly, there is no evidence that this medication will be harmful to you while you are actually trying to get pregnant.  So if you desire, taking MX three while you are trying to become pregnant does not seem to be harmful. However, once you conceive, I would not recommend continuing the medication.The only reliable supplementation that has been shown to increase the chance of a good pregnancy outcome is taking folic acid. Folic acid is involved in the development of the fetal brain and spinal cord, and folic acid deficiency is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects. For that reason, women are recommended to take a folic acid supplement of at least 400 mg when trying to conceive and during pregnancy.So in summary, I would not recommend taking MX3 once you are pregnant, however taking it while you are trying to conceive is not likely to be harmful. However, there is no evidence that it will increase your chance of getting pregnant or help the health of your pregnancy. Only folic acid taken during preconception has been shown to improve pregnancy outcome.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, I started taking Microgynon about 6 weeks ago. We had sex after only 3/4 days and now I'm worried could i be pregnant? I took a 7 day gap between packs and did bleed. I keep burping all the time which is not likeme at all and have very sore breasts. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, if you've been taking your birth control pills every day and you did have a menstrual period during the seven-day break, there is no reason to suspect that your pill is not effective in preventing pregnancy.Birth control pills can have very similar side effects to the symptoms of pregnancy in the first three months of use. These include bloating, breast tenderness, nausea, mood changes, and spotting when you're not supposed to have your period.  Most women see the side effects decrease after their body gets used to the pill which takes about three months.So in your case, as long as you're taking your pills every day according to the package directions and do not have more than seven days in between packs, your chance of pregnancy is less than 1%.The most common sign of pregnancy is missing your period. So if for any reason you do not bleed during the pill free week, especially if you do not miss any pills during the month or deviate from your schedule, that would be a time where I recommend performing a pregnancy test.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I took clomid from cd 2-6 and my follicle was 19mm on cd16.

Your weight should be Height in cms - 100 I mean 5 ft= 152-100= 52 kgThis is reason for PCO & difficulty in pregnancy.Try to reduce the fat around mid segment of body. No fasting. Have controlled diet regularly with low calories, no junk food. Regular exercise , especially for the waist , thighs & mid segment of body. take your time . If you get pregnant with fat, chances of pregnancy complications are also high.Once you lose weight , your periods will also be regular with good flow ( normal flow) & you may get pregnant even without medications.  Inj HCG is hormone which causes your follicle to rupture & egg is pushed out. Usually 13-15 day of cycle follicle will be ripe to rupture, hence doc has give you that injection.Have faith in God , you will get pregnant when right time comesAll the best Dr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"We consulted a Gynac yesterday...she told that the egg has got released from the ovary of my wife...She suggested us to have intercourse as the egg would be alive for about 48 hours...i wanted to know what are the chances of my wife becoming pregnant??","Doctor":"Hi , Rightly said Egg has life of around 48 hrs , but is very healthy for 24 hrs only.Sperms stay alive for 3 days , that is 72 hrs.So chances of pregnancy is high if you have sex just before ovulation & also for next 2-4 days.Sperms should reach the tube first & then wait for the egg to come into tube , where they meet & form the baby. Then baby moves & fixes in the uterus.Chances of pregnancy in normal couple is only 10 % . That's because the healthy egg may not meet the healthy sperm always. Healthy doesn't mean you have a problem. Incidentally the egg or the sperm chosen may not be good. If you are lucky , you may be in that 10 % & you get the best sperm to meet the best egg & you have a healthy lovely baby.These are somethings we cannot control.All the best , God bless youDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"Hi. I there a problem if me and my partern have the same bloog group? We are trying to conceive and has not yet happened, this it the thrid month. I am 30 and my husband 32, not history of medical problems. I have previously used the injection contraception, the last one was in June 10.","Doctor":"Hello,The same blood group has no effect on conception. Don't worry regarding the same blood group.  Check your both thalassemia status before conception. Try to do intercourse from 12 to 18 days of menstrual cycle as during this period ovulation occurs, so conception chance is high. (LH kit can be used for presuming ovulation.) If after 1 year you can't conceive then detailed evaluation is needed with serum progesterone, estrogen, FSH, LH estimation, HSG, serum TSH, free T4 estimation, husband semen analysis, etc., like investigations.Hope I have answered your query.

Don't worry. Husband age is not a big problem. But his sugar is to be corrected immediately. May be that abortion was also because of this.When his sugar level is high, no matter how high,his body may lodge certain infections. High sugars & infections can damage the head of sperm( that's where the genetic material of father is transferred to the baby) so the count may be normal but sperms not healthy, hence the pregnancy out of this unhealthy & can cause abortions. Now over years even the count also is reducing. This can be effectively corrected by oral pills or better with Insulin injections. Insulin for immediate control ,later can be switched to oral pills , under diabetologist supervision.You can spend 2-3 mths in this treatment & get control.Once done you can have tubal patency tested , HSG ( Xray with dye ) or SSG ( scan with dye ) or Laparoscopy . You may also need antibiotic / antifungal treatment for vagina ( transmitted from husband)Once confirmed & semen parameters improved , especially the morphology of sperms( health of sperms) go ahead with IUI ( Intrauterine insemination) which increases pregnancy chances by 4 times . You can try it 3 times , if not successful go ahead with IVF, because of your age factor.If you are not happy with the management there , you should take a second opinion, as your time is ticking away.As you had a pregnancy ,even though it ended in an abortion, your chances for another pregnancy is very high.

Ampiclox is an antibiotic , something that affects bacteria & Chicken pox is a virus !! how can it help. It only reduces secondary infections after you get chicken pox.If your partner has chickenpox, better you delay attempting for pregnancy till fully healthy.When male gets infections- their sperm count, motility & health is reduced. So pregnancy chances is low.In women - Ovulation may not occur due to fever. But incidentally if you get pregnant, the virus in chicken pox & fever itself will cause certain irreparable damages in the baby. Either it will end in abortion or baby with certain defects warranting abortion.So I would advise you to wait for the infection to completely leave your house for you to try for pregnancy.Hope I have cleared your queryAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"Hi i am 27 yrs female.My bothovaries are enlarge in size but have normal shape,outline and echogenicity.There are multiple small (less than 5mm) cysts at peripheral parts of both ovaries.No calcification is seen in ovary.

Even if you are not overweight, have regular exercise for mid-segment of body, controlled low calories diet, avoid junk food. No fasting please.This itself without any medications will normalise your hormones, periods & ovulation.Now your eggs are not rupturing on their own , they are seen as multiple cysts on scan, so they don't meet sperms, so no pregnancy. Only if your follicles rupture your periods will be regular.If you get pregnant with abnormal hormones, you stand a chance of early abortions too.Just get your Thyroid profile & Serum Prolactin level checked in early morning, empty stomach.

To rule out other causes for irregular cycles hope you have done Serum Thyroid profile  / Serum Prolactin , they affect ovulation.You can have sex once her periods bleeding stops, daily or alternate day or as per your convenience. This is not for pregnancy , it's to throw out old sperms. Older the sperms , poorer the healthy pregnancy chances . As life of sperm is only 3 days.Have sex till 10th day of periods ( 1st day of bleeding is 1 st day of periods)Then no sex for 3 days. This will help accumulate young sperms for the ovulation , which occurs usually around 14-16 day of cycle.Have sex for 4-6 days, any number of times , daily.Later than this is optional. Egg's life is only 1 day.But this schedule can be followed only if cycle is regular.Hope I have made it clear with reason.All the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"i am 29 year old woman. we have been trying to get pregenent in 3 years. now my doctor have giving fertyl -super 100mg tablet. today is my second perioday i want star to eat that medicine. so i would like to know the side effect. and also i have been having ulcerative colitics 4 years still the treatment is going on. and this ulcerative colitics make danger to the baby in pregenecy. and will my baby will be healthy or dsiable.","Doctor":"Hi.It would be best to start taking the medication from the 2nd day until the 5th day of your cycle. No there are no side effects other than mild abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, etc.Ulcerative colitis will not effect the pregnancy or harm it so there is nothing to really worry about in regards to the condition.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, I was diagonised with PCOS 3 years ago. I concieved and have a baby boy of 1 year and 10 months. I have been having regular periods after birth until last month when I missed my periods. I had all signs for pregnancy but I tested and i wasnt pregnant. I visited a GYN who prescribed duphaston 10mg for me. he doesnt know my history of PCOS, HE thinks that since i gave birth by C-Section, they could have blocked my tubes. I am afraid of taking the duphaston 10gm because i am still breastfeeding and also have herpetitis B.  wont this medicine affect me and my child. I badly want to concieve. Many thanks JY","Doctor":"Hi.Duphaston is a hormonal pill that will help regulate your cycle, and if at all you are breastfeeding, fluctuations in your menstrual cycle are normal, and I would not worry too much about it.As for the C-section, the procedure cannot block your tubes, and you should be safe to conceive, it may just be a slight fluctuation in your hormone levels that is making it a little difficult. Continue to try to conceive, and write to me using our premium service so I can guide you in a more accurate manner with some fertility tips and medications.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"hello Im 28yrs old having PCOS problem from almost 6yrs now. Im 5ft tall and weigh about 53kgs. I was on Diane 35 for almost a year due to my irregular periods, as a BCP and for my hairloss problem.

Now, it has been 10days since I completed 25th day of menses cycle and the tabs, but there are no signs of getting my period. Im very much worried.

WHEN CAN I GET PREGNANT","Doctor":"Hi.Once the pelvic inflammatory disease has been well treated, we may have to go ahead with an investigation called a hysterosalpingography just to make sure there are no obstructions in your reproductive tract.The hyponnid is to help you to lose weight and you should also work out an exercise and diet regimen. Ruling out/confirming conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome can direct better management, but generally if your cycles are normal, then I would just advice weight loss and fertility medication like clomiphene to be initiated. You can start trying about 2-3 weeks after the last dose for the PID treatment.Best of luck."},{"Patient":"my name is chandrasekhar i got married 5 years back after one year my wife got Pregnancy but after 3rd month doctor's did abastion because of baby growth is less we wait for normal pregnancy but some day we want for laperscopy in that test result is TB in Stomach its a insatl stage pls she can consive na","Doctor":"Hi.I would just recommend non-invasive imaging of your wifes reproductive system (i.e. if she was the one diagnosed with TB of the stomach).

That's the reason for opening up of cervix at 5th month. This problem can be treated only after you are pregnant.

You need to meet you gynecologist who will advise you & your husband a kit of antibiotics & antifugal medicines & follow up antibiotics, Husband will need local antibiotics & you will need vaginal antibiotic capsules. Try for pregnancy only after that. Both of you have to be treated because these infections are transmitted when you have sex. Don't have sex till you finish these medications.

It would although be better if you would go about a little more care during masturbation to make sure hygiene is taken care of.As for conception, sexual intercourse on a regular basis especially on the most fertile days of the month are advised, and there is no other way to it, unless you want to go about artificial insemination ma'am.Please do write to me using our premium service so we can have a one-on-one more private discussion.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"hi there my name is s ,p and to cut it short am currently taking tramadol every day but me and my partner have been trying for a baby well second baby but its been more than a year and she just cannot concieve i wonder if tramadol has damaged my sperm and minimised the chances ., thank you","Doctor":"Hi.There is no significant study or research to prove that tramadol has an effect on male fertility and if there is an issue, it could just be the more common ones like a hormonal cause, etc; request your wife to visit an obstetrician and gynaecologist who will find the issue and sort it out in no time.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"hiii doctor m 24 yrs old, 3 yrs old married girl I was suffering from pcos n my doctor gave me 3 month course of elestra with y cyst m now my cycle is regular from last 2 months we are trying for conceive with diva hmg n hcg 1000 inj n my follicle ruptured in both past cycle but not conceived so doctor suggested me LEVO E this month.. my question is why he gave me contraceptive this month?","Doctor":"Hi , Nice to hear that you had ovulation with those injections . When you are stimulated with hormones you get multiple follicles. Especially when you have PCOD, you may produce 5-10 follicles at a time. All these may not rupture, only biggest of these would have ruptured. The remaining un-ruptured follicles stay on for some time & keep producing hormones & it may affect your cycle & hence may affect follicular output of next cycle. By using contraceptive pills doctor is suppressing those unwanted hormones, suppressing those unruptured follicles & after this suppression next cycle when stimulation is done you will get better & healthier follicles. This is called Hormonal Down-regulation.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. First of all do not panic. If you have history of regular cycles then day 10 to 20 of the cycle is the most fertile period of cycle. If you happen to have unprotected sex act in this period, then You Stand chance to get pregnant.  At least try to have sex at least on alternate days during this period  I will suggest you to opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Include more portions of fruits, salads and vegetables in daily diet. Drink plenty of water in the day. Avoid deep fried foods , bakery products and refined sugars. Use of vitamin B 12 and Omega 3 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant. This helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy and delivery. Also , get husband's semen analysis done. You can get post menstrual HSG - hysterosalpingography done, to know bout tubal patency. .Plesse think positive. Meditate regularly. May God bless you with a bundle of joy. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks. Dr. Purushottam Neurgaonkar"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... are you more likely to let pregnant from sperm that is from a 43 year old who has very very rare sex or a 28 year old who has sex every few days. from a 28 year old woman.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, The woman is 28 years young; so very much in peak of the childbearing age. Now, the timing of intercourse is more important than the frequency of intercourse. The egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to the next expected menses; so it is easy to spot the day of ovulation in a woman who is having regular menstrual cycles. The egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 3 days. Hence a period of about a week around the day of ovulation is fertile period. So more frequent intercourse during this fertile period is more likely to result in pregnancy. Intercourse on the day of ovulation is more likely to be successful in achieving pregnancy. If the semen quality and the sperm counts are within normal limits (as reported by semen examination), then a male of 43 years or of 28 yeas should not make any difference as far as the conception is concerned. The key factor is that the sperms should find live egg within 3 days of intercourse. I hope this clarifies your doubts. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi, i am a 26 year old female and i ve been having painful pains on my waist, when i go to the doctors they are telling me that i have too many sores on my womb, do i still have a chance to get pregnat because i have been trying but no luck. what can i do?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for writing to us. I will be able to comment further if you can upload any relevant reports. Erosion of the cervix and infection as such are not a hindrance to conception, and should be treated effectively. Infections, however, may delay the process. Polyps and fibroids can enlarge during pregnancy and can cause miscarriage. So, it depends on what you have and how treatable your condition is. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, My name is Mahesh and i have a wife. Our marriage done on August 2009.

You had nausea and vomiting along with a missed period. So the possibility of pregnancy is very high. In fact you could have gone for some pregnancy test earlier; particularly because you have a bad obstetric history. However, now you can submit yourself for ultrasonography. If you are aborting and the bleeding has not stooped, ultrasonography will clearly give you the evidence. If the pregnancy is disturbed and non-viable, you will require evacuation of uterus. However, if the pregnancy is still intact and not separated from the uterine wall, you stand a good chance to continuation of pregnancy. Your pregnancy test also then would be positive. In that case, please report to your Gynaecologist. Take complete bed rest. You may require some Progestational preparation like Susten or hCG injection to support and stabilize the pregnancy. I hope this provides you preliminary guidelines. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"am i pregnet?okay. so my breast are sore and enlarging in size. i have been having little cramping but not extreme. my period isnt suppose to start for another 6 days. i deside to take a pregnancy test today and it had a slight faint line. but visible to the eyes.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, The first cardinal symptom of pregnancy is missing a period; all other cardinal symptoms of pregnancy like nausea and vomiting, frequent urination and breast symptoms start about a week after missing a period. So, your breast symptoms cannot be attributed to pregnancy so early. Cramps or any sort of pain in abdomen is not a symptom of pregnancy. The urine pregnancy test is reliably positive about a week after the missed period; however, Beta hCG pregnancy test on urine may show reliable results even few days before missing a period. Since it is done too early, it may show faint positive line. At this stage, Beta hCG test on blood will be more informative - values above 25 mIU/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy while in non-pregnant state, the values remain under 5 mIU/ml. I hope this should resolve your dilemma. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am 30 years, trying to concieve for the past 6 months, I am advised to take Glycomet SR 500, Folic acid and from today being 16th Day Duphston.I have been given HuCOG today and under folical monitoring. Wanted to check what are my chances of getting pregnant","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, HuCOG  is a hCG preparation which helps the release of the egg (ovulation) from a matured follicle. Glycomate with Clomiphene citrate helps the maturity of the follicles. Duphaston would work better if given after injection of hCG. In fact, when hCG is given, Duphaston becomes optional medicine. Folic acid helps the endometrium to grow and the follicle to be healthy. Please monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography. Mostly within 24 hours after the HuCOG injection, ovulation will take place. So have daily intercourse for next 48 hours. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. I hope this clarifies your doubts. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"My medical insurance ran out about 2 months ago and that is when I stopped the generic YAZ birth control pill. I am almost 24 yrs old & I have been on different types of bc pills for 10 years and this is the 1st time I have not been on it. Now, I have not had a period for this entire time and am concerned. Took 2 at home preg test and both negative. Also, I have dropped about 20 lbs over this time too (was 145 now 125) and have been having very severe anxiety/depression... Over the past 10 yrs I have also experimented with all types of drug use. Is my body changing for good??","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Pregnancy test on urine is reliable after about a week of missed period; earlier these tests can report false negative results. However, since you have repeated the test twice, it is likely that later test was done after about a week of missed period. If not you may repeat the test on overnight early morning first urine sample after 4 more days. If this test also reports  negative, you are not pregnant. There are multiple causes apart from pregnancy for missing a period. However, from your history, it appears that you are under tremendous depression and anxiety. Your feeling for permanent change in the body also seems to be out of anxious feeling. This is one of the very important and common causes of missing a period; and then irregular menses subsequently. Please report to some counsellor/psychiatrist with your anxiety/depression issue for effective management. Hormonal imbalance also can cause irregularity in the menses. Please report to your Gynaecologist for thorough investigations and management.Meanwhile you may take some progestational preparation like Deviry for 5 days and then hope for the withdrawal bleeding with 4-7 days after that, if you are not pregnant. This medicine should be taken with a Gynaecologist's advice only. I hope this helps you.

You seem to have such pregnancy in the past. Most of the time, such pregnancy is due to unhealthy ovum. The possibility of recurrence of such pregnancy is about 10%. Normal healthy pregnancies are noted after Blighted ovum. You may report to a Foetal Medicine consultant for evaluating both of you for any chromosomal issues. This might help you in planning a healthy pregnancy. Please start consuming Folic acid daily much before you are attempting the pregnancy. This will increase the possibilities of healthy pregnancy. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi.. I'm trying to get pregnant. Took clomid from 5th to 9th day. Started with duphaston on 16th day. But I have not ovulated yet.. It's been 2 days since I started duphaston.. So wil this be a problem for ovulating? If so, can I stop the medicine now.. I'm afraid it'll cause withdrawal bleeding now.. Pls clarify","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Clomid is Clomiphene citrate which helps release of the eggs in patients who fail to ovulate. My advice to you would be: 1. Start Clomid pills from day 2 onwards for 5 days. Do not carry on with these pills for more than 6 cycles. If you fail to conceive even after 6 cycles of Clomiphene trial, switch over to some other medicines like HMC/hCG combination for induction of ovulation. 2. From day 9 onwards, submit yourself for ovulation monitoring. The follicles between 18 mm and 21 mm in size release healthiest eggs. So when the follicle is of 18 mm size, Inj. hCG may be given for inducing the ovulation. After that, you should have at least alternate day intercourse for next 3 days. 3. The Endometrium (uterine lining) should be between 9 mm and 14 mm in thickness at the time of ovulation. 4. Duphaston may be taken after the ovulation has effected and confirmed; taken before ovulation may interfere the egg release. 5. Please get your tubal patency and uterine cavity evaluated by Hysterosalpingography and Laparoscopy. 6. Husband's sperms should be evaluated for quantity and quality by semen examination after 4 days of sexual abstinence. I hope this provides you preliminary guidelines. For more detailed consultation, you may ask me Direct question on this forum. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"HI, I am 30 years old and my husband is the same age. We have been trying to conceive for almost two years. I had a missed miscarriage last year in September and had a septum removal (disovered during the D&C) in February.

My husband is alergic to aspirin and now I am worried that maybe that might stop us from conceiving. I also have very irregular periods, but the doctors keep telling me that since I have conceived once it will happen again. So what test should I do to get pregnant faster and should I continue taking the aspirin. Thank You","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Low dose aspirin will not cause infertility. You are having irregular menses; so it is most likely that you may not be ovulating regularly or at all. Please submit yourself for ultrasonography for ovulation monitoring.  If you are not ovulating, you may need some treatment for ovulation induction. If you are ovulating, then try to plan your sexual relations on and around the day of ovulation. Also get your tubal patency and uterine cavity tested by Hysterosalpingography and Laparoscopy. Any block and/or adhesions may require surgical intervention. Husband's sperm quantity and quality should be assessed by semen examination. Please report to an infertility consultant.

Please can you tell me what this means? Am I pregnant or sick? Can you help please. Many thanks","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, So long as you are taking Duphaston pills, you will not get menses as these are progesterone pills. If it is 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse after the injection of hCG; please get Beta hCG test done. Values above 25 mIU/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy. Your follicle size of 18 mm was an ideal size for healthy egg. So pregnancy possibility is very high. If the test indicates that you are pregnant, you may continue Duphaston further with the advice of your Gynaecologist. In non-pregnant state, the levels are under 5 mIU/ml.  If the levels indicate that you are not pregnant, you may discontinue Duphaston and you will get withdrawal bleeding within 4-7 days. Do not go on the symptoms like dry mouth.

Any fresh or stale (brown) bleeding during pregnancy indicates risk to the pregnancy. Brown bleeding during pregnancy, in fact, indicates that the baby may not be viable. Your history does not suggest that you are pregnant. The brown discharge you had was after the menses. This was the left out blood in the uterine cavity subsequently coming out.

Your weight should be Height in cms -100 ( eg 160 cms-100 = weight 60 kgs normal) Try Low calory diet & regular exercise. No fasting please.Check your Throid status / Blood sugars / serum prolactinAll these are altered in PCOD. If periods are not corrected even after proper weight reduction , you can go ahead with Ovulation induction pills with / without injections of hormones.Waiting for natural ovulation now may not be successful. IUI will be needed only if your husband has some problem.All the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"hi, can you help me? i had my period last month twice but i have regular menstruation ever since.

As you have been getting regular periods it means your ovulation is regular, your age is right time for healthy pregnancy.Accidents do occur, Blighted ovum was such an accident. But they need not repeat.Keep trying for 1yr, but if very anxious . Kindly get investigated for Blood Sugars , Thyroid profile & Serum Prolactin. Husband for blood sugar & semen analysis. Diabetes can affect sperm's & egg's health.Since you had a pregnancy( even though it was not healthy) your chance for  next pregnancy is very highAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"Dear doctor , I am planning to do Ivf .

Usually doctor has an IVF batch that day, 17th. That period was a withdrawal blled after hormone pills.IVF medicines are started on day 2 or max day 3 of the cycle/bleeding. If started later follicular response will not be seen.You should meet doctor & ask for cycle management. There are lots of pills with the same action as Aminor, maybe your body is not comfortable with this medicine.If not late you can be adjusted to this or next cycle.All the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"I am a DVT Patient from past 3 years.

This will only improve the blood supply to baby.This medicine will not affect the baby as it does not cross the placenta .Mostly when you started Heparin last time , blood flow to baby was already affected & you might have had high Blood pressure , Baby had low birth weight & low water level around it, Maybe premature also ( Cesarean ?). Anyway before you attempt for next pregnancy meet a High risk Obstetrics Specialist, get completely investigated. Many causes are diagnosed before pregnancy only.   Oral medicine is available for DVT when you are not pregnant.

In this scenario, the possible causes are a delayed return to ovulation, other hormone insufficiencies, tubal factors, infections and the male factor.

If you have always had regular menstrual cycles, the cause of this delay should be explored. Since you have had a consultation, please ask your doctor about the findings. To exclude/confirm pregnancy, you have to go for the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titers along with a trans-vaginal sonogram. This clarifies the situation.

If the blood, urine, hormone levels, tubal patency tests and sonogram of the pelvis are normal, you can wait for 6 months to one year.

The other cardinal symptoms are  Nausea & vomiting with pica, frequent urination and Breast symptoms; of which you have nausea and vomiting but the rest two are missing. Of course, they appear about 10 days after the missed period. Anyway, cramps in the abdomen is not a classic symptom of pregnancy. Since, even 8 days after the missed period your pregnancy tests are negative twice, you are not pregnant. Still if you want to endorse the diagnosis by some other test, you may opt for Beta hCG test on your blood. The cramps you are having in lower abdomen are more indicative of impending menses. If you do not start menses within next 4 days, you may take some Progestational preparation for 5 days with the advice of your Gynaecologist. Then within 4-7 days you will get withdrawal bleeding.

It is characterised by delayed heavy menses, high insulin levels and high androgen levels. Symptoms of PCOS include irregular heavy menses, infertility, obesity, hair on the unwanted parts of the body like face, chest, abdomen, legs, etc., hoarseness of voice, etc. All the symptoms may not appear from the beginning. In PCOS, the eggs get entangled in the ovaries and are not released; hence infertility. To achieve pregnancy in PCOS, ovulation induction treatment has to be instituted. Initially, clomiphene citrate may be tried; however for not more that 6 cycles. If these pills fail to give you conception, hCG/HMG combination may have to be tried. Along with this treatment, if treatment for reducing the raised levels of Insulin and androgens is taken, the results are better. Metformin like medicines do help reducing insulin levels by increasing the tissue sensitivity to insulin. Myo inositol helps reducing insulin as well as androgen levels. Please calculate your BMI. BMI should be maintained between 18 and 23.9. If you are overweight or obese, please consult your dietitian to reduce the weight.     I have given you preliminary guidelines; for detailed consultation, you may ask me Direct question on this forum. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Was wondering what the chance of getting pregnant was if I was on the last day of my period and had intercourse but the condom slipped of after ejaculation but was on the outside of my vagina there was some leakage , I am really worried bc I am not on birth control","Doctor":"If it was on last day of periods very less chances of getting pregnant.

My last period was from July 12th-16th 2012. I was sexually active three times following that period. I was two days late on my next period, projected date august 2nd, when I had unprotected sex, august 4th. I then took the morning after pill within approximately 12 hours. It has been two days since then, approximately 5 days late on period and two days of morning after pill with no spotting or bleeding. When can I take a pregnancy test and how accurate will it be?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, You have multiple issues for discussion. Let me solve them one by one. 1. Pregnancy test on urine is reliable after a week of the missed period; earlier, it may report false negative results. Alternatively, you may opt for Blood test for Beta hCG 10 days after the last unprotected sexual relations. 2. Morning after contraceptive pill is very effective when taken within 72 hours of the unprotected sex; you have taken it within 12 hours. So you are protected against the pregnancy due to that intercourse. 3. These pills have some after effects:a. Few days after the pills, some vaginal bleeding occurs which is mistaken as menses. It is normal and does not need any medical attention. b. The period following the morning after pill may get delayed by few days to about a week's period. Wait for a week after missed period before you take any action. If the pregnancy tests reveal that you are not pregnant and still if you do not get period even a week after the missed period, please report to your Gynaecologist.

If you have been diagnosed with TB in lungs, damage to uterus is not very significant. But can't always predict. Extrapulmonary TB - can damage Uterus. Your reduced flow may be due to the stress of heavy infection & may be normal once cleared. TB in uterus usually affects inner lining, reducing the thickness, blood supply.

Results may also be more accurate if you do the test first thing in the morning, when your urine is more concentrated.Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"i m 36 years old i have two kids small kids age 7 years.i m trying to concieve . my doctor adviced me lezra 2.5 mg.how much chance concieve to use lezra tablet.aplz also tell side effect of lezra.thanks plz reply today because today is my 3rd day of my periods.","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome.Lezra is an aromatase inhibitor oral drug which is used effectively in the fertility treatment for women with ovulation problems, or for those with unexplained infertility.

The level more than 6 is higher for your age group. You are hypothyroidic. You should take some Levothyroxin preparation with the help of your Gynaecologist.

Moreover, you have taken Unwanted 72 pill within 8 hours of the sexual intercourse. These pills are effective emergency contraceptive pills if taken within 72 hours of the unprotected sex. So the possibilities of pregnancy seem to be very meagre. These post coital emergency contraceptive pills have some after effects:1. Some amount of vaginal bleeding is noticed few days after consumption of these pills. It lasts just  for a couple of days and does not require any medical attention. 2. The period following the pills is delayed by few days to a week or so. Therefore your periods are delayed. Wait patiently for the periods to appear. If even after a week of the missed period you do not get menses, then perform pregnancy test on the overnight early morning first urine sample; earlier the test may report false negative results. I hope this resolves your dilemma. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been off the depo shot for 1 month now and have been trying to get pregnant.I have not had a period yet and am now this past month I cry about anything and have acid reflex and heartburn all the time. I just took a pregnancy test at the doctors and it was neg. Should I go back  and get blood drawn?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Pregnancy test on the urine before you missed your period is rather too early and is sure to report (false) negative results. This test should be performed about a week after missed period to have reliable results. In fact, it is advisable to let a period of about 3 to 6 months pass after discontinuing Depo contraceptive to attempt for pregnancy. It may take some time for your menses to get regularised. You may take some proton pump inhibitor preparation like pantoprazole for your acid reflux and heartburn. It will give you some relief. For your over reactions to the adverse things, please report to a counsellor. Too much of stress also is responsible for delay in menses. If at all you want the results of urine pregnancy test to be confirmed, you may opt for Beta hCG test on your blood 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse.

My husband n I want a child now will I be able to conceive after leaving novex? Plz help","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Novex DS Tablet contains Ormeloxifene as an active ingredient. It has got contraceptive effect; hence while you are on these pills, you cannot conceive. You do have a chance of conceiving after discontinuing these pills. Fibroid may not interfere in conceiving; however, the fibroid may cause complications of pregnancy or delivery. You may have to face miscarriage, premature delivery, etc. During pregnancy, the fibroid always increases in size and may have bleeding in it. After delivery, since the uterus cannot contract effectively, you may have to face excessive bleeding. Of course the size of the fibroid is not very big. So you may take a chance of pregnancy without removing fibroid. Left ovarian cyst needs to be evaluated. If it is corpus luteum cyst, it should not cause any problem. Ultrasonography ovulation monitoring will give some clue. If you are ovulating then you may go for pregnancy. However, if you are not ovulating, ovulation induction may be required.

You can do follicle study from day 10 of the cycle to know about day of egg formation. Please try to have sex act on and around the day of ovulation. Having these things in place, you have fair chance to get pregnant.  Please start on Folic acid, Vitamin B 12 and Omega 3 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant.  This helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy and delivery. I hope this answer helps you.

If you had the induced medical abortion under the surveillance of a specialist and had a follow-up sonogram to exclude residual products, this spotting is not related. It is possible that you may have conceived again without having a period after the abortion.

Or could I have ovulated recently and my progesterone not gone up yet? Thanks! Jenny","Doctor":"Hi Jenny, Progesterone is a retrospective method to assess normal ovulation. Trying for pregnancy just with this is not very effective. What's the use of just having some follicle ruptured, if it's not healthy !Important Q are:1. Your age - more than 35 years reduces good follicle count2. Weight - Obesity could be reason for ovulation3. An Polycystic Ovaries4. Any Hormonal imbalance - Thyroid / Prolactin5. Have you ruled out Pelvic Infection / Pelvic adhesions  / Endometriosis6. Have the tubal Patency been confirmedAll these could be reasons for unruptured follicles.

At ovulation mature ovum is ready for the unions and broken condom allows sperm entry in vagina and uterine cavity to meet the ovum. So yes, you do have possibility of  conception.

I ve been taking pregnancy tests everyday(since i m anxious) and they are all negative. Is there still a chance I m pregnant? Could the cramps today be implantation? This is my first time for this so I don t know what to think or do. Please help :(","Doctor":"Hi,I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1) First of all do not panic. 2) As per your history, you had IUI on 6th of May, if ovulation day was the same then I will suggest you to wait till 20th of May. Please do not perform urine pregnancy test at least till 24th of May.  It will be non conclusive before that date.3) Secondly, cramping pain within 48  hours after iui can be related to the procedure. Later on, it can be due to some kind of digestive system issue like indigestion or gaseous distension. Please seek prescription support from your treating doctor for getting anti emetics and anti spasmodic medicines. 4 ) I usually suggest to my patients to opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Start with Folic acid, Vitamin B 12 and Omega 3 supplements at least 3 months before  planning to get pregnant. This helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy and delivery.

If sonography reports show rupture of follicle and egg release then egg is available for next 24 to 36 hours. Chances of getting pregnant are high in this period if you have sex activity or IUI in this period. Usually, progesterone hormone is prescribed as support for the expected pregnancy for 10 to 15 days after your ovulation. Your doctor must have given you tablets Meprate for the same. Meprate does not help to get pregnant. It might be givento you to support the pregnancy or if there is no confirmed ovulation then to get withdrawal bleeding.

It help in implantation and pregnancy.Glycomet: again induce ovulation and decrease insulin resistance. You should take above medicine under advise of gynecologist and monitored by USG scan and ovarian follicle study. If drugs will not responds in next 4-6 months the you should ask for HCG and FSH shot, ovarian drilling. Ovacare also help to become pregnant. Last option is IVF.

I take my bbt every morning and I haven t seen a spike in temp. I did see a slight spike on CD 20. Is it possible that I can conceive on day 20 or will my follicles be too largaye?","Doctor":"Hi,The bbt test is not a very sensitive test to find out the ovulation. If the follicle was 18 mm it would have ruptured the day after or may be 1 day after. So even if you have tried on the same day or any of the days after scanning, you may conceive, because sperms can fertilise the egg within 72 hours and a egg is viable for 24 hours.Day 20 will be too late.

My straight forward answer is YES, BUT CHANCES ARE LESS WITH THIS. Because if prolactin and thyroid hormone are high, they will cause irregular menses and patient having difficulty to get pregnant. So it is very important to start treatment, so the hormones come to within normal range. Once they come to normal range, the menses will be regular. With regular menses there will high chances of getting pregnant. Secondly let us discuss about the medicine you have taken, as prescribed by your treating doctor. You told that you are taking meperate. This drug is usually given for withdrawal bleeding (bleeding which occurs after delayed menses). This is usually given for 5 days, and withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within 10-15 days of stopping the drug. So DON'T WORRY, you are on right medication.

I ve been off birth control since October my husband and I were trying at first but nothing ever happened. Recently this is the first time I ve missed 2 periods in a row ever no nausea or cravings but my nipples are constantly hurting and sensitive, white spots have appeared around my areola and discharge has been appearing only when squeezed from my right nipple. I have taken many urine tests and a blood test about two weeks ago and all said negative. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi,I guess your concern is about reasons for not getting pregnant, right. Firstly I want to tell you that there many reasons or factors which are responsible for not getting pregnancy. These factors can be present in wife or in husband or in both.In most few cases reasons are unknown.in case of female most common reason is ovarian factors like- irregular menses, cystic ovaries etc.tubal factors like blockage of one or both fallopian tubes, uterine factors like fibroid etc. Sometimes there is a hormonal causes like abnormal thyroid hormones, excessive secretion of prolactin hormone etc In case of male most common factor is abnormality in sperm or sperm production etc.Secondly let us discuss about your problem:- as you told that I missed your period for 2 month but pregnancy test was negative and you are having pain, white spot around nipple and on squeezing there is discharge from nipple,right.This problems mostly occurs in case of high prolactin level in the body. It is milk producing hormone which is secreted from pituitary gland. When it's level is high in body, it causes irregular menses and milky discharge from the nipple etc. But you have not given information regarding your menses whether it is regular earlier or irregular from the starting and also you have not told about the character of the nipple discharge. So it is difficult for me to comment on this. With above discussion you can try out my suggestions-1. As you told that you are taking birth control pills. This pills are given for regularization of menses. Once your menses will regular, there is high chances of getting pregnant. So DON'T WORRY.2. Try to do coitus in fertile period (it starts from 10th-16th day of menses) during this period chances of getting pregnant is high). So do coitus as more as possible.3.

He had some pre cum that I touched and Im not sure how long afterwards but then I rubbed my clit with the same hand. But I know for a fact that my hand was dry. Later he took over so he could go ahead and cum. Right when he was about to I put my mouth on his penis and all of the cum went there. He then tried to rub my clit again but I wasnt sure if cum got on it so I rubbed all on his fingers and sure enough they were dry. So I let him rub my clit some more.  Im worried if I could get pregnant.  I wasnt ovulating and im a virgin. Also he peed before the session so most likely any sperm in the urethra was removed then. When I got home I wiped my self down there to make sure I was dry and I changed panties.  My period doesnt come for a few weeks.  I think im overreacting but I just want to be sure.","Doctor":"Hi,I guess your concern is about will you get pregnant from a pre cum on cli. So my straight forward answer is NO. There is no chance of getting pregnant. For getting pregnant there should be penis inside the vagina and should ejaculate inside the vagina around the time of ovulation (14th day of menses cycle) or in the fertile period (it is from 1016th-16th day of menses), during this period chances of getting pregnant is high. As you told that you are not ovulate and the penis of BF is not inside your vagina. So there is no chance of getting pregnant.With above information u can try out my suggestions:- If you are still worried then do pregnancy test by urinary pregnancy kit, it is easily available in your nearby medical store.

Please type your query here...           hello doctor..... i m 35 years woman having lobular panniculitis and being get treated with methtrexate......is it ok if i plan for a baby after stoping methotrexate for 3 months??? will my disease affect my baby???","Doctor":"Hi,Yes, you can plan for a baby 3 months after stopping Methotrexate. As per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Methotrexate is a category X pregnancy drug which means it can cause teratogenic effects, abortion, and fetal defects in humans. It has also been reported to cause impairment of fertility and menstrual dysfunction in humans, during and for a short period after cessation of therapy.Hence it should never be used in pregnancy. Pregnancy should be avoided for a minimum of 3 months after stopping the treatment or for at least 1 ovulatory cycle after therapy is completed.In view of the above you can plan for a baby 3 months after stopping Methotrexate. Pregnancy can increase the symptoms of lobular panniculitis. This may be due to the extra weight the mother is carrying and the pressure it puts on her joints. Because of these increased symptoms, you may need alternate effective but safer medications during pregnancy like Hydroxychloroquine or Sulfasalazine for the treatment. However, in some cases, the symptoms of lobular panniculitis actually improve during pregnancy. As a result, you may need less medication, or even no medication, while pregnant. However, the symptoms typically return after delivery.Hope these answer your queries. Let me know if I can assist you further. Wishing you a very good health.

So, you have to take antispasmodic tablets or injection for pain relief. You can have that tablet every time in your menses. Secondly, if you both are HIV positive that doesn't mean you cannot conceive. Yes it is true that there is a chance of transfer to the baby. And also it is a high risk pregnancy. You just have to continue your treatment medicines and continue pregnancy also. For detail you have to consult a nearby gynecologist and may be pediatrician for chances of pregnancy, chances of transfer to baby, and other pros and cons of that. Now for your pain, Dicyclomine like Antispasmodic will do. And if it remains for long time and you don't want pregnancy at all than cervical dilatation is one option after which your pain will be very less and bearable. It is a minor operation you can ask your doctor about it. And if you are planning for pregnancy then one pregnancy happens and the problem is gone so no pain. Once delivery or abortion takes place the source of pain is also gone due to natural cervical dilatation.Hope I have answered your query.

Your treating doctor gave you a drug (clom), for ovulation induction (that means drugs which accelerates follicle growth), following that follicular study usually done from the 10th to 16th day of cycle with the help of scan (ultrasound) to monitor the growth of the follicles.Once the follicles reached the size of 16-20'm then we advised to do coitus as more as possible, because at that size follicles usually ruptures and releases the ovum. At that time sperm fertilizes the coin, chances of getting pregnancy is high. So DON'T WORRY. RELAX. There is time to your follicles to reach that size. So there is chance of getting pregnancy also. With the above information you can try out my suggestions:1. Try to do coitus as more as possible once your follicles reach the 16-20 mm size. So there is more chances that the sperm can fertilizes the ovum and chances of getting pregnancy is high.2. RELAX. KEEP PATIENCE. There is chances in present cycle.3.

Your symptoms could be due to hormonal imbalance as depo shot has been off. To confirm pregnancy, I would suggest to go for blood HCG test, 10 days after sex. Blood HCG test is more accurate test and detect pregnancy earlier compared to urine pregnancy test. Avoid stress, take healthy diet, drink plenty of water, do regular exercise and maintain proper pelvic hygiene.Hope this may help you.

Endometrial thickness is sufficient to get conceive. I would suggest to go for ovarian follicle study again at 14th day. Follicle size between 18-21 mm release quality and high chance of pregnancy. So if ovarian follicle will not mature and rupture then drugs like clomifene citrate, and HCG injection will be useful. You can also take Metformin, Ovacare to become pregnant after complete evaluation. So your endometrial thickness is sufficient but ovarian follicle is not sufficient to get rupture. Avoid stress, take healthy diet, drink plenty of water, maintain proper pelvic hygiene.Hope this may help you.

The emergency contraceptive pill like Positnor is up to 94% effective in preventing an unwanted pregnancy if it is taken within 72 hours following an unprotected sex. Its efficacy would be more if taken as early as possible following an unprotected sex.Pregnancy tests are done to tell if your urine or blood contains a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone is produced right after a fertilized egg attaches to the wall of a woman's uterus. Blood tests are more sensitive than urine tests and may detect pregnancy from about 6 to 8 days after ovulation. The home pregnancy test using an early morning urine sample can be undertaken about a week after missing a period.Hope these answer your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

You have to maintain patience and continue treatment from a reliable doctor in a step by step manner. And once pregnancy happens, everything will be cure. Pregnancy itself is the only cure for endometriosis. In between you have to take treatment for ovulation and then try for pregnancy by simple contact or by IUI. Depend on husband semen report. There is no shortcut in it. Other thing you can do is if weight is more than try to reduce it somewhat which will help in ovulation treatment. Take regular treatment.

The fact that you have been labelled as a case of unexplained infertility suggests that your all other factors like tubal patency, semen quality and quantity are normal. If Clomiphene citrate for 6 cycles have failed to achieve success in effecting the conception, you should not give any more trial to this medicine; instead you may try hCG/HMG combination. Even these medicines also fail to offer you pregnancy, you will have to opt for some Artificial Reproductory Technique (ART); of which, you have already tried IUI. Development of 7 follicles should not be a concern. The follicle which releases the egg should be between 18 mm and 21 mm in size to release healthiest egg. During  ART, well developed eggs only will be collected. LH surge on day 12 is a good sign. This is an indication that you may produce egg. I hope this offers you valid options.

If pregnancy will not occur then following drugs will be useful. Metformin: to induce ovulation and decrease insulin resistance. Clomifene citrate: if there is problem in maturation of follicle.

You have to judge where wife stands, where? I would like to focus on the medical term- FERTILE PERIOD. It is from 10th-16th day of menses cycle where chances of becoming pregnant are very very high. Here sperm FERTILIZES ovum and women become pregnant, thats why its called fertile period. Well, with above discussion you can try out my suggestions:1. Have patience,  things will settle down slowly.2. I insist you and your wife to do sex in fertile period (mechanism I have told above). Do this for next 6-8 months. You will get results by this time.3. If you are in a hurry or you want to really know is that your kid operation is hindering you from becoming father, you can visit your nearby gynecologist or infertility specialist for sorting of things.Hope I have answered your query.

Since last Saturday I have had nausea and chills in varying levels.

It is mostly due to hormonal imbalance and the treatment depends on the type of imbalance. It could be due to ovarian/thyroid problem/pituitary gland abnormality. USG or hormonal assay helps in understanding.Some times ovulation stimulation can be done and conception can be planned or test tube baby can be tried. Still in those cases knowledge of basic problem helps in pregnancy care and normality. In case there is no abnormality noted, the menstrual regularity can be attained by 3 cyclical courses of hormonal treatment. Here ovulation is judged by LH surge test followed by unprotected sex from the day of positive test for 5 days at a stretch.You should consult a gynecologist for all needful advice, investigations, and management.Please don't worry.

Firstly I want to tell you that your  main problem is irregular menses, and because of this you are not getting pregnant yet. But RELAX, ITS NOT A BIG DEAL, its a treatable thing. It is most common thing in reproductive age womens (reproductive age women are 15-45 yrs in which chances of getting pregnant is high). But you did not give information about your age. So I don't give any comment on this. You told that your  gynecologist treated you with medicines ( ocps, metformin, norprolac). These medicines are given to the patients who are having PCOS.

In order to get pregnant you would need to ovulate or release an egg. I suggest to my patients to continue taking their birth control pills and to use condoms for the next 2 weeks. After the 2 weeks, take a pregnancy test. If it is negative, you can stop using condoms but continue the birth control pills.

No meaning of doing pregnancy tests 6 days before period, it will come negative.You can go for blood HCG test 10 days after sex to confirm pregnancy.

It can be done after or during the rupture of follicle. Let us discuss about the procedure of IUI. In this method the qualified sperm of husband is inserted inside the womb of the wife around the time of ovulation. Ovulation is time during which dominant follicle (size 18-20mm) is rupture, during this time more chances of getting pregnant if IUI is done.

It is an empirical medicine and is believed to dissolve the adhesions. However, I have got a doubt how much it will help you in getting the blocked tubes reopened. There is no harm in trying Inj. Placentrex. Tubal recanalization is not an emergency surgery. If the tubes still remain blocked (which is most likely possibility), you will have to undergo tubal recanalization - by Laparoscopy or by Laparotomy.The success rate of tubal recanalization in terms of pregnancy is somewhere around 60% with Laparoscopy having a better success rate.

Should I be using other contraception. Worried that I am taking ovulation tests at the same time and have just picked up an lh surge?","Doctor":"Hi,History of total absence of menstruation followed by surgical (mostly Dilatation and Evacuation and Curettage) termination of blighted ovum pregnancy is suggestive of adhesions formation in the uterine cavity due to trauma to the uterine lining and the musculature. This entity is known as Aschermann Syndrome. This could be the cause of failure of conception. Hysterosalpingography / Hysteroscopy can diagnose this condition. If Aschermann syndrome is present, the adhesions can be severed delicately during hysteroscopy. Putting some intrauterine device and continuous high Oestrogen treatment may help regeneration of the uterine lining (endometrium). Norethisterone will not help the regeneration of endometrium; it will just be an attempt to have withdrawal bleeding. You need not go for ovulation tests at this stage. Please get the cause for loss of menses diagnosed and treated. Once you start menstruating regularly and normally, you may consider the ovulation monitoring.

The period following the consumption of the pills may get delayed by few days to a week or so. So you may be prepared for it and do not get stress of such delay. I hope this resolves your query.

Took first dose last June 7, 1030PM and the second dose June 9, 1030AM. I vomited once and had white discharge but as of today no bleeding yet but am having abdominal cramps. What are the chances of me getting pregnant? thanks.","Doctor":"Hi,You took Nordette as ECP 52 hours after sex. 2nd dose should be taken after 12 hours but you took after 2 days. Since you did not take Nordette pill in correct way, so there is some chance of pregnancy. White discharge could be due to vaginal infection, side effect of pill.If it is foul smell then it suggest vaginal infection. Vaginal swab tests by consulting gynecologist will help in diagnosis. Abdominal cramp could be due to premenstrual symptoms. I would suggest to wait for period to come. If period will delay by more than 7 days then go for urine pregnancy tests and or blood HCG test to confirm pregnancy.

If you happen to get pregnant, you will miss out your periods. If there is no pregnancy, you will get your periods 14 days after the ovulation day. I wish you all the best.

Because my boyfriend inserted his own is in my vagina just once on the 20 th and it is not the 26 so I was just wondering and I took the Next choice pill within two hours of this incident","Doctor":"Hi,Next Choice pill is a post coital emergency contraceptive pill which can prevent the pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of the unprotected sexual intercourse. However, it does not prevent the pregnancy from the intercourse performed after taking the pill. From your query, it is not clear exactly when did you consume the Next Choice pill. You had intercourse on 20th. If you have taken the pill within 72 hours; i.e. before 23rd, you are protected from pregnancy due to this intercourse. You need not repeat the pill again after a week. However, if you were late in taking the pill, repeating it after a week is not going to help you. In that case, you do stand the risk of pregnancy. If you have taken pill 2 hours after the sexual intercourse on 26th, you are protected from the pregnancy due to this intercourse; however, you stand the possibility of pregnancy from the intercourse on 20th. These pills do delay the period by few days to a week or so. Therefore, if your periods are delayed, perform pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample after one week of missed period; earlier the test may report false negative. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test.I hope this helps you. Let me know if I can assist you further.

My straight forward answer is YES, you will get pregnant. I want to tell  you that your ultrasound findings of uterus and ovary as your report shows indicate that you are having infection in your uterus and ovary most probably. But DON'T WORRY. It is having a solution. You come under the reproductive age group ( age group 15-45 comes under this group, in that age group chances of getting pregnant is high), If you are having regular period also then you have DOUBLE CHANCES of getting pregnant.

I can justify for this 50%. If menses are regular then no need to be on birth control. If menses are not regular then it is really necessary to put on birth control. IUI is done around the ovulation ( ovulation means the period during which dominant follicle is rupture and ovum is released). Sperm in IUI needs to fertilize this ovum to getting pregnant.

Due to the ectopic pregnancy I lost my right tube and my doc performed the myomectomy the same day. Please advise my chances of falling pregnant again as it was our first baby.","Doctor":"Hi,I guess your concern is about chances of getting pregnant with one fallopian tube and after myomectomy. Firstly let us discuss about the ectopic pregnancy, it is a type of pregnancy in which pregnancy occurs other than the womb, mostly in fallopian tubes. If it ruptures, it requires removal of that site of fallopian tube, and this same thing happened with you. But you have the one healthy fallopian tube so relax. You are having high chances of getting pregnant. You also come under the age group in which there is maximum chances of getting pregnant. So you have double chances of getting pregnant. Secondly I want to tell you that you have already undergone myomectomy for fibroid as told by you on same day. Usually pt having fibroid, facing difficulty in getting pregnant. So there is TRIPLE MORE CHANCES of getting pregnant because you already had myomectomy. You can follow my suggestions:1. RELAX, DON'T WORRY. there is triple chances of getting pregnant. just keep patience.2. If you are in hurry then revisit your treating doctor, he/ she can help you.i hope this information is useful, informative and helpful for you.

You can go for IUI. that means the semen of your husband will be processed and it will have much better motility and then it will be instilled into your uterus on day of ovulation. This may work for you.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Khushboo Priya"},{"Patient":"Hello.  I have a concern.  I am 22 years old.  When I was 12, I had a surgery to create an opening in my vagina in order to my menstrual blood to finally be released.  Any who, I am a virgin still.  Recently, my boyfriend and I got too physical.  My boyfriend started “humping” me.  I was wearing thin lace underwear but he was naked.  Then he pointed out that my underwear was wet.  He was claiming that I was me who was wet (I was not having an orgasm, I guess I was still in the process of reaching that point).  I was saying that he had gotten my underwear wet…bottom line, we didn’t know who’s discharge it was.  I was pretty sure there was no penetration (since I was wearing underwear of course).  But since my underwear was wet (whether the discharge was from me or my boyfriend), is there a possibility that I can get pregnant?  Is that surgery that I had back when I was 12 increase my chances of getting pregnant due to surgical opening?Another question?  Because I had that surgery, does it mean that when I lose my virginity, it wont hurt as much?  Can someone tell me what kind of condition I had?  And what anatomical part it is that was actually surgically opened to release menstrual blood?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.At that time if they did not suture back your hymen then you already lost your virginity. It is just a thin layer of tissue called hymen which determines virginity. They at that time probably would have kept an incision over your hymen so that you can get periods. Now, if you are concerned about pregnancy then sperm travels in liquid media and it cannot travel through clothes.Only, if semen went inside your vagina then only it is possible.Hope I have answered your query.

You can stop taking this tablet. Just folic acid tablet will be sufficient. For the itching, It may be because of some infection.  So please consult a doctor for that. May be you will need some antibiotics.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I was just rubbing my penis against her outer vagina but I didn t have a condom on. Could she get pregnant with pre ejaculation being around her vagina, but not fully inside of it?","Doctor":"Hi,I guess your concern is about getting pregnant of your girlfriend from pre-ejaculatory liquid near vagina. So my straight forward answer is, YES. There is chances but its VERY VERY LESS to getting her pregnant. Usually chances of getting pregnant is more when ejaculation occurs when penis is inside the vagina. But in your case as you told that your penis did not go inside the vagina and you were just rubbing it against her outer vagina. So there is very very less chance of getting pregnant. So DONT WORRY, RELAX. You also told that u didn't have condom on that time. And there is pre-ejaculation occurs around her vagina. So there is little bit chances having for getting pregnant. For that you do not need to take tension because your girlfriend can use emergency contraceptive pill (i-pill) within 72 hrs of unprotected intercourse. As told by you that you people had intercourse 2 days ago. So there is sufficient time to take emergency contraception. This is usually available your nearby medical store at affordable prices. With this above discussion you can try out my suggestions-1. Don't waste time and get the i-pill as early as possible. Ask your girlfriend to take it. Wait till her next menses. If she gets menses on her expected or delay date, she will not be pregnant. 2. You can do urinary pregnancy test after 5-6 days of her missed period. It is available at affordable prices your nearby medical store. Buy it and ask your girlfriend to do it by herself. if it is negative, she's not pregnant. if it is positive visit to nearby gynecologist for further help.Hope I have answered your query.

The blood test resulted all normal for me and for my husband, it is Hepatitis - B positive. Will this is the cause for not getting conceived (Wife being HBV - negative and Husband being HBV - positive) ? What is the solution if we want to conceive?","Doctor":"Hi, Hepatitis B positivity doesn't have any effect on conceiving. What you can do is to go for a IUI with washed sperms because chances of transmission of hepatitis B is high by normal intercourse. Also get yourself evaluated at intervals for hepatitis B. You can try ovulation induction in which you will receive medicines for growth of your eggs and when egg matures, injection will be given for rupture and IUI will be done that means after processing semen of your husband it will be directly put into your uterus.Hope I have answered your query.

If after 5 years also there is any problem in conception, you need to undergo various investigations to assess various factors which are essential for conception. They are: 1. Ensure that you are releasing the eggs (ovulation) regularly. This can be done by ultrasonography ovulation monitoring. Once you understand about the day of the ovulation, you can plan your sexual relations on and around that day. Ovulation monitoring home kit also is available for the purpose. Monitoring the hormonal levels and studying the uterine lining also can provide this information. 2. Assessing the patency of the tubes and normalcy of the uterine cavity and the surrounding tissues. Hysterosalpingography, Laparoscopy and Hysteroscopy can provide this information. 3. Semen examination to assess the quality and quantity of the sperms. Please report to your Gynaecologist or Infertility Consultant if inspite of all the normal reports, you fail to conceive within six months of fair trial. Hope I have provided you preliminary guidelines to proceed. For more detailed information, you may ask me direct question on this forum. Regards,Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi, my wife is 6 dpo she is experiencing gas and bloated feeling, tired a lot and she is having digestive issues ie. after she eats she feels like the food is laying on her stomach for a longtime and its uncomfortable nothing seems to help it. she is having excessive amounts of creamy white CM which is not the norm for her at this stage in her cycle she is most often 21-23 days..she feels flush and sometimes her bp is higher than normal her MAP is hovering around 100 which is high for her and im worried.

The digestive problems and increased (clear) discharge can occur due to pregnancy. However, creamy white discharge per vaginum is suggestive of fungal infection. Please report to Gynaecologist for this. It can be cured by antifungal treatment. Varian in MAP is not suggestive of pregnancy. You should get the evidence of pregnancy for correct diagnosis by: 1.

She is on HRT and has stopped taking the pill. She is quite convinced that she cannot conceive naturally anymore and that we don t need contraception. I am not so sure. As our children are grown up and we don t need to start again what is the likelihood of a natural conception?","Doctor":"Hi,I guess you concern is about chances of getting pregnant at the age of 48 yrs, that is menopausal stage. Firstly I want to discuss about the menopause- it means permanent cessation of menstruation at the end of reproductive life ( reproductive life is between 15-45 yrs age group, during which maximum chances of getting pregnancy occurs). So once menses stopped, there is no chance of getting conceive naturally.That means after getting menopause there is  0% chances of getting conceive naturally. So DON'T WORRY,  RELAX. Secondly you told me that your partner is on HRT (hormone replacement therapy) and has stopped taking pills. After the menopause there is no need of contraceptive pills ( birth spacing pills). So RELAX. Your partner don't need the extra burden of this pills. But you have not told me that which medicines your partner took under HRT, so I cant comment on this. With the above information you can try out my suggestions:1. RELAX, DON'T WORRY, NO NEED TO TAKE TENSION. Your partner is on the safe side.2.  You told me that your partner is taking HRT. In my suggestion you can continue it but not for more than 3-5 yrs, because it may cause some harmful effects to your partner's body. For that I would like to suggest you to visit your treating doctor or nearby gynecologist for your HRT related pros and cons. Lastly again I want  to tell you that after menopause there is no chance of getting pregnant.

It was initially started for acne in my late twenties (when I first began to have breakouts) and I continued using it as a contraceptive. In 2010-11, my husband and I tried to conceive but was unsuccessful. I then resumed Ginette with frequent breaks ever since (usually resume when the acne starts again and it becomes unbearable). We both want to conceive dearly. My husband has just returned from a work related overseas trip and we began to discuss conception again. I have just stopped taking Ginette this morning (one week before my menstruation is due) and we have been having unprotected sex for approximately one week now.What are your recommendations for us? My husband is also 39 years old, 1.8 metres tall and weighs 79.9 kgs. We are both relatively healthy. My husband has mild eczema for which he takes Zyrtec from time to time. I exercise 5 days a week for approximately 50 minutes per day.I would really appreciate any advise that will assist us with conception and sustaining a healthy and safe pregnancy.Thank you.Antonia","Doctor":"Hi,Once you discontinue taking oral contraceptive pills, or even if you are irregular in taking these pills, there is always a possibility of pregnancy due of unprotected sexual intercourse if it is performed in the fertile window. Egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. It has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 3 days.Hence, a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is considered as a fertile window. This calculation is useful if you have regular menstrual cycles. Better way would be to submit yourself for ovulation monitoring by ultrasonography which will give you direct visual evidence of imminent ovulation. Planning the sexual relations on and around the day of ovulation definitely will increase the possibilities of pregnancy. Your husband's eczema and its treatment should not come in way of conception.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I am 6 days late with my period and I've got funny sensation in my stomach and noticed white discharge on my undies. Is there a Chance that am pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi,I guess what your concern is:- Your boyfreind has put his finger in vagina, Can I get pregnant though the proper intercourse has not happened, right? You said your boyfriend has wiped his sperms spilled hand with towel. Well, you have not shared the information, whether did he wash his hands with soap water, just water, or just wiped his hands? Lets assume, he has just wiped off with towel. Semen containing sperms is sticky in nature. Though he has wiped off with towel, some sort of quantity may be sticking on his hands. Imagine you have had a very oily stuff food and you try to wash your hand even with soap water but you still feel oily,right?? I hope you got the picture dear. So sperms may be present because of sticky nature of semen and he might have put it into your vagina causing pregnancy although there is very very remote chances. Still, medical world is full of miracles, I cannot say you are 100% safe from pregnancy and you say you are waiting for your menses. That adds to our confusion. The funny sensation in your stomach-its just psychological, and before this sensation you had unprotected sex so your mind is hitting on it. You are young, accidentally had unprotected sex, and so you are getting worried about pregnancy positive. Its natural. Every women goes through this stage.i can understand your situation. Well you can try out my suggestions:1. Have patience and wait for your menses. Sometimes menses get altered because of stressful life style.2. Get urinary pregnancy test done to confirm pregnancy. Many urine pregnancy test kit are available at medical stores at affordable prices. Buy it, and do it yourself. If negative, you are on safe side.2. If positive, visit your nearby gynecologist for further treatment.3. If negative, still not getting menses. Even then, I suggest you to visit nearby gynecologist to not only rule out pregnancy but also to verify if there are any reasons that' s causing delay in your menses.I hope this information was useful, informative and helpful.

I am now remarried. When the doctor tied my tubes he said it took over an hour because he had problems finding my tubes. What are my chances of getting pregnant now?","Doctor":"Hi,Well, I guess your concern is:- what are the chances of pregnancy after tubes tied...right?I understood your doubt. Firstly, I would like to tell, chances of pregnancy inspite of tubes tied depends on what type of surgery was done to tie the tubes. What type of surgery was done, you haven't shared with us. So difficult for me to comment on exact chances of getting pregnant. Secondly, be positive. There is no hard and fast rule that women cant become pregnant with tubes tied. Remarried recently, you are wanting for a baby, but tubes tied in the past has put you in tension. I can understand your psychology and your situation. Well, you can try out my suggestions;1. Along with records of what surgery was done to tie the tubes go to a nearby gynecologist to discuss the chances of getting pregnant.2. Let God forbid, if a permanent type of surgery is done to tie the tubes, then chances of pregnancy are less. But, here comes the advancement of technologies of 21st century to get pregnant - assisted reproductive technologies-IVF. You can discuss the pros and cons of assisted techniques with your nearby gynecologist or visit a nearby infertility specialist for the same.I hope this information was useful, informative and helpful.

My doc suggested for Ecosprin 75 & Folic acid when Ttc next. Please advice when can i try to conceive now & should i start taking Ecosprin 75'?","Doctor":"Hi,Usually after an abortion which is complete and curetting, the egg release (ovulation) starts after about 5 weeks. However, immediate pregnancy is not advised. Some fair time should be given for the reproductory organs to heal and attain their normalcy. Hence, I would advise you to give about 3 month's time for the reproductive organs to come back to their normal capacity. After 3 months of the abortion, you may attempt your next pregnancy. During this period of three months: 1. Start consuming daily Folic acid tablets which will facilitate healthy conception and implantation. 2. Try to get the cause of the missed abortion investigated. If any treatment is indicated, complete that treatment and then only attempt for the pregnancy. After you have conceived, reassess the situation and then take a decision of taking Ecosprin; take it only with your Obstetrician's help and not of your own. I hope this clarifies your doubts.

So after taking Siphene, there is maturation of ovarian follicle and rupture of follicle (ovulation). It should be monitored by USG scan/ovarian follicle study. But some time ovulation may occur but the ovum may not release. If the size is more than 2×2 cms, you should go for HCG injection with your doctor's advice to rupture follicle.

Treatment information given by you seems correct. Endometriosis is a health problem in which pt will have painful menses and difficultly in conceiving. The surgery and medicines (Zoladex, Prolifen as told by you) is usually given for endometriosis treatment. But, when the surgery was done and when the medicines were started, this information is not shared by you. The dosing of medicines is also not told by u.so i cant comment on the medicines. Dont worry, once the problem of endometriosis is solved you can conceive for next baby. My suggestions:1. Usually it takes some time for the medicines to have their effect. Sometimes the medicines start working early and sometimes it takes little extra time. 2. So have patience. Wait for few more days. if still their is no improvement in painful menses, revisiting your treating doctor. Your other concern is to conceive for next baby. Endometriosis is one of the cause of infertility (infertility in medical term means unable to conceive). So a patient on treatment for endometriosis is usually having difficulty in conceiving till successful treatment of the problem.My advice:1. Revisit your treating doctor, to discuss about conceiving for the next baby and presence of painful menses inspite of taking medicines.2. You may also consult a nearby infertility specialist.I hope the information is useful, informative and helpful.

I am terrified of being pregnant again or having a ectopic pregnancy. If someone could assist I would appreciate. I have reached out to my doctors office but haven t yet received a response back.","Doctor":"Hi,I guess your concern is missed menses thereby ectopic pregnancy. Sometimes there will be menses irregularity after tubal ligation. This happens because the blood supply to the ovaries will be altered due to tube ligation. So the ovaries which are getting altered blood supply do altered/ irregular menses. The normal pattern of menses will resume slowly. So, don't worry. But there are the chances of ectopic pregnancy after tubal ligation. However, the chances depends on the type of surgery done for tubal ligation. As the type of surgery is not known, I can't comment on the chances of getting pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy.My advice:1. Wait for 4 to 5 days for menses to happen, if u still don't get menses go for a urinary pregnancy test. If it is negative we can wait for 5 to 6 days, if still no menses you have to revisit your treating doctor.2. If the urinary pregnancy test is positive, immediately visit your treating doctor. Usually a scan (ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis) to cross check and confirm the ectopic pregnancy is done.

Usually a scan to assess follicular size is done from the 10th day of menstrual cycle. This scan is done consecutively for 4 to 5 days. It is difficult to comment on the follicular size based on 2 days scanning. So it is difficult for me to comment on your follicular size query. Still, 11.7 mm on two different scan days may tell inadequate follicular development. However, your follicle may increase in size in next few days and in the scan report it may show that your follicles are developing. So it is difficult to comment on this two scan findings. Your next concern about the injection. Usually the standard protocol is to give injection 16-20 mm sized follicle to rupture. Though, based on the treating doctor practical experience, he may decide the timing of injection.My advice:1. Get consecutive 4 to 5 days scan done to comment on the follicular development.2.

You have mentioned that you are taking medicine - M2 tone for regularization of menses. The dose, and since when you have started taking the medicine is not shared by you. After taking the medicines whether the menses have become regular or not, it is also not shared by you. It is nature's rule, as we get older the functions of our body will be decreased quantitatively and qualitatively. The ovaries also decrease in its function as women become old. The reproductive age group, that is maximum chances of conceiving is more usually at 20 to 40 years.  Around the age of 50 to 52 years, women stop her menses. This indicates she can't conceive anymore. The age 45-48 years is a transition zone from highly reproductive age group to the age group where menses stop. And here the chances of getting pregnant are not as high as reproductive age group and not low as 50- 52 yrs of age. But still there is a chances of getting pregnant in this transition age, and you are at 42, so there is a hope of getting pregnant. Be positive and don't lose hope.However, irregular menses at this age decreases the chances of pregnancy. But, as you are on medicine for irregular menses, once the menses becomes regular, the chances of getting pregnancy increases. So there is double positive hope for you. Some people though they are in reproductive age group, because of problem, either in husband and wife, chances of getting pregnancy decreases. You have told that 'MY AND MY HUSBAND REPORTS ARE FINE'. So there is triple positive hope. As you have lost your first child and you are at the transition zone, its better to go for a accelerated method of pregnancy.The accelerated methods are-IVF, GIFT, ZIFT, ICSI. The advantage of accelerated methods is getting twins of triplets is also there. My suggestions:1. Have patience. Wait till the menses becomes regular. Then pray to God for natural method of getting pregnant.2. At the age of 42,  transition zone I would recommend u for accelerated methods - assisted reproductive techniques (ART) - IVF, ZIFT, GIFT, ICSI  and to visit nearby infertility specialist to know pros n cons of each.

How will this drug help me in conception ?? Please answer my query as i am tensed alot. Thank u","Doctor":"Hi,Ecosprin will help to prevent miscarriage due to coagulation/vascular defect. Ecosprin prevents clotting of blood vessels and thus increases blood supply to the baby. It should be started as soon as the cardiac activity appears. I would suggest to go for APLA screening, PT, APTT and ICT Beta-2 microglobulin antibodies, thrombophilia profile to rule out any coagulation defect. So it should be taken under evaluation to maintain pregnancy in history of repeated miscarriage due to coagulation defect. So you can ask about coagulation defect. If above test will come normal then no need to take it. But it should be started once cardiac activity of baby appear in USG. This drugs will not help to conceive. I would suggest to consult (both partner) infertility specialist and undergo work up.For you: reproductive hormone analysis, USG scan, ovarian follicle study. For partner: semen analysis, testosterone. Specific treatment will depend on cause: Drugs like clomiphene, progesterone, HCG injection will help you to become pregnant.Avoid stress, take healthy diet, drink plenty of water, do regular exercise.

In fact pregnancy is possible only after rupture of the follicle. Now let me explain you this.A follicle ruptures to release egg. Usually the eggs released from the follicles of size between 18 mm and 21 mm are the healthiest eggs having maximum possibility of successful pregnancy. An egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 3 days. Hence, sexual intercourse even 3 days before the rupture of a follicle (or release of an egg) can cause pregnancy. Since the egg has a life of 24 hours, sexual intercourse within 24 hours of the rupture of follicle can result into pregnancy. I am sure that now you are convinced that unless the follicle is ruptured, egg cannot be released and thus pregnancy is not possible. The pregnancy is possible only after rupture of a follicle. From your history, it appears that you had sexual relations on the day of the follicular rupture, so you have maximum chances of pregnancy. Hope I have answered your query.

I consulted Dr. she told me to take Deviry for 5 days and i have completed the course but still dint got my peroids is there any chance of pregency while i have skip my periods after taking deviry.","Doctor":"Hi,Deviry is a progestational medicine. In cases of delayed menses, this medicine is prescribed for 5 days. After discontinuation of the tablets, usually within 4 to 7 days, withdrawal bleeding is observed. So do not be impatient. Wait for few days and you will get menses. However, Deviry alone is not prescribed to achieve pregnancy. Since you are having Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), you will have to take medicines for inducing the ovulation (egg release). PCOS is a condition which is characterised by failure to release eggs. The medicines used for induction of ovulation are Clomiphene citrate or HMG/hCG combination. You will have to undergo a battery of investigations like blood levels of FSH, LH, Oestrogen, Progesterone, Prolactin, and AMH.Based on the results of the investigations, medicine(s) for induction of ovulation will be chosen. The medicines for induction of ovulation are given only after inducing the menses to prevent their use in undiagnosed pregnancy. You have to work actively to reduce your weight. Please maintain your BMI between 18 and 23.9. Please report to your Gynecologist after you get withdrawal bleeding so that you can be given medicines for induction of ovulation.

For more detailed advice, you may ask me direct question on this forum. Regards,Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hello. I been taking the hcg activator capsules for 11 days.

Urine pregnancy test will give positive results once your period will delay by more than 7 days. It should be done with overnight early morning urine concentrated sample. It may give false negative result with diluted urine sample.You can also go for blood HCG test to confirm pregnancy. It is more accurate and detect pregnancy earlier than urine pregnancy test. In absence of pregnancy, delayed period could be due to hormonal imbalance. Avoid stress, take healthy diet and drink plenty of water.Hope I have answered your query.

Since all the three pregnancy tests you performed week after a week of missed period, you cannot be pregnant. After a week of missed period, the results of these tests are reliable. Still if you are suspicious and want to confirm the pregnancy status, you may perform Beta hCG test on your blood. Values more than 25 mIU/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy while in non-pregnant state, the values remain under 5 mIU/ml.To get the menses after missed period in non-pregnant state, you may take some Progestational product like Deviry (with an advice from your Gynaecologist), then within 4 to 7 days, you would get withdrawal bleeding. Occasionally, periods may get delayed even without pregnancy - due to  transient hormonal disturbance or physical or mental stress.

The egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. The egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 3 days. Keeping this calculation in mind, you may plan your intercourses. Alternatively, you may go for ultrasonography ovulation monitoring. It will locate the day of your ovulation. Accordingly, you can plan your intercourse. If there is any problem is egg release, you will have to take medicines for induction of ovulation. If you are ovulating normally and regularly, and still fail to conceive even after fair due trial, you will have to look for the other two factors : tubal patency and semen quality. Hysterosalpingography and Laparoscopy can find out any tubal block and even the intrauterine factors also. Semen examination of husband will inform you about the quality and normalcy of the semen. If within 6 months of fair trial you fail to conceive, please report to the gynaecologist or infertility consultant. Hope I have answered your query.

Delay in your menses seems to be due to menopause, may be you are in a premenopausal phase of your life. In this phase, the menses start becoming irregular and are delayed. The period of delay goes on increasing and subsequently the periods stop permanently. When there are no periods for continuous six months, we label such women as menopausal woman. If you indeed keen to know the status of your menopause, you may get FSH and Estradiol levels done. They will be very low after menopause.

However, few women do get some amount of bleeding during early pregnancy at or around the expected date of menstruation. This used to be known as placental sign in good old days. Your history of the spotting followed by menstrual bleeding does not seem to suggest the possibility of pregnancy. However, you may confirm the diagnosis by:1. Pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample about a week after the first day of your 'so called' menstruation; earlier these tests may report false negative results. 2. Alternatively you may opt for Beta hCG test on the blood 10 days after last unprotected intercourse.

How long should i wait and whats the maximum size of the egg to be ruptured???","Doctor":"Hi,The follicles can rupture at any size. However, the follicles of size between 18 mm and 21 mm are supposed to release the healthiest eggs which have better chances of successful pregnancy. Now that your follicles are of 20 mm size, this is the most ideal time for egg release. If they are not rupturing naturally, you may request your gynecologist to give you an injection of hCG which will bring about ovulation within 24 hours. You may confirm the evidence of ovulation by ultrasonography. Utilize these days for your sexual relations. I hope this provides you some guidelines.

Anyways I usually am on for 7 days and I'm trying to get pregnant so when should I try to get pregnant. When will I be ovulating?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.When you have irregular menstrual cycles, it is difficult to pinpoint the time of ovulation each month.Ovulation generally occurs about 14 days before your period starts. So if you count 2 weeks backwards from the date that your period starts, you can figure out by looking a few months back what your typical window of time is typical for your ovulation.If you have intercourse every other day from two days before your typical ovulation time until you either feel PMS symptoms or your period comes, whichever comes first, there should be enough active sperm around when you typically ovulate for you to conceive.For more accurate estimation of your ovulation, there are kits called ovulation projectors that can be bought over-the-counter in a chemist or pharmacy. These kids have test strips for your urine that check for certain hormone that is released when you are about to ovulate. These test strips can also be useful if you do not have regular cycles when trying to conceive.If you and your partner try unsuccessfully for one year to get pregnant, there may be a medical reason involved in why you are not conceiving. At that point, you may want to consult with your gynecologist or fertility specialists.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, i am 32 yrs old. Had gone under surgery for endometriosis on 18th Aug 2014. Had bleeding for few days. My gyneac said i will have to take lupride injection after 8 days of my surgery i.e on 25th Aug. I took the injection and the doc said i can have a normal pregnancy. Just 2 days back i visited my gyneac as i had my periods and she told me i will have to take two more dosage of lupride each month to reduce my bleeding. I don t understand why such complication even after removal of endometriosis. Please help as i and my husband are desperately TTc. How long will it take me to conceive and will it be normal pregnancy.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pelvis that cannot be removed completely by surgery.  The reason is is that endometriosis implants can be microscopic, which is why ultimately most women are treated with hormones to suppress their menstrual cycle for 3 to 6 months after endometriosis surgery. This helps to prevent recurrence of cysts and scarring within your pelvis which may increase your chance of conceiving.However, while you are on the Leuprolide (LUpron) injection, you will not menstruate regularly and is unlikely that you will become pregnant. Your greatest chance of pregnancy is in the first six months after stopping the medication.  Because you only 32 years old, I would recommend doing a full six months of Lupron injections before trying to conceive again.So again to clarify, you do not need Lupron because you had any complications from your surgery, rather the issue is that Lupron reduces your risk of recurrence of endometriosis after surgery, which will help to maximize your chance of conceiving later.So there is no reason why you and your husband cannot have unprotected intercourse while you on the Lupron treatment, however the goal of the treatment is to reduce the inflammation your pelvis after the surgery to help you heal and also to reset your hormones so when you go off the Lupron you will be in the best shape to conceive.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that I helped clarify the role Lupron has in the treatment of endometriosis.I wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"we were trying to conceive so i was testing for ovulation. i got a positive on the early morning of the 16th. the last time i tested was the night of the 13th and it was negative. was unable to tests on the 14th and 15th due to travel. the las time we had sex that resulted in ejaculation was the 11th. on the 26th and 27th i saw a faint line on the pregnancy test. wanted to know how could this be possible?","Doctor":"Hi,First of all, sperm can live in the female genital tract for up to five days. So if you had sex on the 11th, there certainly could have been viable sperm still in your system to be there to fertilize your ovulation on the 16th. Furthermore, modern pregnancy tests are extremely sensitive, and can become positive even 10 days after conception.However, if the test is not performed correctly, or if the test is left out too long beyond the time recommended to read the test on the package, a faint line can appear.So at this time, I recommend waiting for your menstrual period, and if it does not arrive on time I would repeat the pregnancy test at that point.  At this time this has should give you an easy to see, accurate answer.  But it is certainly possible that you could have conceived this cycle.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and I hope this information was helpful to you. Best of luck in conceiving.Regards,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"so today i had sex and my boyfriend and he was wearing a condom but he came inside the condom what happened is after he let go the condom stayed inside me so i had to get the condom out but there was only a little bit of semen in the condom so i m worried that some of his semen is still inside me. He told me that in the morning he masturbated 2x and the semen that was left a little in the condom was light and watery can that get me pregnant ?","Doctor":"Hi,There is always some chance of pregnancy in this type on sexual intercourse. Condom was stuck inside the vagina so there may be chance that some seminal fluid get enter into vagina. It may contain sufficient sperm that cause pregnancy. Again pregnancy will depend on the time of menstrual cycle.If you have did sex during fertile phase of cycle then high chance of pregnancy. If you have regular cycle of 28-30 days then 10th to 18th day of period counted as fertile phase. So if you had sex during fertile phase take I pill with in 72 hours of sex to prevent pregnancy. If 72 hours has been crossed then wait for period. If period will delay by more than 7 days then go for urine pregnancy test and or blood HCG to confirm pregnancy.If you will be pregnant then still you can terminate pregnancy by abortion pill under advise of the gynecologist. Meanwhile avoid stress, drink plenty of water, do regular exercise and maintain proper pelvic hygiene.Hope this may help you.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The fact that your doctor has commented that your scan reports are good means that you are ovulating regularly. Endogest is a natural micronized progesterone preparation. After fertilization, progesterone is required to stabilize the pregnancy. This progesterone is released by Corpus luteum. If corpus luteum is weak, the pregnancy may not continue due to shortage of progesterone. Therefore you are given these pills. Moreover, Inj. hCG helps strengthening of corpus luteum. So it will be useful when the fertilization has taken place. If you miss the period, perform your pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample, earlier the test may report false negative results. Alternatively you may perform Beta hCG test on the blood 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse. Now that the other medicines like Evion, Ebexid, M2 are not continued now, we need not discuss on them. Moreover, if you are ovulating naturally, you do not need these medicines.

Is this serious as it is not normal for me?","Doctor":"Hi,Normally in period of 28-30 days cycle, ovulation will occur around at 14th to 16th day of cycle. You can count first day when bleeding is started. So if you have normal 28th to 30th day cycle then ovulation occurs at 14th to 16th day of cycle. Now sperm can live in female genital tract for 4-6 days and ovum can live around 12-24 hours after ovulation.So 10th to 20th day of cycle is fertile day of period. You can do sex daily or alternated day on fertile period of cycle. Do full penetrative sexual intercourse by putting pillow on back. Clumps of blood could be due to endometrial tissue that will shed and will come out during period. If you have normal period then nothing to worry about that.

Lastnight, my partner and I of 2 years had intercourse for the first time. The condom broke, but he did not ejaculate. Pre-ejaculate was present, but he immediately pulled out when the condom ripped. I was aware of the risk with Pre-ejaculate, so I took the emergency contraceptive plan B within 2 hours after the incident. I would like a second opinion and hopefully some more reassurance that me chances are still low. Also, if it concerns you and your answer, I ended my last period one week ago.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. First of all, I want to reassure you that Plan B is extremely effective when taken within 72 hours of a condom accident or unprotected intercourse. It reduces your risk of pregnancy to less than 10%, and is maximally effective the sooner you take it after the incident. Secondly, even though a small amount of sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate, it typically only starts to leak out very close to the time of orgasm.  So if your partner was not close to orgasm when he pulled out, the chances of being exposed to viable sperm is also extremely low.So in summary, in your particular scenario, your chances of pregnancy are extremely low. Nothing except abstinence is 100% effective, however in your case, I think you can be reassured that you will not conceive.For some additional information, I just wanted to let you know the typically women have some vaginal bleeding or spotting between 3 to 7 days after taking Plan B. This is normal and is actually a sign that the pill is working. Your real menstrual cycle may be delayed if you have any bleeding from the Plan B.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.

Now I am experiencing tender/larger breasts, a greater amount of vaginal discharge, slight cramping in my lower left abdomin, and bloating. I took a hpt and it was negative. Do I have reason to believe I am pregnant and had a false negative hpt?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You have  delayed period by 4 days and you took clomid. Clomid will help to induce ovulation in 80% cases and increase 50% chance of pregnancy. Your delayed period and other symptoms could be due to pregnancy. Urine pregnancy test at 4 days after delayed period may give false negative result.Urine pregnancy test will give positive result 8 to 10 days after delayed period.I would suggest to go for pregnancy test once your period will delay by 8 to 10 days.You can use clomid for 4 to 6 cycle and then undergo USG scan and ovarain follicle study. If 18-21 mm ovarian follicle size will be there then it cause successful pregnancy. If ovarian follicle not ruptured then HCG injection can be useful. Avoid stress, take healthy diet, drink plenty of water.Hope I have answered your query.

My periods were irregular from last few months, this time 45  days no periods yet,  I have reported in hospital, they asked to go for a pregnant test? Is pregnancy  possible after tubectomy done? Dr . Sir  advised for some another tests such as TSH,FSH,LH,PRC and USG  \\" pelois \\"? Please advise me ?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. If you had a tubectomy (which I'm assuming is a procedure performed on your fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy), your chance of conceiving is close to zero. That is why tubectomy is regarded as a method of permanent sterilization.Many hospitals routinely do pregnancy tests on women of reproductive age regardless of their history when they are initiating treatment of some other issue. This is usually done because many types of other physicians are uncomfortable in treating women who are pregnant, and they want to find out about the pregnancy early before you receive any other medical treatment.Irregular periods can happen to any woman and can because by hormonal irregularities. That is the reason why your doctor advised for those other tests like the TSH, FSH, LH, and others. A USG (gynecologic ultrasound) of your pelvis is simply a test to look at the shape and size of your uterus tubes and ovaries.  This is sometimes used in evaluation of an irregular menstrual cycle.So in summary, the pregnancy test you received in the hospital is more due to hospital policy than your actually having a risk of pregnancy. The other tests- the hormonal tests and ultrasound (usg) are simply part of evaluation of your irregular periods.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.

Now Im planning to try it again. I went to my OB and prescribe the same medication. Im worried about taking the medicine but will be disappointed again by not getting pregnant. what should I do","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Clomiphene is a type of fertility medication that works to help a woman ovulate. Unfortunately, if your infertility has another cause, the clomiphene will not be effective. Furthermore, is not recommended that you do more than four cycles in a row of clomiphene, as the hormones in the clomiphene can actually decreases your risk of pregnancy by making the uterine lining very thin and not receptive to implantation.So in summary, clomiphene will only work as a fertility medication if the cause of your infertility is a lack of ovulation.  There can be many causes of infertility, which can be related to age, the health of your fallopian tubes, structure or physical problems with your uterus as well is a problem with your partner sperm. In order to have a full sense of whether clomiphene would be an effective medication for you, your doctor should have checked your hormone levels and whether or not you ovulate. In addition, no fertility method for women will work if the man's sperm count is not normal - and almost 50% of cases of infertility have a male factor involved.So the best thing you can do is consult with a fertility specialist if your next cycles of clomiphene are not effective.  The specialist can evaluate both you and your partner and come up with the best treatment option for you to have a successful pregnancy. Normally, the tests that are required are some basic hormone levels in the woman, a test called an HSG to make sure the fallopian tubes are open, and the sperm count evaluation of the male partner. There are many other options thing clomiphene for fertility treatment that are available, and discussing these options with a specialist would be a good next step in your evaluation.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. If the egg is not released, there are no chances of pregnancy. The question is: why even after the hCG injection, the follicle did not rupture to release the egg? It is likely that the follicle was not adequately matured. The follicle of size between 18 mm and 21 mm size release the healthiest eggs which have high probability of successful pregnancy. If the size of the follicle is small, you may take some ovulation induction medicine like Clomiphene citrate or HMG/hCG combination. Please report to infertility consultant.Hope I have answered your query.

How frequently shud I hav intercourse","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Active reagent in Ovafar is Clomiphene citrate. It can be started from  day 2 of the cycle for induction of ovulation. Associated treatment with Metformin or Myo inositol is supposed to give better results. After the course of Ovafar for 5 days, ovulation monitoring with ultrasonography is advised. When the follicle(s) has (have) reached size of 18 mm, injection hCG will give you programmed rupture of follicle; thus you can have planned sexual relations. The follicles of size between 18 mm to 21 mm release the best quality eggs having maximum opportunity of successful pregnancy. Since your follicle is now already 22 mm, you may start the intercourse frequently upto 24 hours after the egg release. The life of the egg is 24 hours while sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence, please start frequent sexual relations from the 18 mm size of the follicle and continue then at least for 24 hours after the ovulation has been achieved. Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. When the follicle is sufficiently matured, injection of hCG does effect its rupture resulting into ovulation. Usually this effect is seen within 24 hours. However, if your follicles are not responding to hCG injection, may be the covering is too thick.In such cases, after trying with hCG injection for few cycles, you may opt for ultrasonography ovarian drilling. Adjuvant treatment with Metformin may help you.  Please consult some expert infertility consultant who is endoscopic expert also. I hope this provides you some guidance.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Yes, yeast or any other infection in the vagina does affect the fertility by creating a hostile environment for the sperms. However, once the infection is treated successfully, the environment regains its normalcy and thus fertility can be re-achieved. For yeast infection, please take some anti-fungal vaginal or systemic treatment. Along with it, use Lactobacilli vaginal ovules for at least 15 days and Lactobacilli perineal wash too. This infection can spread sexually also. Hence, irrespective of the symptoms to your husband, both of you should take the simultaneous treatment. I would advise both of you to follow the undermentioned tips for successful anti-fungal treatment: 1. Till both of you are declared completely cured, observe complete sexual abstinence. 2. Shave the private parts clean. 3. Clip the nails short - flush to the skin.4. Boil your underwear daily. Use panty liners. With the successful treatment for the fungal infection you can definitely conceive provided:1. You are forming the eggs regularly: you may ensure this by ultrasonography ovulation monitoring. 2. Your tubes are patent and there is no pathology in the uterine cavity : Hysterosalpingography, Laparoscopy and Hysteroscopy can provide the information about these factors. 3. Husband has sufficient healthy sperms: Semen examination will give the information. Please report to your gynaecologist for these investigations, treatment and further advice.

Clofart are tablets of Clomiphene citrate. Clomiphene citrate is used for induction of ovulation. These tablets do sometimes cause release of multiple eggs from the ovary which may result in multiple pregnancy, that is twins of triplets. Occasionally, there are many eggs released, which is known as hyperstimulation of the ovary. However, if you need induction of ovulation due to failure of natural ovulation, you should not deny the treatment of Clomiphene citrate (Clofart) for the possibility of multiple pregnancy. You need the eggs to get released. Hope I have answered your query.

I have too much doubt on Fallopian tubes blockage. Please guide me.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You concerns about tubal blockage can be answered by a diagnostic test called hysterosalpingography which shows any blockages in the tubes. In this procedure dye will be injected in to the uterus and and x ray of pelvis will be taken to see whether drug spills out from the uterus. If it spills out it indicates tubes are patent and if not on the side where there is no spillage, there is a block of tube which will be evident on the x-ray film.  If tubes are patent you check for ovulation whether it is occuring or not and growth of the follicles which is called follicular study. If ovulation occurs and tubes are patent chances of conception are good. Hope this is helpful to you.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You can use fertyl and duphaston under the advise of gynecologist after complete evaluation. I would suggest to consult gynecologist and undergo reproductive, thyroid and insulin hormone analysis, USG scan, ovarian follicle study for better management. - Fertyl contains clomiphene citrate:  It induce ovulation in 80% cases and increase 50% chance of the pregnancy. - Duphaston contain progesterone:  It makes the uterine environment favorable  for implantation and support pregnancy. You can also ask for metformin for insulin resistance and for induction of ovulation. Folic acid will also be useful.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You have left fallopian tube with staple on it. The right tube was removed. Natural pregnancy is possible after recanalization surgery. Success of this operation depends on length of healthy tubes left behind after sterilization. So there may be chance of pregnancy but less because alternate ovary get ovulated and you have no right tube.So consult the gynecologist and undergo examination, USG scan to know the status of tube and if possible recanalization surgery. If surgery is not possible then go for in vitro fertilization. Avoid stress, take healthy diet, drink plenty of water and do regular exercise.Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You are using correct drugs. I would suggest you to use medicine under the advice of the gynecologist. Clomiphene citrate will help in induction of ovulation in 80% cases and increase the chance of pregnancy to around 50%. So it should be taken from 3rd to 8th day of cycle. Noreethisterone contain progesterone and in your case it will not act as contraceptive.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You did sex from the 3rd day onward to whole cycle. During this time you can become pregnant as you did sex also in the fertile phase of the period, that is 10th to 20th day of period is highly fertile and you have to concentrate in those day. During this time ovum is released, so there is more chance of the fertilization. But it is very early to tell about the pregnancy. Tender nipple could be due to hormonal imbalance. Just from this symptom, it is difficult to tell about the pregnancy. I would suggest to wait for the period. If period is delayed by more than 2 weeks then go for urine pregnancy test and or blood HCG test to confirm the pregnancy. Avoid stress, take healthy diet, drink plenty of water, do regular exercise.You can also take folic acid tablet as you are trying to conceive.Hope I have answered your query.

If you do not conceive with 4 cycles of IUI, we need to consider the possibility of  the patent tube also being affected by infection. It may be patent but it's lining epithelium may not be functioning normally. So if you do not conceive with 4 to 6 cycles of IUI, then I suggest that you need to consider IVF treatment.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Fertomid is prescribed to you to induce ovulation. It is the right medicine. I suggest that you have ultrasound study at least in the first cycle of treatment  to confirm that you are ovulating. It is better to have sex 3 to 4 times in a week (alternate day) rather than looking for ovulation day. Having sex on alternate day automatically covers the ovulation day as sperms remain alive in reproductive tract for 5 to 6 days. Doing this way will avert the undue stress. If you are obese then please reduce weight. Reducing even 5% of body weight will improve your chances of conception  Stop smoking if you are a smoker. Take a tablet of folicavid daily.

By and large, irregular menstrual cycles are associated with non release of the eggs (anovulatory cycles), though it is not a rule. Menstrual periods of about 55 days is quite a delayed cycle. It is most likely that you are not releasing your eggs. Please ensure your ovulation by monitoring through ultrasonography. If you are ovulating, plan your sexual relations on and around the day of ovulation. If you are not ovulating, you need induction of ovulation by some medicines like Clomiphene citrate or HMG/hCG combination for which you will have to report to gynecologist/infertility consultant.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Most of the time, irregular menses are associated with failure of egg release (ovulation). The irregular periods could be due to conditions like Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), abnormal uterine bleeding, and thyroid dysfunction. Ultrasonography will initially help you to find any evidence of condition like PCOS. Ultrasonography ovulation monitoring can help you get evidence of your ovulation. If you are ovulating, you may plan your sexual relations on and around the day of ovulation. If there is ovulation failure, you will have to undergo further investigations to look for the cause. Also reproductory and hormonal profile may be tried to further clinch the diagnosis. Depending upon the levels of different hormones, you may have to take treatment.

Be patient, if you rush it, the result might not be one you desire. Make sure we first concentrate on getting you a normal menstrual cycle, if your cycle is normal, your fertility will be normal.If all is well and controlled, then you can request your doctor to initiate folic acid supplements and clomiphene citrate. Usually within a few cycles of clomiphene citrate, conception is successful.I wish you loads of luck.Best wishes,Dr. Shoaib Khan"},{"Patient":"I just turned 31 yrs.old last march and that month also i had a miscarriage with my first baby that I ve waited for 5 years....and now i am starting to consult my ob gyn to conceive again. She gave me folic acid and clostil..Is it posible for me to conceive quickly? thank you and more power","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. If your menstrual cycle and hormone levels are normal and regular then clostil should help, either within the first cycle or after a few cycles of clostil, conception should take place. But if your cycles or hormone levels are not normal, then I do not recommend the use of clostil. Because, clostil can result in conception, but if all parameters are not normal then the risk for a miscarriage will be high. So correction and normalization of all values is mandatory before initiation of clostil and other fertility drugs.Best wishes,Dr. Shoaib Khan"},{"Patient":"Hello doc, I am TTC for last 4 months.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. There is a chance of the pregnancy because there is penetration of penis inside the vagina. Precum enter into vagina unknowingly before the ejaculation and precum contain sufficient sperm concentration that cause pregnancy. I would suggest to wait for the period.If your period will delay by more than 7 days then go for urine pregnancy test and or blood HCG to confirm the pregnancy. If you will be pregnant then you can terminate the pregnancy by abortion pill containing mifepristone and misoprostol under the supervision of the gynecologist.Hope this may help you.

Take proper rest, avoid stress, eat healthy diet, drink plenty of water. You can also take meftal spas for the pain.

I would suggest to go for the urine pregnancy test with early morning urine sample to rule out the pregnancy. If you are not pregnant then consult the gynecologist to rule out cause. It could be due to hormonal imbalance, ovarian dysfunction, excessive stress, change in life style and dietary habit.You can use primout to induce the period in absence of the pregnancy under the advise of gynecologist.

I am not overweight and I look normal.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,To start with, let me discuss about the medicines you have been prescribed. Registrone is a retroprogestational medicine which helps controlling the excessive bleeding or inducing the withdrawal bleeding when taken for short period. If taken continually cyclically, it helps regularising the menses without affecting the ovulation.  Folinz tablets are tablets of Folic Acid and Zinc. They help the healthy growth of the tissues. Siocare Syrup is an Ayurvedic medicine which is used for the treatment of Menstrual problems, Bleeding Gynaecological conditions, Reproductive system problems, Bleeding disorders, Diarrhoea, Eye disorders and other conditions. Siocare Syrup contains Ashwagandha, Asoka, Chandan, Daruharidra, Dashmoola, Dhataki, Guduchi, Jeeraka, Lodhra, Musta, Shatavari, and Udumbara as active ingredients. Now let us turn to your main issue of fertility and the irregular menstruation. By and large, the women with irregular menstruation are known to face problems in egg release; however, it is not a rule. If you are overweight also, having hairiness at the unwanted places of the body along with irregular menses, please check for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome which is known to have ovulation problem and result in infertility. At this stage, I would advise you to monitor your ovulation. Ultrasonography would be option of choice for this. If you find evidence of egg release, you should not be concerned about conception problems. Try to plan your pregnancy at and around the day of egg release to achieve the pregnancy. If ultrasonography reveals the failure of ovulation, you will have to undergo treatment of ovulation induction. Please report to your Gynaecologist.

My husband and I just had a baby in February, but she passed away at 17 days old, and we are trying again. However, my period hasn t returned and I stopped pumping fully close to 7 weeks ago. Also, when should I get concerned that my period hasn t returned? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Usually the period starts within 5-6 weeks after discontinuing the breast feeding. Even after the discontinuation of breastfeeding, if you continue to squeeze the milk from the breasts, the effect on the hormones is the same as the breast feeding. When expression of the milk by natural or artificial way has been totally discontinued, within 5-6 weeks, the menses should return. However, in many cases, the menses do return even while the breast feeding the child. Sometimes, during this period, conception may take place which is known as pregnancy in lactational period. Therefore before taking any steps to induce the menses, it is advisable to look for the possibility of pregnancy by pregnancy test. If you fail to get the menses within this stipulated time, you may report to your Gynaecologist.  After ruling out the pregnancy, probably some progesterone preparation would help your menses to return again. After returning the menses, it may take few weeks for the ovulation to return. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri."},{"Patient":"ive had unprotected sex last monday and saturday not sure if he ejaculated , but my boobs hurt and my stomachs really sore , i took a pregnancy test and it showed up one line and one faint line but the faint line kept disapearing , i also have my period every 3 months because it gets quite painful not sure when i get it next as i dont count , i also have forgotten the pill","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, I would have appreciated had you mentioned the date of your last period. The fact that your pregnancy test is positive suggests that you are pregnant. However, faint second line is an issue of concern. The main causes of such weak positive test are:1. Ectopic pregnancy: The pregnancy in such cases is implanted somewhere outside the uterine cavity, commonly the tube. Such pregnancy does not grow and subsequently ruptures to cause profuse bleeding in the abdomen. It requires emergency surgical intervention with many units of blood transfusion. Such condition is associated with extreme pain, which I believe you are having. Ultrasonography will help you. If in spite of positive pregnancy test, the uterine cavity is empty, it is most likely ectopic pregnancy. 2. Missed abortion of recent origin when the test is on the way of becoming negative. Ultrasonography can help detecting such condition. If detected, it needs immediate evacuation of the uterus. 3. Test performed too early in normal pregnancy. Subsequently it becomes strong positive. Weak positive pregnancy test, particularly with pain in abdomen should not be taken lightly and should always be investigated with ultrasonography. Please report to your Gynaecologist ASAP. I hope you got the message. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 20 yr old female and I m sexually active, now normally my period always comes either the middle of the month or the end and always lasts 5-7 days but my last period only lasted 3 days I thought it just simply stopped because sometimes ot does that but it always starts back up again and this time it didn t. I m somewhat concerned that I may be pregnant, I have notices that I have been tired more, loss of appetite, and with a couple of foods I have ate their was a metallic taste. I m not too sure what s going on","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, You had your normal menses. So the probability of pregnancy is very remote. Tiredness and altered taste with loss of appetite and repulsion towards certain (particularly) oily and/or spicy food can be due to affection of the liver with or without jaundice. Please have to look of your urine. If it is dark yellow, it may suggest jaundice. Please report to your physician. To ensure the pregnancy status, you may opt for:1. Pregnancy test about a week after the (supposed low) menses; earlier the test may report false negative. 2. Beta hCG test on the blood 10 days after the last unprotected sexual intercourse.

They didnt give me a pregnancy test, but they did insert the Nexplanon. I ve been having pregnancy symthoms, Maybe it s just in my head, i do have a 3 year old, so i have been through it before. It does have me worried that im having all the symthoms. Is it likely that you can get pregnant while gettin off birth control, changing to a new one?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Implantable contraceptives like the Implanon and Nexplanon, even though they have expiration dates, are effective for even a few months beyond that date. This is because the manufacturer is required to post an expiration date that is actually earlier than when the device truly becomes ineffective.When switching birth control methods, hormonal symptoms are very common. Many of the symptoms that we commonly associate with pregnancy including bloating, breast tenderness, moodiness, weight gain, nausea, headaches and others are common side effects of progesterone based contraceptives (like the Nexplanon) and cannot be distinguished from pregnancy.The only way to know absolutely for sure that you are not pregnant is by performing a urine pregnancy test. Modern pregnancy tests are extremely accurate, and will become positive within 10 days to two weeks after conception. However, the reason your healthcare provider did not require pregnancy test before giving you your new Nexplanon is that, because of the reason I explained earlier, you really were not at risk for pregnancy.So the likelihood of your getting pregnant in between switching from Implanon to Nexplanon is close to zero.  The symptoms that you are experiencing are likely side effects of your body's adjustment to the new medication, which will likely subside over time.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been diagonsed with thyroid and doctor suggested me to take thyronorm 25 mcg for 3 months will this reduce weight?

These pills are given for 5 days. Few days after that the ovulation results. Ovulation Monitoring by ultrasonography after the day 9 of the cycle will give evidences of ovulation; more over it will help you to locate the day of ovulation so that you can plan your sexual relations on and around that day. Addition of Metformin and/or Myo inositol may give better results in case of failure of egg release due to PCOS. Clomiphene citrate trial should not be extended beyond 6 cycles. If it fails to result in pregnancy, you may have to go for HMG/hCG combination therapy. I hope this gives you preliminary guidelines.

There is always a possibility of discharge of secretions which will contain some left out sperms which are capable of impregnating her. As you have mentioned in the summary of your query, if you did not have any penetrative sex, you do not have to worry about the pregnancy. However, if you had penetrative sex even after couple of times masturbation, it is better to look for the evidence of pregnancy by: 1. Beta hCG test 10 days after this incidence. 2. Alternatively, wait for her menses. If she gets her menses, she is not pregnant. If she misses her periods, perform pregnancy test on her overnight morning first urine sample after a week; earlier the test may report false negative results. Beta hCG urine test kits can detect the pregnancy even few days before missing a period. I hope this clarifies your doubts.

You can become pregnant even with the subserous myoma. Your abdomen is looking large which makes you think that you are pregnant. In fact the myoma you are carrying in your uterus could have grown big enough to distend the uterus. The best way to resolve this dilemma is by finding any evidence of the pregnancy. With enlarged uterus, the pregnancy is also quite advanced and hence can be easily detected by ultrasonography. Ultrasonography also will inform you about the size and number of myoma in your uterus. I hope this helps you today.

So you can calculate the date of your ovulation. The intercourse which is around (plus or minus 4 days) the date of ovulation is responsible for the conception. Since there is difference of about 15-20 days between the two intercourses, ultrasonography can give your approximate date of conception (rather the age of the baby). This also can help you figuring out which intercourse is responsible for this pregnancy. The fool proof evidence you can have about the paternity of this baby is by DNA test. I hope this helps you to resolve your dilemma. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Im 26 years old and im after a miscarriage.

I tried last month itself after stopping pills. but fortunately or unfortunately my periods came. will I get pregnant atleast this month. when willi ovulate? or there is chances for me to get conceive?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You were given Ginnette for regularizing your menses. These are oral contraceptive pills which help in regularizing irregular periods. Now for your conception, monitor your ovulation from day 9 onwards by ultrasonography. Usually the follicle ruptures to ovulate when it attains size between  18 mm and 21 mm. On and around the day of the ovulation, plan your sexual relations. This will give you maximum chance of conception. If the ovulation does not take place naturally, please report to your Gynaecologist for induction of ovulation, either by Clomiphene citrate or HMG/hCG combination. I hope this helps you.

The size of the follicle was 28x30 mm in size on day 19. This is not a good development for conception. What was the dose of hCG given to you - 5000 IU or 10000 IU?The follicle should have ruptured after the first hCG injection. It did not. Moreover, the follicle has grown to quite a big size. Follicles of size between 18 mm and 21 mm diameter release the healthiest eggs which have better chances of successful pregnancy. You should try induction of ovulation when the follicle is within this size range. Also please try to look for the thickness of the uterine lining (endometrium) at the time of expected egg release. Endometrial thickness between 09 mm and 14 mm is most conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum. I hope you will discuss these issues with your Gynaecologist.

Pease submit yourself for ovulation monitoring. If your follicle is releasing the egg between the size 18 mm and 21 mm, it is healthy egg. Also observe the thickness of the uterine lining (endometrium) at the time of ovulation. Endometrial thickness between 9 mm and 14 mm is highly conducive for implantation of  fertilized egg. If the egg is not getting released at this size of the follicle, inj. hCG will help do that. Susten is a progestational preparation and will help stabilizing the pregnancy immediately after conception. Inj. Folligraft contains Urofollitropin. FSH binds to the follicle stimulating hormone receptor which is a G-coupled transmembrane receptor. Binding of the FSH to its receptor seems to induce phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) and Akt signaling pathway, which is known to regulate many other metabolic and related survival/maturation functions in cells. Thus it helps in health conception. I hope this helps you plan your sexual relations around the day of ovulation for better results.

Does he need to see a doctor about this?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,At the outset, let me assure you that frequent erecting dos not cause abortions nor does it affect conception. Erection is possible without sexual arousal (libido) even with tight underclothes or position. If you find him still erected even after ejaculation, you may not terminate the intercourse; continue to have the penis still in the vagina. After some time you will again start getting orgasm, this time within the vagina from what is called as G point. This is called as vaginal orgasm which hardly less than 10% of the women experience in their life. Continue the intercourse in the second innings and enjoy your vaginal orgasm. I do not feel he needs a medical intervention for his frequent erection and libido. Just cooperate with him. I hope this convinces you.

It is a medicine for treatment of Diabetes. It is not a medicine which initiates ovulation. However, this medicine helps the other medicines like Clomiphene citrate or HMG/hCG combination to effect the ovulation. This combination is effective particularly in Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) wherein the levels of insulin also are increased. Metformin helps controlling Insulin levels.Though Levocetrizine does not affect ovulation or maturing the follicles, it is not advised in early pregnancy. Hence, if you are attempting for the pregnancy, discontinue it if you can and take a Gynaecologist's opinion on it. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I have recently had a light bleed for 3 days which started when my period should have on the 17th of this month.

This used to be called previously as Placental sign. If you have all the other symptoms of early pregnancy; i.e. frequent urination, nausea & vomiting with pica and breast symptoms, there are chances that you are pregnant. You definitely have the breast symptoms. You may confirm your pregnancy status by performing pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample. This test is reliable after a week of missed period. Since it is now 3 weeks from the placental sign, the pregnancy test should provide you reliable results. Alternatively, you may report to your Gynaecologist for detection of pregnancy. I hope this helps you.

But I still did not conceive. I am thinking of doing follicular study once again . My sonogaphy report is also normal. My friend advise me that this time in follicular study i should tell doctor to call me for follicular study even after ovulation just to check what exactly happen after ovulation.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Siphene is a Clomiphene citrate medicine, used for induction of ovulation. This is an anti-oestrogenic medicine and hence has god adverse effect on the growth of the endometrium. Hence and due to some other reasons also, it has better success in ovulation induction; however success in achieving the pregnancy is lower. Please submit yourself for ovulation monitoring after Siphene. At the time of ovulation, please note  size of the follicle(s) and thickening of the uterine lining (endometrium). Follicles between 18 mm to 21 mm size release healthiest eggs and have better pregnancy chances. If the follicles are becoming larger, you may request your doctor to give you Inj. hCG when the size of the follicle(s) is(are) within this range. If the follicles are remaining smaller, you may have to switch over to HMG/hCG combination. The endometrium of thickness between 9 mm and 14 mm is most conducive for implantation of the fertilized ovum. If the endometrium at the time of ovulation is thinner, please do not attempt pregnancy at that cycle. Get your endometrium built up by some oestrogenic preparation first. When it has reached the required thickness or more, then down regulate the oestrogen and attempt pregnancy in the next cycle by induction of ovulation. May be, if Siphene does not work, you may have to switch over to HMG/hCG combination. Also please find out by hysterosalpingography about the patency of your tubes. Husband's semen examination also is needed to find out the quality of the semen. I hope this has provided you preliminary guidelines.

However, 30 years is not that advanced age. These sorts of chromosomal abnormalities, though may be seen at earlier age group also, are more common after the age of 32 years. You have a history on one affected child. So you have to be more cautious. Please get your triple marker test, Nuchal thickness test done and report to a Foetal Medicine consultant.

Hence, you have been rightly advise to have maximum sexual relations during this period. However, at this stage, Inj. hCG would have helped you more.

Moreover, you had your last menstrual period just a week and half ago. So there is no chance that you are pregnant. You have not specified which pregnancy symptoms you are experiencing. If it is nausea and vomiting, it could be due to acidity or gastro-intestinal disturbances. Try some antacid; if it does not give you any relief, please report to your physician.

Is it risky to concive with pcos ??i dont hav diabtic,colestorol,pressure...nothing but fat.pls advice in detaill thanx","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Letrozole is a strong fertility medication that can produce ovulation in women who normally do not ovulate, such as women with PCOS. The Ovidac injection just induces you to ovulate at the correct time in your cycle to correspond usually with a timed insemination, either by intercourse, or by IUI.The fertility medication itself does not cause any risk to the baby if you do conceive, because the medications only affect your ovulation and ability to conceive. However, fertility medications such as Letrozole can produce high order multiple gestations (triplets and above) in women with PCOS because PCOS is a disease where women have many immature eggs waiting to be released.If you successfully conceive only one baby, your pregnancy is no more a risk than any other obese woman.  You will have a higher risk of diabetes and high blood pressure during your pregnancy, and they should be tested for and monitored carefully, but with proper prenatal care women with PCOS and obesity can have successful pregnancies.So in summary, the fertility medications that you have been treated with really only increase the risk of conceiving multiple babies at the same time.  The medications do not cause birth defects and are out of your system by the time you actually get pregnant. However,  unless you have already tried milder ovulation induction medications (not injections) that failed in the past, I caution against the use of Letrozole as women with PCOS frequently conceive multiple eggs at the same time and twins or even higher order multiple pregnancies are possible.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and I wish you the best in conceiving a healthy pregnancy.

I m trying to decide whether or not I need to bring this issue to his attention and whether or not I need to worry. I m already feeling incredibly nauseous, though I have only thrown up once so far. I am also experiencing breast tenderness and fatigue. I know these are all three symptoms of pregnancy so I figured I should ask someone instead of just doing the generic web search. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Even though there is sperm present in pre-ejaculate, it is at a fraction of the amount that is present in the vagina after ejaculation.  Therefore withdrawal does work as a contraceptive about 75 to 80% of the time.  However, there is definitely a possibility of pregnancy if you had sex around your ovulation time, which if in your case occurs during your menstrual period.However, it takes a few weeks after conception for fertilized embryo to produce any level of hormone that would be high enough to produce pregnancy symptoms.  Pregnancy symptoms vary greatly between women, and many of the symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy like nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, spotting, or mood changes can take place with PMS or other hormone irregularities as well as pregnancy. The stress of worrying about getting pregnant can also make women more acutely aware of the hormonal symptoms. Modern pregnancy tests are extremely accurate and will become positive within 10 days to two weeks after conception, so if enough time has gone by,  I would recommend you perform a urine pregnancy test with your first morning sample according to the package directions.In the meantime, to summarize, no one can diagnose pregnancy based on physical symptoms. There is a possibility of pregnancy when you use withdrawal for contraception, however it is effective about 80% of the time. The most common sign of pregnancy is missing your period, so until that happens, I would try to avoid worrying too much.I wish you the best of luck in your situation.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi im 22years I have misscarrage my fist baby so doct gave me to take fertomid 4th aug 9 aug for daily to take two tablts bt first 2day I have forget to eat 2tablts only one I have eat for 2days after that I eat daily 2tablts is it is problms to get preg","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Fertomid is a type of fertility medication used help to cause ovulation in women who have trouble getting pregnant.Because you did get pregnant (even though you had a miscarriage), unless you have been trying since then for over a year and been unable to conceive, the Fertomid medication will not likely increase your chance of pregnancy significantly.Therefore, even if you forgot to take some of the pills, you still have a significant chance of pregnancy as you are still very young, especially if you have regular menstrual cycles.If you and your husband have not been trying to conceive for more than a year on your own, I would not recommend using any fertility medication.  Using Fertomid for more than four menstrual cycles can actually reduce your risk of pregnancy, as it decreases the effect of estrogen on your uterine lining. 80% of healthy couples will conceive within one year if they are having regular (at least 2 to 3 days per week) intercourse without contraception. One in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage, which means that 90% of the time couples will conceive a perfectly healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage without any form of medical treatment.So in summary, missing the Fertomid tablets this particular month will not likely affect your chance of conceiving this cycle if you already ovulate naturally.  I strongly recommend trying to get pregnant naturally for one year before using any type of fertility medication, as your body has proven that you can conceive even though that pregnancy did not work out.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this additional information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I have had the implanon in my arm and it has expired, its expiration was in February. But due to no insurance and keeping a busy schedule I havent had the time nor money to have it removed. I was just wondering if I can get pregnant now? I feel as if I am, but the test come out negative. Im also worried I might become infertile. Help?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Even though there is an expiration date on the Implanon, for medical safety and medications are devices that expire still have some function in them beyond the expiration date. So there is a very strong possibility that if you are not menstruating your Implanon is actually still providing contraception.Furthermore, the side effects of the Implanon can be similar to pregnancy, as the hormone in the Implanon in certain ways tricks your body to thinking that your pregnant in order to provide contraception.So at this time, it is most likely the your Implanon is still preventing pregnancy. Eventually, the usual way you will find out that the Implanon has worn off is that your menstrual period will begin again. However, if you strongly do not desire pregnancy I suggest you use a backup method of contraception just in case.There is no reason to believe that you are infertile while you on birth control. Until the birth control is completely out of your system, there is no way to know about whether or not you can conceive. If you are otherwise healthy and under the age of 35 and at regular menstrual cycles before you got the implant, there is no reason to suspect that you would have problems with fertility once the birth control is out of your system.  The rod should be removed when you can, as the device was not tested for integrity in your arm much beyond the expiration date.  In the United States, Planned Parenthood offers low-cost and free birth control management and would be a good place to investigate for removal of your Implanon at an affordable rate.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi. I am female of 25 years old. I have been married past 1 and half years. We were in planning stage. But since from two months we are trying for a baby. Last month we tried intercourse regularly that is i between 10 th day to 20th day. As We were knowing that ovulation occurs in between 12 to 16th day. During intercourse all the semen completely ejected into vagina. After sometime means after a hour it starts spilling out. We were in a hope that this month we can get a positive results but it was in a vain. And also the peneteration was medium. Let me know what is the reason of not getting conceive?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.In normal healthy couples, it can sometimes even take up to a year to conceive. 80% of couples will conceive within one year if having regular unprotected intercourse (at least 2 to 3 days per week). It is best not to time the efforts of intercourse around ovulation unless you have accurately documented the ovulation date, with an ovulation predictor kit or with hormone levels checked at the doctors office.The best way to try to conceive in the beginning is to have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. Premenstrual symptoms are caused by the same hormones as produced by pregnancy, so when you start to feel bloating, breast tenderness, nausea, or other pregnancy symptoms you do not need to continue to try to conceive that cycle, as you either already ovulated or are already pregnant.There are nearly 6 million sperm in every ejaculate from a man, so as long as some of the sperm is ejaculated inside the vagina, there is a possibility of conceiving. Many women have sperm leak out after intercourse, however the ability of sperm to swim within the vagina ensures that a man with a normal sperm count has at least thousands of sperm that reach the egg if ovulation has been taking place.So in summary, many couples do not conceive within two months of beginning to try. I encourage you and your husband to have patience. In the meantime, the best way to prepare for healthy pregnancy is to get adequate rest, eat a healthy diet, avoid alcohol consumption, and take a prenatal vitamin or folic acid supplement which can help prevent birth defects.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello, I started my period on June 4th and ended on the 8th and I had sex with one guy that night.

So the changing of your due date by four days does not really change the possibility of your first partner having been the father of your baby. Furthermore, sperm can remain alive in your genital tract for up to five days, and once you ovulate, the egg remains alive inside you for up to 72 hours. This is the reason that no test can accurately assess the date of conception based on the exact dates that you had intercourse.  Women typically ovulate two weeks before their period arrives.  If you have a 28 day cycle, and your last period started on June 4, you likely ovulated around June 18. So either of the men you had sex with between the 15th and approximately the 20th could be the father of your baby.I hope that this information was helpful to you and that I was able to adequately answer your question even though it is not possible with medical science to determine the paternity of your pregnancy. I wish you the best of luck with your pregnancy and good health.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi m 22 year old and my gal frnd is 18 ven went to a resort last week n booked a room v r wr cuddling each other n I was on track pant wit no inner wear n she was was just wit her inner wear I rubbed my penis on her vagina n I ejuculated on her inner wr n thighs m worried she might get pregnent plz help","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Contrary to some common beliefs, a woman cannot get pregnant from transfer of semen from or through clothing. Semen dies when exposed to air, and the porousness of fabric would absorb the protective fluid for the sperm to swim up the vagina. In order for a women to get pregnant without penetration, there must be ejacultion right at or inside the vaginal opening, and it must mix with vaginal fluid. So in your case you do not have to worry about your girlfriend having gotten pregnant. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was reassuring.

Trigestrel is a form of birth control pill that is taken in normal women to prevent pregnancy. In women who do not get menstrual cycles, it will cause you to have regular period that you will not be fertile at any time during the pill cycle.Birth control pills are sometimes prescribed to women who do not get menstrual cycles on their own to reduce their circulating levels of other hormones that can interfere with fertility.  For example, circulating elevated male hormones are sometimes present in women who do not ovulate consistently.  The birth control pills temporarily reduce the level of these male hormones, so that when you stop them your body's normal cycles may return.So again to clarify, you will not conceive while taking the Trigestrel pills.  After taking them and having regular cycles for two or three months, most doctors would have you discontinue them and either give you fertility medications or wait and see whether your own cycle resumes without the pills.I hope that this information clarifies the reason why you're on Trigestrel and the fact that there are no fertile days while you were taking the medication. Speaking with your doctor about the plan of what to do after you are no longer on the medication may clarify the situation better for you.I wish you the best of luck in conceiving,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello there. Me and my boyfriend had never had sexual intercourse. In other case, we are still virgins. When I last saw him, we rubbed our parts on each other but he didn t cum in me. I had my period that day and it was my first day so I wasn t really bleeding much. Or I was about to start because I had brown discharge. My period was really really light. It only lasted 2/3 days. What does that mean ? Can I be pregnant for this? I am concerned right now. What made my period stop? Was it that or it just happened cause it s normal? I think I should be fine but I just want to make sure ? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, I want to clarify, if you are virgin and have not had sexual intercourse or ejaculation directly in the opening of your vagina, your chance of pregnancy is really nonexistent.  Sperm die when exposed to air, so there is no way that you can become pregnant from sperm that ejaculated outside the vagina.Furthermore,  is very uncommon to find women who ovulate during their menstrual cycle. Therefore, you were most likely not at the fertile time of your cycle when you and your boyfriend had genital contact.Furthermore, irregular bleeding can be caused by travel, changes in weight, hormonal imbalances and stress, especially the stress of worrying about getting pregnant. Just because your period was light this month does not mean that there was anything wrong. No women's menstrual cycle is exactly the same every month, and as long as you got a period at the usual time, there is no reason to suspect pregnancy if the bleeding was different in quality than what you usually see.So I think that it is fine to be reassured that you did not conceive from this encounter with your boyfriend.  If you continue to have irregular menstrual cycles for more than three months, you may want to visit your local physician as some hormonal imbalances can cause these problems and should be tested for.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi. Actually i had sex with my bf on the last day of my period and he did it inside, but to be on a safer side i took the pill. And got my periods again after 4 days but don t knw i feel hungry a lot and a lil bit tummy pain and it s almost 15 days now. So should i get my tests done?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, it is extremely uncommon to be fertile during your menstrual cycle. The hormonal drop the causes you to get your monthly period is inconsistent with ovulation, so unless you have very short menstrual cycles (less than 23 days) it is unlikely the you would actually have ovulated during your period.The morning after pill is extremely effective in preventing pregnancy if taken within the first 72 hours after an unprotected encounter.  The morning-after pill works by thickening the mucus of the cervix and uterus to help to prevent fertilization. If the medication works, it usually triggers a small amount of bleeding like a period 3-7 days later. Therefore, the fact that you already have bleeding is a sign that the medication worked and that you did not conceive.Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea, appetite changes, bloating, abdominal pain, mood changes and breast tenderness can occur as side effects of taking hormones or of an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy.Therefore, there really is no reason to worry at this point that you are pregnant.  Is normal to have your period be late after you've taken the morning-after pill, as you already had some bleeding this cycle, however taking a pregnancy test at that time (when you are late) would not be unreasonable. If that test is negative, then you can be re-sure that you are not pregnant and do not need to retest even if that menstrual cycle comes late.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"My gf and I had unprotected sex during her period. I produced a little bit of sperm in her on Friday and she got off of her period on the following Sunday. Can she still be pregnant 2 days later after she got off of her period? Please help . Can we get the Morning after pill still ?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, it is extremely unusual for women to ovulate during her menstrual cycle.  The normal drop in hormones that triggers a woman to get her period is not compatible with ovulation, so generally if a woman is bleeding or within the first seven days of the start of her period, she is not fertile at that time.If you and your girlfriend are still anxious, taking the morning-after pill is still an option. The pill is most effective when taken within the first 72 hours (three days) after your unprotected encounter, but it still can help to prevent pregnancy even when taken up to a week later.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hello! i have had unprotected sex with my boyfriend on the last day of my ovulation(most fertile). we used the \\"pull out\\" method the 1st 2 times and the third time he ejaculation in me.  i this has also been the 1st time out of the month that we have had intercourse.

I don t start my period for another 2 days and will test again. My areolas are darkening and getting bigger, and breasts are very very sore. More sore than how they get before I start. I have a couple prego signs but nothing major yet. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If you have not yet missed your period, even if you are pregnant, the line will appear very faint on the pregnancy test as your hormone levels are extremely low at this time in pregnancy.  So there is no reason to assume that the test was wrong as the greatest likelihood is that you are actually pregnant.However, women can have a situation where they have a positive pregnancy test and then get their normal period on time. This is known as a chemical pregnancy and is caused by the situation where the egg is fertilized but never implants into the uterus and continues to grow. So I encourage patients in general to try to avoid performing pregnancy test before they actually miss their period, as even though you have a positive pregnancy test this early, it does not guarantee that the pregnancy is going to take.  If your cycle is late, there is no reason to assume that there is any problem with the pregnancy.If you do retest after you miss your period and the line is still very weekly positive, it may be reasonable to see a physician and get a blood test for the level of your pregnancy hormone.  Pregnancy hormone levels are supposed to double every 48 hours so by the time you miss your period the levels should be significantly high enough to produce a clear double line on the pregnancy test especially if you perform it with your first morning urine as recommended.  Low hormone levels in early pregnancy can indicate that the pregnancy is not developing properly or that it can be an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, which needs to be diagnosed and accurately managed by a physician.In the meantime however, I encourage you to stop drinking alcohol, eat a balanced diet, begin taking prenatal vitamins and get enough sleep as a greatest likelihood is that you are pregnant with a very early normal pregnancy.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes and good luck with the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I WENT TO THE DR ON TUEDSAY OF THIS WEEK.

MY QUESTION IS, WHEN SHOULD I HAVE HAC INTERCOURSE TO CONCEIVE?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.From the time you receive an hCG trigger shot, your body has been trigger to ovulate. Therefore, you should start immediately after hCG injection having intercourse daily for three days and spacing out to every other day for seven days.If your period is late, you should perform pregnancy test or see your doctor for a pregnancy test.If you produced two follicles this month and you do not conceive,  your doctor should keep you at the current dose next month, as developing follicles over 2 cm in size should result in ovulation.It is always best when going through fertility treatment to have regular intercourse just in case spontaneous ovulation occurs without the hCG trigger shot.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and I hope that you're tempted pregnancy are successful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I have had my tubes tied for a yr and 3 most but today I have been having servere abdominal pain that goes to my back and puts me into tears and lots of cramping and got sick outta no where and had my period a few days ago and now I m having g light pink spotting. What should I do I need answers and idk if I am possibly pregnant. Plz help me","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, if you were sterilized, there is no reason to suspect that any symptoms you may be experiencing are caused by pregnancy. Fewer than one in 10,000 women will get pregnant after tubal ligation in their lifetime. The most common sign of pregnancy is missing your menstrual period.  If you got your period on time and it was normal for you, there is no reason to suspect that you are pregnant.Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the symptoms that we commonly associate with pregnancy like bloating, breast tenderness, spotting, mood changes, and nausea can be caused by hormonal fluctuations as well as pregnancy.However, in women who do get pregnant after having a tubal ligation, there is a high risk of the pregnancy actually occurring within the fallopian tube, called an ectopic pregnancy. If you do find out that you are pregnant after tubal ligation, it is important to seek medical care right away, as an ectopic pregnancy can be an emergency requiring surgery for treatment.Having severe abdominal pain is not normal even if you are not pregnant. For example, appendicitis can cause severe abdominal pain and nausea and kidney infections can also cause abdominal and back pain.  Any woman can have spotting when the body is under stress from other illnesses.I do recommend that in your situation that you should seek medical care urgently for an evaluation. Even though it is unlikely, performing a pregnancy test may be a good idea because if you are pregnant, you should be seen in an emergency room to make sure that your symptoms are not caused by an ectopic pregnancy. It may be prudent for you to go to an emergency room anyway, as other severe illnesses that require hospitalization, such as appendicitis and kidney infections can also be causing symptoms such as yours.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and I hope you seek medical care promptly and get an accurate diagnosis of your symptoms.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Today I had some light pink vaginal discharge. I ve never had that before. Before my periods I just get light bleeding in clear discharge. This was kinda thick and pink. My periods are irregular and I use a diaphragm or condoms when having sex. I ve only ever been with my husband. Does that sound like a sign a of pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, if you have been using contraception (even a barrier method) every time you have sex, your chance of pregnancy is extremely low no matter what your symptoms are.Secondly, having occasional abnormal vaginal discharge is more likely a symptom of a vaginal infection than pregnancy.  Slight bleeding can be caused if the vaginal canal is very irritated, and if your discharge is thick, there is a possibility you may have a vaginal yeast infection that is causing inflammation in the vagina.Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, but the most common sign of pregnancy is missing your period.  Nausea, fatigue, bloating, breast tenderness and mood changes are some other symptoms that are commonly associated with pregnancy, however all these can also be caused by irregular hormone production.So if your period is not late, I strongly believe that your symptoms are likely due to an infection in your vagina rather than pregnancy symptoms.  I recommend evaluation by a gynecologist or your women's health provider to examine your vagina and determine the cause of the discharge.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi!

Is there a chance that I can get pregnant? My last period was on 24th July and we did it on the last day of my period. The periods last for 6-7 days and I usually get them a week earlier so my next period should be 17th august.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Is extremely unusual for women to conceive without having intercourse because semen dies when exposed to air.  However, if there were any drops a semen that were directly connected by liquid to your vaginal fluid, there is a possibility that the sperm could swim into your vagina theoretically putting you at risk for pregnancy.In addition, it is unusual for women to ovulate before day seven of their menstrual cycle.  Most women ovulate about two weeks before their period starts, so counting backwards, you probably ovulate around the 10th to the 12th of the month, so you did not have sex during a time where ovulation typically takes place.So in summary, you are theoretical risk for pregnancy, however the actual likelihood giving your situation is extremely low. I would not worry about conceiving in the situation, however if your menstrual cycle is late this month, I would confirm with an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test to make sure your results are negative.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"i dont remember having a period at all last month.

From your side you can plan a safe weight program for yourself including healthy diet and regular exercise. This will increase your chance of getting pregnant. Have unprotected sex regularly especially 4 days before and 4days after the day of ovulation. The day the follicle ruptures is known as the day of ovulation. The egg or the ovum can be fertilised for 72 hours after ovulation and the sperm can fertilise upto 24 hours after ejaculation and mainly 1st 6 hours. Therefore it is important to have regular unprotected sex for conseceutive 3 days after the follicular study shows rupture to increase the chances of fertilisation.

Mostly it alternates if right ovulates in this menstrual cycle then mostly left ovulates in the next menstrual cycle and then right in next cycle and usually this follows. But it depends on individual basis in some cases only left ovulates conseceutively for few cycles and then right ovulates and in very few cases both ovaries ovulate in the same cycle. In one ovary many follicles are formed but only one attains the maximum size and ovulates and other follicles regresses. Size of follicles increase from 1 st day of cycle and gradually increases upto day of ovulation and after ovulation regresses. Ovulation occurs 14days prior to the start of next mentruations if cycle is regular. Having sex 4 days before and 4 days after ovulation regularly has maximum chances of fertilisation and getting pregnant."},{"Patient":"Hi!

Could you let me know the results could be favorable for me to conceive? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hello, your endometrium thickness and the follicular size is favourable for conceiving but size of endometrial polyps is of concern. If they are of very small size then they might regresses themselves and you can go for follicular study and then have sex regularly for 3 days after your ovulation has occurred for successful pregnancy. But if the endometrial polyps are of larger size, constant in size or increasing in size then you need to meet your gynaecologist for the treatment. In my opinion if endometrial polyp are incresing in size then proper treatment should be done for them first and then go for follicular study and pregnancy. Endometrial polyps may be a premalignant condition for endometrium cancer if it shows hyperplasia with atypia. If on biopsy tissue is of normal histology then thete is no problem polyp itself is a benign condition with both medical and surgical options of treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi me and my fiance have been trying to get pregnant for a year and 4 months. I don't know if that's normal. He says that he's ok, but I think the problem is on me because I don't have regular cycles I get them 2 times a month.. any help on how to get pregnant would be great..","Doctor":"Hello, having periods twice a month means shorter menstrual cycle of less than 20 days duration. The normal range of menstrual cycle is 21-35days. You are having polymenorrhoea which depending upon your symptoms and other health problems should be treated otherwise you'll become anemic and weak. Meet your gynaecologist and get blood tests for hemoglobin and transvaginal ultrasound and other investigations done as per requirement to rule out the causes of polymenorrhoea. Get proper treatment for the cause and regularise and normalise your menstrual cycle. It is possible to get pregnant with irregular period by maintaining menstrual calender and having sex regularly from 4 days before and 4days after day of ovulation. The day of ovulation can be calculated by substracting 14 from the date of the starting of the next menstrual cycle if you can predict it by maintaining menstrual calender. Having regular intercourse for 16months with unsuccessful results is not normal and the reason of being unsuccessful at conceiving should be found out and treated. Usually pregnancy occurs in 12months of regular unprotected intercourse. Both partners should cooperate. The male partner should have his seminal fluid analysis should be done."},{"Patient":"I have been taking Novelon tablets for over 4 years now as I have PCOD.

Both me and my partener have thalassemia B trait.. i have heard that this is dangerous for when i want to stay pregnant. Can you please explain to me what exactly the dangers are and what is the procedure i ll have to go through in order to have a healthy child.","Doctor":"Hello, Beta Thalassemia is an autosomal reccessive genetic disorder which can occur in 3 forms major, intermediate and minor. Beta Thalassemia minor is the Beta Thalassemia trait in which the patient is just a carrier of the genetic muted gene and lives almost a normal life. For both couple having this trait then there are25% chances that the baby will be normal, 50% chances of having Beta Thalassemia trait like parents and 25% chances of having Beta Thalassemia major which is a serious condition requiring regular blood transfusions. As in your case you can plan pregancy keeping few basic things in mind. Get routine blood tests done to know your hemoglobin and iron levels. During pregancy take daily 5mg folic acid tablet throughout pregancy to reduce the chances of having neural tube defects like spine bifida in your baby as beta Thalassemia increases the chance of neural tube defects in the baby. Mother should be healthy all throughout as her body is already under stress due to her disease plus pregnancy adds more stress to different organs for the developing fetus. Between 11-14weeks of pregancy chorionic villus sampling should be done to know the exact karyotype of the fetus. This test should not be done before 10 weeks as too early a test leads to facial and limb defects in the baby. So have patience. Don't be in a hurry. If the karyotype of the fetus shows minor or intermediate continue pregnancy but if major is present then think of abortion and plan next pregnancy. For the delivery be careful and talk to your obstetrician regarding safe delivery, normal or caeserian."},{"Patient":"what are my chances for the pregnancy after my follicular study?

There are very good chances of you getting pregnant as ovum can be fertilised 72-96 hours after ovulation. Sperm is active for 24hours after ejaculation.

The test was negative so delay could be due to what reasons, may be PCODs. As i was diagnosed with PCOD before my first delivery but i conceived normally without any medications. So negative UPT means for sure that I am not pregnant.

Have patience you have left ocp just a month ago. Your body needs time to adjust its proper hormone levels for fertility. Well controlled hypothyroidism and treated PCOD do not cause any problem in conceiving. Moreover first normal delivery without medication is a very good sign for next successful pregancy. If you are overweight for your age and height then in the meanwhile you can join a gym for 6months to reduce weight."},{"Patient":"I have recently changed from a combined OCP (brevinor) to a mini pill (noriday), am currently onto my third consecutive cycle since starting with no period or spotting at all, I ve taken two pregnancy tests and both were negative.

The most common side effect of minipill is irregular vaginal bleeding. Many do have delay in menstrual cycle.

If you had regular cycles then ovulation takes place 14days prior to the start if next menstruations. 4 days before and 4days after ovulation is the unsafe period in which couples should avoid having intercourse. If you have a regular cycle of 30days then you had sex in safe period plus you took postinor 2 within 24 hours which means very less chance of getting pregnant.

There was no ejaculation before the condom was put on, it was not until after the condom was used that I ejaculated. I ve read articles about pre - ejaculation and with that being said I had not ejaculated for an estimated 24-48 hrs prior to the incident and had urinated multiple times within that 24-48 hrs. After ejaculation into the condom I checked to be sure that it was intact by sliding it in between fingers from base to tip once I had removed it. I appeared fully intact with no leaks. So my actual questions is do you think that the chance of pregnancy is very low/very minimal with all the factors mentioned above?

It will come back within 4-6 months after the body has adjusted its hormone levels. Implanon is a hormone based contraceptive which is effective only for 3years. You can get pregnant with expired implanon as the hormone it was releasing is finished and your status is you are using no contraceptive at present so there are chances of conceiving without periods similar to conceiving in lactational amenorhoea.

Menstrual history pre sex is important to determine the safe period and the unsafe period. In case of regular menstrual cycles ovulation takes place 14 days prior to the start of next menstrual bleeding. 4 days before and 4 days after the ovulation day is known as the unsafe period which means if couple have sex in this period then there is maximum chances of getting pregnant. The left over days are in the safe period. If your girlfriend was having regular periods then there are less chances of her getting pregnant. But if she was having irregular menstrual cycles then there are chances of her getting pregnant depending on the length of the shortest and the longest menstrual cycle. Sperms may be present even in the pre ejaculatory fluid and average time of sperms to reach site of fertilisation is 30 minutes. Sperms can ascend into the vagina even without actual penetration."},{"Patient":"hello i had we have been trying to have another child for almost two years. i recently had blood work down and found out i i have hypothyroidism and my lh is 19.7 and my fsh is 7.3 what does this mean if we want another?

Well controlled hypothyroidism does not cause complication related to pregnancy. But if TSH levels are increased and the patient wants to get pregnant then she should meet her physician who will increase her levothyroxine dose according to the patients weight and other comorbidities. Pregnancy should be planned only after reaching normal TSH levels as thyroid hormones have a major role to play in fetal brain development. Uncontrolled hypothyroidism do cause abortions and other complications in pregnancy. Weight reduction is very useful getting normal TSH levels. As per LH and FSH hormones are concerned, they are in the normal range so no need to worry. Normally if FSH level is greater than 10-15 then it indicates diminished fertility, poor egg health or low ovarian reserve. Normally LH level is 1.9-12.5 in follicular phase of menstrual cycle, 8.7-76.3 at the peak of cycle and 0.5-16.9 in luteal phase of menstrual cycle."},{"Patient":"Hlo doctor on the date of 8 of this month there was intercourse between me nd my fioencee it was unprotected nd 1 day after periods so I take ipill nd bleeding occur 6 day for 2 day which is not continues like period nd yesterday there was again unprotected sex nd They leave something inside so I got worried and take ipill Plzzz help me to guide about this","Doctor":"Hello dearI understand your concernYou have did sex 1 day after the period.

So you cannot attribute your cramping tom pregnancy. Pull out method is not a reliable and safe method of contraception. Before ejaculation of the sperms, pre-seminal secretions (precum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Precum does contain some sperms which can impregnate the woman. The earliest test you can perform for detection of pregnancy is Beta hCG test on your blood. This test gives reliable results 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse. Values more than 25 mIU/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy while in nonpregnant state, the values remain under 5 mIU/ml. Alternatively, you may wait for the menses to appear. If you get your menses, you are not pregnant. If you miss periods, perform pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier these tests may report false negative. I hope this helps you today.

More information: Last night me and my partner had unprotected sex for the first time ever, we normally use condoms but they were unavailable & I am not on birth control, nor have ever been due to my religious beliefs. He did take his penis out of my vagina, at least 5-8 seconds, before he ejaculated. I am sure of this because it took a few seconds then he ejaculated. We later had sex again in the morning. He did urinate between encounters. I researched online, and I am getting many conflicting opinions. I need a medical experts opinion. Please help and get back to me at your earliest convenience. thank you so much!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, You seem to be under tremendous stress due to fear of unwanted pregnancy. Pull out method is not a reliable method of contraception. As you have already mentioned, pre-ejaculation secretions (precum) could have been deposited in your vagina. Precum does contain some sperms which are capable of causing pregnancy. Precum comes out of penis without any sensations and feelings; hence man does not know that he has deposited precum in the vagina. Now instead of being so stressed out, please try to find out any evidence for the existence of pregnancy. For this, you have following options: 1. Opt for Beta hCG test on your blood any time 10 days after the last incidence of unprotected sex. 2. Alternatively, wait for the menses to appear. If you get periods, you are not pregnant. If you miss the periods, then perform pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier these tests may report false negative results.

Reply Forward","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Missing a period is the first cardinal symptom of early pregnancy. When you have not missed your period, nausea in the morning may de due to increased acidity or stress of not becoming pregnant. Some antacid will give you relief. The  very fact that you had a miscarriage once means that you were pregnant. Thus you have proved your capacity to be pregnant once. Hence, your eggs must be forming regularly and your husband should be having good quality semen. The only question is whether you contacted any minor infection during the miscarriage which had resulted in tubal blockage. Please get hysterosalpingography done to find the evidence of tubal patency. If the tubes are blocked, you may require surgical intervention for reopening the tubes. If the tubes are patent, please monitor egg release (ovulation) by ultrasonography from day 9 of the cycle. On and around the day of ovulation, try to have sexual relations maximum times. You can give such fair trial for at least three months. If still it fails to  make you pregnant, please report to Infertility specialist for further investigations and treatment. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have few questions. 1. My Doctor gave ChromiNAC-A tablets and Harmoni - F tablets. These two are for what? 2.

Is there any medical facility like taking his sperm and injecting to my body ?. Details: age:30 Period cycle:34 thanks,","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, ChromiNAC-A is a medicine which can be used is cases of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. In PCOS, levels of insulin are raised due to insulin resistance. These tablets reduce the insulin resistance. Harmoni F Tablet contains Cyproterone, Ethinylestradiol, and Folic Acid as active ingredients. They may be useful in controlling the raised levels of male sex homones in PCOS. Also they will help in building up the uterine lining. However, these pills will have to be down regulated before you undergo IUI. If you are releasing eggs (ovulation) regularly, and if the tubes are patent, you can conceive by a procedure called as Intrauterine Sperm Instillation (IUI). Monitor your ovulation by ultrasonography. On the day of ovulation, your husband's collected and processed sperms can be instilled in your uterus. This can make you pregnant. I hope this helps you.

You are indeed not sure whether he had his finger soiled with semen. So the possibility of pregnancy is very remote.The first cardinal symptom of pregnancy is missing a period. If your menses are still awaited, wait for them to appear. If you get the menses, you are not pregnant. If you miss your periods, then perform pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample a week after missing the period; earlier the test may report false negative results.

There are several reasons for a person to not conceive. Few reasons for infertility are tubal blockage, hormonal imbalance, PCOS, decreased follicles, cervical factors etc.2) All these things cannot be detected by a pelvic ultrasound. Since you have small eggs, chances are high of you having hormonal imbalance. That has to be evaluated. You need to get your blood tests done like FSH, LH, AMH, testosterone, oestradiol, TSH, insulin etc.3) You might also need to get a tubal patency test like HSG done.4) If everything is normal, you might be asked to increase the dose of siphene or add injections.5) Do not lose hope, you will conceive with proper treatment.I hope this was helpful and I wish you best of luck.Regards,Dr. Shikha Shah"},{"Patient":"May 2-3 bleeding due to early miscarriage,, yhen we had sex right after bleeding stop,, and had period on may 28-30 but watery,,,and then the following month o june had period but not heavy as normal,after 1 week i had a small amount of spotting brown and pinkish but and then this july i don get myvperiod only brownish and pinkish spotting,,and i had dull lower abdominalnpain,, am i pregnant or something is wrong,, hope to et reply,thanks,,,","Doctor":"Hi there, After going through your question, I am of the opinion that:1) Sometimes, brown spotting could be due to retained products of conception. Also, after a miscarriage, sometimes there could be chances of a molar pregnancy too. There are chances of you having a normal pregnancy too if there is history of unprotected sexual intercourse.2) My suggestion is that you get a pelvic ultrasound done just to rule out any pathology in the uterus.3) If you cannot go for it right now, you can get a urine pregnancy test or a blood test called serum beta HCG. 4) It is better to get the blood test done as it could help in further managemet too.I hope this was helpful.Regards,Dr. Shikha Shah"},{"Patient":"i am 42 years old and only have a daughter who is currently eight years old.

Three days ago i was advised to use fertility pills which i should finish by saturday, and then proceed to using ovacare, kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hi there,After going through your question, I am of the opinion that:1) Fibroids do cause infertility, especially as age increases as well as size of fibroids increases.2) The reason that fibroids cause infertility are: a) They distort the uterine cavity and prevent implantation. b) Hormonal changes are caused which can prevent ovulation. c) Sometimes, they obstruct sperm transport and fertilisation. d) They can cause miscarriages due to poor placentation.3) My suggestion is that you keep trying to conceive, but in case the pills do not work, you might need to get your fibroids removed by myomectomy and then plan for pregnancy.4) As it is, your age is also a factor in reduced fertility. As we grow older, our follicles reduce and there are a lot of hormonal changes too. A woman of 34 and of 42 are completely different. you should get evaluated for your hormonal profile too with tests like FSH, LH, AMH, sr. testosterone and oestradiol, TSH, T3, T4 and blood sugar and sr. insulin.I wish you all the best.Regards,Dr Shikha Shah"},{"Patient":"hey, can any online Gyn tell me what are the chances of getting pregnant after i was given a ZyHcg 5000 iu injection? i am a pcos patient . i did take some medicines. and the egg was fertiled and i was given this injection to release the egg. so may i know what are the chances of me getting pregnant.","Doctor":"Hi..

I took it this month and started intercourse on the 9th day according to my Dr and fertility calculator. We had sex for 3 consecutive days. Should we have proceeded after the 3rd day and how exactly should I be taking the pill if I m not pregnant ?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Fertomid pills are the tablets of Clomiphene citrate. I would have appreciated had you taken some more scientific steps as described below:1. From day 9 onwards, subject yourself for the ovulation monitoring by ultrasonography. Usually the egg is released when the follicle attains the size of 18 mm to 21 mm. So you can plan your sexual relations accordingly. Ultrasonography also will provide an evidence of egg release. 2. Some prefer to give Inj. hCG when the follicle is matured to have guaranteed and planned egg release. So from a couple of days before that to few days after injection, sexual contacts are advisable. 3. Clomiphene citrate should not be taken for more than 6 cycles. If it does not result into pregnancy, you may have to change over to HMG/hCG combination for induction of ovulation. If all these fail, you may have to go for Artificial Reproductory Technique. I hope this provides you brief and still apt guidelines. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"i was on depro birth control shot for at least 7-9 years not consistenly though. I had two early abortions and i didn t need any d&c. i been of the shot for a year now and have been trying to concieve. do you think i will ever concieve a child ? Or should i wait a bit longer i am 33yrs old","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Since you have been pregnant before, there is no reason to expect that you should not be able to conceive spontaneously after going off the Depo Provera.  The fact that you terminated your pregnancies does not have any long term effects on your ability to conceive, and Depo, once it is out of your system, does not have any bearing on your fertility or ability to have a healthy child.  Certainly there is no reason to delay trying to get pregnant if that is what you and your partner desire.However, sometimes it can take 6 months to even a year after stopping Depo for your ovulation to return consistently, so if you do not conceive easily right away, there is no reason to be concerned.

I tested this morning, but came out negative. Did i test too early since it’s only been 2 weeks since the unprotected sex? Should I test again and if yes then when? Is there a real chance that i’m pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.It is normal to have bleeding 3 or 4 days after stopping birth control pills (which is why you have your \\"period\\" during the pill-free week).  In addition, it is common to have an irregular or delayed period after stopping the pill as well.It is unlikely you would have ovulated in only 3 days after stopping the pill, so your chance of pregnancy from that encounter is very low.  Also- pregnancy symptoms vary greatly between women and many of the symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy like bloating, breast tenderness, appetite changes and irregular bleeding can happen from an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy.Modern pregnancy tests are extremely accurate and will be positive by two weeks from an unprotected encounter.  Your test was likely accurate, but retesting in a week would provide extra reassurance.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"My husband and I are TTC.

These pills have to be down regulated  and the medicine for induction of ovulation needs to be started. After down regulating Krimson pills, you should take initially Clomiphene citrate which will bring about the egg release. This can be ascertained by ultrasonography ovulation  monitoring. If within 6 cycles this medicines fails to give you pregnancy, you have to switch over to hCG/HMG combination. In PCOS, along with failure of egg release, the levels of Insulin and male hormone also increase. Metformin helps to reduce insulin levels while Myo inositol reduces the levels of both insulin and male hormones. If either or both these medicines are given with Clomiphene citrate, the results are better. APCOD contains Myo inositol, Methyl folate and Vit. D3. It will help the medicines for ovulation. Per se APCOD cannot bring about the ovulation. Along with these medicines, please take care to maintain your BMI under 23.9.Please report to an Infertility consultant for appropriate medication. The medicines which you are taking now without the medicines for ovulation induction cannot make you pregnant. I hope this provides you guidelines for further steps.

Is there any way I can know for sure whether I m pregnant or not,also is it advisable for me to take a contraceptive pill like I Pill before 72 hours are completed ?","Doctor":"Hi there,My opinion after reading your question is that:1) After having unprotected intercourse, it is better to take an I-pill within 72 hours. This is to be done even if there was no ejaculation because pre-ejaculate also contains sperms.2) I do not know what treatment you are taking for PCOD, but if you are taking oral contraceptive pills like Yasmin or Yamini or Mala D or Duoluton-L, then you do not need to worry about taking I-pill. This can be determined by how you are taking the medicines. If you are taking 3 weeks of medicine followed by one week break, then they are most probably oral contraceptive pills.3) There is no way right now to find out if you are pregnant so soon, you will have to wait atleast for two weeks and then get a blood test called serum beta HCG. If you miss periods, you can get a urine pregnancy test done.4) So to sum it all, I think you should take an I-pill as soon as possible. Then you can wait for periods. If you get them, nothing to worry. If you do not, then get a urine pregnancy test done.I hope this was helpful.Regards,Dr. Shikha Shah"},{"Patient":"i'm taking ovofar my docter gave me dis and i got miscarriage in month of april i was pregnant for 2 months that time,now my docter said that she going to clean my tubes on 22 of dis month i'm taking dia tablts from 2 days is it good and i'll get pregnant after cleaning the tubes","Doctor":"first check ur thyroid level ...prolactin..and sugar level...y u got abortion...first find d cause n treat that...u should take 3 month gap for next conception"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 29 yrs old and have irregular spotting as in the spotting starts about a week or two before the actual bleeding.

It did not break, but was extra tight at the top and there seemed to be fluid near the base and so I was worried, but not even sure if the fluid was sperm. It just seemed more than usual. I m not even sure if a condom can leak from the bottom if it is on tight. My cycle is a 28 day cycle. Thanks. Corrine","Doctor":"Dear Corrine,When your menstrual cycle is of 28 days, day 9 of the cycle is just on the borderline of fertile window. Anyway, safe period is indeed not a very safe method of contraception. Moreover, the condom has leaked. Leaked out fluid does have sperms in it. So there are good possibilities of conception. Covering this intercourse with post coital emergency contraceptive would have been safer. Now you can confirm the pregnancy status by:1. Beta hCG test on the blood 10 days after this intercourse. 2. Wait for the menses. They appear, you are not pregnant. However, if you miss the period, perform pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier the test may report false negative results. If you are pregnant and this is unwanted pregnancy, you may terminate the pregnancy by medicines up to 9 weeks of gestation. I hope this clarifies your dilemma.

You seem to have some flue like infection along with dyspepsia. Even the bitterness in the mouth could be due to fever. Please report to your physician and get the treatment. Some analgesic antipyretic will help you. Also get your urine examined for any evidence of infection. If so, the doctor will prescribe you some antibiotics as well. However, before that you should ascertain the status of your pregnancy as some antibiotics may cause ill effects on the baby at this stage. Yes, 10 days delay in menses could be due to pregnancy. 10 days is a sufficient time for any pregnancy test to give reliable results. You may perform either pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample or you may opt for Beta hCG test on your blood anytime now onwards. I hope this helps you.

Last 2/3 days getting very light period? Not due until next week. Don t know this guy too long..as in couple mths... ? Roisin","Doctor":"Dear Roisin, Since during some sexual contacts, he did not use condom, the probability of pregnancy does exist. Though he had not ejaculated inside your vagina, deposition of pre-seminal fluid (precum) cannot be excluded. Precum does contain some sperms which are capable of fertilizing an ovum. Precum gets deposited without any sensation to a man. Please find out the evidence of your pregnant status by:1. Perform Beta hCG test on your blood 10 days after the last unprotected sex. 2. Alternatively, wait for your menses to appear. Light bleeding may not be a true menstruation. If you get good menses, you are not pregnant. If they are delayed for more than a week, perform pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample; earlier the test may report false negative results. If you are not sure whether you have missed period or not due to scanty bleeding, you may perform the test 3 weeks after the last unprotected sexual intercourse. I hope this will resolve your dilemma. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"hi, Really need help! Me and my hunsband tried to have baby for 4 months but not sucessful. Doctor said that my endometrial near ovulation is 6mm which is too thin. However my husband have colitis and need to take mesalazine which been stopped 7 month already in order to have a healthy baby, but seems like it is not good for him to stop taking it for his health. Thus, we have to have a baby as soon as possible so that he can continue to take mesalazine. Would you please let me know if 6mm endometrial near ovulation is to thin to have a baby? How I can thick my endometrial and have a healthy baby because in those days I find healthy is really important! You can have nothing but health! Thanks a lot for your help!","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, I want to reassure you that no matter what your endometrial measurement may be, 80% of couples will conceive within one year naturally. Couples are not diagnosed as infertile until you have been trying and been unable to become pregnant for over one year.Endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization.  The thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels. When couples are undergoing IVF, treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining. However, because you've been only trying to get pregnant for four months, your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived. Furthermore, unless your husband's sperm count has been shown to be decreased, Mesalazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive. Medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus, but not any medication taken by the father, because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm.  So unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal,  there is no medical reason why your husband needs to be off his medication for colitis in order for you and need to conceive successfully. I suggest that if he needs the medication for his health that he continue to take it. As for is maximizing your chance of healthy pregnancy, the best thing you can do is get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins, and tried to have regular(at least 2 to 3 days a week) unprotected intercourse from the time your menstrual period finishes until you begin to feel premenstrual symptoms.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and I wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hello i have a question i had unprotected intercourse a few weeks ago im not on birth control and my partner was not wearing a condom he used the pull out method, i have irregular periods and i got my perod on the 26th of may it only lasted 4 days it usually lasts a week, ive been having some cramping , i took a pregnancy test today and it came out negative should i take a blood test?","Doctor":"Hello dearI understand your concernThere is always chance of the pregnancy as you had unprotected sex and you are not on birth control pill.I would suggest again go for urine pregnancy test and or blood HCG if period will not come in next 7 days.If you will be pregnant and do not want pregnancy then still you can terminate the pregnancy by abortion pill under the advise of gynecologist.Hope this may help youContact HCM for further health queryBest regardsDr.Sagar"},{"Patient":"I had my last period July 7 .

In this condition, the eggs from the ovary are trapped within the ovary and they re not released; hence any cysts are formed. This leads to irregularly delayed heavy menses with infertility. This condition also is characterized by high insulin and high male  hormone levels. Due to this, there is obesity, hair on unwanted areas like face, chest, abdomen, legs, etc. Medicines like Metformin and/or Myo inositol help reduce the levels of these hormones.For achieving pregnancy in such cases, some medicines have to be given for releasing eggs from ovary (induction of ovulation). To  start with, usually Clomiphene citrate is used. This medicine can be used for maximum 6 cycles. If it fails to give desired results, HMG/hCG combination may be tried. Concomitant use of Metformin and/or Myo inositol give better results to Clomiphene citrate. Ovacet Tablet contains L-Methylfolate, Myo-Inositol, and Vitamin D3 as active ingredients. Therefore it helps achieving ovulation by Clomiphene citrate and usually does not have any ill side effects. However, this medicine should be given along with Clomiphene citrate. In addition to the medicines, please pay attention to her weight and BMI. Please maintain her BMI under 23.9. I am sure this will clarify your concepts about the treatment she is receiving and the ideal treatment for such condition.

Is the masturbation reason for my conceiving problem. I feel satisfied when I masturbate but at the same time I feel guilty.Is that I am doing something wrong?,Please help me.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Masturbation is self satisfying sexual urge and is not a guilty act at all. You should not feel guilty for this habit. Many women do masturbate in their life. If masturbation is not coming in way of your normal marital sexual contact, it should not have any adverse effect in achieving conception. Your problem seems to be with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). Please get well treated for PCOS from some competent Infertility specialist. Initially, you should take treatment with Clomiphene citrate in combination with Metformin and/or Myo inositol. This will help induction of ovulation required for conception. If it does not give desired results within 6 cycles, you may have to switch from Clomiphene to HMG/hCG combination for inducing ovulation. I hope this clarifies your doubts.

But now we want to take chance for baby. So can we plan for pregnancy now. My LMP is 6th August. How long effect of ipill ?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Since you have vomited out within half an hour of consuming I-pill, the pill should have been expelled out in the vomitus. So this pill will not give you any protection from the pregnancy. Of course, pregnancy also is not guaranteed; however, you had unprotected sexual contact around the day of ovulation and in the fertile period. So there are good chances of pregnancy. To find out whether you are pregnant or not; you have following options: 1. Perform Beta hCG test on your blood any time after 28th August. 2. Alternatively, wait for your menses to appear. If they appear, you are not pregnant. If they are delayed, wait for  a week and then perform pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample; earlier the test may report false negative results. Since the pill has been expelled out within half an hour of ingestion, it does not have any effect on the body as it was not absorbed at all. So there is no risk to the pregnancy if you are pregnant.

Both Ubiphen and Clomipure contain Clomiphene citrate while dubagest and Duphaston are Progestational medicines.  Clomiphene citrate is a medicine which induces the ovulation. Progestational medicine supports the pregnancy after conception. However, in PCOS, along with the menstrual and fertility problem, the insulin and male hormone levels are increased in the body and they may not give success to only Clomiphene. Addition of Metformin helps reducing insulin level and the success to Clomiphene may be better.  Myo inositol controls both insulin and male hormones levels and hence the results of Clomiphene are still better. Clomiphene should not be taken for more than 6 cycles; if it fails to cause pregnancy, ovulation induction may be tried with HMG/hCG combination. After the medicines for induction of ovulation, please monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography so that you can plan your sexual relations on and around the day of ovulation. Controlling weight is of prime importance in PCOS. You should maintain your BMI under 23.9. Diet control with high protein with low carbohydrates and low fats along with appropriate exercises will help you reduce the weight. I hope this helps you.

Flight attendants are even allowed to work until the third trimester.  So there is no reason you need to worry about your granddaughter flying while pregnant.However, pregnant women are more prone to getting blood clots in the legs when sitting for prolonged periods of time.  So your granddaughter needs to just make sure she stretches and gets up to walk around at least every few hours if she is on a long flight.The only places pregnant women are encouraged not to fly are areas that are at risk for Zika virus infection.  This includes most tropical islands and parts of central and south America.

However, 80 percent of couples will conceive within one year, so if you divide that by 12 (for each month) you have about a 6 percent chance of conceiving per cycle.Sperm live in the female genital tract for up to 72 hours, so it is generally recommended when trying to get pregnant to have sex every other day between the time your period finishes and the time you feel PMS symptoms (which means you have already ovulated and can no longer conceive that cycle).  So I would try to be patient and understand that it sometimes can take some time to become pregnant.  In the meantime, I recommend you try to eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, avoid alcohol and smoking and begin to take Folic Acid, which is a B vitamin that has been shown to help prevent birth defects. 400 micrograms daily is the standard dose, which can be purchased alone or in prenatal vitamin preparations.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and I wish you the best of luck getting pregnant!Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, I m having a lot of white creamy vaginal discharge (sorry tmi) feeling pain and cramps in my tummy, dizziness that last about 4seconds, light headache on and off and my breast hurt when I lay on them, are there signs that I m pregnant?

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options.1 ) First of all do not panic. 2 ) All your symptoms can be related to pregnancy,  if you have any positive  definite indicator test for pregnancy. 3 ) As you might be aware that the very first and important sign of pregnancy is a missing period.  If you have regular cycles, and you have crossed your dates, then please get morning's first sample of urine tested for pregnancy. In case of doubt blood beta HCG test and USG will be of help. 4 ) If your pregnancy test results are negative, then  your symptoms can be due to PMS - premenstrual syndrome. Breast discomfort, headache and abdominal pain, mood changes are few of the symptoms in PMS  . In  that case I will suggest to start with long acting form of Vitamin B 6, vitamin E and evening primrose oil supplements on daily basis at least for next 3 months.

Usually, 14 days prior to the next expected menses the egg is released (ovulation). A period of about one week around this day is a fertile period; though variations are known. With a history of unprotected sex in child bearing age, if the periods are delayed, pregnancy should be suspected unless and until proved otherwise. To find the evidence of pregnancy status, you have following options: 1. Perform pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier the test may report false negative results. 2.

The time period that period stop i was also encountering some stress as i had make a decision to close my business thatwas difficult thing for me to do. question is could stress have been the contributing factor to my period history. and is there a posssible of me getting pregnant at this stage of my life.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,There are more than one issues for which you need guidance cum explanation. I shall tackle them one by one:1. Though stress can affect the menstrual regularity, after having a menopause for 4 years if you again start bleeding, it should be taken seriously to rule out any evidence of any serious pathology like cancer. Such sort of a bleeding anytime 6 months after confirmed menopause is labelled as Post Menopausal bleeding and needs to be thoroughly investigated. Your menopause was confirmed by blood tests.  Initial ultrasonography will give some clue and will guide for the further investigations which may include Hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsy, etc. 2. After bilateral tubal block, the tubal reconstruction surgery can be performed. However the success rate of such surgery in terms of pregnancy is hardly up to 50% in a woman in childbearing age group. If the tubes were blocked by some infection, the success rates are still low as the tubal lining is affected by infection. You are in your menopausal age group; so the success rate will be considerably  low. 3. Since you have menopause, even though the tubes are reconstructed, the million dollar question is whether you would be producing any eggs? Most probably not. However, AMH levels in your blood will give scientific information about it. Considering all these odd facts for you to become pregnant, I would advise you to opt for an adoption if the natural pregnancy is not possible. I hope this clarifies all your doubts.

Hypothyroid state is known to affect the fertility of a woman. Even if you become pregnant with Hypothyroidism, there is an increased risk of pregnancy loss or baby affection with low Thyroid function. Some Levothyroxin (with the advice of a Physician only) will help you bring your Thyroid function to normalcy. I would advise you to go for medicines like Clomiphene citrate (which is a key component of Tablet Ccq 50) after your Thyroid function is within normal range. If even after that Clomiphene citrate fails to give you pregnancy within 6 months, you will have to shift to some Artificial Reproductory Technique with consultation of Infertility Consultant.

Chances of successful pregnancy are more when the egg is released  from the follicles of size between 18 mm to 21 mm. One of the follicle in left ovary is of 1.8 cm; i.e. 18 mm size. So it is very likely that this follicle will rupture any day. Hence, I would suggest you to utilize every day now  for sexual relations. Another option is to get inj. hCG 5000 IU to induce the ovulation from this follicle of 18 mm size and start having intercourse every day; or at least every alternate day for better chances of conception. Please continue to have ultrasonography daily for few days to find out what happened to these two follicles. Also please get the information about the thickness of the lining of the uterine cavity (endometrium) from the sonologist. Endometrium of thickness between 9 mm to 14 mm is most conducive for the implantation of the fertilized ovum. I hope this provides you sufficient guidelines.

When you saw that the ovaries were on the verge of ovulation, it would have been more informative had you continued to have ultrasonography to confirm the ovulation.

Thnk u Dr. Waiting for your Reply.","Doctor":"Dear Vaishali,Fertab is a medicine containing Clomiphene citrate which induces egg release from the ovary (ovulation). Hence, if you want to consume these pills for induction of ovulation, you should take them before intrauterine semen instillation (IUI - Injecting the sperms). The protocol should be as follows: From day 2 of the cycle, Clomiphene citrate tablets are taken for 5 days. Then from day 9 onwards, monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography. When the ovulation takes place, semen should go in your uterus; either naturally by intercourse or by IUI. Occasionally, the ovulation fails in spite of these tablets. In such cases, when the follicle is about 18 mm to 21 mm size, Inj. hCG is given to induce the ovulation and then the semen is injected. If these pills fail to offer you pregnancy within 3-6 trials, you should not continue these pills but shift to HMG/hCG protocol. I hope this clarifies the matter to you to take an informed decision. If you want further more details, you may ask me Direct question on this forum with your investigations report.

Now please utilize this day and few more days by as frequent sexual relations as possible. You do stand a good chance of pregnancy provided there are no other adverse factors. Miprogen Capsule contains Natural Micronised Progesterone as an active ingredient. This medicine is given to support the pregnancy in early stages. In case there is any corpus luteum insufficiency, this medicine will take care to support the pregnancy. Argipreg Sachet contains Arginine, and Proanthocyanidin as active ingredients. It will help strengthening your capillary blood vessels and appropriate implantation of the fertilized ovum. You may continue taking B long which is Pyridoxin. It will help your general health as well as heart. I hope this ends up in a good stable pregnancy for you."},{"Patient":"hi. I am 26 and have irregular periods.

If the opened tube is infected, there is a great probability of it getting blocked again. First get the infection treated and then again reassess the patency of the tube by Laparoscopy or Hysterosalpingography. If the tube is still patent, you stand a chance of natural conception. However, tubal patency is not the only factor of conception. You have to find out whether you produce the eggs regularly or not. Ovulation monitoring by ultrasonography can help you to get this information. Also get the semen of your husband examined.  If all the investigation reports are within normal range, try to plan your sexual relations on and around the day of egg release as found by ultrasonography. If after a fair trial of at least 6 months also, you fail to conceive in spite of all the reports within normal limits, you might have to consider opting for Artificial Reproductory Technique for which you should consult Infertility specialist. I am sure, this will provide you initial broad guidelines. For more detailed advice, you may ask me a direct question on this forum.

I say kinda because it was for short amounts of Time and I wasn t close to orgasming I am just worried about precum and the odds of her being pregnant it was 4 days after her period. Also is there anything she can take to help avoid it (preferably something you can buy when younger then 18)","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Precum is pre-ejaculation secretion which is expelled out unknowingly. It does contain some sperms which can cause pregnancy. However, you had this experience 4 days after her period. This day is rather safe as far as the risk of pregnancy is considered. Egg is released 14 days prior to next expected menses. Egg has a life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 3 days. Hence a period of about a week around the day of egg release is considered as fertile window. 4 days after the menses falls quite away from fertile window. Still, I would say, better to err on safer side. Hence, she should take post coital emergency contraceptive pill protection. These pills have to be taken within 72 hours after the unprotected sex. If this period is already over, she may get intrauterine contraceptive device inserted within 5 days of  this unprotected sex. This will give her protection from the pregnancy and moreover will give her ongoing contraception for years to come. If 5 days also are over, you cannot do anything now. Just wait for her periods to appear (which mostly she will get). If she misses her period, get pregnancy test done on her urine after one week; earlier the results may be false negative. Alternatively, you may get her blood checked for Beta hCG for diagnosing pregnancy, 10 days after this incidence. If she is pregnant, she can get the pregnancy terminated by medicines safely and effectively up to 9 weeks of gestation. However, this has to be done with Gynaecologists advice and prescription only. And lastly, any step she takes is to be done with her parents consent since she is minor; otherwise it will be an illegal offence. I hope this provides you detailed guidelines.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi Doc, my hus has below sperm factors.pls advise if we can try naturally. sperm count... 68 million/ml total count per ejaculate... 168 million motility fast proggressive..10% slow progressive.. 30% sluggishly progressive...15% non motile.. 45 % morphologhy normal forms..55% pls advise i have pco and my periods go missing once in 3 months","Doctor":"Hello dearI understand your concernIn sperm analysis: count is normal.Total sperm motility should be >=40%.So semen analysis is within normal limit and conception is possible.But PCOS can cause problem in conception.To regularize the period consult the gynecologist and undergo reproductive hormone analysis, USG scan and ovarian follicle study for better management.Drugs like krimson 35, metformin, clomiphene citrate, duphaston will help youDo regualr exercise and lose weight (10-12%) if you are obese.Take healthy diet, avoid stress and drink plenty of waterHope this may help youContact HCM for further health queryBest regardsDr.Sagar"},{"Patient":"I have the Mirena, had it for 3 years now. Lately I ve been having a lot of pregnancy symptoms. I have clear liquid coming from my boob, tired, moody, nausea, head aches, cramps even after the little couple day cycle that I had. The list goes on. Could I be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.No birth control method is 100 percent effective, so if you have been having unprotected sex, pregnancy is a possibility.However, if you can feel your strings, which means that the IUD is in place, the chance of your being pregnant is still extremely low.In addition, many of the symptoms we associate with pregnancy like mood changes, breast tenderness, fatigue, spotting and nausea can also be caused by an abnormal menstrual cycle.  You may not bleed very much with the Mirena, but you do ovulate and you may be feeling premenstrual hormonal changes which can mimic pregnancy.So to be on the safe side, I suggest you purchase an over-the-counter pregnancy test and perform it according to the enclosed directions.  Modern pregnancy tests are extremely accurate, and will become positive within 10 days to 2 weeks after conception.If you are not pregnant, you should see your women's healthcare provider as nipple discharge can be a symptom of a breast problem if you have not been nursing recently.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello, really hope you can help me.

As a precaution I took the morning after pill around 11 hours after the incident. My last period started on 28 May. Is there any possibility I could be pregnant? Thanks very much for your help.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, unless penetration occurred, there is no reason to suspect that you could be pregnant.  There is a small amount of sperm in pre-ejaculate, but unless you and your boyfriend had direct genital contact there is no way the sperm could have traveled up your reproductive tract because sperm die when they are exposed to air.  Furthermore, even if you did have intercourse, the morning after pill prevents pregnancy 90 percent of the time if taken within 72 hours.So I really do thing that you can be reassured that you are not at risk for pregnancy.

You are not diagnosed as infertile unless you and your husband have been trying to conceive (which means having unprotected intercourse at least two or three days a week) for at least a year.Folic acid is a B vitamin that does not help you to get pregnant, however it is recommended to take during early pregnancy because it helps prevent birth defects.Siphene, also known as clomiphene citrate, is a fertility medication. It can help induce ovulation in women who are infertile because they do not ovulate. However, if your periods normally come every month, there is no reason to suspect that you are not ovulating.Because you are under the age of 35, I recommend that you and your husband to not take any more fertility medications and try to conceive for another six months on your own. Normally, your most fertile time is between the time your period stops until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms.  For most couples, that means having sex every other day from about the seventh day of your cycle until the 23rd to 25th day.If you and your husband have not conceived in another six months, I recommend both of you see fertility specialist, as 50% of the time lack of pregnancy can be a problem with the man's sperm as well.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful, and you and your husband are able to have a baby soon.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, doctor.

However, you had all these sexual relations after 31 December; i.e. after you missed your period. You cannot be sure only with the history whether these sexual acts have resulted in pregnancy or this is just an irregularity of the menses. Since it is more than 7 days delay in your menses, please get pregnancy test done on overnight morning first urine sample. It would inform about the pregnancy status. However, considering your sexual history in relation to your menstrual history, I feel you should get Beta hCG test done 10 days after the last unprotected sexual relation. If you are diagnosed not pregnant, please report to your Gynaecologist for irregularity of the menses. I hope this helps you.

However, whether to go for next pregnancy so immediately is a question; particularly when you had missed abortion. I feel primarily after any type of abortion, due time of about 3 months should be given for the organs and tissues of reproductory system to regain normalcy. After that pregnancy may be attempted. However, since you had missed abortion, I would advise you to consult a foetal medicine specialist to find out the probable cause behind the missed abortion. May be both of you might have to get your chromosomal study done. If any cause is detected and is curable, first get it treated before you attempt next pregnancy. Right from now, in the preconception stage, start taking Folic acid tablets daily and high protein diet also. This will help release of healthy egg and healthy implantation of fertilized ovum.

Pregnacare and Folic acid are good vitamins which help healthy eggs and implantation of fertilized ovum. In PCOS, you should control your weight. Find out what is your BMI; you should keep it under 24. High protein, low carbohydrate and low fats is a good diet which should be supported by appropriate exercise.

While there is no proof that taking folic acid completely prevents birth defects, it is known that neural tube defects are caused by folic acid deficiency.It was helpful to take folic acid while you are trying to conceive because then you will already be on it at conception. However the neural tube of the baby only begins to develop at around 7 to 8 weeks gestation, so if you start taking the medication at around that time pregnancy the potential benefit is still there.So in summary, you should begin to take folic acid tablets as there is a possibility you are pregnant.I hope this information was helpful and best of luck to you for your future pregnancy.Regards,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"i had sex with my gf and i gave unwanted 72 tab to her . again after two days had sex and gave tablet, normally she shoud gt periods on date, she is saying she s not getting periods even after four days from the date of normal period date , even she has not got withdrawl bleeding , is she is pregnent??? when should she expect the periods ...??","Doctor":"Hi there,After reading your question, I am of the opinion that1) Unwanted 72 is not a fool proof method of contraception.

Try to plan the intercourse on and around the day of egg release. The egg has a life of 24 hours and sperms are active for 3 days. So intercourse near the day of ovulation will help her conceive.

Before you go for any ART treatment, I would advise you to try few simple things:1. Monitor your ovulation by ultrasonography. This will locate the day of the ovulation. Try to plan your sexual relations at and around this day. 2. Ovulation monitoring should start from day 9 onwards. Please find out what was the size of the follicle before rupture. Follicles between the size of 18 mm to 21 mm release the healthiest eggs and have best pregnancy outcome. 3. Also find out the thickness of the endometrium at the time of ovulation. Endometrium of thickness between 9 mm to 14 mm is most conducive for implantation. If this trial does not work, you may try artificial reproductory technique. Please report to an infertility consultant. I hope, this helps you.  Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hello sir!! i had unprotected sex with my partner and had an i pill the very next day. Next day i again had sex and also I had 2 i- piils back to back. Now on the day my periods genrally occurs there is a brown discharge instead. Its lasted for 1-2 days. Am i pregnent?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, There was medical belief few years ago that I-pill like emergency contraception can be taken only once in a month. However, now there are evidences that such pills can be repeated any number of times after each unprotected intercourse if taken within 72 hours of the intercourse. These pills have typical after effects:1. Few days after the administration of the pills, some amount of vaginal bleeding occurs. This is withdrawal bleeding and stops within few days. It requires no attention. 2. The following period may get delayed by few days to a week after single administration of the pill; with multiple administration, it may further be delayed. In all, these effects may get enhanced  with administration of more than one pill. So the brown bleeding you have noticed seems to be the post pill withdrawal bleeding. It will stop itself. Your regular menses will be delayed by a week to 10 days or may be more also, since you have consumed two pills. These pills are fairly successful in offering the protection against the pregnancy. So the possibilities of pregnancy are very remote. If at all you do not get menses even 2 weeks after the missed period, you may get pregnancy test done on your overnight morning first urine sample to find out your pregnancy status. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test on your blood. I hope this relieves your stress.

It is a positive finding that your ultrasonography has not detected any organic lesion in the uterus. For the hormonal imbalance, you will have to take hormonal treatment. If you do not take it, the imbalance may interfere in your conception. If you are keen on getting pregnant, you need not defer for the hormonal treatment. Retroprogestational preparations of progesterone will help you regularise your menses without affecting the egg formation and release. You may request your Gynaecologist to prescribe you retroprogestational preparation. Of course I would like you to get your coagulation profile done, keeping in mind the history of missed abortion.

Can she get pregnant on the last day of her period? she told me afterwards that her period started again the day after with signs of blood","Doctor":"Hello dearI understand your concernPregnancy is not possible when sex was done on the last day of the period.Last day of period is completely safe period.During this time ovum is not released so no fertilization will occur.To become pregnant, penetrative sexual intercourse in unsafe period of the cycle is require.Period started is just menstrual blood.Hope this may help youContact HCM for further health queryBest regardsDr. Sagar"},{"Patient":"I had finished dophiston before 3days and today i did pragnancy test by pragnancy strips and it gives like positive result i mean that the second line i.e pragnancy line was slightly shown in the strip and did the test today for four times but the result was same am i pragnant or not","Doctor":"Hi there,From your question, your pregnancy test kit is mildly positive.That means:1) Yes, you could be pregnant.2) The next step is to get a blood test called serum beta HCG to see your pregnancy hormone levels.3) If beta HCG gives positive results, it means you are definitely pregnant.4) You could also retake the urine pregnancy test after a week and see the results if you do not want a blood test right now.Hope this answer was helpful.Regards,Dr. Shikha Shah"},{"Patient":"Ultrasound said I was 5 weeks 4 days on Sept 10. I had sex on Aug 4,6, and 17. I am very confused on which possible conception date it would be. Because I heard you take two weeks away from the ultra sound date? My last period was Jul 26 which means I should be further along right?","Doctor":"Hi there, after reading your query, my opinion is that:1) The 5 weeks 4 days is counted from the day of your period, i.e. 26th July. So, you would be 5 weeks 4 days on 3rd September.2) The most likely date of conception would be 17th because there are chances of delayed conception as indicated by the disparity between your date and sonography.3) So, instead of ovulating on 10th, you would have ovulated a week late, on 17th.4) Most probable date is 17th in my opinion.Hope this answer was helpful.Regards,Dr. Shikha Shah"},{"Patient":"Hello..me and my girlfriend indulged in a little foreplay..I masturbated and then washed it off with only water..and I wiped it off and I am pretty sure that my hand was dry..then about 10-15 minutes later, I felt her vaginal area withmy finger..i ddidn t even insert it in deep..it was very superficial..could this get her pregnant? I am really freaking out..please help..thank you.","Doctor":"Hi there, I have understood your concern. Here is my opinion for the same. 1 ) First of all do not panic. 2 ) As there was no penetration and you washed your hands, I am sure that there will be no pregnancy.3) I suggest you and your girlfriend visit a counsellor who will guide you about sex and contraception.I hope this answer helps you.

And from the time I am under medication. Initially I was told that due to early age puberty my periods are irregular. And it used to be vast.. Either when I get my periods it will last for 15-20 days and when I stop it using tablet it will not come again for months. I have consulted around 4 doctors in this 15 years and found that I have PCOS and so far my period was not regularized and in continuous treatment. My Gynecologist said that many women have this issue and it will get alright for some once they get married and have a child. Now I am married for 4 months and I was under medication till last before month. I was having Duoluton tablet and my Dr. asked me to stop this birth control after 2 months of marriage and to start having Hyponidd for 6 months which will help me conceive. I stopped Duoluton last month and started having Hyponidd, but missed my period which was supposed to be on 18th May 2014. I even had a pregnancy test and it was negative. Unfortunately after marriage I moved to USA and couldnt have a personal consultation with my Dr. and also could reach her through phone only by next week since she is in abroad and not in India now. Now I am confused as to what would be the best treatment for me from now on that will help me getting conceive. I am also obese since I have gained so much weight before marriage due to computer job, heavy mental stress due to family issues and in addition with PCOS. Now I am a house wife and also away from mental stress and family issues and here in USA I am trying to workout atleast thrice a week in treadmill and cycling for 1 or 1.5 hours. But I feel difficult to reduce it now, still I am trying hard continuously. For sure I know reducing my weight will slightly help me. But apart from that what would be the treatment I should take further? Is that a personal consultation with doctor compulsory by this time and if yes which specialization doctor should I consult? It will be of great help to get an answer and I am worried if I will get pregnant and make my husband happy who loves me a lot. Thank you!","Doctor":"Answer: Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1 ) You need to get your hormonal profile done. 2 ) Take high fibre food along with diet and exercise.3 ) You need to consult an infertility specialist for proper guidance.4) It is necessary to see a doctor personally as PCOS is not a disease that can be cured with medicines alone.5) Do not worry. With proper and regular medications, you will be able to conceive.I hope this answer helps helps you. Thanks. Dr. Purushottam Neurgaonkar. ."},{"Patient":"Hi, My name is Kelly. I was just wondering if anyone could help me understand why it s taking so long to get pregnant after the depo shot. I ve been off of it for 9 months now and I have recently seen dark brown spotting but only once and it hasn t come back. I was on the shot for about 4 years. My husband and I would really love to have a kid. Please helps. Tia (:","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Unfortunately, Depo-Provera is a very long-lasting contraceptive. For convenience sake, having to only worry about birth control every three months is extremely helpful. However, in some women, normal ovulation can take many months to come back some even up to one year. The reason for that is that the hormone that is in Depo-Provera is designed to be long-lasting and different people metabolize the drug differently. Also, the fact that you had been on Depo for four years and likely you did not get your period during that time is a sign that your estrogen levels also had been suppressed by the medication.If at one year since stopping the Depo-Provera you do not have any sign of real menstruation, I would recommend that you and your partner see a gynecologist for evaluation. They could do an analysis of your hormones, and medication to help stimulate you to ovulate again may be a possibility.So I know it is difficult, please try to be patient if at the end of three months you still have not resumed normal menstrual cycle, I would recommend evaluation by a gynecologist or endocrinologist to evaluate why you are not menstruating. It may be recommended also for your partner to do a semen analysis, as most doctors want to know that there is no male factor involved in your fertility issues.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I dont have any abnormalities except lh hormone.

Just want to know how long its takes on Fertimod 50 mg My Doc said everything is okay with me:-) Thank you Nellie","Doctor":"Dear Nellie, Fertomid is a medicine which contains Clomiphene citrate as an active ingredient. This medicine has to be taken for 5 days and then it initiates the egg release. So this medicine is for inducing egg release (ovulation). It is advisable to monitor ovulation by ultrasonography or LH estimation kits. Intercourse or IUI should be planned on the day of ovulation. This medicine should not be tried for more than 6 cycles. If within this period there is no success, some other medicines like hMG/hCG combination may be tried. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I have pcod and irregular periods. I have been trying to conceive for last 6 months. in the month of October I had these brown discharge for many days my doc gave me duphaston 10 mg after which I got my periods. this month again I am having the same problem i.e since 26 dec I 'm having this brown discharge. I did a home pregnancy test to check if I am pregnant but unfortunately i'm not. should I take duphaston again to  bring my periods. any will duphaston help me to conceive?","Doctor":"Hello!First, do not worry. 6 months are not enough to get worried.Second, you have to confirm that you have PCOD. Your doctor is right.You should have menstruations every month. They feed the uterus, unless it becomes smaller and you may have difficulties in the future to concieve.The fact that the menstruation come after Duphaston, it is a good sign. Also, you have to know that in PCOD, there is a difficulty in growing a mature follicle. So you have to monitor your ovulation with your gynecologist.At least, I would say that you should try for another 4 months with your husband during the appropriate days and then take an appointment to your doctor. During this time you should take also Duphaston for the menstruation. If you do not have menstruations, you can not get pregnant.Take care.DR. Thano"},{"Patient":"Hi I had my period 2 weeks ago everything was fine but I have had unprotected sex in the last week & now I m bleeding again it s light bleeding & kind of pinkish. Could I be pregnant or are there any other causes, I m 22 years old & after my last unprotected sex I was worried so I took 2 birth control tablets I am waiting to start the pill until my next regular cycle.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If you are menstruating regularly with cycle of bot 30 days, you can expect egg release (ovulation) about 2 weeks after the last menstrual period. Some amount of light bleeding, may be with some pain in the abdomen can be experienced on and around the day of ovulation. It is called Mittelschmerz. Your bleeding seems to be this type. Also this bleeding could be due to the birth control pills you have taken after the intercourse. In fact post coital emergency contraceptive pills within 72 hours of the intercourse would have been more effective in avoiding the pregnancy. However, you had unprotected intercourse during this period. So the possibility of pregnancy cannot be ruled out. I would advise you to get Beta hCG test done 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse to find out the evidence of pregnancy. Alternatively you may wait for menstruation. If you miss it, perform pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample about a week after the missed period; earlier the test may report false negative results.I hope this helps you.

I agree with what doctor Purushottam has said. I think that we have told nearly the same. But what I do not agree with, is the fact that PCOS is only a lifestyle related problem because the etiology is yet still not sure and many theories exist. But in a situation where a couple is trying for 1.5 years for a pregnancy, we are talking about infertility and I think that only lifestyle changes are not enough. I have mentioned trying to loose wight (exercise and vegetables/water included), ultrasound for the follicle growth track and intercourse around the ovulation, so we are saying the same thing.
