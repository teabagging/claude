The irrational fear of having some illness or hypochondriac ideas are the reasons of panic and severe anxiety you're having. You are 38 years old female and it is not common to have heart attack at this age especially in females. Your all ECGs came normal so remain relaxed and assured that you are safe.Thinking about getting some serious illness again and again causes anxiety and panic. Try to keep yourself busy to come out of anxiety and panic attacks. Relaxation exercises help to reduce the anxiety and panic will decrease. Breathing exercises also helps to reduce the symptoms. If relaxation exercises don't result in improvement then medicinal treatment will be needed. SSRIs are commonly used drugs for anxiety symptoms. Drugs like Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Sertraline etc are SSRI drugs and help to reduce the intrusive thoughts and will also reduce the panic attacks. Sertraline is even safe in heart conditions.Please visit a psychiatrist for evaluation and if needed start taking treatment.Thanks Take care"},{"Patient":"Can stress cause a black eye? woke up with a black eye I thought it was due to new medication so i stopped it and black eye went away.

Rapid heartbeat, a little difficult breathing, sweating, restlesnnes, the feeling of being super nervous and a floating feeling in the chest but not pain. What might this be because it was a little scary?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking from HCM for your health relate doubtsI can understand your concern. The symptoms like sudden onset palpitations, difficulty in breathing, restlessness, severe nervousness, chest heaviness etc are commonly seen in severe anxiety or panic attacks. But to make proper diagnosis detailed evaluation is needed.ECG should be done to rule out any heart condition. Angina or any arrhythmia could cause symptoms like panic attacks. Even hyperthyroidism can result in increased risk of panic attacks. This should be ruled out by thyroid function tests. Anaemia also increases the risk of panic attacks. Complete hemogram should be done to rule out anaemia.Once these medical conditions are ruled out then we can label anxiety or panic as cause of your symptoms.

He did very well on it but had terrible drowsiness and couldn t stay on it in college. He has moved to Citalopram because he found he was very short tempered and wanted to explode on people (more a phrase than anything physical, very stressed with college life) when he came off the Prozac. The citalopram has helped with that short temperedness but he feels completely emotionless now. Of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is there one that would be better to consider. We have an apt with the doctor in another week but I would like to go in prepared with a game plan.","Doctor":"Hi,This is one of the known side effects with serotonin re-uptake inhibitors.

I get an urge when I see bare skin to want to know how it feels to slice open someone else s bare skin. I don t want to do it, I just can t help but suffer from clear visuals of how it would feel. As in i can actually visualise what it would be like and then get an inch for it.

I can understand that the situation with your daughter's family must be quite distressing to you. You are indeed right in being concerned about the safety of your grandsons and your daughter.You have mentioned that your daughter's boyfriend has been diagnosed to have Paranoid Schizophrenia and that he has serious drug problems as well. Now, Paranoid Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness and requires regular treatment and follow up. Unfortunately, it seems that he is not on any medication or monitoring, which increases the risk of relapse of symptoms, that can lead to aggressive behaviour. Using street drugs like heroin, etc. further worsens the illness and increases the risk of violence. So, considering the above factors and the fact that he has already exhibited very violent behaviour in the recent past, I would say that his risk of violence / danger to your daughter and your grandchildren is very high. The situation seems to be further complicated by the fact that your daughter has mental health concerns herself. From the situation that you have described, I have concerns whether your daughter's decision-making / judgement capacity is being clouded by the mental health problems that she may be undergoing.From your side, I would suggest that you consider the following two things:1) You can inform Child Services that you have serious concerns about the safety of your grandsons. They will take appropriate steps to do a risk assessment and put in safety measures in place.2) You can take your daughter and also her boyfriend to a mental health professional to ensure that they are started on appropriate treatment and followed-up regularly.I hope I have addressed your concerns and do sincerely hope that this difficult situation resolves as the earliest.Kind regards,Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar MBBS., DPM., MRCPsych.(U.K.), MBA.(Hosp.

It's expected that you feel sad and worried, but you can face the panic and axiety attacks. I suggest you to take your time, go to some quiet place, like your room, pay attention on your feelings, take a paper and try to write, in topics, what really makes you feel bad. If your problem is when your parents will die, try to think what, in this case, makes you feel bad. For exemple, to be alone. Try to face your personal and psychological difficulties.

The anticipation of these attacks causes further anxiety.

If your diagnosis was correct when you were a child, you were probably diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperacive Disorder (ADHD formerly called ADD), but sometimes children are incorrectly diagnosed with this disorder and are given Adderall, which is an amphetamine. Lack of focus, inattention, and inability to concentrate can also be one of the symptoms of depression.  You have not stated your other issues, if any, so I can only tell you what these symptom can also mean.I suggest getting an assessment from a psychiatrist.

Smuggling from India through Tripura border is rampant with regular seizures by police, BSF.Corex has been banned in India from March 2016.Legally, Corex can only be obtained by a physician's prescription, but studies show that more than 90% of the product is sold without one. The majority of the sale of Corex are people of are addicted to it in India. Police in different states has been conducting regular raids, seizures and criminal cases against chemist stores, pharmacies and stockists who keep diverting Corex for sale to addicts.Corex is not generally a fatal drug substitute, unless taken in extremely high quantities. However, many side effects are common. It can cause short term memory loss, sleeplessness, tremors and spasms, muscular pains and dehydration.Long term abuse leads to serious kidney damage or constipation. Corex also has a high sugar content, and may be risky for acute diabetic patients.You must stop using it right away, as it is illegal and dangerous.

i ve heard of a hospital back east (new york? pennsylvania?) that takes mystery disease charity cases on an inpatient basis for in-depth observation and testing. have any of you heard of this hospital, and would they take my case? for whatever reason, i cannot even establish myself as a patient with any general practitioners where i live, in redding, california. i have been turned away by all the local medical centers, although they accept medi-cal. when i was assessed for medi-cal, they sent me to a psychologist, who told them that without seeing any evidence of my claim (he was not given a copy of my medical files, which include photo documentation and witness references), that his uninformed opinion was that i was psychotic and delusional. i m guessing at this point that i am receiving medi-cal on the basis of his claims, as i did not receive any other assessment reports from my previous general practitioner (i recently moved, which is why i don t have a provider). it would appear to me that i am not being assisted because my illness has been falsely diagnosed as a delusion. is this a case of discrimination, and if so, what can i do about it? can anyone help me with this? with no diagnosis of my physiological condition and a false diagnosis of mental illness, i can t get SSI, i can t get an excuse note from a doctor to wear special protective clothing if i choose to seek employment, and if i seek medical attention for any number of health problems, the treatment could be potentially life-threatening because without a diagnosis of porphyria, they will give me whatever drugs they have on hand. i also fear that if i show up for an appointment at some new facility complaining of my porphyria-related symptoms that someone will have me committed for psychiatric evaluation due to whatever is stated in my medi-cal file. that in itself would be life-threatening, as i would surely experience a seizure from the light exposure and psychiatric drugs. what can i do to get out of this cycle of abuse?

Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi dear , welcome to healthcare magic                        After going through your query i can suggest that you consult your psychiatrist once again to start your treatment.for depression treatment guidelines say that for first episode medicines can be prescribed for 6 month to 1 year.for second episode you have to take medicines for longer periods.CBT can be given along with medicines for better treatment but only CBT is not effective than medicines in case of depression.in case of only generalized anxiety disorder CBT is more effective.generally clonazepam is started initially along with escitalopram and stopped after 4 weeks but can be continued without no serious side effects if anxiety is severe.no serious side effects with escitalopram and clonazepam at therapeutic doses seen if any they are mild."},{"Patient":"My 26 year old son has Down syndrome and moved into a group home in March, 8 months ago.

Although it is generally accepted that emotional stress or psychological factors can make any back pain problem worse, the concept of “stress-related” back pain takes this idea one step further. The diagnosis of stress-related back pain assumes that psychological and emotional factors are of primary influence.The stress-related back pain diagnosis is a \\"psychosomatic\\" or \\"psycho-physiological\\" one. It should be emphasized that even though psychological factors may be causing the physical symptoms, the symptoms are not imaginary.

Stress is simply a reaction to a stimulus that disturbs our physical or mental equilibrium. In other words, it's an omnipresent part of life. A stressful event can trigger the “fight-or-flight” response, causing hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol to surge through the body. A little bit of stress, known as “acute stress,” can be exciting—it keeps us active and alert. But long-term, or “chronic stress,” can have detrimental effects on health. The symptoms could include body numbness, shivering, breathlessness, dry mouth and palpitation among others. As you fear, the chances of anxiety disorder and panic attacks are very high with high continuous stress.You may not be able to control the stressors in your world, but you can alter your reaction to them. Physical exercise, creative activities, deep breathing, being away from the situation for sometime etc can help you tackle the stress.

His doctor said he was having a manic episode.  Since leaving he has made no attempt at contacting me.  I am unsure at this stage where he is now living.

He went to live with mt son who drinks heavily and maybe drugs involved.","Doctor":"Hi dear,            After going through your query i can suggest that persons with borderline personality will be having the behavior problem right from age of 18 years with some micopsychotic episodes .whereas patients with bipolar disorder will have two manic episodes or one episode of depression and one of mania with full inter episodic recovery.generaly bipolar patients in manic episode hardly take medicines of there own in initial period.so take care he should take medicines regularly."},{"Patient":"sir i have been in a relation but  she dumped me for some reasons and it is affecting on my mind i cant sleep i cant focus on anything even not on my career. iam ok when iam with my friends or out form my home but when i come to my home i get depressed sometime in take relaxation pills for sleep and sir let me tell u about my personality iam not an emotionally stable person i get serious on tiny things plz tell me how can improve my self ang get out from this breakup condition...","Doctor":"Hi,u have symptom of depression. u have to consult some psychiatrist and u required counselling and medication both. thanks"},{"Patient":"I am afraid to go to sleep for the fear of not waking up.

I understand. I think you should not link your sadness problem with depressive disorder. Being emotional and being depressed are two different things. Emotions are part of body's defense mechanism and please do not try to alter it. Many emotions do alter themselves when you get experience in that area. In your case, you are already 70 and I believe you have enough experience in this area. Nothing unhealthy can happen even in the condition. So let it be so.

It's been over for a little while now... But I've found myself to be having some problems... It's quite difficult to explain but I find if I think about something.... Absolutely anything... From going out to making the dinner I find myself having a slight shortness of breath and my chest getting tight. It only lasts for a few seconds. But if I think about it too much I find myself getting panicky... Where as if I just do it... Without thinking... there's no issue.... But I've also found myself to be having flashbacks... Again it's difficult to explain. It's like things, objects, places trigger these flashbacks and I'm right back there... Re-living it... The past... I have difficulty sleeping too and when I do sleep I find myself having nightmares, fighting with my sheets and pillows... I've tried to ignore it but I've found it gradually getting worse...Do you have any idea what this is? Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I can understand. The troubled relationship, as it is highly troubled, gave you ordeal of continuous stress. Stress is a reaction to a stimulus that disturbs our physical or mental equilibrium. In other words, it's an omnipresent part of life. A stressful event can trigger the “fight-or-flight” response, causing hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol to surge through the body. A little bit of stress, known as “acute stress,” can be exciting—it keeps us active and alert. But long-term, or “chronic stress,” can have detrimental effects on health. In your case, the continuous stress you experience, is taking its toll on you. Nothing to be alarmed of. The present symptoms are usually categorized as anxiety neurosis. In my opinion, as these are related to the past stress, could be treated under Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, though not that severe.I suggest for Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Occupational therapy and relaxation therapy.

If your insomnia is due to stress and anxiety and obsession, there is no need for you take sleep aid medicines. You just are suffering from this problem for two and half months of so.

You do sleep for three or four hours per day, but you don't seem to be fulfilled. Not having sound sleep. You also feel tired during day time. If yo do suffer from sleeplessness for two days, automatically on the third day you will sleep sound. You should understand this pattern and follow it.

She says that she is the reason why the straps were redesigned on the table because when she was 13 she passed out on it and fell through every one of them. She mainly passes out after she has done something streinous the following day; or if her body is weak from a virus; or from over heating like when in Florida. They have measured her blood pressure on the tilt table clear down to 60/20 when it dips. Usually it will dip and causes her to pass out. Her presser comes back up however she is unable to speak for about 20 min. and is weak for the next few days. She said its like her entire body falls asleep and then is waking up with the feeling of needle pricks all over her body. My question is that is comes and goes and now that she is older it may happen maybe 6 times a year. However, she has to be careful now to over exert herself. They have rulled out any heart problems or ceasures. She is a little worried now because she is getting a new sensation. We just got back from a youth retreat with kids for 4 days and she is exhausted. The next day she passed out a coulple times.

But, there is no alternative so as to manage it.You were consulting a psychiatrist for 12 years and just last year you were diagnosed bipolar. that seems to be peculiar. But naming a mental disorder is just for prescribing medicines. Psychologists and therapists approach the mental disorder in a different angle and they provide you with psychotherapy methods to manage your disorder.Awareness is the first step to manage your disorder. You should be aware of your symptoms, frequency, type, how it disturbs you, whole pattern of the symptoms etc. once you how and when the symptoms comes, you can easily put diversions. Therefore, as the first step of therapy process, I suggest you to maintain a diary about everything from your thoughts and emotions and behaviors and symptoms. Be systematic. Continue writing this cognitive diary for a month and then with the diary visit a psychologist and rest of the therapy will be provided by the therapist. Don't worry.

Stress is another factor with which people do become short tempered. Over and above, a sort of low self esteem and low self confidence also triggers anger and aggression. Before advising the method to deal with the client, we would like to know more information about the client. We need to assess the dept of the client's anger. Is it just anger as an emotion is anger disorder? proper assessment of the client would provide the necessary insight.Emotional anger and aggression can be approached with the help of anger management therapy and slight life style changes with awareness.

I feel much better w/ no anxiety, and have returned to my regular work schedule, but (this is hard to explain) I can t be sure it is due to the FW device, though I made no other changes.

Thank you so YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Dear patient, I am Dr. Neel Kudchadkar and I will help you now. I have examined your question and being your personal physician, will handle all your medical needs. Firstly, you have mentioned that your son is probably suffering from Mood Disorder, now, all energy drinks provide the \\"boost\\" because they contain large amounts of caffeine, which increases the pain of the bipolar mood problem. I would say that energy drinks can alter the electrolyte balance in the body and a person who takes Lithium is vulnerable to cationic loss. For these reasons, I kindly advise you to help him utilize citrus drinks like Guava or Cranberry juice, which supply large amounts of antioxidants and vitamins to him, give him a more powerful energy boost and he can take Lithium side by side with these.As regards autism, I would ask you to bear patience with certain erratic behaviour and demands posed by your son because, autistic people are known to be highly talented in engineering and science. Despite social issues, if your son is channeled into the correct academic environment, his life will bloom. Therefore kindly regard his autism as a mixed blessing.

Persistent anxiety and depressive symptoms that impair day to day functioning should never be ignored. Self medication, relaxation exercises can help but if the anxiety is causing problems in functioning and relationship then there is need to see a psychiatrist. For anxiety medicines like SSRIs as Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Escitalopram etc are used commonly. These medicines will help to decrease persistent anxiety and will improve the depressed mood. Apart from this for relief of symptoms of anxiety benzodiazepines or other drugs like propranolol can be used. These medicines can help to reduce symptoms in acute anxiety situations. Continue to do relaxation exercises and mediation and this will supplement the actions of medicines.

My I have glasses for reading and glasses for distance, I have been to an eye doc and he says everything is normal, I get scared and think I might have something horrible like a brain tumor.","Doctor":"Hi Jenny,I can see why seeing the 'funny things' in front of your eyes has made you anxious and fear about a brain tumor despite assurance from your eye doctor.I would want to reassure you regarding the same, because a brain tumor is a serious problem that manifests with wide range of symptoms. It presents with prolonged headache, vision blurring, projectile vomiting, seizures, significant body weakness or stiffness, loss of consciousness or speech difficulties.There does not seem to be reason to believe that you could have a tumor in your brain. I do not know if the so called 'funny things' are mere artifacts in the eyes that appear magnified when seen across bright light, or if they are just flashes seen with closed eyes after a tiresome reading. The good news is that, except for the glasses you use, your eye doctor has ruled out a problem in your eyes. Hence, do not worry about this problem. I think you may try washing your eyes with clear water regularly and taking breaks from reading, during the regular use of glasses daily. If this still does not allay your fear, you may get an investigation of brain-scan (CT) done for your own satisfaction. However,  it is not recommended in current scenario.Hope this answers your question.

Memory loss of an elderly lady with delusional disorder. Delusional disorder as the prominent symptom and memory loss occur in the dementia, which are syndromes wherein psychiatric symptoms and memory loss result from deterioration of brain tissue. Because delusions can be shown as part of many illnesses, the diagnosis of delusional disorder is partially conducted by process of elimination. If the delusions are not accompanied by persistent, recurring hallucinations, then schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are not appropriate diagnoses. If the delusions are not accompanied by memory loss, then dementia is ruled out. If there is no physical illness or injury or other active biological cause (such as drug ingestion or drug withdrawal), then the delusions cannot be attributed to a general medical problem or drug-related causes. If delusions are the most obvious and pervasive symptom, without hallucinations, medical causation, drug influences or memory loss, then delusional disorder is the most appropriate categorization.

Though more details are needed but it appears that your dad has really some mental issues. To some extent keeping pictures of naked girls is justifiable but keeping the pictures of your sister or cleavage pictures of your sister is not acceptable. In my opinion you should talk to your mother for that and if he gets ready then consult a psychiatrist for evaluation of his symptoms. You also have mentioned that your brother is disrespectful towards you and he is showing symptoms like spiting on your face etc. These symptoms suggest some impulsive behaviour and need evaluation.

I recently had an extreme life crisis (that caused heartbreak, beginning of new job and moving to the other side of a city in 2 weeks time. It was so traumatic, that it increased the above issues. I had been abusing alcohol for about a year and a half. Then realized I had to stop. (just in the past 3 months), I ceased using alcohol but tried substituting with other medications, including suboxone, percocet, heroin (would never shoot, just orally ingested). I have always had a very high tolerance to these things. Even being prescribed pain killers in the past for a few operations, I would need to take 5 (instead of 1) to relieve pain, the amount of anesthesia it takes to knock me out confuses doctors etc. Even Novocane at the dentist, took 3x more to numb me than average patients. When I took the suboxone for extreme depression and anxiety (before going to a psych doc), I took 8mg (as a person never addicted to opiates) and had no side effects! I was told I should have been vomiting and should have gotten very ill from taking that much for the first time. Since I had gone to see a psych doctor, she prescribed me Celexa (after a month, depression and anxiety didn t change), Neurontin (after 2 days of use, didn t help, even if I took more), Xanax (.25; didn t help, so I HAD to take at least 1.5 or 2mg for my anxiety and depression to subside). Then, after about 2 weeks of taking Xanax, it stopped working!. I am now on Wellbutrin and it is NOT helping. My depression, anxiety and ability to focus is getting WORSE! I have 2 questions: 1) Is there an existing condition where some people are extremely tolerant of medications for no apparent reason (i.e never having been an addict?) I was honest with my psych doctor about abusing the .25 prescription of Xanax, but I was telling truth (and not abusing the drug itself. Meaning, I wasn t getting high or anything). Reluctantly she upped my dose to .5mg. I m going to tell her we need to try other things because I m not getting better. I m just afraid to tell her that I am very tolerant and build tolerance to medications very quickly. I don t want her to think I m a drug seeker, because I m not. I just want to feel normal and get better. 2) Based on my brief description of what I m going through, are there any medication combinations that you could reccomened?","Doctor":"Excellent questions. First things first: if you are abusing any substance, whether an illegal drug or prescription medication, this needs to be addressed before anything else. Adding antidepressants will not help you if you are abusing or withdrawing from substances. If this is the case, I recommend detox and rehab before addressing depression, anxiety, or ADHD.You describe a history of anxiety and depression. We'll leave ADHD aside for a moment. The standard treatment for both depression and anxiety is either an antidepressant, psychotherapy, or both in combination, which is usually the most effective. It sounds like you started taking Celexa, after a month you noticed no change, and Wellbutrin was added. This is a sound strategy. Keep in mind that unfortunately, you may not notice an improvement in symptoms using an antidepressant for 4-6 weeks. It requires some patience to allow time for the medication to work, and if it doesn't work, to increase doses and employ augmentation strategies like adding Wellbutrin to the mix. If you are still not feeling better after 4-6 weeks of maximum dose Celexa + maximum dose Wellbutrin, I would switch to a different antidepressant (Zoloft, Lexapro, Prozac, etc) and give that a try.I would not under any circumstances ever use Xanax, for a couple reasons. First, benzodiazepines actually do not treat anxiety well in the long term; this is the job of an antidepressant. Second, Xanax is a highly addictive benzodiazepine, which should be avoided at all costs in someone with a history of substance abuse. As you mention, you will habituate (develop tolerance to) this medication quickly, and it will not help you in the long-term.I would avoid treatment of ADHD until your mood and anxiety disorders are addressed. These are causing you the most trouble, and ADHD treatment is tricky because it also involves amphetamines, which are addictive substances.In summary, I would avoid benzodiazepines altogether, set aside ADHD for the moment, and focus on depression and anxiety. This involves treatment with an antidepressant and, if possible, psychotherapy. Allow 4-6 weeks of maximum-dose antidepressant to work, and if it doesn't, augment with something like Wellbutrin or lithium, or switch to a different antidepressant. There are many to choose from, so be hopeful. I'm sure with time and patience you will begin to feel better.Dr. Sheppe"},{"Patient":"i have stopped masturbating for over 5 years months and from time to time I suffer from nocturnal emissions, which I have come to know is completely natural.

These stop working for my insomnia and my nerves are all over the place. I have only been on these medications for a little over 3 months. I met with him yesterday and he wants me to just stop the flurazepam 30 mg with no reduction and start cymbalta 30mg. As far as the nortriptyline 25 mg take one every other day for 6 days and then stop. He also added the generic lunesta 3 mg for sleep. I have only been sleeping about 3 hrs. a night and stoping these medication so abruptly have me concerned, since I had such severe withdrawals symptoms coming off remeron after only taking that for a little over 2 months, had to stop taking remeron because it caused mouth sores. Do you have any advice?","Doctor":"Hi, . Thanks for asking your query at this forum.We understand your concern. I have read your question carefully and understood it. I will try my best to answer it.As you told that you are suffering from depression, anxiety and insomnia and recently you have been taking Tab Flurazepam and Nortriptyline for last 03 months. Flurazepam is a good anxiolytic and sedative, hence produce relaxation and sound sleep. I must educate you that Flurazepam is an addictive drug with abuse potential. It is prescribed for initial few days and should be discontinued over a period of next few days.  If a person continues to use this drug for weeks, over a period of time tolerance develops and more dose is required to produce the same desired effect. Apparently this has happened with you. Apparently you did not went for review by your doctor in time and continued to take the earlier prescribed medicines. Due to continuous use of more than 3 months, you might have developed tolerance to this earlier dose and now not getting enough sleep. Your doctor has taken a right decision to discontinue this drug but it is always better to taper it gradually. Cymbalta (Duloxetine) is a good antidepressant with nice anxiolytic property, tolerance does not develop, and it is not addictive, hence suited for long term use. So I consider it is a good switch. Lunesta (Eszopiclone) is  good for sleep induction and maintenance. So it may take care of insomnia due to Flurazepam withdrawal. Nortriptyline 25 mg is a suboptimal dose for anxiety/ depression and it can be stopped without much difficulty.You may discuss these issues with your doctor. I hope he may be agreed to taper the dose of Flurazepam before stopping it completely. I hope it answers your query. i wish you all the best."},{"Patient":"Hi I have dizziness that gets worse during the day - seem to be fine upon awakening and moving around, but towards lunchtime onwards, it worsens until I feel nauseas.It is also exacerbated by looking around, turning my head and movement.I have just come off Venlafaxine (suddenly) upon the advice of my Dr, for one week as he believes I may have been having a drug reaction to it. 335mg per day was the dosage. My face is covered in a red, raw and hot rash as well. Also low grade headache. Been like this for about 1 week. and 3 days into 1 week off the Venlafaxine.Sara","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCM for your health related queriesI can understand your concern. You were on high dose of Venlafaxine and have stopped the drug abruptly, this has precipitated the withdrawal symptoms. The symptoms like dizziness that is worsening progressively, nausea, vomiting are occurring due to serotonin withdrawal syndrome. The low grade headache, rash on face is possibly due to withdrawal. I'd advise you to call your doctor or visit an ER if symptoms increase in severity. Take plenty of fluids and remain calm. For nausea, vomiting you can use OTC antacids. In my opinion the drug should be started again and then doses can be reduced gradually. Call your doctor for details. Thanks, I hope this helps you. Take care.

During this time I was able to successfully teach at CCSD NV for over 22 years, I stopped those medications and soon was diagnosed with severe depression disorder...couldn t teach, can barely get out of bed...on disability........I try self medicating but it s awful, Is there any way I could get back on those 3 prescriptions so I can function?","Doctor":"Hi, . Thanks for asking your query at this forum.We understand your concern. I have read your question carefully and understood it. I will try my best to answer it.As you told, you obtained the above mentioned psychotropics and used it for recreation purpose without any specific indication for many years. These medicines have high abuse potential and they are highly addictive. Apparently you got addicted to these drugs and now suffering from withdrawal discomfort. Let me explain this for you.The first medicine named Didrex (Benzphetamine) is a psychostimulant group of drug which may be prescribed for reducing appetite in obese persons. This drug produces a false sense of enhanced well being and overconfidence for some time. Apparently you might have like this effect after initial use and experimented again and again to have the same desired effect. As you reveal, you could obtain this prescription drug and regularly abused it without any significant indication.  So, you had develop addiction of the drug. This drug causes insomnia, so to overcome this side effect you might be using Valium (Diazepam) and another strong sleeping pill daily.If the drug Didrex is not available to the body it experiences various withdrawal discomforts like mood swings, irritability, excessive sleep, restlessness, decreased energy, sadness of mood and anxiety and panic attacks. Apparently this is happening with you (as you mentioned experiencing severe depression and inability to get up from bed). These withdrawal symptoms mimic a depressive episode or an anxiety disorder and a history of sudden abstinence from prolonged, habitual and regular use of the drug is very helpful in diagnosis. Although you may not accept it but it is obvious that currently you are having strong craving for the substance (as you want back those prescription drugs). This further points towards dependence to these psychotropic medicines. I encourage you to honestly tell your doctor about your drug abuse habit and thus you may help him in reaching a correct diagnosis. Accordingly you may be put on a de-addiction therapy to cure this illness. Trying to get back those prescriptions is not a remedy of your situation as it may further push you on the path of dependence.I hope it answers your query. I wish you a better drug free life."},{"Patient":"i Have been having heavy labored breathing.  I feel axious work from home, get little excercise and am overweight.  I have slight asthma.

And am thinking with stress from work I am having some anxiety issues with out of shape lungs.  What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi, . Thanks for asking your query at this forum.We understand your concern. I have read your question carefully and understood it. I will try my best to answer it.As you told, you work from home and apparently having a routine with little physical activity. This is certainly not a healthy routine and you also accept it. It is nice to hear that you started working out now a days. A stress free lifestyle consists a regular daily routine with early morning awakening before sunrise, doing yoga/meditation/relaxation exercise going for jog for some time, having balanced nutritious diet (with lots of fresh fruits and salads and without much fatty foods), having some time for recreation and socialization (spending good time with family members and friends), playing outdoor games, listening soothing relaxing music for some time in evening, taking warm water bath an hour before going to bed and having adequate rest and sleep. Are you missing these things in your routine? If yes then it is time to change now. You may have to find out some time from your busy routine for these essential activities. Since you have slight asthma, you should try to be in fresh air and in well ventilated places. Asthma does not change the shape of lung, so you should not worry on this aspect. Overweight may cause heavy laboured breathing and worsening of asthma. With above mentioned routine you may reduce your weight, get a good body shape and a stress free life.

My cousin is a year older than I and had a ministries at 27. I recently woke up with friends over and thought they had drugged me as their voices sounded metallic and I seem traces of them when they moved. I have had what I though to be sleep paralysis. I also recently thought there was s girl in my house but the person laying next to me did not however I texted my friends & took the dog out so I did actually get up. At any rate when I went to the hospital they tested my blood and urine. Said I m fine.","Doctor":"Hi, . Thanks for asking your query at this forum.We understand your concern. I have read your question carefully and understood it. I will try my best to answer it.As you told there is family history of bipolar disorder, epilepsy, narcolepsy and aneurysm and recently you had a strange perceptual experience of hearing unusual sounds of friends, seeing traces of people moving out and having a belief that a girl was there with you at your house. Since these symptoms occurred suddenly, it points towards acute confusional state either may be due to intoxication with some substance like marijuana or due to effect of epilepsy. Since you became alright soon and could get your dog out for a walk it goes more towards an epileptic fit. After recovery from an epileptic fit a person remains confused for some time, unable to move limbs initially for few minutes, can hear unusual voices or can see unusual things. This is a temporary condition and it goes of gradually over a period of next 20-30 minutes. Apparently it has happened with you. A negative blood and urine report further rules out possibility of drugging. You may clarify further from your friends who might have witnessed the possible epileptic fit. If you had noticed tongue bite/involuntary micturation/defecation etc then it further goes towards epileptic fit. It is better to get evaluated further and get assessed personally by a neurologist who may advise you for EEG and MRI brain. I hope it answers your query.

She'd repeatedly asked for my assurance and wash her hand to make sure she doesn't touch the painted kitchen cabinet, chandelier in the bedroom, mirror in the bathroom and among other things. Nothing gets done in the house. I've been doing all housekeeping, and working a full time job with busy schedule. She's blaming everything on me and I cause all her problems. I feel like walking on eggshell. Anything I do can be wrong and cause her to be angry and feel her belongings are damaged. For example recently, I opened a mail once with mail cutter nearby her handbag, and she's panicking about it, and feels her bag has broken pieces of cutter. That's just one of the example among other things that I can hardly explain here.I want to understand what's happening to her.

Could I obtain a prescription for this medication?","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCM for your health related queriesI can understand your concern. The symptoms like exhausted feeling, poor concentration etc can occur due to persistent stress or mild depression. But some medical causes should be ruled out to make diagnosis of stress as cause of these symptoms. Low vitamin B12 levels, poor nutrition, iron deficiency anaemia, hypothyroidism, hyper cortisol levels etc are common medical causes that should be ruled out for these symptoms. Please consult a doctor for proper evaluation and investigations.Vitamin B12 supplements, Omega 3 Fatty Acids tabs help to reduce these symptoms and are very useful. If symptoms persist then visit a psychiatrist for treatment. Thanks, Hope this helps you.

And you were symptom free during all those years and your symptoms reemerged after stopping the medicine. This gives an indication to restart your treatment , and the best choice would be the medicine that you were stable with, which you have already started. I see you are concerned with weight gain , but usually celexa is not associated with much weight gain issues, and rest of the antidepressants are no way better in this regard (weight). also SSRI usually would take about 4-6 week time to act effectively ( even if you were on it for 10 years), so if you were my patient i would have advised you to wait with 20 mg of celexa dosage for a few weeks. but you should definitely discuss these issues with your psychiatrist. hope i answered your query - any followup queries are welcome - if satisfied please rate the answer"},{"Patient":"Hi, last night while I was studying I began to notice that the left side of my body had became very heavy feeling.

The symptoms like persistent tiredness, pains in body can occur due to depression but other medical causes for these symptoms must be ruled out before. One possible cause for such symptoms is low vitamin B12 levels and iron deficiency anaemia. Visit a doctor and get your B12 and haemoglobin tests done to rule out these conditions. Hypothyroidism can also cause similar symptoms and should be ruled out. Get your thyroid function tests done to rule out the condition. Once medical causes are ruled out then we are left with depression as most common possibility for your symptoms. Visit a psychiatrist for help. Drugs especially SNRI drugs like Duloxetine, Venlafaxine etc are commonly used in depression with somatic symptoms. These drugs would help to improve your pain and tiredness symptoms.

First of all I'd like to tell you that it is common in individuals to have increased anxiety, tremors and restlessness when they start taking drugs like Escitalopram for first 7-10 days. This rebound increase in anxiety can be reduced by starting the drug with low doses. In most individuals this anxiety decreases by self in about 10 days. You have persistent side effects with Escitalopram even with low doses so in my opinion you should consult your doctor again for some more safe drug. Continue to take the Clonazepam 0.25 mg on PRN basis for anxiety and stress. Don't use this drug regularly as this is known to cause dependence.

I then had unprotected sex again (after my period) with my boyfriend several times but don t recall the dates (somewhere from March 10) .

The ultrasound based on the measurement of the embryo showed that my due date is on December 12, 2014 (my doctor didn t ask me when my last period was) I am also a bit confused about two other things as well - the first one being when I use the due date calculator by sonogram (reverse calculation) it says that I conceived on March 21, (how long does it take to conceive after sex) then the second calculation based on my first day of LMP which was March 16, shows that conception date was March 30.

Sperm life within moist vagina is upto 48 hours. If sperm cell could not find a way into the ovum, within this 48 hours, the sperm cell dies.

Doctor said 7 weeks and your calculation is 6 weeks. The matter of 7 to 10 days tolerance is normal.

Her anxiety is purely due to her insomnia and vice versa. During those three months and even now, she must be taking pills for sleeping and possibly those pills are not working because of her brain wave pattern. Doctors must have analyzed her brain too to determine any other possibilities. I suppose there no other possibilities or brain or neurological causes. In that case, she should be given counseling to educate herself about insomnia and related anxiety. If you become anxious and stressed, it is natural you don't get sleep. Sleep depends on physical activities, exercise, mental physical fatigue, stress and anxiety.

The symptoms like agitation, screaming episodes, abnormal behaviour etc can occur in ADHD but considering his age chances of ADD as new diagnosis are very less. His symptoms suggest that he has some components of bipolar disorder. In bipolar disorder individuals develop violent, aggressive episodes and they screams on other family member. He is not letting others to talk to you and this could also be one symptoms of bipolar disorder. I'd advise you to take him to a psychiatrist for help.For his aggressive episodes medicines like mood stabilisers as Sodium Valproate, Lithium Carbonate can be used. These medicines will help to reduce the violent episodes. Some times low dose antipsychotics are used. These drugs also help to control the episodes. Please consult a doctor for prescription.

You have persisting headache and problem in getting tensed quickly. The headache is present chiefly on top of head and is associated with chest and epigastric discomfort.

Raised ESR and severe throbbing pulsatile headache chiefly in temples can be the presenting feature of temporal arthritis, though your symptoms are different. Still I'd advise you to visit a doctor for evaluation and to rule out this. In tension headache low dose Amitriptyline, Nortriptyline etc drugs are used.

The symptoms like fear of death, worries about family, anticipatory anxiety that who will look after your family after death, pains in chest, fear etc are occurring due to severe anxiety most probably.

Any information would be appreciated as I have been prescribed this with no explanation as to what each drug is used to treat specifically.  I do have depression but no symptons of schizophrenia or manic episodes.  Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCM for your health related queriesI can understand your concern. Zispin is Mirtazapine and you are taking 45 mg of its doses. You are also on 25 mg of Olanzapine. In my opinion these are not the low doses. Starting dose of Mirtazapine is 7.5-15 mg while for Olanzapine is 5-10 mg per day. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant drug. The drug helps in moderate to severe depression. The high doses are required in resistant depression. The drug is known to cause sedation and weight gain at high doses. Olanzapine has been probably added to your prescription to stabilise the mood. Though there is no history of mania or psychotic symptoms in your case still the drug can help in controlling mood and will strengthen the actions of Mirtazapine in your case.

From the given symptoms it is almost evident that you are suffering from social anxiety disorder or social phobia. Social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, is an anxiety disorder in which a person has an excessive and unreasonable fear of social situations. Anxiety (intense nervousness) and self-consciousness arise from a fear of being closely watched, judged, and criticized by others.A person with social anxiety disorder is afraid that he or she will make mistakes, look bad, and be embarrassed or humiliated in front of others. The fear may be made worse by a lack of social skills or experience in social situations. The anxiety can build into a panic attack. As a result of the fear, the person endures certain social situations in extreme distress or may avoid them altogether. In addition, people with social anxiety disorder often suffer \\"anticipatory\\" anxiety -- the fear of a situation before it even happens -- for days or weeks before the event. In many cases, the person is aware that the fear is unreasonable, yet is unable to overcome it.For social anxiety disorder, the most effective treatment currently available is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Medication may also be used to help ease the symptoms of social anxiety disorder so that CBT is more effective. please consult a psychiatrist /  psychologist.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

The ideal way to decrease the incidence of withdrawal symptoms is by gradually tapering the drug before completely stopping it. As you have already stopped taking it, you might have these symptoms only for a couple of days after which you will be feeling normal.

There are many medicines for this like Atomoxetine, Methylphenidate and Dexedrine. These medicines are costly and have many bad side effects like addiction. Look, do not give your kid any medicines. Just make him join a sport or some activity that requires attention. See what your kid likes. Some kids like to play chess, some like to play sports, some like to study or read or program a computer. Thus slowly your kid will develop his attention and judging skills. Drugs are bad and the last resort when everything fails. Attention, concentration, is just like a muscle, it has to be exercised in a gym to develop. A muscle can also develop by taking harmful drugs like steroids. Think. Think. Think. Spend time with your kid today, and get him enrolled in some exercise. Best wishes, Dr. Neel Kudchadkar."},{"Patient":"I'm a 40 year old male and have had bad ocd for about 20 years now.

You are 40 years old and have OCD since last 20 years. Now after catching mice and then cleaning house completely you have started having anxiety about getting Hantavirus infection. First of all I would like to reassure you that such infections don't usually spread by just cleaning the house. Usually such infections spread more commonly in closed, damp areas like old ships, godowns etc. Not all mice are infected and prolonged contact is needed to get infection. So as per my opinion there is no need to worry. The fear of infection is probably due to severe anxiety you are having and this has got aggravated because of your history of OCD.

Cortisone is steroid hormone and it can cause mood swings and this result in calming effects. Ritalin is amphetamine and the drug is a stimulant drug. The drug helps to control symptoms of ADD and result in improvement of concentration and reduction of hyperactivity. The inability to stay in conversations, impatience, fidgeting etc could be sign of attention deficit but need proper evaluation and treatment. Cortisone would result in temporary calming effect.

Your mother had lock jaw and then you have developed fear and this causes constant dreams that your jaws got locked up. This is nothing but severe anxiety (anticipatory) and there is no need to fear. Slight pressure in nostrils and head is also probably due to this anxiety. Try to relax yourself and reassure yourself. Even if your mother had lock jaw this doesnt mean that you would have lock jaw.

For the last 3 1/2 years, I have been on medication for adult ADHD that has truly transformed my life. It was at the urging of my family that I originally sought help for symptoms that I have had since childhood. I have been very stable on: Generic Concerta (methylphenidate) 54 mg ER: one each AM as well as generic Adderall 20mg each afternoon as needed. I am in need of a psychiatrist in the Van Buren county of Arkansas who would be wiling to renew the above medications. I have no allergies whatsoever. I do take generic Lipitor for a slightly high cholesterol and even though my diet is excellent and I exercise regularly, it is still necessary to have a bit of help with medication. I have no history of heart problems or problems with blood pressure and my family history is negative for that as well. I am retired and enjoying the Ozarks in close proximity to my relatives. Last week a friend and I traveled 3 hours to see a psychiatrist whose receptionist assured me should be no problem in renewing my medicines. We actually felt as if we had entered the Twilight Zone, lol. The psychiatrist insisted on seeing us both. She went into great detail regarding her medical crisis of the past year. She gave us a tour of her facility and showed us a chair that she helped invent for depression. We were shown the many gifts bestowed on her by her patients as well as pictures of her with celebrities as proof that she has been a psychiatrist to the stars in past years. After about 1 1/2 hours, she revealed that I would need to see a psychiatrist closer to my home. She offered to provide names of specialists close to me but her receptionist still has no such messages for me. She does seem like a lovely lady but it did come across as more than a bit unprofessional. Thank you in advance for helping me find a solution to my situation. Warmest regards, Sandy Umstott Anesthetist, Retired","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I see that you have vast knowledge about medical field and other aspect.

Bipolar disorder with mania may present with anger outbursts and such individuals show abnormal projection to other people.

For the last two years he has had consistently low levels of testosterone with normal levels of LH and FSH. A year ago blood work showed he had low total t4 but normal TSH. This week his free t3 and free t4 were as low as they could get withing normal range. His t4 was .8 and that was the lowest in the range. However, his TSH was on the low end of normal. Despite undergoing testosterone replacement therapy for a year his levels never increased. He has developed severe mood problems and was diagnosed Bipolar type 2 a year ago after a hospitalization. He has very severe depression and absolutely no energy. He never has euphoric mania. He only experiences periods of terrible rage consistent with IED, racing thoughts, and the need for activity. Even in his high states he has no energy. Growing up he was overweight but lost 60 pounds. Later he rapidly gained a hundred pounds and lost a patch of hair out of his beard. He has always felt bad about his chest as well and felt that even at his thinnest he too much fat there. He has been rapid cycling and experiencing mixed states. Also, he has not had any break or normal period since suddenly developing his mood problems two years ago. I do not understand why his pituitary sending hormones do not increase when he has low levels of hormones such as thyroid and testosterone. Is it possible he has an endocrine problem worsening bipolar? Or could the bipolar be a misdiagnosis?","Doctor":"Hi! I'm Dr. Neel Kudchadkar and I will help you with this problem. I would like to politely request you to give me some information about your husband, such as 1) Did he have any thyroid problems BEFORE a bipolar II affective disorder (Hypomania with dysphoria and depression: BPAD Type 2.) Did the bipolar issues surface first and then, a diagnosis of thyroid/ pituatory / HPT was made? 3) Regardless of the hormone levels currently in his blood serum, I would state with confidence that Lithium is the culprit behind the thyroid problem. Lithium Carbonate is the most common drug prescribed for Bipolar II, and causes thyroid problems. I would ask you to stop Lithium if it is being taken and to try another medication called as Lamotrigine at a dose of 100mg at night after food. This drug (Lamotrigine) was designed exactly for the state of mind your husband is in. I would state with confidence that the Bipolar diagnosis is 80% probably right. I'd like to have a conversation with you as regards the details of this case, and being a neutral observer, you could provide me with these details. Kindly provide me with the details, including what current medications your husband is taking, because these are important, for his cure.

From past few months my mind is not in my control.. Last June I came to know that my Husband was talked with a Lady on a daily basis(only one time after 11.30 pm and his duty over at that time). Once i saw her number i asked him that who is this and he told me that it is a sales man.. After few months again i saw that number and called and came to know that that was a lady. Then I asked to my husband about her and he told me that she is a Cancer Patient and she dont have anyone so she asked to my Hubby to call her daily. After that I called her and she told me that she is a cancer patient and she dont have one Kidney too and she loved my husband and my husband also loved her but my husband never express his love to her.. My husband thrown his old sim card and told me that he never loved anybody except me and he dont want to talk anybody without my permission. After few days I became a mental patient and treated by a Doctor. Unfortunately we couldnt complete my treatment and the Doctor suggested me Opripol, Zosert and Anxozap Tablets. 2014 August 25 i tried to commit to suicide with Anxozap tablets.. I have two beautiful kids and I always thinking about my husband and that lady, Doctor. Still I cant sleep well, eat well and I often crying in the night. I know that my husband will not cheat me but i couldnt control myself. I still asking him about that lady . Sometimes I am thinking that I want to kill her and you know doctor she is not a patient and she is a fraud and she want to talk with my husband so she lied him that she is a cancer patient. I know all these things but i cant forget her words. I want to die doctor.Please help me please","Doctor":"Dear SavithaWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Let me be very clear in my approach. Nobody can help you die except god. You suspected your husband with such a venom and because of that you had to be diagnosed mental patient. why would you like to do so? You have never saw your husband with that girl. You just suspect and suspect. I don't see any reason or proof of the relationship between your husband and that girl. He lied to you, I can understand. There are so many occasions in a family relationship, where lies are common. Can you say for sure that you never lied to your husband? Your husband clearly told you he do not have any relationship with that girl and he promised to love you and you only. You did not believe him and instead believed circumstances. In family relationship, you should learn to believe your husband rather than circumstances. Then family life becomes peaceful.

I have never had any internal problems of any kind...only injuries in motorcycle accident at 16. I was the youngest licensed acupuncturist in US in 1976, herbologist and nutritionist. Today at around 10am pst after drinking a quart of freshly made watermelon juice, a daily routine, I noticed I had leaked fluid on my pj bottoms and saw what at first I thought was blood on my pj s and then upon closer exam I saw a drop of blood at penus opening! Being an expert on meridian energy cycles and cleansing phenomena, I thought that the Juice I had consumed ten minutes before discovery...had caused a cleansing action of some kind with my kidneys via bladder. I was able to urinate a normal pale yellow color and the bleeding had stopped. I rested on back after drinking a glass of water to help continue any flushing of my kidney-bladder system and after another couple of hours need to urinate again and had no problem. I felt an urge to defficate and it was a combination of stool and small diarrhea discharge, followed by a small discharge (teaspoon) of blood from end of penis and then normal urination followed. I continued to rest through afternoon to about 3 p.m. and for the following hour and a half still felt fine. Actually I was feeling great all day except for the anxiety of what was happening... And then around 5pm...which is the time of the day for the kidney and bladder Chi to activate the late afternoon pee...and again I found a little more blood in the urination in the first moments of peeing...followed by normal urination to completion. Now the winter time of the year is considered the time of nature s cleansing for the kidney and bladder organs in Chinese medicine tradition... And so I hope I am having a cleansing action in my body...but of course I wonder what other medical view of these symtoms may imply...and so as I have always been my own healthcare provider...I thought to go online to see what advice a doctor would advice giving the events I have described above.

I have, since childhood, suffered from periods of relatively sudden (sometimes magnified by a bad situation) periods of sadness.  My symptoms are feelings of despair and the urge to express sadness (crying, isolating myself, etc.) that sometimes seem to occur without cause.  These episodes are sometimes crippling for short periods of time.  I also seem to take on other peoples feeling of sadness.  I am not comfortable watching new events about tragedies and funerals are an absolute 'no go' whether I know the deceased or not.  During my late teens and 20's, I was able to self fix or correct the issues almost immediately.  I seem to have lost that ability.  My question is this...  I have met or had in my life, certain people that, for the periods of time that I associate with them, whether at that time I am in direct contact with them or not, seem to eliminate all (all!!) of my issues.  During these time (most recently a two+ year period) I have no memorable episodes.  The people that I have experienced this with in my lifetime are few (maybe 3 or 4).  Sometimes it was immediately obvious and sometimes it didn't occur to me until much later or until after that person was no longer part of my world.

There is another angle to look at these events. Do your husband has any other fantasies you are aware of? If fantasies are his habits and you see them are general, then it is fine.

Fantasy prone personality (FPP) is a disposition or personality trait in which a person experiences a lifelong extensive and deep involvement in fantasy.

Medicines: Lamotragine, Seratreline, an sometimes Benadryl Conditions: Mild cerebral Palsy, Anxiety Disorder, ADHD, and depression. Let me first start from the beginning. This all started shortly after my child was born. I thought it was just after birth symptoms. After a while I got diagnosed with anxiety disorder. My doctor rarely takes me seriously. I feel like it is because of my mental status. However I know the difference between a anxiety/panic attack, and when something else is wrong. No to mention over time these symptoms have grown worse, and more frequent. I also notice Also my meds almost completely stop them from happening. I have been a lot better while on them. I have been taking them for 3 years maybe a little longer.My weight has stayed the same pretty much. I tried eating healthier, and they got worse. I also excursive more regularly. Symptoms: Random pain in different spots Trouble breathing when exercising. Excessive sweating at random times of the day. Getting overheated easily. Feeling sick, and slightly faint if I do not eat regular meals with snacks in between. Almost always have some sort of mucus build up in my sinuses. Feeling hungry sometimes even after big meals. Fluctuating blood pressure that goes up and down. Heart palpitations when exercising. I have been tested for Diabetes. I do not have it. I have had my cheat x rayed to look at my heart. Cat scan to.

I will try to help you. With whatever information you have provided I can understand that you developed post brain surgery depression, that is a quite common illness after an insult to brain like stroke/trauma/surgery.As you told, you are taking psychotropic medicines since last about four years. Psychotropics may have their own adverse effect. The present symptoms like slurred speech, tremors of hands, involuntary jerking of arms and difficulty balancing points towards a condition called extra pyramidal symptoms. Extra pyramidal symptoms are a group of symptoms that occurs due to use of psychotropic medications and are characterized by tightness/rigidity of muscles causing difficulty in movement, slurred speech, difficulty balancing, tightness of chest, tremors of hands and feet and involuntary dystonic movements. These symptoms may occur at any time after starting the medicine and are well known to occur with tab Aripiprazole (Abilify). Old age and brain insult predisposes a person to these effects which is true in your case.There are many symptoms in you that point towards this adverse effect. I advise you to consult your treating psychiatrist and discuss these issues who may add you some medicine like trihexyphenidyl/ promethazine to your therapy to cure you.I hope it answers your question.I wish you all the best."},{"Patient":"Hello, I ve got a common question.

The child does not sit at a place still & runs here and there. Child does not complete a work and before ending picks up another task again just to leave it incomplete too. Due to poor attention the child does not pay attention at teacher's/parent's words leading to poor learning at school and non adherence to elder's instructions at home. The child can not register things and events in memory due to lack of attention and concentration. While writing they dont use punctuation marks and do silly grammatical errors.If most of the above things are true in your child's case then he may be sufferring from ADHD.The children  with ADHD can not wait for their turn, are often impulsive and may quarrel with others on minor issues. Sometimes the child feels an inner intense compulsion to do certain things that may violate others's right. Thus conduct disorder is a co-morbidity often, as it happened in your child's case.If a child like your son with such a problem is brought to me, I will do following things to have a holistic view of problem.1.   IQ testing to rule out co-morbid Mental Retardation.2.   MRI brain to find out any structural pathology if there.3.   Screening for \\"Autistic spectrum disorder\\"4.   Detail history and EEG to rule out any seizure activity.Secondly your concern is right as the child with ADHD is not immune for other mental illness & he very well may have more than one psychiatric problems at a time.We have to treat child as a whole not as a ADHD patient only. Parents & teachrrs have a very important role in therapy as they are well aware of the child's problem and also readily available for behavioural modification.You must consult a good child psychiattist who may evaluate your child personally in detail. He may prescribre certain medicines for his illness and behaviour control. He may also tailor a behavioural therapy programme as needed and may  involve you also in the therapy of your child.With constant effort he can be cured. I wish you & your child all the best.Hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"I was on Wellbutrin XL 150 mg for 6 days and 300 mg for another 6 days to treat depression.

Schizophrenia is a psychotic illness in which the person has abnormal perception, absurd thinking, decline of higher mental function, deterioration in social and occupational functioning and significant personal sufferings for years. The patient may claim to hear unusual voices which others deny to hear. This is called auditory hallucination. Initially the voices come for a short period and the person feels strange and does not understand what to do. He/ she gradually may start believing on those voices as frequency and intensity of voices increases with passage of time.Often these voices comment/discuss derogatory about the person and sometimes these may suggest or command the person to do certain act. Sometimes the person may harm herself/ himselfs under the infuence of these voices. As you have experienced, she has a self-talking behaviour since last many years, has harmed herself once  and now she is claiming a clear two way  conversation with that voice. It appears that she is having auditory hallucination(auditory hallucination is one of the commonest symptoms in psychosis like schizophrenia), and apparently these voices are unpleasant or commanding in nature that might have provoked the episode of self harm in past.Since the onset of symptoms are in childhood and has been continuing for years it shows poor awareness of caregiver about the symptoms of  illness. It is never too late. You must consult a good child and adolescent psychiatrist and encourage your daughter to discuss her symptoms honestly so that the diagnosis can be finalised. If I would have been her doctor , I would have adviced her for brain imaging, certain other investigations, to take some antipsychotic medicines under supervision of a family member and to attend psycho-educative classes regularly. Medicines and supportive theapy can bring remission to illness.Hope this has helped you.

Take care Regards, Dr Manuel C See IV, Urologist"},{"Patient":"I have been dating a 59 year old man for nearly a year and have experienced multiple episodes where he says one thing one time, another thing another time--usually the opposite thing. An example is that one time, in an attempt to get me to remain in the relationship, he said he would propose to me in six months. A couple of weeks latter, he denied ever saying that to me, and any time I ve mentioned, hoping for an explanation, he remains silent. There were other times he said things like I ve been single for 14 years and tired of it, want to get married . A short time later, he said I ve been single for 14 years and do not want to get married . He also seems often unable to make decisions, unless either I or one of his family (usually his sister) urge him to decide. He recently spent over 6 months trying to get some very simple repairs done to his house. He insisted he couldn t get anyone to do them. I finally intervened and got a contractor I know to do the work. I do know that he has, in the past, one time 15 years ago, and another 1 year ago, had what the family refers to a mental breakdowns, the last time spending a month in a psychiatric unit, with no recovery, until seen by a psychiatrist, after he left the hospital. Not being a family member, I am not privy to his diagnosis. I just know that he takes a large number of medications. Another thing he does is sometimes come out with totally inappropriate, and what I consider bizarre, comments. A couple of examples: At the end of a regular checkup by his family Dr., after discovering they d both graduated H.S. in the same year, he said to her, Too bad we didn t know each other in high school, we might have got together . He couldn t understand why she just turned and left the room, not answering. He also said recently to a grocery store check out person (a girl): You re pretty good. You re pretty and you re good. Now, maybe that o.k., but it seemed strange to me, the way he later went around, boasting of what he d said, as if it was a really brilliant remark. The latest version of his lack of planning or whatever this suggests, is that he s been off-on re. marrying me for many months, in a very confusing way. So, I gave him the date of May 31 as a time for him to make a decision. The above described self-contradictory remarks re. marriage caused me to try to break-up with him several times, but I truly love the guy--the part that is sweet, kind, very lovable/affectionate. Anyway, with May 31 still a couple of months away, and without ever proposing to me or telling me of his decision, last night, at dinner, his sister said he remarked that She (meaning me) will sell her house here and move to ____ (where he has a house). I will rent out my house. We will buy a house there . There s nothing wrong with all he said, except we ve never made the decision to marry. I sure could use some professional help now. He really is nearly driving me nuts, and I myself am hovering close to depression (which I ve had in the past) due to his disorganized thinking and behavior. What would be the possible cause(s) of his disorganized thinking?","Doctor":"Thanks for being concerned about your partners health. I would directly answer your question by stating that your partner has a thinking problem. You mention that he was hospitalized a long time back, for a mental breakdown. There is only one possibility. I will politely inform you that, given the graphic descriptions of your partners behaviour, he may be suffering from Schizophrenia, Paranoid sub type. He might also be suffering from OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), in tandem with schizophrenia or as a distinct illness. I have answered your query by making a diagnosis based on your detailed description of your partners behavioural patterns, thoughts, speech, memory and actions as a schizophrenic with OCD, or as a person who suffers from Obsessions alone. Please take care of your partner. He's dilly dallying the marriage, but he's not doing these things to you on purpose. He just cannot help it. He needs professional help and medication. You must regularly give him the medication and make sure that he takes it in front of you.If you can accomplish this, he'll become \\"normal\\" and take the right decision to marry you.

It can also be used in many different illnesses including drug abuse (in particular).The tablets come in 100 millionths of a gram dosages. I will directly answer your question by stating that clonidine, when taken regularly in high dosing can cause hypotension to occur in a person. In your case, your BP was 98/57, which is a result of that medication. The reason your BP has shot upto 104/87 is that you must gradually stop taking clonidine. You must taper it off under medical supervision, else you get rebound hypertension. Please see a psychiatrist as regards your BPAD and PTSD, and voice all your concerns.

It made her like a zombie but at the same time gave her the shakes and made her anxious (couldn t sit still, etc). On February 18th, the psychiatrist took her completely off the invega but she still has the anxious sypmtoms... is this normal? How long does it take to get this out of her system. The Dr. said she should be feeling a little better by now... HELP!!!","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to Health Care Magic.We understand your concern.I am Dr Alok Sinha, MD Psychiatry, from India.I will try to help you.Hyponatremia is known to cause a delirious state in a person leading to poor orientation about person, place and time, difficulty in focusing and shifting attention at will and altered sleep wake cycle. The person suddenly starts behaving strange, may claim that other may harm him/her or plotting against him/her. He/she may also hear strange voices, at the same time others may deny hearing the same. The person appears confused and puzzled, seems to be talking nonsense and often may shout or weep without obvious reason.  In such situation it may be necessary to start a antipsychotic medicines for some time, as in your mother's case the doctor started Invega (Paliperidone) a well known antipsychotic medicine. If hyponatremia is corrected then these behavioural oddities get resolved spontaneously and the antipsychotic medicine may be stopped gradually. So, your doctors have rightly decided to stop antipsychotic medicine now.Sometimes antipsychotic drugs have their own side effects like tremors of hands and feet, rigidity of limbs, anxiety, inner restlessness, tendency to move always and inability to sit at a place (called \\"akathisia\\").  Apparently your mother suffered this adverse effect.  You may discuss these issues with her treating psychiatrist who may prescribe her few medicines like clonazepam and trihexyphenidyl for some days to relieve her symptoms.Hope this answers your question. I wish her all the best."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Actually I want to ask you something related to my family. My father, is now in his 50s and before two years he started doubting my mother.

I have never felt any guilt or remorse. I wouldn't care if anyone died, even friends or family, or anyone else I claimed to love. For instance, I'm currently with a girl. I tell her I love her every night. But whenever I think of losing her, or her dying, I feel nothing. I think I might feel disappointment, but not out of love or whatever the hell I'm supposed to feel if that happens, but out of the fact that she still continues to associate me despite knowing that there's something... off... about me, including the fact that I have homicidal urges, so I think I'd feel disappointment if I lost her out of... boredom, I guess. Moving on, I manipulate people, and even events, to get what I want,  again without guilt or remorse, even if I destroy someone or more than one someone in the process. I also cannot empathize with others. For an example, recently a \\"friend\\" told me her sister was raped and killed.  My response? \\"Okay. That's... interesting, I guess. Does that really matter?\\" I mean, I acted like I cared, but couldn't really care less. Also, when I watch the news with someone and they go, \\"Isn't that horrible?\\", I either feel nothing or am disappointed no one died, because that would make the news more interesting. Honestly, the only reason I don't kill people, including family members, is because I'd probably get caught, not because it's \\"wrong\\". I don't even get what would be wrong about it. Everyone dies eventually anyway. So anyway? Am I a sociopath? I'm only interested in knowing because I think a professional opinion would be amusing.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I can understand your emotions.

Dehydration/electrolyte imbalance may predispose a person to this illness. It can be relieved with rest, taking water and ORS and temporary use of some muscle relaxants.

I suffer from anxiety and haven t been able to leave the house since I got out of the hospital. I had cellulitis with sepsis and they gave me silvadene,but its gone now. I finished antibiotics and am just try to find something to help my leg wound heal safely.","Doctor":"Thanks for your concern about your leg.The anxiety you are experiencing is due to genuine concerns about the wound in your leg. You feel that it may get worse, or it is causing you physical discomfort. This is making you anxious. You have a right to be anxious, in this situation at least.If you experience pain or fever (increased body temperature), then I'd ask you to immediately go to the hospital and get yourself examined. They will probably give you an over the counter medication like Tylenol (Paracetamol) or they might prescribe you some Advil (Ibuprofen).Silvadene (Silver Sulphadiazine) is a cream used to deal with these issues, and if, as you say, even after finishing the antibiotics, your wound has not yet healed, then you might seriously want to visit the hospital or a local doctor to attend to your wound till it heals. Your anxiety is your mind's way of reminding you that you have not addressed certain issues in your life.If on the other hand you are house bound, and cannot go outside of the house to seek medical help, or are fearful of situations in which you have to mingle among crowds of people, or are fearful of open spaces, then I would seriously suggest that you see a counselor or a therapist as regards your fears and anxieties. Please do not take medicines for \\"anxiety\\" that you might find on the internet. Also do not take any illegal substances (\\"drugs\\") for your \\"anxiety\\".It will lead to your anxiety blooming and increasing. It's always a bad idea.

The fact is that Strattera (Atomoxetine) was prescribed for your son's ADHD (Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder). You state that your son is also taking Synthroid (Levothyroxine), which a replacement for a natural hormone (chemical) that occurs in the body. I will directly answer you question by saying that Prozac (Flouxetine) when given with Strattera, causes problems in blood pressure and heart rate. This is dependent on the exact dose of Prozac that is given and your son's weight. If you would wish to continue Prozac therapy, then you would definitely have to go to a Doctor who would precisely calculate the right dose of Prozac for your son.

In these occasions, even though we are angry, we do not care, because in the first one, we need to keep our cool just to be peaceful. If you react, your peace will be lost. In the second instance, if you react, you will loose your job.Just analyze these things. Now under this pretext, tell me, can't you control / manage your anger?.

My name is Amanda and I am 17, almost 18, years old. I m really worried about my mother, whose name is Sandra and is 55 years old. You see, when she was little, she was mentally abused by her mother for many years, and then when she grew up and got married, she was physically abused by her husband. It has been many years since then, but I fear she has become the product of psychologically abusive parenting. She constantly blames things on me and everybody else even if she is to blame, she regularly makes me feel bad about myself by doing, for example, things that require physical labor, and then complaining about it later that I did not help her due to whatever reason, which is usually because i was sleeping or doing homework. She makes me feel bad about myself in general, so much that i ve had to see councilors in the past due to depression. Of course, it wasn t just her that had made me feel sad, I must note. I know it s not her fault she s like this, but sometimes i can t help but getting aggravated and arguing back because I get so annoyed being blamed, accused, criticized, and put down all the time. However, the unfortunate thing is that i ve tried to get her help many times before in the past, but she always refused it and thinks that she is perfectly fine, when I see she is clearly not. But within this year and the next, I will be graduating and getting ready to go to university, so I do not want to leave her by herself in this state. I think she may be very mentally ill after all the years of trauma she s been through, so I came to this website as a last resort to try and help her. I ve tried to stop getting into arguments, i ve tried getting her professional help, and i ve tried just being there for her, but none of what i m doing seems to be making any sort of impact. I was wondering if this website could provide me with some answers on what to do, because I won t be able to always be there for her, and i m really worried. Thank you. *Side note: She has also had cancer twice, been diagnosed with diabetes, and has breathing problems which requires for her to take a puffer 4 times a day. She sometimes has spells in which she fixates on these problems and pities herself and is almost always negative.

Do I need to worry or find another doctor","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to Health Care Magic.I understand your concern.     Continuous working in a stressful environment causes debilitating effect on body and mind. Researchers have found that chronic stress can lead to reduction in immunity resulting in increased vulnerability to several infections and illnesses. Increased WBC count in your case may be due to subclinical infections because of reduced immunity.Apart from that stress also produces several changes in brain that produces psychiatric symptoms like insomnia, anxiety, sadness, helplessness, hopelessness, worthlessness and even suicidal ideations. Although blood counts are mildly elevated, you need not worry much about blood counts once any overt infection has been ruled out. It may be often due to less water intake/ dehydration. We as a doctor try to treat the cause and not the effect. You must try to modify/change your working environment or you must learn some positive coping skills from a mental health professional to deal with ongoing stressors. You should have a balanced nutritional diet, regular exercise, proper hydration, enough sleep and recreational activities to make yourself healthy both mentally and physically. You may also take psychotherapy or some antidepressant medication with the help of your psychiatrist. I hope these steps can help you.

Thank you for posting your question.Do not panic so much. I can understand that you are very anxious about your health. A lump in the inguinal region can simply be due to inflammation of the lymph nodes over there due to some infection. Spotting is not due to these lumps.Do not neglect your diet. Have regular diets .You see anxiety is an ailment which can be overcome very easily. Try relaxation techniques like consciously breathing in and out twice a day for 5 minutes. It will help you to relax. Every night before going to sleep write out 3 things that went well that day , it can be anything like you read a good story book or you helped someone in the street, cooked a delicious dish just anything.For the lump , I would suggest you to visit  a doctor and get it examined. It may be nothing serious, just a routine checkup.Have a nice day.

These type of person usually justify their behaviour due to some reason. This is definitely undesired behaviour by her and she also has unhealthy way of coping (escaping from home in the name of shopping daily, taking help of a priest but herself avoiding her desired role at home). In this case it may be due to continuous strain of caregiver burden or this may be her personality trait.     The best way is to record the conversation secretly and then late her review her behaviour herself by playing the recorded file. She may be overburdened and offering a helping hand may perhaps help her."},{"Patient":"I had a panic attack a couple of days ago at night during sleep. I thought I was having a heart attack but I wasn't sweating. After a couple of hours, the panic went away. However, I still have sudden attack, minor than the first night. I've been managing it though I am concern, especially the lightheadness. It goes away when I lie down for sleep, but comes back when I get out of bed. I told my dad of this and he said it was just anxiety and it will eventually go away. I lost my mom last year & I quit my job, so I assume it's built up stress that's causing these panic attacks. Well, I hope. Should I get checked out?","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCM for your health related queriesI can understand your concern. Loss of parent and then loss of job has probably build the significant stress which has precipitated these symptoms. The repeated panic attacks, feelings as if you had heart attack, anxiety episodes, lightheadedness, fear of sleep etc could denote a panic disorder or anxiety disorder. As per my opinion you should consider consulting a psychiatrist for these symptoms. In most cases Behaviour therapy coupled with relaxation exercises like Progressive Muscle Relaxation Exercise, Breathing Exercise help to reduce these symptoms and also reduce the intensity of attacks. If these methods don't result in improvement then medicines like SSRIs along with benzodiazepines can help. Benzodiazepines in low doses can be utilised to reduce the symptoms of severe panic and you will be able to function normally.Thanks, hope this helps you.

I am not currently taking medication for anxiety and my chest pain/pressure has been getting more frequent. Should I see a general doctor first or go to a cardiologist?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Proper diagnosis is what you needed. You should not ignore chest tightness or pressure. Please do consult a physician and get EKG and stress test. Anxiety disorder do produces symptoms of tightness / pressure / ache of chest, neck and shoulder area and even if you take anxiety medications, they tend to relapse. That is because, even with medicine, body could be stressed. Once stressed, body automatically contracts these muscles and they ache. During stress, acidity symptoms also occur which presses the diaphragm upwards and chest cavity constricts. Resulting in tightness and pressure.

I have servere Agroaphobia, social anxiety, PTSD, and panic attacks so as we speak i am notable to leave my home. my kids are with my mom because right now physically im not able to take care of them. Dfacs has a home parenting aid that comes out on a weekly basis, and i have been working with a CBT on-line councelor for a little over 2 months now. I have lost alot of weight gone from 289lbs to 215lbs since the end of June because I am unable to eat, I dont really have an appetite. I can small food think oh yummy and not eat. I am very weak because I have lost so much weight. I have some mobile atrophy going on, i am unable to climb the stairs or even remotely able to get out of bed because of how much weight i have lost it causes shortness of breathe if if i sit up or try to walk. Parts of my belly are numb because of how immobilzed i am, I am needing some in-home physical therapy and iv nutrician to get my strength back up. I can not do a peg feeding tube because of my attacks or i would so i have been told doing iv nutrician would be the best way to get it back up to where i can feel better in order to go back on my medications, stil work with the CBT therapist and the parent aid, and the dentist that is going to be working with me on a new guard for my TMJ. My nurse practionier is willing to do PPN (in-home iv nutrician threw the home health,) but she does not know enough about the dosages to write the script to have it done. She asked me to contact the Atlanta center for eating disorders to see if there is a nutricionist that can possibly help us in writing the orders and helping us with this. I do not want to be hospitalized because my agrophobia is to servere and I am willing to go back on the meds and continue to work with the therapist that i currently have. We have talked with several People an this is in the best interest right now. The in-home care told us that they can come out and administer the Iv nutrician and monitor it and help me with physical therapy to get back on my feet so that i can get some strength and be able to care for my kids again.

IF this is my bite/jaw causing this can it be corrected to where it goes back to normal agagain i have panaramic xrays avalible, and teeth impressions avbalible also. my dr an i believe that i jumped to soon into gettinmg the acrlic guard offline because i had no insurance at the time and was looking for somethiong more permernt. i got the impressions about a week later got the guard it was pretty snug at first for the first week or so, then it started to even out, i wore it 24/7 for entire month an thern started to notice the breathing differences, i stopped using it for about 2 weeks an started having swallowing issues, i started the guard back it was snug again but evened out in about a day, and the swallowing issues went away, so needless to say the guard has been causing all of this an i need someone to help me get my bite back in place my jaw has now started poping on the left side when i yawn my dr is willing to talk with you about my situation also i have panaramic xrays and teeth impressions prior to the guard i started to wear thats causing all of this.","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCM I have read your detailed explanation of symptoms and can understand your problem. Your main issues are related to mandibular joint (TMJ), dental issues and anxiety. As dental problems coupled with anxiety have resulted in reduced feeding so first of all I would advise you to get yourself reevaluated to find out any abnormality in dental and TMJ. The problems of agoraphobia, anxiety, PTSD, panic disorder have probably resurfaced because of dental issues. This is the reason for eating disorder. I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist for detailed treatment. Medicines like SSRIs especially Escitalopram, Fluoxetine can help to reduce your problems related to anxiety and will help to control eating disorder.

Last year due to an extreme stressful situation in her life, after 2 days of receiving a very bad news she started to have pain in the right side of her upper stomach. She lives in the Caribean but was in Holland at that moment. She could not afford to go to a doctor and instead drank almost daily 6 Alieve-Extra Strength capsules to control the pain somewhat. She was very depressed and cried almost daily. THis all during 3 weeks. When back at home she was diagnoticated with a double Vena Porta Trhombose. Afortunately after a few months she started feeling good again. I am convinced that the Thrombose could have been caused by exessive stress and depression. There is a legal case at the court where my daughter is asked to demonstrate that the Vena porta trhombose could have been caused by stress and depression. I know that stress and depression causes most of our illness in our bodies. Can you inform me more here about? I have to go to COurt next week. Is it possible to send me a response at your earliest convenience? Thank you in advance for your valuable information.

Born by LSCS, third in no. (3rd issue) was alright for 2 days after birth c/c with refusal of feeds and convulsions on 27th Jan. 1996. Patient was shifted to Neonatal Pediatric Department of Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Srinagar, Kashmir, India where he was treated for Neonatal Sepsis, received plasma transfusion. At the same time, he developed slight squint eyes (Nystagmus) which progressively increased till date. He was discharged after one month and was put on sodium valporate. Patient develops convulsions on and off till date. The duration and intensity of convulsions varies from time to time which extends from some minutes to hours with the result, he becomes incontinent. There is an H/o vomiting and fever. Patient remained under pediatric observation till date. In the meanwhile, he got admitted in the school at the age of 3½ yrs but his schooling got disturbed with his ill health (seizure/convulsions) so, he remained off from school. Initially he was cooperative and doing well, but he left school as he was pressurized by teachers to compete with other normal students. From last 2-3 yrs, he developed severe behavioral disturbances, anger, trying to fulfill his demands at any cost. In Nov.2009, he got admission in Composite Regional Centre (CRC) Bemina, Sgr. for getting special education but lost interest after finding himself isolated among children with severe abnormalities like Down syndrome etc. Then he got admission in Voluntary Medicare School for special education but due to his impatient and aggressive behaviour, he remained off from school most of the times. As for his behavioural change, patient went for psychiatric consultation to AIIMS, New Delhi and was advised specialised treatment (psychiatry unit dept. with behavioural intervention).                He gets seizures very often but from June 2014, he has not got a major attack as his Neurologist increased dosage of Tegretal CR to 300 mg BD. However, he complains some light formation (black out) in his eyes and starts uttering unusual words and then after taking some rest becomes OK. What could it be and what is possible remedy for this. Presently, he has developed unusual OCD that is to say he goes wash room very often and washes his hands & feet by counting upto 500. He does not open the doors with his hands but feet and with time he has become very hygiene conscious. He remains very disturbed. Can you please suggest some remedial measures to improve his condition. Regard s Aisha","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCM Thanks for providing detailed history. I can understand your problem. You brother of 18 years have mental retardation, seizure disorder since birth, developed after neonatal sepsis. He was clinically better but has developed aggressive behaviour since last 2-3 years. Currently he is on Carbamazepine 600 per day. Now he has developed Obsessive compulsive symptoms with compulsive hand washing and these are severe to such degree that he has even stopped to close the doors. These are due to severe OC symptoms.As per my opinion there is need to add some good anti anxiety drug to his prescription apart from anti seizure and mood stabiliser drugs. Fluoxetine in high doses can control his symptoms of OCD. If his doctor agrees then mood stabiliser like Sodium Valproate can be used again in place of carbamazepine. The drug will help to control his behavioural symptoms. Discuss with his psychiatrist for prescription.Thanks, hope this helps you"},{"Patient":"I hired into a job as being available at any time for any shift.

She started her study at 5th grade. We have two children (Son and daughter). She is our youngest one. 1)     When she was studying in 10th grade (2005 year), A big hurricane hit our house window glass and burst. At that time we were praying in another bedroom. That wind burst our bed room window where we were praying burst outward. She feared very lot at that time but she has no problem at that time. 2)     One day she was taking shower after her school some boys hit her bath room. She feared, ran to sitting room and could not speak some. My wife asked so many times, after some times she told her this incident. Our house was on ground floor.This was the second incident. 3)     After one year, when she was studying in 11th grade, some boys bothered her so much. She told me that no one never touched her but they teased her with words like prostitute etc. when she travel by school bus or she was studying in school because she is nice, beautiful. So they tried to attract but failed. She needs to live holy, doesn’t want American people life. She didn’t know who is working in background. At last she found told us that one of boys is living above our apartment house. Her tension increased, one day we noticed that she is smiling and talking herself. This was starting point. We admitted in hospital and discharged from hospital after 10 days. They gave Seroquel tablet. We found that our daughter will not get peace if she stays in our apartment house. So I sent daughter and my wife to India in February 2007. We admitted her in hospital, Kerala India and they doubted, it may be Schizophrenia. They gave medicines Night: Quetiapine (Ingredients: Substituted for Seroquel) Morning: RIZ LS - Risperidone and Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride Orodispersible tablet (Ingredients: Risperidone BP 2 mg, Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride IP 2 mg) When she was taking, she told us that she cannot look naked body when she bath or change her dress and she is hearing voice. My wife told this problem then doctor told her that ignores it. My wife didn’t know that it was medicine side effects. 7 years she suffered these problems and she studied 11th, 12th and graduated B.Sc. in year 2013 with very good marks. I got a new job in Texas, USA on June 2012. So I moved from Florida to Houston. So we decided to bring my wife and our daughter to here (Texas, USA) and our daughter can continue her education. They came here on July 2013. At that time she was taking medicines as follows. Night: Quetiapine 50 mg (Ingredients: Substituted for Seroquel 50 mg) Morning: RIZ LS - Risperidone and Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride Orodispersible tablet (Ingredients: Risperidone BP 2 mg, Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride IP 2 mg) As per our doctor s instruction india, we reduced medicine from Quetiapine 50 mg to Quetiapine 25 mg (bed time). On 2014 March 2nd night (after one month), She couldn t sleep, so I brought her to Hospital Emergency Room on March 3rd morning. They tested her blood but they didn t give any medicine and discharged from hospital. Then I called our doctor in India, he told me that increase medicine Quetiapine 25 mg to Quetiapine 50 mg. So we gave Quetiapine 50 mg on March 3rd night but she couldn t sleep again. So I brought her to Emergency Room (Mid night). At that time she was very nice to talk to us. They admitted her on March 4th evening on patient care. So doctors stopped all medicine then she has no problem and she can sleep without any issue. Also she can look her naked body when she was bathing and she has no hearing voices etc after stopping these medicines. Everything happened because of these medicines side effect. Next day they discharged from hospital and prescribed started Risperidone 2 mg and Benadryl tab 25 mg bed time only for safety. They didn t check prolactin level before giving Risperidone tab. I was watching her and found that something is going on her but she has no issue. Her period (menses) started March 3rd, 2014. After taking this medicine 18 days, her period was started again. Then I identified, it is an issue of this medicine. We got appointment after 5 days as per hospital referral doctor. March 26, 2014, we consulted the doctor and I told her the problem. Doctor didn t believe my words. Because of my request, doctor wrote prescription to test prolactin level. We gave her blood on March 28, 2014 Friday and Lab told, they will send result to doctor on Monday March 31, 2014. Friday after noon, she was completely changed and she was throwing all old dress to garbage, tore old photos, documents and etc. Next day again worst, she throws all disliked items to garbage. I contacted doctor but she didn t change medicine. Two times I brought her to hospital, they didn’t believe our words. I am not able to stop medicine without right help. At last again brought her to our hospital Emergency Depart, there duty doctor stopped this medicine and prescribed a tablet to sleep and discharged. The doctor told us to contact our follow up doctor on morning. We gave this sleeping tab at midnight and then she slept on that night. Morning, we went to doctor s office, at that time, doctor got prolactin result and result was abnormal (124.5) which is 6 times more than the maximum (18). She changed medicine quetiapine 50 mg in night (bed time) and Quetiapine 25 mg morning only. Doctor didn t give any medicine for Risperidone internal reaction. One week, we suffered very lot and found that our daughter’s tendency “to throw old dress” which was not completely cured. We found another good doctor (Neuro Psychiatrist) and changed appointment to him. During this period, we tested Neuro transmitter test and found that Dopamine is normal but DOPAC level is low. We tested neurotransmitters (after her periods) from urine (They told give 2nd urine to avoid any medicine trace). Neurotransmitters: Serotonin (5 HT), Catecholamine (Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Epinephrine), GABA (Gamma- Amino butyric acid level), Glutamate, R/E Ratio, Glycine, PEA (Beta-phnylethylamine level), Acetylcholine, Endorphin, Melatonin. A test result, DOPAC is low and others are fine. The new doctor told Quetiapine is also allergic to her. He told us that Risperidone damaged her brain which affected her thyroid gland function and hormone. He gave Latuda 20 mg in night only. After some blood test we found that her Vitamin D is low. Doctor told that it will affect her mood. So doctor prescribed vitamin D. After giving 3 days vitamin D medicine, our daughter told that she feels snake crawling on her body. Next day we watched and gave vitamin D to her, after one hour our daughter was alerted and she told snake strangling her neck also. So we contacted doctor and he looked her problem. Doctor told it is hormone sensitivity which was caused by Risperidone. He stopped vitamin D and prescribed a tablet to decrease prolactin level and prescribed a medicine to increase thyroid function. After 2-3 days giving this medicine, our daughter’s mood were changed, the doctor stopped these medicines and referred to hospital. One week, our daughter was admitted this hospital. This hospital told us that her disease may be some kind of Psychosis. So the doctor prescribed the medicine Abilify 5mg(aripiprazole) and Activan (Lorazepam 0.5 mg) twice a day. We told doctor that she is going back to home country India to take master degree or other professional degree. Her mood is changing in her period’s time. Also if she eats any item with ingredients Corn her mood will change (eg: Oats). As per our watching, something is connected to her hormone. They left to India again. One doctor in India, increased Ablify and gave another tablet ‘pacitane tablet’ to remove side effects but she fell down unconsciously two times. Also we give quetiapine tab before, same thing happened in USA. Suddenly my wife take her to another doctor in cochin, she explained all allergies etc. Doctor told , Abilify is not the right medicine, he changed medicine to Sizodon LS tab half morning and half evening, Activan 10mg night. My wife told doctor that Risperidone is severe allergic to her. Two days before we found that her behavior is changing, we tested prolactin which is elevated from 5.5 to 45 within 10 days. My wife told but doctor is not considering these changes. If prolactin increase Here is the list of behavior change happened in USA 1) The habit of doing/telling lies (Same thing happened in kerala today when my wife observed Our daughter, she pretend sleep on bed tonight and also she covered her body with blanket {which used in cold weather} when the atmosphere was very hot now in kerala.) 2) She sits alone on a room and anyone comes to room, she will get out from there. (This happened in kerala one day before).       3) She took important items and throws them in trash. 4) She tore photos and valuable documents. 5) She loses touch with reality and starts talking non-sense After all these behavior changes, we suffered 3 months to bring back our daughter at least 50% with her right behavior. Doctor in USA told, Risperidone tab affected her pituitary gland and prolactin level based on blood test results. So we cannot continue this medicine. We need right treatment. Now she is allergic to Corn, Soy, Pistachio, Walnut, Corn Oil and Quetiapine tab, Risperidone tab, Vitamin D tab, RIS-LZ tab. We need proper help to bring back our daughter with her nice behavior with minimum medicine. All these issues happened after giving Risperidone. What is will be alternate medicine for Sizodone. If we give aripiprazole tab, only issue is, some mood changes (not always). So what is the right medicine for her Regards","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking a question from HCM for your health related queriesYou have mentioned detailed history and it can help in making a provisional diagnosis. From the history you have mentioned and age of the onset of her symptoms it appears that her diagnosis of Psychosis is correct and probably she is suffering from Schizophrenia. A lot of factors affected her psychological development like migrating from India to USA and then due to fear from boys and change in culture she was migrated again to India. Over protective parenting also resulted in increased pressure on her like her decision to remain \\"holy\\" even you were aware of this and this is not a expected behaviour. Her symptoms started with muttering and later progressed to violent episodes. Initially she was well with quetiapine but later due to shifting to USA her symptoms relapsed. She developed hyper prolactenimia due to risperidone and this has resulted in galactorrhoea. She failed to respond to Quetiapine again. Aripiprazole has cause intolerance and mood changes and Extra pyramidal side effects. Neurotransmitter studies revealed abnormal receptor functionsAs per my opinion she should underwent one MRI scan of brain with special target to pituitary ares. Porlactin increase to such levels with such doses of Risperidone is no so common. MRI will rule out any prolactinoma or other tumour. Once it is ruled out then we can think about other medicines. Olanzapine is relatively better tolerated and is safer. Clozapine can also be considered as a good option. The drug is useful for resistant symptoms and have excellent efficacy. You can discuss with your psychiatrist regarding prescription of these drugs. Both drugs will help in sleep also.Thanks hope this helps you.

When i'm down i'm either sobbing uncontrollably, or hostile, angry, and yelling at people and starting fights.  When i'm up i can be way to confident in myself, but when i'm down i'm waaayyy to low on self confidence.  I don't sleep too little, but rather i am almost always tired and wanting to sleep.  When i'm up, anxious, and nervous i talk really fast and almost nonstop.  I have struggled for a long time with thoughts racing through my head to the point that i can't slow my mind down.  I can be easily distracted, but i'm usually pretty good at staying on track.  When i'm up i can be sooo energetic that i actually need to clench my fists to try to channel it.  Very abnormal for me.  When i'm down i literally don't want to do anything at all.  I've never really felt so social i needed to call people in the middle of the night.

Am I mad?","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for writing in.I understand that the strange experiences of seeing non existent things / people must be causing you a lot of distress. Now, it is important to differentiate whether you are seeing them in front of your eyes (like you see normal things) or whether you are seeing them as mental images. If it is the first case, then you are experiencing hallucinations, which can be due to a psychotic illness or illegal drugs or sometimes due to neurological problems. If it is the second case, then these could be due to stress-related disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, etc. A detailed history and psychological assessment is required to arrive at the correct diagnosis. So, I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist and have a detailed psychological assessment in order to confirm the diagnosis and start appropriate treatment. I would also suggest that you avoid alcohol, drugs or caffeine as these can worsen your symptoms. You can also try to practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, yoga, meditation, etc.as these can definitely help you to relax and calm your mind.Best wishes,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor,Can one suffer from multiple personality disorders simultaneously?

I can become overly happy and ecstatic for no real reason at all in a split second, but the simplest things can send me into an extreme fit. I m not really sure how to describe it, so I ll do my best. At times I ll become full of anger, rage, and just get irrational. I could be sent into hour long crying sessions, and not just like crying, but screaming and crying and rocking around almost like I m crazy. I get insane, so bad that by the next day I ll be swelled in the face and have sore throats; I ll get so angered I ll throw things, and break them. Its like a click goes off in my head and no matter how much I ve trained myself to stay logical I don t really care. I have to be in my mood because in my state of mind it s how I should be. Then once my mood switches off, I become normal again and ridden with guilt, because I know how I acted was wrong. I try and control it but nothing I do seems to help at all. It s mainly affecting my relationship with my boyfriend, he tells me all the time that my emotions he can t handle. For example on New Years Eve we hung out, but during the day he was helping his friend get his car to the shop, then bought a couch and I was so angry that I went into a fit, I started crying, and threw things around in my room, I started acting like I didn t care for him at all, I started saying things that I didn t mean. Once we did hang out, I picked a fight with him. As soon as I was done I became normal. Then we went to a party with his friends, and because we didn t kiss as soon as the ball dropped I instantly became silent and the rest of the night wouldn t talk, and at two in the morning when he was falling asleep I became angered with him for not talking to me, I jumped up made loud noises to wake him, he had to come over and grab me and hold me I started shouting and was irrational. Then the next morning before I went to work, he wanted to keep sleeping instead of going with me on the drive to work(his mom took me) and I became so angry and hurt. Like he didn t love me or something. So I sat across the room at him, it was about nine in the morning and he kept falling back asleep, so I was furious. After I made loud noises and shouted at him that I would go wait with his mom(i didn t have to leave for 40 minutes) he got up and kept asking me to come over to him and kiss him and sit with him for awhile, I kept shouting why and you never wanna be around me etc. I wouldn t go near him I was angry, I refused to kiss or hug him goodbye. I treated him like crap, and went on in a fit. Once I left I immediatly felt horrible and on break at work I texted him how sorry I was and that I didn t mean to treat him that way. When he didn t reply, I sent him more apologetic texts. Now this morning, seeing there was still no reply I started bawling and ripping at my sheets and bed covers, I was throwing myself around on my bed, then curled up and cried for about an hour. Then in an instant I snapped completely back to normal. This happens daily, every day. I could be the happiest girl in the world, then minutes later feel like I m dying. One night I was drinking, and he and his mom on the way to picking me up almost got in an accident for bad weather, and had to turn around. I snapped into this mood where I went crazy and was screaming on the top of my lungs that I wanted to die, and he didnt love me, that I wanted to kill myself. My mother had to come in and grab me and put me into bed, but I kept getting out and for hours and hours, I was in an extreme depressed state, over nothing at all. It happens a lot, and if you knew us both you d know that I m delusional when I say these things, because we ve been together for almost two years, he s the best thing to ever happen to me, and he s always sweet and supportive of me. But when something snaps in my head it s like I m someone else, and I no longer can control it. This is a really long message, but I ve been quietly looking up things about bipolar and I would like to know if I could be? For the longest time I thought I could be but refused to accept any idea because I didn t want anything to be wrong with me. I have no money for counseling or whatever it is that people do or get when they re bipolar. I m just sitting here at the breaking point, I can t keep going into these rages for nothing, I want to know if there s a medical reason why I do it, or if I m just going insane. I can t handle these depressed states I get into where I want to die, and run away, where I hate myself. I can get so disgusted with myself that I just burst into tears, it s not normal. I wanted to know if anyone could help?","Doctor":"HelloWelcome here.Your description suggests that you have frequent mood swings. The description is pointing towards a possible mood disorder.I would suggest you to visit a psychiatrist for proper evaluation. I think its the mixed bipolar disorder category which you fall under.You might need a drug treatment with mood stabiliser drugs like valproate(prescription drug). But that would be cobfirmed after a psychiatric evaluation.Hope this helps.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hello, my name is Barbara, and I have pulmonary hypertension and Lupus.

About two days ago I accidently took an extra dose of adderall maybe an hour after taking my first dose in the morning. I m only suppose to take one dose per day. I figured I would be ok since my dosage is only 10mg per day and I knew that many patients are prescribed 20 or higher. I went to go work out and as I was exercising I experienced what I think were heart palpatations. My heart seemed to skipped a beat and then began to flutter. I sat down for a few moments, went back to normal, and cautiously finished my work out. Since then however I ve noticed some signs that concern me. I feel minor and temporary aches and pains in my chest and arm. I feel tightness in my lower jaw. I ve felt weak and tired. Just this morning I had some minor stomach cramps and my stool was looser than usual though I wouldn t call it diarreah. I checked my blood pressure and it s been high (I m usually a healthy person and have never had high blood pressure before). Right now my blood pressure is 134/74 but it s gotten as high as 140/83.

I was recently diagnosed with adult ADD but I do not think I really have it. Long story short: I mentioned to my doctor that I am forgetful & have trouble concentrating & asked what herbal remedy I could take for it. He referred me to a clinical psychologist. The psychologist decided I have ADD without much to go on. I couldn t believe that he came to that conclusion. I have a B.Ed & used to teach kids with ADHD as well as a Masters in Counseling Pyschology. My mother-in-law has adult ADD & so does my brother-in-law. So, I am very experienced with it. I have also taken several online ADD questionnaires with negative results. After receiving the report, my regular doctor prescribed Adderall 20mg XR. After reading what it does & researching for hours (and obviously still researching), I found a lot of off label uses for it...weight loss, Depression, Social Anxiety, even Chronic Fatigue. It s so hard to decipher from the internet what is fact & what is fiction. I have Chron s Disease & have had a bowel resection in the past. I am always B12 & iron deficient. I get regular B12 shots. I am always tired & I do not have a lot of energy. Getting up in the morning is extremely hard to do whether I ve had 3 hours of sleep or 10 hours. I am seeing a sleep specialist & he said I have Delayed Sleep Phase & tried me on several sleep medications to try to adjust my phase. I did not see any improvement & the specialist is going to schedule a day sleep study to assess my daytime fatigue (already did the night clinic) to decide if he is going to prescribe something to help with the daytime sleepiness. I have a very patient husband who usually takes the kids to school in the morning so I don t have to. We ve kind of settled into the roles of me being the creative, game board mother & him being the active, outdoors dad because I don t have the energy for it. My Chron s Disease is under control & I stopped taking Imuran in October 2011. However, I still have abdominal pain related to it. I have just learned to live with it. When I read about Adderall after my doctor prescribed it, I decided to try it. I may not have ADD but I have a lot of other ailments that might benefit. So, I started taking the 20mg capsule. What a difference! I only started it last week but my energy level has increased, I get out of bed before the alarm... without hitting snooze literally for a 1/2 hour. I wake my kids up instead of them trying to wake me up. I get tasks completed & cross a lot of things off my to-do list. I have not noticed any abdominal discomfort. My husband is in Afghanistan for this month & I have had no problem getting the kids to school on time or doing activities with them that require energy. I feel like such a better mom. I have started going to the gym & doing cardio & weight-lifting which I am supposed to do for my Osteopenia.There s no high associated with it, just increased energy. I think that 20 mg is too high, though & I am going to ask to drop to 5mg, 10mg or 15mg. I just want to take the lowest possible amount that will increase my energy level, give me a higher tolerance for pain & solve my sleep problem. I have not had a problem falling asleep on Adderall, either. I take the pill early in the morning. So, I fall asleep at a normal time & get up at a normal time. Wow! I m almost 40 & have never done that! Sometimes I feel like I am just keeping my head above water because of my energy level. Adderall has genuinely helped me to function & accomplish daily tasks. Ok, that was the loooong history. I am getting to my question, I promise! I am worried about the long term side effects of Adderall. I am un upbeat person who has never suffered from depression but my mother, sister and brother have. Apparently that puts me at risk for depression and/or anxiety with Adderall use. Even with all my health issues & lack of energy, I m still an optomist & I do love life. My dad died at 43 of colon cancer when I was 16 so I learned at a young age to love every day. Adderall is an addictive drug but I have been on many addictive pain killers in the past, including morphine taken every morning with percocet for break through pain for 6 months before my bowel resection. I ve also taken drugs such a lortab over the years for flare-ups. These medications have always been prescribed by a doctor & I have never abused any of them. I have come off all without any addiction issues. I read that Adderall causes appetite suppression & weight loss. I am very conscious of that & I have made sure to eat regularly & I bought some Ensure shakes for back up. I do not want to lose weight & possibly cause trouble with my Chron s. I have had an increased heart rate at times but have measured my pulse but it has not gone over 92/minute. I have minor headache and anxiety as the drug is wearing off. Do you think I should continue to use Adderall? What dosage? What are the long term effects for patients taking Adderall without ADD?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for choosing \\"Health Care Magic\\" for posting your query.I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through.Generally patients with ADHD need to continue treatment for long. There are no significant side-effects of long term Adderal and it may be taken regularly.

I can understand your emotions. You did go through so many life experiences which are supposed to set your thinking straight and positive. But otherwise happened.We come across so many events in our past. Some are negative and the maximum are positive. We program our brain so as to remember the negative events. Positive events teach us positive lessons and negative events also teach us POSITIVE lessons. In that case, we should forget the negative events and boast about the positive lesson we learnt from it and cherish it.  That is how positive thoughts manifest and our brain gets reprogrammed.Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement.

His stools are always soft and sink to the bottom of the toilet, on occasion they are diahorea. He recently has complained of his bum being itchy and it is red. He is at nursery school and I know he is active and growing but has always had a good appetite and we would eat healthy home cooked meals, however the food in school is somewhat processed and I think at times he does not eat a lot of his dinner in school and this may be a contributing factor in the weight loss. Also about 2 weeks ago he seemed to be having bad nightmares, sweating/fever and his body was twitching a bit. He was like that for 3 nights running and then it stopped. he has night sweats regularly but this was more like a fever. I am concerned about his weight, and was wondering if you would have any advice, or would this give you an idication of any possible diagnosis?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

I was finally getting better and was on the right medication and then my doctor decides to take me off all of it. My question is would overdosing on 30mg duromine 15 tablets do any harm/kill me?","Doctor":"HelloWelcome here,The 15 tablets of duromine 30mg can be toxic and fatal.I can understand your mental situation. But dear, killing yourself is not the solution for problems. You must not loose hopes and never try to do such acts.I understand that sometimes we get frustrated and can feel like this.But i would suggest you to not commit such acts and discuss your mental health issues with a psychiatrist. There is a solution to every problem and you should not give up.Hope this helps.Thanks"},{"Patient":"My father, aged 62, has been under psychiatric treatment for 6 years for Recursive Depressive Disorder. During this period he was cured for nearly 2 years. However, though for the last 4 – 6 months he is free from depression he has been found to become increasingly nagging and later in-coherent. For the last 1-2 month we have found him talking to himself or others, completely incoherent. He suddenly lies down on the floor, starts running(with small steps), hugs anyone who is around him, shouts(either someone’s name, or just blabbers incoherently or the words:“minor aberration”). He was admitted in a psychiatric facility for last 1 month where initially he was given no medicines to eliminate the case of drug reaction. Following this when his actions became more uncontrollable(he started jumping and falling face first on the bed, banging an open door, hugging people more, running) pathological test were done. Urine Culture, Chest X-ray, USG(whole abdomen) showed everything to be clear. However the C-REACTIVVE PROTEIN was found to be 51.1(However, the psychiatrists and neurologist finds one things very puzzling and completely reverse to his diagnosis. My father has periods of high confusion when he presents typical symptoms of dementia and very high delirium(all above abnormal activities included), But he too has periods when he is lucid, completely coherent, aware, sharp memory and defies any signs or symptoms of dementia. According to the psychiatrist in lucid times also there should be at least some baseline cognitive deficit no matter how less, and hence the doctor too is at a loss. When he is normal he says that sometimes he has a squeezing sensation inside his head, which is soon followed by confusion and worsening of the squeezing sensation. Soon it becomes intolerable and he loses control and as we see he loses full cognition. If at that time we talk to him he hears but cant comprehend. So we give him Haloperidol drops when he feels the squeezing sensation or as soon as we detect he is starting to get confused. His present medication includes: •     Donepezil (10mg at morning) •     Risperidone(2mg at night) •     Quitipine (150 afternoon + 150 night) •     Haloperidol oral liquid (10 drops SOS) – generally 50 – 90 drops per day My question: •     Is the Diagnosis correct? •      If so then why is he so incoherent and unmanageable at times(nearly 8-10 hrs a day). Also how can he be so coherent and responsible at other times? •     He is in tremendous discomfort. Today whole day he kept running and walking briskly with small steps. Is this ever going to stop? Will he be able to get relief? Please HELP us…If required we can also take him to you next month.","Doctor":"hi, I can understand the stress you must be through currently. From his complaint, it appears to be a case of psychotic disorder overlapped with an episode or two of delirium, considering his high age.The symptoms of muttering to himself. talking irrelevant and disorganised behaviour, all suggest a possible psychotic disorder. For further diagnoses of its subtype I'll need to know a complete elaborate history and progression of symptoms from you.the medications appear to be going inadequately the doses can be adjusted. I would suggest considering stoppage of one of the drug.Ill need to know his CT brain findings.welcome for futher consultation.hope to have satisfied your query.thanks Dr Pankaj Borade"},{"Patient":"I just found out that my 17 yr old granddaughter has Leigh s Disease which usually is found in infants with life expectancy to be short-lived.

Thank you very much in advance for your help. It is greatly appreciated. After being on 400 MG of Tramadol for nearly 4 years due to nerve damage as a result of my post inguinal hernia surgery back in 2011, I have been off of Tramadol for 2 months now. I made the decision to stop due to the fact it was not helping the pain anymore. I have gotten through most of the physical withdrawals (hell on earth), although I still suffer from slight nausea and acid reflux/GERD like symptoms. The worst part is the mental depression and anxiety I am still dealing with today due to my weaning off this med. I have been prescribed anti-depressant to counter this, but it just seems my brain was so altered by the tramadols chemical properties, I have yet to experience any relief from this. My question is, When/will I get better? What can I do now in your opinion (besides exercise, meditation) to help this recovery process? Thank you Doctor for your time.

Without my consent, she placed my penis in her month (maybe for about 2, maybe 3 seconds max).  When I confirmed what had happended, I asked her to stop and she proceeded to unpackage and place a lubricated condom on me and she continued what she started. About 1 week after this walk on the wild side, I began to experience a strange 'tingling' sensation after urinating.  There is also a few small drops of urine that I just can't seem to shake off.  I haven't any sores, burning, discharge, itching, pain, in, on, or near my penis - just this akward tingling sensation.  The opening to my urethra is also healthy looking and clear and not red nor irritated.  The best way to describe what I am experiencing is that I have a hightened sense of awareness toward my penis now. What might this be?  Perhaps, some form of urethritis caused by my hooker friends filthy little mouth or even the spermicide on the condom?  Could it be a STD such as the clap or chlamydia.  I understand that the rate of transmission via oral sex is very low and I haven't the classic symptoms for these.  Albeit, the symptom itself is hardly a concern for me, the guilt of my actions is making me worry that I may have contracted something devastating. Should I be tested for STDs (i.e. gonnorhea, chlamidia)?  What else?  What should I request of my physician - assuming he is not well experienced in the field of STDs or urology? A detailed response would be greatly appreciated. The West Side Wanderer","Doctor":"Hello,It's always better to rule out things first. I suggest you to get checked for sexually transmitted infections as soon as possible. If comes negative then yes it might be because of lubricant that she used then.
