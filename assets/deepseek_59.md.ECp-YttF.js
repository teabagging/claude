This can be from a local infection, injury to bones, ligaments or an outgrowth from them. As the sonologist suggested, MRI is needed to exactly define the tissue of origin and type of the lesion- which is necessary for orthopedist to plan the management.Since it is an acute painful condition, few days off the job is unavoidable.

Diagnosed with ADHD a bit over 7 months ago and put on dexamphetamine. In July contracted pneumonia, had breathing problems and presented myself at the local surgery three times, getting brushed off. Took myself to emergency the fourth time. Still got sent home. Told everyone what meds I was taking. No one checked my BP or listened to my heart. Two days after the ER trip, I collapsed unconscious in the shower 7am in the morning. Damaged three discs in my back and couldn t sit down for 3 months. I had been tachycardic and experiencing some arhythmia and this in combination with a stimulant (which someone should have told me to stop taking) had resulted in syncope. My heart was getting up to 220 at rest in the days after this happened. This improved over the next week to peaks of 160 at rest. Finally the doctor got me in to a specialist at which point I wore a holter monitor and things were much improved. A bit of atrial arrythmia, not considered outside of normal for a person recovering from pneumonia. But a lot of painful bruising, cramping in both thighs and calves and painful muscle spasms in my lower back. Not offered any pain meds (presumably my new ADHD status made me a potential drug-seeker). During this post-syncope recovery time I have also suffered hyperarousal insomnia due to PTSD (insomnia pre-existing condition to stimulant medication). Experienced Raynards-like bluish colour to feet which when feet were elevated turned cherry red, then normalised in colour. Swelling has persisted, although taking aspirin regularly seems to have sorted out the Raynards-like effect and hopefully any lingering vascular blockage (?) due to very heavy bruising of my buttocks and legs from the fall. Previously very fit, cycling 2-300km per week. Swelling of my feet (something I have never had ever in my life, despite severe insomnia for long periods of time) is pretty persistant. My feet and ankles almost up to my knees feel tender to touch and there is patches of brownish discoloration. The general palor of my feet and lower legs is pale, blotchy and looks like the area has aged 20 years (or I have now got my grandmother s feet when until recently I had the legs of a cyclist ie, very youthful). Concerned about this ongoing swelling and discoloration but less than impressed with the local doctor s grasp of things given I was told ADHD was not a real disorder and I should make do with what God gave me. All back symptoms have now subsided except for some minor spasms at times, close to the injury site in my buttock. Good as fixed, but the swollen feet are still a concern. I don t believe it is due to standing for long periods or sitting for long periods because nothing even remotely like this has happened prior to the loss of consciousness in the shower. What s your opinion on possible causes given the background (excluding psychosomatic origin, thankyou). I should say, I don t drink alcohol and don t take drugs. I have been prescribed Serepax and Zolpidem tartrate for insomnia but don t tolerate drugs well and prefer to not take them. So intermittent and infrequent use of sedatives, cognitive effects linger and memory problems affect my ability to study. Now, the ankles...?","Doctor":"Hi, You did not mention your age, the most common cause is increase in uric acid please get your uric acid checked.

I have 2 ruptured discs in my lower back.","Doctor":"Hi, The ruptured discs does not cause this type of pain. Your pain is localized to below the tailbone. This usually occurs when you have a fall on the tailbone resulting in an injury to this bone leading to this type of pain. Another possibility is an infection in the area causing an abscess or fistula. This needs to checked by a surgeon Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

What do you think it is ? her numbers are all good otherwise, but her leg has been giving her alot of pain. When she was little she was ran over by a milk truck and in a body cast for along time. Do you think it has anything to do with that? What are the chances you think that its cancer.","Doctor":"Hi, The problem as you say is pain in the same limb which had the fracture when she was young. Fracture in young age heals well and the none tends to regain its shape and size and by adult life will be almost normal. If a thickening has been detected then it's a new change resulting from either a hormonal problem or cancer. Hence, an MRI is necessary to study the appearance to reach a diagnosis. If all the blood tests are normal it's possible that it may not be from cancer. However this needs to be investigated. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Anyways, what I want to see now is:Your lower limb X rays to actually see what is the cause of your shortening?CT Scanogram of both lower limbs to measure combined length and individual lengths of femur and Tibia.Now as far as correction is concerned, normally we operate only if the discrepancy between the two legs is more than 2 com and it also correlates clinically. Any difference less than that is normally managed by shoe Insoles which make it equal on both sides and make it easy for the patient to walk.

The pain seemed to be muscle pain, but in the past two days has turned into a burning sensation almost like it s the skin. Any clue what it could be?","Doctor":"HI.The laparoscopic wounds although small are done through small incisions through the abdominal wall. When the trocar with cannula goes through the wall it can open up few blood vessels to cause an obscure hematoma which is not seen or felt due to obesity for which you are getting the surgery done , so it is missed and can cause the pain . Secondly this can be due to cut / partially cut nerves cause the similar pain which you described , the burning... one ."},{"Patient":"Starting around 6 months ago, by stretching in the morning I had felt a pop in my sternum as you would if you were to pop your knuckles and it started out initially feeling good after it had popped. earlier tonight I was looking in the mirror and noticed that the pronounced portions of my clavicles were a little uneven and offset, mostly the clavicle on my left side was much less protruded and wasnt really where it normally is. I have also been having a tingling feeling down the backside of my left arm it comes and goes and usually lasts around 20 min. Any idea what is going on?","Doctor":"Hi,You have mentioned that you feel that your left clavicle is slightly depressed as compared to right one, but we as Orthopedic surgeons actually see a few points about any bone.- Is there any bone swelling or tenderness at any point over the left clavicle?- Any abnormal mobility?- Have you had any fracture in your clavicle or any other surrounding bone?If the answers to all these questions are no, then most likely there should not be any issue with your clavicle. What you could just be feeling is maybe difference in the soft tissue cover over the two clavicle bones. If you are still unsure or not convinced, no harm in getting an X-ray of the involved region. Now as far as tingling sensation over the left arm is concerned, it could be either some bit of stiffness or a nerve impingement which may be causing this.To manage it, I will advise early initiation of physical therapy to strengthen neck muscles, shoulder muscles and periscapular muscles. Posture maintenance is of paramount importance, and if need be modalities like TENS can be initiated for left upper limb. If you still do not feel symptomatic improvement, a few medications can be initiated in your case.You can discuss your case and treatment plans with a specialist in a greater detail in a private consultation.Hope I have answered your question.

The season starts now... so should I stay off it 4 weeks and get it healed, or should i get through the whole basketball season with the stress fracture and then address it later?","Doctor":"Hi,It will not cause any problem once it is healed. Since the stress fracture has involved the weight-bearing bones of your foot (heel) it takes from 6 to 8 weeks for such a fracture to heal. Returning to basketball season too soon can put you at risk for larger, harder-to-heal stress fractures and an even longer down time. Re-injury could lead to chronic problems and the stress fracture might never heal properly. Once your pain has subsided, your doctor may confirm that the stress fracture has healed by taking X-rays or a CT scan then only you will be allowed to join your activity slowly.Hope I have answered your question.

I just found out its name .. apparently ) for more than 6 months now My general physician advised me to do exercises and not stain the knee too much .. for some weeks .. to get this tear healed or something I did rest and exercise for 2-3 months, and when I felt that I could run a little and comfortably , I started going out for sports. In retrospect, it was a bad idea. I fell down a few times .. sometimes with excruciating pain , and would come back to my room cursing my knee. Then I again resumed playing few weeks down the line (how stupid!) But now, I think I am totally fed up and disappointed in myself, that I cannot play the easiest of sports without faling like a dud. I dont know what to do. Please help me","Doctor":"Hello, You have quoted the term ACL Tear. I want to put light on this so that you can have good understanding of that. The ACL is short form of Anterior cruciate ligament. This ligament binds thigh bone with leg bone at knee. It is strong ligament and prevents anterior displacement of leg bone in relation to thigh bone or in other words helps in getting stability at knee. In case of its rupture you will feel giving away feeling or unstable knee during walking / fast walking and during staring up or down. If you are not feeling instability at your knee then most probably you may not having ACL tear. If your symptoms line up with above description you should have a MRI scan to rule out your pathology. Very early stage tear can be managed conservatively while gross tear should be operated. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Your local ortho doctor put traction and applied plaster. He had decided for this conservative mode of treatment due to her age and low weight. This was the need of that time as she was not fit for surgery or other mode of treatment. Probably her fracture may be mildly misaligned.

Surgery to insert a plate & to do a bone graft was planned when I was admitted at A & E on Sunday 6th Nov 2011 (injury happened on the 5th Nov ) but the orthopaedic consultant decided the next day not to operate but to treat with a full plaster cast & minimum weight bearing for 6 weeks. Am now on 5th week ... What can I expect to happen once the cast has been removed ? How soon can I get back to swimming, walking & normal day-to-day activites?

If fractures are not displaced or very minimally displaced then they can be treated conservatively in plaster cast. It depends on your attending doctor to take decision in your favour. The good thing is that fractures near ends of bones are in metaphyseal bone which generally heal well if you are taking due precautions. Most of the tibial plateau fracture generally heal well in 6-8 weeks time. Your doctor will do frequent x ray examination in 1-2 weeks to know the health of healing bone. After 6-8 weeks he remove plaster cast depending upon x ray picture and apply a compression bandage or a Range of movement knee brace. Now you need good physiotherapy to mobilize your knee and ankle joint and to strengthen your muscles. This may take about 2-3 weeks time. After post injury 3-4 months you may able to walk normally and with in 6 month you will be able to back to your normal life.

I started to slowly fall of my bed and I tried to stop but it didn t work. I ended up on my head on the floor and all my weight (I weigh at least 131 pounds) on my neck and my body went over my head and then my head popped up. So it was kind of like an extremely painful back flip or somersault, off my bed. The pain right now is probably a 15 on a scale of 1-10. I went and saw Ms. Will (the school nurse at my high school) about my neck and she said that in between my vertebrae was probably swollen and to go see a doctor if it gets worse. So anyway the pain was not that bad unless I tried to look up. At the end of the school day the pain got worse and I got a bad headache. ( I don t know if that has anything to do with my neck but in case it does there you go) My symptoms are: pain (really bad severe pain), swelling (in between vertebrae most likely) and reduced flexibility. What can I do for the pain? Ibuprofen doesn t seem to help because I tried and it helped my headache but not my neck. I take strattera for my adhd and I had a concussion in 2008. I am 14 years old and I am 5 feet 1 inch. I weigh about 131 lbs.","Doctor":"Hi, You have mentioned Severe pain in your neck region aong with swelling and stiffness. All this actually points out to thw pattern of Neck injury which you susatined which might have lead to all the three symptoms in your case. If you have localized Neck pain with no other symptoms like radiating leg pain, neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, paresthesias etc, then in my opinion you can start with following recommendations for initial period of 2 weeks: - To maintain proper posture of your Neck while working and sleeping - If pain is more as it is in your case , then you can take a short course of an anti-inflammatory medication like tab Aceclofenac etc alongwith a muscle relaxant for 5-7 days, you can add antacid if have issues of acidity after NSAID intake - Physical therapy like use of some modalities etc can be initiated but no exercises till the pain subsides completely - Ice packs can applied 3-4 times in a day - Analgesic spray for local application can be used and is easily available - Avoid lifting heavyweight/ acute forward bending in mornings etc. We will observe you for next 2 weeks how you respond to this conservative management protocol, you can also use a soft cervical collar if movements in the neck region increase your pain, but from my side if you have no neurological symptoms, then we can follow this protocol for next 10-14 days. If you do not feel better in terms of pain , swelling and stiffenss etc, then we will have to get some investigations like, dynamic x rays of Neck and few blood tests for evaluation. Just also keep me informed on what medications you are taking coz unless you take proper pain management medications, your pain won't become better.

This is seen in lot of people and discovered accidentaly  when you investigate for other reason. in your case it was seen when MRI was taken. this is not a concern. ----- the second problem which you have stated, '' first two coccyx segments or the distal sacrum and the proximal coccyx by about 6mm''. This is probably caused due to your fall which you suffered when due to fracture of these bones they have united in a slight ma position . this however is acceptable and does not cause any issues. --you have not mentioned when the MRI was taken.

As it is almost 3 weeks and he is up and about and does not have pain on you pressing it. Then it’s very unlikely he may have a fracture . Even if he had a fracture it must have been a small or undisplaced fracture. It’s always a safe thing to get an X-ray whenever In doubt as it rules out any bony injury. Now in your case if there are any X-ray facilities easily available. You can go ahead and do the X-ray as it will make you at ease. Otherwise wait for 1 more week and the swelling will slowly settle down. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The day before I wore a tight girdle which provided much relief from a large hernia that I was diagnosed with 2 years ago. I kept asking if by wearing the girdle I could have caused an issue with the bowel, I was told no. While I was in the hospital, I have had no appetite and I shared concerns that when I tried to eat anything today it caused discomfort in my abdomen. I also developed a headache on the left side. Since I have been home I have vomited just a little, have not urinated or had a bowl movement, I have a sharp pain on my right side and pain in my back which is also on the right side, and woke up with night sweats.

And you never know when and if its happens. Typical symptoms of bowels obstruction are nausea, vomiting, lack of stool and gasses, bloating and sometimes cramps.The other thing is that you have also urinating problems and back pain. This makes kidney infection very possible. Actually with bowels obstruction kidney infection can appear as you do not absorb water and do not urinate enough.Both conditions can be life threatening. That is why you should not wait with them. Please go to ER. Urine analysis, abdominal x-ray and ultrasound are necessary. Surgery might be the only treatment.Hope this will help.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Because of the multiple surgeries in the past, there is a possibility of your intestines getting stuck to the old scar somewhere in the abdomen (called adhesion formation) resulting in sub acute attacks of intestinal obstruction. This means the lumen of the intestine gets obstructed due to kinking by means of adhesion formation, which might get relieved of its own at times resulting in the pain off and on. The pain will pass off when the obstruction gets relieved. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for liquid and soft diet in repeated small quantities. If the pain becomes continuous and more severe, then I would refer you to your surgeon for further investigations and management. Till then you could try an anti spasmodic for relief of pain.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

My question has to do with a progressively worsening  condition that I ve been dealing with now for several years.  For the past 2-3 years, I have developed several very painful muscle spasms (I often refer to them as knots ) throughout my upper back and posterior shoulders. These spasms started small (just sore spots that weren t much of a concern), but over time they have become very large, to the extent that they now push on nerves (resulting in arm/hand nerve pain and numbness).  I frequently wake up in the morning with shin splints and/or aching muscles in one or more extremities (and I know that I did not do anything the day before to cause this pain--I just wake up with it).  Finally, I often feel very tired, even if I m sleeping well/enough. This is strange to me because I am very athletic/active (I do 60-90 minutes of intense cardio at the gym 7 days a week) and I am a very healthy eater.   I should also mention that my mother has Sjögren s Disease. My primary care doctor ordered blood work for me about 5 months ago and my ANA was normal. I ve been to Physical Therapy and it only made the muscle spasms worse. I ve tried Savella by my primary care doctor (for fibromyalgia), but was taken off of it due to side effects (I was an emotional basket case on it). I also REFUSE to take any kind of prescription pain medication (mainly because I feel that they would be a band-aid for a bigger problem).  Finally, i want to assure you that I am actually VERY pain tolerant. I don t let people know that I m in pain unless it is very severe. This IS severe--and it is absolutely diminishing my quality of life. I m only 28 and I wake up every day in pain, even though I maintain a very healthy lifestyle.   I don t know if you can offer ANY suggestions, but if you can, I would be extremely grateful. I apologize for bombarding you with information, but I did not want to omit any important information.  Thank you again for your time.","Doctor":"HiSpasms of skeletal muscles are most common and are often due to overuse and muscle fatigue, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.

Today am 39, weigh abt 75 kilos and have a pain radiating into my right leg on and off, pain in the right foot almost constant - specially in the heel and the area around and below the last 2 toes. On days of exertion and PMS, the right leg feels heavy with slight stiffness and swelling from the knees and below. Wearing a pair of socks, putting a lot of weight with 2-3 woolen blankets gives some relief. Exposure to cold weather brings back the pain. My physician recently examined me and told this is a trouble with the sciatic nerve. He has advised not to do any forward bending exercises. Can someone explain what the condition is and any particular specialist I need to consult.","Doctor":"Hello,You may be suffering from a slipped disc in your lower spine with pinched nerve. To put in simpler terms, the lower limbs receive nerve inputs from your spine. So whenever you have slipped disc, the disc comes and compresses your nerve (pinched nerve) which causes your whole limb to  feel numb and weak.In your case the CT scan done previously has diagnosed your condition at that time, but the best thing is to get an MRI scan done of your spine which will tell you in detail about the spine  and the nerves. After doing the MRI scan your orthopedic surgeon or spine specialist will be in a position to guide you further. In the mean time you follow the advise given by your doctor (not to bend forward and lift weight).Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Santosh S.

Cramps are commonplace for some women during their menstrual cycle, although exercises can often alleviate such pain. The strength of pain does not necessarily indicate seriousness: very painful cramps can be caused by gas passing through your digestive system harmlessly, whereas life-threatening conditions such as colon cancer and early appendicitis can produce mild or even no pain,2. so care needs to be taken not to judge the cramp severity according to your pain level."},{"Patient":"I had flu for a couple weeks, then after that alot of coughing and sinus infection.
