Your worry is the results are not negative and you have pedal edema. Pedal edema is usually associated with your problem. I like to explain certain world statistics about the prognosis. Out of the 190 patients, 155 (81.6%) achieved End of Treatment Complete Response (EOTCR) whereas 35 (18.4%) were nonresponders (NR). These 155 patients, who showed complete response were followed for six months after the treatment to assess sustained viral response, which was seen in 112 (72.25%) patients whereas 43 (27.7%) were relapsers.

I have checked with three specialist (Gastroenterologist and Hepatologist) and they all didn't seem too worry about my condition, they said I will fully recover. My family are so scared because I am so yellow (jaundice) and they don't let me near my child, afraid of contagious. It has been very challenging these past few weeks for me and my family. My family have been watching my food diet, I can only eat soup, porridge, and steam fish and vegetables.  In the meantime I lost 15lb and still feel nausea with no appetite. My recovery seems to go pretty slow, am I doing anything wrong? Please help...","Doctor":"Hello, There is no effective drug treatment of hepatitis A since it is a viral disease. So as with any other viral diseases,the affected individuals should avoid contacts with others,take plenty of fluids,and take rest. Since the stool remains very contagious for several weeks into the illness, they should be extra careful with bathroom hygiene. If possible, a separate bathroom should be set aside until recovery. Separating eating utensils may be of benefit. Most of he people suffering from hepatitis A recover completely in 5 to 6 weeks time however around 10% people may have prolonged waxing and waning illness that may last as long as 6 months. There is no chance of this problem becoming chronic and once a person recovers from it,he never gets it again in his life. Your temporary increase in bilirubin levels is Normal and should not be worried. Relax,soon you shall be all right.You are not doing anything wrong.Nausea and loss of appetite shall be allright soon.

Tramadol overdose can cause acute liver failure.However  pharmacological use of tramadol has not been associated with cases of clinically apparent drug-induced liver disease. It's continued use results in minor enzyme elevations which  are usually mild, asymptomatic and self-limited, resolving even with continuation of therapy.However you should keep a regular watch on your liver enzymes by constant monitoring them at regular intervals and if you find that they are increasing,you should stop TRAMADOL at once. Since it is an opioid analgesic,it leads to addiction and it being a kidney toxic also,you should find ways to minimise it's consumption.

I daily drink beer. but when doctor told me that i am suffering from Jaundice i stop to drink. Sir the 2nd report shows the increase of every thing. I want to ask is some thing serious is going to happen in my body... Plz sir answer me. my emailid is  YYYY@YYYY . Thanks. waiting for reply","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. You shouldnt be worried at all.You are young and you should be afraid of some serious disease. These tests showed only slightly elevated bilirubin and ALT.A bilirubin level of 1.4 is nothing to be concerned about,it can be caused by temporary liver damage or haemolysis. You just need to do frequent check ups and change your dietary habbits. I wouldnt even prescribe any medicines. You should avoid alcohol for some time. If elevated LFT persist then some genetic and methabolic disorders can be considered, but the best thing to do is to wait and see. Nothing will happen in a short period.

My age is 23yrs, height is 5ft 8inchs..","Doctor":"Mirrizi syndrome is the condition  where gallbladder stones cause a communication between the gallbladder and bile ducts, often due to inflammation. This condition in your case has been treated by the operation you describe. Jaundice episodes after such a procedure  are not uncommon. They may be caused by a stricture or build up of sludge in the duct. Contact your doctor it should be easy to diagnose whether there is a problem in the bile flow by MRCP ( magnetic resonance examination of the bile ducts and the pancreas)."},{"Patient":"Hi I have been on hrt for 8yrs it was changed from estradol 11 months ago to elleste  after 5 months on this I got gallbladder disease so it was removed now 6 months later my hot flushes came back I went to the go had blood test and now I need to go for a scan on my liver as the blood results showed abnormal things in my liver is this because of the elleste solo 2mg as I dont drink and I am only 33yrs old","Doctor":"Hello, lucyaustin29, Thanks for contacting HCM with your quiery. You have had your gallbladder removed and that should not give you problems. If you had a retained stone in the bile duct, the channel that carries the bile to the intestine it can cause blockage. This would result in abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting and yellow jaundice along with abnormal liver tests. In the absence of these symptoms, abnormal findings in the liver could certainly be due to Elleste Solo. This is Estradiol (Estrogen) and they are associated with some conditions. There is increased risk of breast cancer , blood clots in the legs, also liver abnormalities. These are small liver tumors or growths called Adenomas which are generally benign but are subject to complications such as bleeding and infection. I am sure your doctor would be ordering liver blood tests and follow closely. I am glad that you don't drink alcohol which would add to liver damage. Plese discuss this with your doctor and take proper steps. I wish you the very best."},{"Patient":"My mother is diabetic, has a mitral valve which needs replaced buy she is not healthy enough for the replacement.

I recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure values for a week, several times during the day (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and refer those values to your doctor. If your blood pressure values are above the normal ranges (140/90 mm Hg) most of the time, you should discuss with your doctor on the possibility of starting anti-hypertensive therapy. In such case some other tests would be necessary to exclude other secondary causes of high blood pressure: - a chest X ray study- thyroid hormone levels- complete blood count for anemia- blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance- kidney and liver function tests- fasting glucose. Anyway, if your blood pressure values are elevated only during anxiety or physical stress, I would not recommend any treatment.

Such nerve problem can be caused by spine disc herniation for example. I suggest you to visit your doctor, have abdominal ultrasound, blood work and liver tests. If nothing will be found, you should visit orthopedist and consider muscular or nerves related reasons of your pain. Spine MRI might be helpful.

Thank you for your query. If gall bladder stone remain asymptomatic then there is no need of surgery. Her weakness may be due diabetes or its complication like diabetic neuropathy or nephropathy. Weakness with sudden fall of blood pressure is a feature of autonomic neuropathy which is also a feature of diabetes. Alteration of bowel habit may occur due to same problem. Though there is possibility of irritable bowel syndrome or non ulcer dyspepsia. So all complication of diabetes should be excluded.

Its elevation is commonly found in many disorders must most usualy is alcoholic, viral, autoimmune or toxic liver damage.Also it can be due to excessive execise.  The most common liver disorders is fatty liver which can be found in healthy people, but usually is resulting from elevated blood lipids, overweight and elevated blood sugar. If ultrasounds didnt find anything and viral markers are negative then you have no reason to be concerned. YOu should treat it by gdieatary and lifestyle habbits. Do exercise, avoid alcohol,smoking, fats,fast food and carbonated drinks. Eat more fruit and vegetables, boiled meat and follow some of hepatoprotective diets.

Once my daughter was born it started to happen again and i ended up in having my gallbladder removed.  2 weeks after the gallbladder was removed i had the severe pain in my right upper quad and all the way around to my back plus vomiting a grey substance.  This went on for 5 days and having 4/5 attacks a day the only thing taking the pain away was IM morphine and i was also given anti sickness jags.  I had an MRCP which showed i have 1 stone or 2 stuck in my common bile duct, i had an emergancy ERCP which didn't show any stones but they made a cut so that if i have any more stones etc they should just pass.  They said i was a high risk of internal bleeding because of the cut made.  I was fine after the ERCP but about 10 hours after it it was like something moved inside me (right upper quad) then it happend again a few hours past then i started getting spasms.  I have other sympotoms pain in stomouch, chest pain, and diarrhea.  Please help!!! thanks","Doctor":"Hello, xpittbullx1990x, You mentioned that the MRCP had shown retained stone or stones in the common bile duct , yet at ERCP they did not find any . Either the stones moved back up or dropped down after they made a cut into the duct. Usually bleeding occurs during or right after the procedure although delayed bleeding can happen with activity. It is possible the spasms could indicate movement of the retained stone and they would be dropping into the intestine and eventually passed in the stool. Diarrhea may be related to the slightly excess bile that is released into the intestine after the procedure , which can be normal and should not last long. If you have increasing abdominal pain, fever,chills, feeling faint etc , you should get in touch with the doctor as soon as possible to find out if there is any delayed continued bleeding. In any event you need to be closely observed . I wish you the very best."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Usually we suggest patients to walk 10-14 days after surgery so if this passed then there shouldnt be any problem. Bile leakage is rare but possible complication of CH-tomy. Stent removing is simple procedure so there is no need to be concerned about this. This is done on the same way as stent was placed. More important then physical activity is dietary changes.

We were asked to take Whole Abdomen report and Liver blood test. The Sonogram report mentioned that \\"The liver shows multiple isoechoic lesions with surrounding halo in both right and left lobes. S/O Metastases. Right cortical renal cyst\\". The DGKC blood report had 482 U/L and Gamma GT Serum is 481 U/L. All other blood results are fine.  We are worried about the result outcome. Could you suggest what could be the actual problem ?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM! Thanks for posting your query here. Edema in both the lower limbs shows right heart or liver failure. The sonogram report is suggesting of metastases. Cancer cells from the other source of the body are invading the liver. They are spreading from the other part of the body where it is having cancer. So you should find out where the primary lesion is. The elevated levels of ALP-alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase shows a biliary or liver disease. These parameters are also elevated in alcoholic liver disease. But the finding of metastases is of concern. Right cortical renal cyst is a common finding in the elderly people. A cyst is a sac filled with fluid. It can be simple if it wont show pressure symptoms on the surrounding structures. Your Father-in-law needs to be further evaluated for the primary lesion.

I am also glad that you are not an alcoholic. Sonogram shows a contracted gallbladder which could be from chronic inflammation. No mention of stones.I am not sure if the doctors have ruled out autoimmune hepatitis by doing special blood tests such as ANA , Anti-DNA, Smooth muscle antibodies,Complement levels, Anti Mitochondrial antibodies etc. These are important because the treatment is different. As for your current enzyme levels and bilirubin levels , they are improving. SGPT is somewhat slow to come down and so is Alkaline phosphatase. Your current medications URSO and Liv52 seem to be working. As for diet, I suggest you avoid fatty, greasy and fried foods. A healthy high protein diet with enough carbohydrates (Sugar) is good.

Through this hole the camera is inserted and also gallbladder is taken out. That is why this area can give problems with healing. The large lump you have noticed in your belly button area is most likely hernia. Possible reason of it can be mentioned lifting your baby. Other possible reasons are wound infection, stone left in this area, irritation and inflammation due to stitches. I suggest you to visit your surgeon and have it checked. If it is a hernia, the wound needs to get healed completely and after that it can be repaired (for about 3 months).

I am seeing my surgeon on May 7th for my followup.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. This leakage is most likely caused by wound infection indeed. It may be caused by bacteria presence, irritation due to stitches presence, lost stone in the wound. The fluid can also appear due to incomplete abdominal cavity closure, or presence a part of perineum in the wound region. I suggest you to visit your surgeon sooner. It is because infection may spread to the surrounding tissues, the infection can cause poor tissues healing and result with hernia in this area. The wound needs to be checked by surgeon, drained if necessary. Antibiotics might be necessary as well. Hope this will help.

You tell us that you have had the diagnosis of Hep-C for over ten years. You also say that you are not on any interferon therapy. I am not sure if you were treated with any anti-viral therapy before.

There are very effective drugs that can cure Hep-C and acheive complete clearing of the virus. There are a number of options that you can discuss with a specialist who deals with hepatitis and has experience. Propranolol is a Beta Blocker and can reduce your pulse rate and help anxiety. Swelling of the feet may indicate fluid retention from liver disease and you may have fluid build up in the abdomen as well. This needs to be checked with a sonogram of the liver and abdomen.

I have been to a urologist and have no obvious deficits with lab work and ultrasound. Any advice?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Such recurring UTIs needs to be diagnosed as can lead to kidneys severe inflammation and failure. From your symptoms it sounds like you may have kidney stones. It is very common that such stones can not be visualized in the CT or ultrasound and the only proof of its presence is recurring back pain radiating to the lower abdomen and groin. Other reasons like narrows in the ureter can result with chronic utis due to impeded urine flow. Increased blood sugar level (diabetes) makes us prone to utis as well. Hepatic cyst and hemangioma are very common findings and most of them does not need any action except observation. Kidney stones are thought to be caused by diet, but as there is few types of stones and every type needs different diet, it is hard to advise which diet you should have. You definitely should drink a lot of mineral water (like 2-3 l a day). Increase physical activity. You may try to decrease sodium intake, animal proteins intake, avoid foods high in oxalate, such as spinach, rhubarb, nuts, and wheat bran. Your urologist should perform cystoscopy and urinary tract check with contrast. Hope you will find it helpful.

In Sept.2012 ,you say you had jaundice and sounds like Hepatitis of some sort, either Type A, B or C. Usually Type-A hepatitis does not go into a chronic phase. The other two can. Your bilirubin level has come down to normal and SGPT and SGOT are still elevated but seem to be improving. Now you are told about fatty liver. I am not sure if the doctors told you what grade it was. I have a feeling it is probably mild. At this stage , it can reverse back to normal. Do not drink alcohol and do not take any medications that might have affect on the liver. These include NSAIDS such as Naproxen, Ibuprofen etc. Also certain antibiotics belonging to the sulfa or tertacycline family. You need to avoid highly fatty, greasy foods and fried foods also. You can take supplemental protein drinks. I also recommend Vit-C 1000 mg. daily, Vit-E 800 i.u. daily and a good Super B-Complex vitamin pill daily. It is O.K. to excercise and play. Check your enzyme levels every 4 weeks. SGPT will take longer to come down than SGOT. Don't worry. If you are slightly overweight , try to cut back on calories and try to lose some weight. This will also help your fatty liver to return back to normal. I wish you the very best."},{"Patient":"Hi, I'm 28 yrs old and had a blood test on 4th april in which my sgot was found 49, sgpt 111 and triglyceride 229. from that day i stopped eating oily and fatty foods.

Your mother-in-law has jaundice and the doctors say that she has a liver tumor . There can be several types of growths or tumors of the liver. There are cysts, benign tumors and also cancerous tumors. If she has a cystic growth which is more than 5 cm. in size , they have to do surgery. Results are very good and she can recover completely. If she has growths called Adenomas , which are usually benign , if they are big, then surgery is necessary to remove it. Liver has tremendous regenerating power and a person can have half the liver removed and still lead a normal life. Cancer of the liver is more serious and it would have to be confirmed by special tests and biopsy. There are several options depending on how advanced the cancer is. Cysts and Adenomas generally do not cause jaundice unless they are near the channel or duct that carries the bile thus blocking . I cannot comment without knowing the specifics either CT-Scan or MRI ,ultrasound etc. We also need to know all her blood tests to find out the liver functions. I hope she will be under care of a competent surgeon who has performed liver surgeries in the past with good results. You may have to enquire around to find out. I really wish her the very best."},{"Patient":"I have been experiencing pain that seems to radiate from my center back to the front in the sternum area. This has been off and on for about a year.

Eat more fruit and vegetables, boiled meat and follow some of hepatoprotective diets. Findings usually improves on such measures within 1-2 months.

It can definitely be psyhosomatic pain, but I suggest to do some tests to rule out something more. usually stomach or pancreatic pain can manifest on this way especially if painkillers dont help. Also some lungs infections and hepatic disorders.. I suggest to do basic blood tests and abdominal ultrasound just to clear this out. If she has fever, vomiting or weight loss you should do tests as soon as you can.

This is expanded malignant disease and prognosis and treatment are hard to predict, but I cant tell details without more info. It is always possible that all these masses and changes are benign, but CT scan is usually accurate about this and this  looks like primary kindey cancer with multiple metastasis. This is hardly curable,almost impossible. First the surgical procedure should be performed and then chemo or radiotherapy or both. All in all long and difficult treatment is neccessary,but I hope that everything can still be well controled.

Firstly you need to find out what the doctor means by report being 'Good' and why are you assuming that you are positive for HbsAg. However  to answer your query since you are not vaccinated and if you are tested positive for HbsAg then it means you got this infection and you are a carrier of the virus.You probably got it through parenteral route like blood transfusion,tattoos,body piercing,infected syringe or sexual transmission.

The further management will depend on which type of bilirubin is raised. There are two types of bilirubin- direct and indirect. They are increased in different disease processes. Direct bilirubin is increased in diseases of biliary tract e.g. obstruction of the biliary tract, damage to liver cells by infections, inflammations etc. Indirect bilirubin is raised in conditions where there is increased breakdown of RBCs. So, after determining which type is raised the further management can be planned. Consult your doctor for further relevant investigations and management. Thanks and take care.

The other possible cause for lethargy could be hypothyroidism for which you need to undergo a few tests.

You could have primary liver disorder which might have affected the smaller ducts (Hepatic ducts) that carry the bile or you could have the main duct called the common bile duct blocked by a stone or scar tissue from repeat inflammation. What you need is a sonogram of the liver and gallbladder first. You need a complete set of liver tests and also immune studies to include ANA, Native DNA. Alpha fetoprotein,Anti smooth muscle antibodies and also Anti mitochondrial antibodies. If there is significant obstruction , your stool will be clay colored also. Your blood Alkaline phosphatase level will be very high. Hope you can discuss these with your doctor and get tested properly before they can decide on the treatment.

This is slighly increased SGPT only. Your symptoms may be caused by stomach issue or by fatty liver. Stomach swelling may be caused by high acid secretion which is found in gastritis. Symptoms that are experienced in such conditions are pain and tightness in upper stomach, bloating, breathing difficulties, heartburn, feeling of lump and sore in throat, gurgling sound in throat, fatigue and loss of apetite. Symptoms are aggravated after meal, long sitting, leaning forward,stress and anxiety. In the beginning this is treated by changing dietary habbits. You should avoid alcohol,coffee,smoking,fats and fast food, carbonated drinks and eat more milk and milk products, fruit and vegetables,boiled food and natural beverages and teas. 1 hour after meal you should not sit or lay. Also lay with elevated upper body. If you are overweight you should do often exercise. Also ypu should do ultrasounds to verify is there liver damage. I dont think that because you have no significant liver enzymes elevation. For improvement of these findings you should avoid alcohol and fats. COntrol your blood lipids, glucosa and lose weight if overweight.

Whatever it is further blood tests and abdominal ultrasound should be done. Till that, avoid alcohol,smoking, fat food,coffee and carbonated drinks. Eat easier food and milk products,drink water or tea. Speen cant cause such symptoms. SOme other reffered pain can be considered such as ureteral colics or pelvic infection,but in most cases this is related to stomach or gallbladder.

This is considered as normal finding in most laboratories. This means nothing and if you repeat the test today it might show -5+ parameter. So this isnt abnormal finding.

Cyproheptadine is antihistaminic medicine and dexamethasone is a steroid. Taking steroid to increase appetite is very dangerous and this practice is very common as a self medication. It need to stop. But stop dexamethasone slowly, as sudden discontinuation may lead to adrenal crisis or withdrawal. Your case need to investigated for loss of appetite. Liver dysfunction is also common cause for loss of appetite. For that it is better to meet general physician for examination and investigations. Same time you can meet nearby dietician to plan your diet to increase weight. Wish you all the best.

How ever let me provide you information. Some fat in the liver is normal. But if fat makes up more than 5%-10% of the weight of your liver, you may have alcoholic or nonalcoholic liver disease. In some cases, these diseases can lead to serious complications. If you don't have drinking habits then The cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is not clear. Certain factors tend to increase risk, but in some cases, no risk factors show up. However, Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease tends to run in families. It also shows up most often in people who are middle-aged and overweight or obese. These people often have high cholesterol or triglycerides and diabetes or prediabetes (insulin resistance), as well. Other potential causes of fatty liver disease include: Medications Viral hepatitis Autoimmune or inherited liver disease Rapid weight loss Malnutrition There is no specific treatment at this time for fatty liver disease. However, getting treatment for any underlying disease, such as diabetes, is essential. And you can take other steps to improve your condition. If you have alcoholic liver disease and you are a heavy drinker, quitting drinking is the most important thing you can do.

If the surgery was difficult due to location of the gallbladder or too much inflammation around , it is possible to develop some adhesions or scar tissue around that area. There is a part of the colon called the hepatic flexure that is close to the liver. If there is some kinking , gas can get trapped in that area and give you the bubbles. When you change your position the gas moves and you may get relief. Unless the problem is major you really don't need another surgery. Try to take simethacone containing pills that may help to break up the gas bubbles. Make sure you drink enough water also. You might consider getting an x-ray of your colon (Barium Enema) to see the shape of the colon. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"I am having a total hysterectomy on April 22nd.

Do bilirubin levels ever randomly spike due to alcohol consumption or could it be due to a diet high in protein? Help!","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. It might spike, dut not such high. This is severe elevated bilirubin and it should be evaluated especailly in such young people. It can be caused by liver disease in most cases but also some blood disorders as well. He recommended ultrasound because without it we cant find out the degree of liver damage. After that you ll know is this just fatty liver or there are signs of fibrosis. ALso it can be caused by biliary duct obstruction and gallbladder issue. All in all you dont need to worry, this is something treatable and reversible. YOu cant have cirrhosis or malignancy. It can be alcoohlic damage,autoimmune or caused by drugs and dietary. Whatever it is it will be found and you ll know further tratment, WIsh you good health."},{"Patient":"Hello I have a question regarding a health issue my fiancee just ran into. She was having pain in her chest several times last year and we kind of ignored it because I told her it was probably cramps or a pinched nerve. About a month ago the pain came back and worse then usual. The pain was in her left side of her breast, left arm and left side of her back. It got real bad 2 weeks ago and she had to go to the hospital. The doc told her it seemed like a minor heart attack and then said it might even be a pinched nerve in her some where where her ribs are, A blood test came back and we found out her main viens going from and to the heart are built up with calcium and she would have to do an \\"infusion\\" therapy once and we just wanted to know about this procedure. And this is being done over here in germany.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome no HCM!I passe through your fiancee's medical history and would like to explain that it is necessary a careful differential diagnosis to precisely clarify the issue of her recurrent chest pain.After checking her resting ECG, cardiac enzymes (CK-MB, Troponin), cardiac ultrasound, and chest X ray, it is necessary to perform a cardiac stress test which could come on different modalities (exercise cardiac stress test, stress echo, nuclear perfusional cardiac stress test [CARDIOLITE].Another option would be to undergo through a coronary angio CT. If sufficient data are drawn on a possible coronary artery disorder, then a coronary angiography is necessary to precisely define possible coronary lesions and decide the following plan of treatment (medication strategy, percutaneous angioplasty or a surgical option).You need to discuss with her attending doctor on the above mentioned issues.Hope to have clarified your uncertainties!Kind regards,Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"Hello, my 19 year old son has been vomiting, been dizzy for 2 weeks now.

This isnt something unusualy. He obviously have enlarged liver(this is explained to patient like swolen abs) but it means that doctor felt enlarged liver over his abdoinal muscles. His symptoms and raised liver enzymes are associate dwith this. Now he shound find out the exact cause. In most cases this is tempray liver damage caused by alcohol intake, gallbladder stones, viral hepatitis or some autoimmune disorders. Other possible causes are more serious but much more uncommon at his age. HE will do ultrasound probably and everything would be clear then. I am sure this will be fine.

Its a good idea that you avoid alcohol already. Weight loss and exercise are key issues in the management. I suggest a diet rich in vegetables, fruits and fibres. Regular exercise, avoidance of alcohol and avoiding taking of drugs toxic to the liver, especially drugs containing Paracetamol should be avoided. Consider the opinion of your treating physician before taking any drugs. Continual abdominal scans and liver function tests are keys aspects in your management, preferably by your gastroenterologist.

If the Intravenous cannula was kept in the hands,then it may be the cause for numbness as minor nerve injury might have occured.

Do you have yellow discoloration of eyes and urine/ decreased urine output/ decreased appetite/recurrent nausea or vomiting? Gamma GT is very specific to liver and higher values indicates liver pathology. SGPT is also specific to liver but it has multiple origins. You  should consult with internal medicine specialist/ gastroenterologist and should go for thorough check up. You should also go for ultrasound imaging for liver and kidney status. Rise in urea could be due to liver pathology. You should also go for Australia antigen and HCV. You should avoid banana, juices and coconut.

They should not be removed as there will be Bile leakage from cystic duct and the artery will bleed. It is not possible to remove them. 13-24 clips are more in number.They might have applied due to unexpected injury to any structure. But,complications after 20 yrs are rare.

About 9 months ago I began to get pain in the very top of stomach between breast and rib cage. This pain came on when I ate. At first certain foods, within few weeks it did not matter if I ate a pretzel or a cheeseburger the pain is all the same. Starts at top of stomach then my mid back, then my entire stomach hurts and feels bloated and gassy. About 8 weeks ago I did go to urgent care a Doc friend of mine told me to have the check for H-pylori , white blood cell count and liver enzymes. H-pylori came back positive other test were great.

It is because stomach mucous is hardly visible for the ultrasound. You have not mentioned what kind of surgeries you have had, but every abdominal surgery causes adhesions inside the abdominal cavity. Such adhesions can cause partial bowels obstruction and give abdominal pain like yours. That is why it should be ruled out as well. I suggest you to have upper GI endoscopy performed to check for peptic ulcers and to rule out the cancer. Discuss with your doctor about bowels obstruction and possible gallbladder disease.

If it was due to alcohol, you should definitely avoid it completely for the rest of your life. If the jaundice was due to something acute and unrelated such as Hepatitis A, or a medication induced liver injury, then I would wait until your liver is completely recovered for at least 6 months to a year (with completely normal liver enzymes). Consult with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist beforehand. No supplement is proven to help protect the liver. Milk thistle is popular, but the research studies show no benefit (unless given intravenous and in very high doses). Also milk thistle is not an FDA regulated supplement, so the efficacy, if any, varies depending on the brand."},{"Patient":"Hellow doc, iam ashwin an month ago diagnoisd in an usg as attunation of echoes seen with impression as fatty liver , later 15 days again had an ultra sound at an another centre finding were homogenous paranchyml echoes noted in liver, spleen and pancreas , iam very much worried my sgpt and sgot are 35 and 69, i have cholestrol 243, vld as 170, iam having rosuvaas 5mg one at nite , ulyses plus twice and evion 400 twice , it it any thing wrong in my liver? ,what should i do next, i wakg daily for 45 mintes and in strict indiet of low fat,","Doctor":"Hello, ashwin, It looks like the condition you have meets the criteria for \\"Metabolic Syndrome\\". You have high lipid levels, have fatty liver and perhaps you may be overweight. It is also possible that you could be pre-diabetic or have Type-2 Diabetes.

I also recommend Vit-E , same dosage /day. Higher doses may be actually harmful. I am glad you are on a low fat diet and also excercing which is good. You do need to lose weight if you are 15-20% overweght. The liver enzymes should improve in time 3-6 months if you follow above regimen. At this stage the liver can recover completely without getting worse.

By lowering these parameters you protect your liver too. WIsh you good health."},{"Patient":"hi sir,I have gone through LFT test while taking treatment for jaundice and i found my bilirubin total (3.1) ,SGOT/ SGPT reading too high(1840/2040) and alkaline phosphate (348) .All others like blood counts etc are normal in reports.I do not have fever.My doctor now (prescribes me medicine which contains URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID & SILYMARIN ,clindamycin hydrochloride,famotidine,primaquine phospate,Pls guide me whether i am taking correct medicines or not..I am 22 and dont have habit of drinking alcohol,cigars etc.","Doctor":"Hello, sudheer4b3, Your levels of enzymes indicates that you have acute hepatitis. I hope that your doctor has done complete hepatitis screenig for all three major types A,B and C. If you have type A hepatitis , the enzymes should start coming down in 4-6 weeks from the onset of jaundice. If you have type-B Hepatitis , about 20-30% can go into a chronic phase and even after six months , the enzymes will stay abnormal. Same could be true for Hep-C if you have any of the risk factors. Clindamycin is an antibiotic and is not effective for viral infection. Urso and sylamarin may be helpful in reducing the damage to the liver. Primaquin is also not indicated for hepatitis virus. Famotidine is a H-2 Blocker and for acid control. I am glad that you don't smoke or drink. You need to be on a good high protein diet , take B-Complex Vitamin with C which is helpful. Hope you can discuss these with your doctor. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"My father from hepatitis A & E, has liver swelling as well, But today he complained of bleeding during pooping , Doctor told that he has water in stomach, what is that, What is the problem with him plus he complains of new things daily or on alternative days that have been already told by doctors to look for as signs PLEASE HELP ASAP AS WE WANT COMPLETE & PROPER CURE FOR HIM","Doctor":"Hi and welocme to HCM. Obviously your father has serious liver damage,but you shouldnt be worried because this is reversible and treatable. You must be sure that there is no hepatitis c and B. His liver function must be evaluated by ultrasound and liver enzymes every 2 weeks.There is no specific cure.  He must rest strictly, follow hepatic dietetary and keep constant weight and hidration. Blood in stool is usually caused by fissurae and hemorrhoids, but considering that he has hepatitis and possible liver failure he should do examination at gastroenterologist. This can be sign of something serious. WIsh you good health."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Annie. I have been on subtext for 8 years as a substitute for heroin addiction . I started off on a high dose and am now on 6 mlgrms pr day. I have recently had chronic liver fatigue and signs that my Hep C is active. I am waiting for the results from the hospital as I m contemplating have the Interferon treatment. Subtext has saved my life, I would have died of a heroin overdose had I continued using, or another car crash of which I had several!! I do however worry that Subutex has a negative impact on my already damaged liver. Could you please tell me if this is true... Thank you...","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. Yes this is true unfortunately, but this isnt a reason to stop taking it. Hep C causes much serious liver damage than subutex. You should treat hep c  primary. I know that there is a minor chance that you are able to stop with subutex and you must consider all this as the best solution. You should follow doctors recommendations, rest, and do frequent liver check ups. Hep c is unpredictable disease and has its positive and negative phases. You need to hope for the best and nit to give up.

Smoking directly affects the lung and food pipe and stomach by irritating them. This causes dryness, reflux, and acidity. Smoking can predispose to a heart attack at a young age too. My suggestion is if your pain increases on walking up stairs then you need to consult Chest pain unit. If not, it is only because of the acidity. The best treatment for it is to quit smoking and to take antacids temporarily. That will work magic on your lung, heart, and stomach. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards, Dr Ebenezer Rajadurai, Internist / Hospitalist"},{"Patient":"Dear Sir, I had a successful 4 bypass operation during  February 2007.

I am a vegetarian. I keep fit by going for long walks and cyclng. Thank you. Egon Kramer","Doctor":"Hello Egon!Welcome on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that the troubles with breathing during the night could indicate possible sleep apnea. You should know that this disorder increases your cardio-vascular risk and the risk for hypertension. That is why it is important to get diagnosed on time and get the proper treatment for this disorder. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests to investigate for possible sleep apnea: - a chest X ray stuy and pulmonary function tests for obstruction- a resting ECG- an arterial blood gas analysis- a multi sleep latency test. Regarding your BMI, I do not find it concerning. I would just encourage you to continue on your healthy diet and keep being active. Consulting with a dietitian could help lose some pounds.

Even with gall stones,there is no need to remove it if there is no pain.Pain will be under your right rib cage at the upper part of the abdomen Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck,joint pains are not related to gall bladder.

It is immposible to be 100% sure that this is haemangioma considering ultrasound only,but it is good that some more serious liver malignancies are ruled out.

It can mean liver damage at any stage. Cirrhoiss is one of the worst consequence of hepatitis but it goues through phases and develops during many years. First stage is fatty live then fibrosis and then cirrhosis. If your liver enzymes are fine then this probably isnt cirrhosis,you just have minor liver damage which is inevitable in hepatiits. Enzymes would be more than 10x elevated in cirrhosis and you would have some serious symptoms. Fatty liver and fibrosis are almost completely reversible, cirrhossis is ireversible,but even small healthy part of liver can compensate its function so there is a long way from hepatitis to failure.

You are ok,but it seems to me like you are trying to find a reason to drink alcohol:) When you drink alcohol your urine is more diluted and there is higher amount of water in it so this is the reason why it seems like you dont have orange urine when after drinking.

Ever increasing number of patients with many co- mrbidities are being treated by this technique. However, significant concern prevails among the surgical community regarding its safety in patients with cardiac co-morbidity. A very large study of such patients was undertaken and it showed that laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be safely performed in patients with significant cardiac dysfunction. Such patients need proper evaluation by cardiologists and anesthesiologists If considered safe to undergo general anaesthesia, such patients should not be denied the benefits of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Optimization of cardiac status, administration of balanced anaesthesia and low-pressure pneumoperitoneum are essential steps to ensure patient safety. The chances of life threatening complications are rare, and in the eventuality, can be easily managed in a hospital with adequate cardiological support. Discuss with a cardiologist and an anaesthetist and abide by their evaluation. Thanks"},{"Patient":"I have liver cirrhosis from blood transfusions Inreceived in1977.

Are there any side effects of taking this medicine. Please not I am a non drinker also I had been detected with stone in Kidney around 2 years back but it has already been passed away. Thanks a lot for your reply Bikram","Doctor":"The enzymes are slightly elevated, and the Udiliv may help to decrease them, however you should get a work up by a doctor to find out why these enzymes are elevated, as this is not normal at all. It is not life threatening at this time, but if you have an underlying undetected disease, it may progress with time (such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B, fatty liver, autoimmune hepatitis, etc)."},{"Patient":"3 months before i diagnesd as fatty liver , from that day i felt lower right abdomen pain and terrible fatigue .. i stoped drinking .. and smoking . i took ultrasound scan which resulted bright echotexture fatty liver. i am 36 years old and wt 60 , there is no other notable symptoms i have,, i just wanted to know its fattly liver or something worse than that ,, i wold like to know fatigue due to fatty liver lasts as long as 3 months in a life of no alcochol or smoke","Doctor":"Hello, jayapen, Fatty liver can be associated with high lipid levels ,diabetes and overweight. If your blood sugar and lipid levels are normal , then the condition is not too bad. Also , your liver blood tests especially enzyme levels , if high that may be more serious. In most cases fatty liver could be reversed with a low fat diet, staying away from anything that can damage the liver such as alcohol and drugs including over the counter or prescription drugs. I would recommend that you start taking Vit-E 800 i.u. daily and Vit-C 1000 mg. daily. High protein diet , fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts are all good to improve liver. Hope you can discuss these with your doctor and take appropriate action. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"I was prescribed to perform endoscopy of upper GI and other tests like LFT, lipid profile , uric acid , thyriod. etc. When the result came it is found that H pylori is there and Some engyme of liver also increased.

I am assuming that the surgey was done through a laparoscopic approach. It is rather unusual to have problems with adhesions after this long interval. Now you mention about the pancreas being abnormal. If your pancreas enzymes like Serum Amylase, Lipase were elevated, you may have pancreatitis. This can be cofirmed by CT-Scan. Creon is a pancreatic enzyme supplement that is given for people who have deficiency due to repeted attacks of pancreatitis. The condition known as Chronic pancreatic insufficiency . This would make you to have fatty stools (Frothy and floats on the water and foamy as well). Hope this answers your concerns and you can talk to your own doctor. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"I had my gallbladder removed 3 months ago. i felt great and everything seemed to be going fine. until recently i started having shooting pain where my gallbladder used to be, accompanied by shooting leg cramps , anywhere between my hip and the bottom of my feet . I also contracted hepatitus c when i was younger (about 8 years ago). but it spontaneously cleared within a month or two of diagnosis. Could it be my liver? i have an appointment but i wanted to research before i went in.","Doctor":"Hello, heinsightz2020, I do not believe that your gallbladder surgery 3 months ago would have anything to do with your current symptoms. Shooting pain between the hip down to the feet is suggestive of pinched nerve or Sciatica which can occur with sudden twisting or some kind of misstep or lifting & bending action. As for your Hepatitis-C , you mention that it cleared spontaneously. I am a little skeptical about that, especially if you never had treatment. I advice you to get a complete set of liver tests, get a HCV-RNA viral count and see if the hepatitis is active. Hepatitis virus stays in your system long after exposure and a person can be free of symptoms for years before it starts showing it's effects. As you are probably aware, this chronic Hepatitis-C can lead to Cirrhosis and also liver cancer. It is very important that you have these blood tests done. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"Hello, for the past couple of weeks I have been getting randomly chest paints along with dizzy spells.

Other possible causes to consider would be: coronary artery disease, panic attacks or a musculo skeletal pain. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests to investigate for the possible causes: - a chest X ray study - a resting ECG and a cardiac ultrasound to examine your heart function and structure- an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to examine your heart rhythm trends during a prolonged time and investigate for possible cardiac arrhythmia- complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid gland dysfunction- blood electrolytes for possible electrolyte imbalance- PCR and ESR for inflammation- a blood lipid profile. A cardiac stress test would also help exclude possible coronary artery disease, if suspicions are raised during the above tests. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Hope to have been helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"Hello. I ordered lab testing for myself because I do not have insurance. I have been feeling very fatigued and achy for several months.

What do the combination of these abnormalities indicate?","Doctor":"hi high creatinine, high ketones and high cholesterol due to following reasons like diabetes, cardio vascular diseases, muscular dystrophy, kidney diseases,  hypo thyroidism etc so to prevent further damage of your internal organs  you must consult general physician for further evaluations and for the treatments. take care. get well soon."},{"Patient":"I noticed I have a knot in the middle of my chest right where the V is in your chest sometimes it hurts to touch it, it doesn t hurt on the inside it hurts like between the skin and my inside if that makes any sense at all. could you tell me if this is something to worry about or maybe does it have to do with my gall bladder? it sticks out a little bit and it is a round hard knot.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. It sounds to me like you have some subcutaneous lesion of abdominal wall. It is almost impossible to feel your galbladder and you would have crampy pain after meal. It is more like some kind of benign tumor, lipoma, fibroma or atheroma, whichican be easily surgucaly removed. If you think that this is intraabdominal then you must do ultrasound and further examination. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, I have a raised readings of SGOT 50 UL and SGPT 104 UL.

Am I on the right medication? What does g1 fatty lever means? I am an occasional drinker. Does this have any impact on the same.","Doctor":"Hello! Thanks for being with us. Fatty liver is a reversible condition where vacuoles of triglycerides get accumulated into the liver cell. Excessive alcohol intake and metabolic syndrome (obesity,dyslipidemia,hypertension,diabetes) are two most common causes of fatty liver. Both these factors,dyslipidemia and alcohol are present in you. Hence this could be the cause for your fatty liver and deranged liver function i.e. SGOT AND SGPT. Grade 1 fatty liver is not harful at this stage but it may progress to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. I would like to suggest to get physician opinion for treatment of dyslipidemia and avoid alcohol as for as possible. Other causes of fatty liver that should be considered are: 1.drugs and toxins. 2.malnutrition or rapid weight loss 3.inflammatory bowel disease 4.diverticulosis 5.gastric bypass surgery 6.HIV 7.HCV Hope this will help you.

If your liver is damaged, it may take several months for it to recover after you have stopped alcohol. Sometimes it never gets to be able to come back to normal (if you have too much scarring in your liver, leading to cirrhosis). You should have a healthy diet as well."},{"Patient":"Hi There. My doctor called me and said one of my liver tests came back slightly elevated , im going to call him monday to see what slightly elevated means. He said that he wants me to repeat blood work in 2-3 weeks and he will schedule a liver ultrasound soon to be sure. The blood work was done 12 weeks after completing a cycle of winstrol. what do you suggest to bring my liver enzymes back to normal range?","Doctor":"It depends of which liver enzymes are elevated (AST, ALT, Alkaline phosphatase or bilirrubin)? Depending on the reason why they are elevated is that recommendations can be given for you to get them back to normal. A good start is to avoid alcohol, and lose weight."},{"Patient":"Hello, Im 35 and 13 weeks pregnant. My ALT/AST levels were 79 and 37 last week. 2 months ago they were very well under the normal range. I have a history of Pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome and I also tested negative for Hepatitis B . I got the Flu 2 months ago. Could that have increased the levels? Will diet make a difference","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query, the past history of pre eclampsia and HELLP syndrome are very important to be signaled to your treating obstetrician. This exposes you certainly to a higher probability of having the same symptoms in subsequent pregnancies, demanding a more keener followup. Raised ASAT and ALAT early in pregnancy in this case are not very surprising and require a very keen follow up. Drugs not prescribed by your physician should highly be avoided. The flu certainly cannot be responsible for raised ASAT/ALAT levels 2 months later. A keen liver function test, blood pressure, kidney function and ultrasound monitoring are keys issues in the followup. I suggest you comply to the prescriptions of your obstetrician and never fail to signal any abnormal feelings in case they do come up.

Yours is an advanced stage of liver disease with cirrhosis and also what is called \\"Portal Hypertension\\" which is the reason for build of fluid in the belly and also legs. You need to have a complete blood examination including blood count, coagulation studies, kidney and complete liver tests . We have to make sure that you are not anemic from blood loss which can happen with ruptured veins in the esophagus and stomach. This is very serious. You can also go into a \\"Coma\\" (Hepatic  Coma ) which could be fatal. I am sure by now , you have stopped drinking any alcohol. You need to see a gastroenterologist who can perform the necessary tests and put you on a treatment program. This would include dietary measures, restricting proteins and salt intake. You may require \\"water pills \\" or diuretics to make you lose fluid build up, you may need drug to prevent you from going into coma (Encephalopathy) and medications to prevent bleeding from the varices (Enlarged veins) by the use of some Beta Blocker drug. You may need endoscopy to look for these veins and if there is active bleeding they may have to place clips or do banding procedure to stop the bleeding. There are other procedures that can be done to control fluid build up with the use of \\"Shunts\\" etc. You really need to sit down with your doctor and discuss all these. This is a serious problem and I urge you to take care as soon as possible. I wish you the very best."},{"Patient":"Hi. My father is of 49 year age. He has hepatitus c positive since year 2004 with genotype 3. In 2005, he was treated with Pegasys with ribavirin for 6 months but unfortunately the treatment was not successfull. Again after break of 7 years his treatment was started 6 months before with Pegintron with Ribavirin. Doctor suggested that the treatment will last for a year. After 6 months, the virus is still present in the blood with the Real time PCR quantitative1600 IU/ml. At the start of treatment it was 922,812 IU/ml. My family is too much worried about him. Kindly guide....?Are results satisfactory?","Doctor":"Hi, Based on the treatment information every things look pretty good. (1) Let me give you some information about clinical trial for genotype-3  treatment, it shows that 24 week treatment only cures 65% of patients so in order to achieve or cover the complete 100% case it need to have 40 weeks treatment, so in theory we will be able to cure 100% cases. But we are taking  year worth of medicine will cure you from HEP-C WITH 130% result, hope it makes sense, if not try to read it again, More over in simple words you will be cured completely even before 12 months of medication but YOU ARE a reoccurrence case so taking medication for 12 months is a great option. (2) Now let talk about the PCR- IT REDUCED BY MANY FOLDS from 922,812 IU/ml  to  1600 IU/ml. Its the best result one can have. So from that estimate the PCR Will be near zero in next 3 months but please continue taking medication as physician has asked for, as this is a naught disease and can reoccur if not cured completely . (3) PLEASE let your family know that things are working fine even better then expected, so their is nothing to worry about and will be as normal as before after 6 months of treatment.

It really sounds like gallbladder disorder.It doesnt need to be coused onla by stones which should be seen on CT. Galbladder motility disorders or main bile duct disorders can do it as well.

She has had stomach pains for 3 months now and been in & out of the ER. Is it pancreatitis, or just menstrual cramping?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. What about amylase test? It is not common that such lipase level elevation is related to menstruation or any other organ but pancreas or bowels. You should focu on these to and rule out any serious disease. In pancreattis lipase level varies during the day and this is nothing strange. Some abdominal partial or temporary bowel obstruction or gallbladder problems can cause lipase level elevation as well. I would do further tests,imaging and lab to find is there any particular cause of it. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Hello my doctor asked me to retake a blood test to test my ALT levels in a month. I had been drinking about three days before I took the blood test so I was wondering if that would have resulted in high ALT reading and that is why asking for me to do a retest? How much damaged must your liver for you to have a high Alt reading? Thank you","Doctor":"Hi Bibi.you didnt mention how high ALT is. 2x or 3x higher than normal is a sign of hepatic or biliary damageusually biliary obstrucuton or gallbladder stones) It can be caused by alcohol or any other factor. More specific test for alcohol abuse is GGT. If only ALT is raised and you consider that you are not heavy drinker then liver damage iis probably minimal. Ultrasound can visualize is there any sign of cirrhosis. YOu should do freuent liver enzyme test and stop drinking till values fall to normal range. If alcohol abstinence isnt enough then other possible cause should be found such as viral or autoimmune hepatitis or biliar tree obstruction. Wish you good health"},{"Patient":"I have been told that i need my gall bladder removed, recently my attacks have changed, they are now in my back, my sides and lower abdminal pain and it feels like my insides are on fire.

These sounds like biliary colic but if pain radiate to back then also biliary pancreatitis could have beed developed. YOu should do lab tests and ultrasound to exlcude it. If you have any sign of gallbladder inflammation such as fever, right abdominal pain when breating deeply or vomiting you emergency surgery should be considered. If pain reduces on painkiller this is a good sign.

Thse symptoms are serious. It comes with disorders you ve mentioned but alos many other can cause it. It is obvious that she has liver damage and everything else coes as a result of this. You need to find the exact cause of this damage. First thing to think is viral hepatitis, autoimunne hepatitis, drugs and alcohol abuse,bile duct obstruction. Also it doesnt need to be infection, some congenital liver and spleen disoreders, blood disorders such as haemolytic anaemia and metabolic disorders can cause it,even heart failure as well.. There are many specific tests, i doubt that cause cant be found. Infection can be ruled out by immunological tests,by hemoculture and urine analysis. Intraabdominal abscessus can be visualized by any imaging tests. MRI can give detailed picture. Autoimmune disorders are also ofund by specific tests and treated by streong medicines. SO just encourae her to find the eact cause even if it means repataed tests for few times. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Hi, My father in law suffers from vertico (spelling?).

You should trust your doctor and abide by his instructions. The goal of treatment is to correct the blood sugar levels without being aggressive and without causing hypoglycaemic attacks. Since the sugar levels are still uncontrolled,let your doctor decide what to give and see he response of the drug patiently. Sometimes it takes many weeks on the part of doctor to achieve proper sugar control. Besides medications,your husband should follow dietary restrictions as advised by the doctor and must do regular exercises,which help in better control of blood sugar levels.

And this should be ruled out at first. To do that, heart ECG and heart enzymes should be checked. It is also possible that there is a stone in your bile ducts and it is causing your pain. Usually gallstones are invisible in the CT, that is why abdominal ultrasound should be done. Do not know what blood tests were performed but you should have GGTP and AP checked (usually elevated with bile ducts stones). Upper GI endoscopy should be also done to rule out peptic ulcer. If no findings in ultrasound and blood tests, ERCP procedure should be also considered (to contrast pancreas ducts and bile ducts). Hope this will help.

The most common causes for high liver enzymes are consumption of alcohol,diabetes,triglycerides,obesity,consumption of lot of pain killers etc and various types of hepatitis. Your life style change can normalise these levels in few months time. What to do... Quit alcohol. Reduce your calorie intake and reduce your weight. Avoid sweets and deep fried foods. Avoid junk foods and colas. Consume fresh fruits and green vegetables. Do regular aerobic exercises. Take super B complex vitamin with 1000 mg of VIT C. In next few months time,you should be all right. Consult a gastroenterologist if liver enzymes persist or get elevated,even after the lifestyle changes.

Thanks for using this forum on HCM. The inter relationship of menstrual cycle and the symptoms after gall bladder removal has been studied and still research is going on. The explanation lies in the fact that during menstrual cycle two hormones, estrogen and progesterone play important role. Progesterone is known to cause delayed gastric emptying which means food is released more slowly from the stomach. After gall bladder removal surgery, bile content in the stomach increases much folds. The bile content increases further during menstrual cycle from the fact that progesterone delays food release. This combination of delayed emptying and increased gastric bile reflux leads to discomfort in epigastric region along with vomiting. Consult with your doctor for further anti emetic prescription. Feel free for further queries. Regards."},{"Patient":"i had my gall bladder taken out during the christmas holidays of 2012 and i am having random episodes of the same symtoms i had before.

Thank you for the query. Quite often it happens that peptic ulcers pain is misdiagnosed and after finding gallstones, symptoms are thought to be from gallbladder. That is why some part of gall bladder surgeries does not give any improvement. Gallstones pain is located in the upper right abdomen and radiates to the back. Nausea and vomiting is present especially after fatty foods or fried foods. Peptic ulcers pain is more in the upper middle abdomen, and does not radiates to the back. It appears after 1-2 hours of the meal, nausea and vomiting is present. So if your symptoms are more like peptic ulcers, upper GI endoscopy should be performed. Other possible reason of your symptoms are stones present in the bile ducts. In such case, symptoms are very similar to gallstones symptoms. If your symptoms sounds more like gallstones, you should have abdominal ultrasound, blood work, liver tests (AST,ALT,GGTP,AP), amylase and if stones will be confirmed, ERCP procedure should be a remedy. Hope this will help.

I am Bi-Polar; and my weight fluctuates depending on what medications I am able to take and the amount of sleep I am receiving, due to severe sleep apnea ( I have a Bi- Pap unit but only within the past 9 months (new model) in the past 10 years have I been able to use it due to nasal and palate restriction in my airways complicated with central sleep apnea. I do not have any history of even moderate alcohol use and I have never done drugs. Should I be looking for a more aggressive treatment for protecting and or helping my liver to regain any potentially lost function. When I take Liv 52 4 caps per day my liver functions (ALT AST) come back normal; when I don t they are elevated. my weight is currently on the losing curve and I am down to 269 lbs and 36% body fat. I am fairly stable with 1 amitriptyline 25mg and 1 2mg klonopin a day. Is metadoxine a possibility.

And myextrahepatic measures 10mm at its proximal third tapering to approx 8mm distally could you please explain.

A 10mm duct becoming 8mm is suggestive of narrowing which can be extrinsic or intrinsic and needs to be evaluated. At times a Contrast enhaced Ct yields more information on such issues. Get a stool occult blood examination done. If positive then a upper GI scopy and Ct may be indicated.

A double contrast CT of the abdomen will reveal whether the lesions are solid or cystic, vascular or avascular. This will lead to a clue as to whether they are benign  or malignant in origin. If still the surgeon is unable to comment then a CT guided FNAC of the lesion will help in arriving at a diagnosis.MRI scanning is not so helpful in diagnosis of abdominal  lesions.

Then some complications in the protien levels shown as well as some haemolysis ( Haemoglobin went up to 7). Doctor did endoscopy to assertain any verices, it was absent. He told me it is acute hepatic failure. since October the levels start decreasing. In January, the readings were total Billiburin 1.25, Albumin 4.0, A/G= 0.8, SGOT 46, SGPT 89. Hg 12.2, In the Ferbuary end reading is Billirubin 1.6, Albumin 4.2, A/G 1.4, SGOT 63, SGPT 57, Hg 12.8. These two readings are from two different laboratories. My energy levels are quite fine (not exerting heavily though). Does the enlarged billirubin level is alarming? My email id is YYYY@YYYY . Kindly reply,","Doctor":"Dear pairajesh007, I am looking at the January and February lab results and they do not look alarming. Eventhough the enzymes are still elevated slightly , they will continue to improve. Bilirubin level 1.25 -1.6 again is not very high. You might probably have a slightly higher indirect bilirubin than direct which indicates a slight hemolysis. But your Hemoglobin levels are O.K. Keep eating a good high protein diet, take a good Super B-Complex Vitamin along with 1000 mg. of Vit-C supplement. I am sure you will be back to normal soon. Hepatitis-A does not go into a chronic phase.

Such mild derrangements can be seen in mild hepatitis, early stages of alcoholic liver injury , fatty liver diseae, cirrhosis of liver, metabolic liver diseases like wilson's disease  etc..Since your liver functions have improved ,it is a very good sign. Some more  tests that you can get done to make it sure that every thing is fine  include  USG whole abdomen espicially hepatobilliary system, HBs Ag TEST, HCV serology and ECG  Your epigastric heavyness can also be due to acid peptic disease, so you consult a gastroenterologist who will reveiw your reports and will advise you accordingly Hope every thing is going to be fine with you and wish you good luck and speedy recovry thanks Dr Arshad"},{"Patient":"Hello.

I am Dr. Prasad Akole (Critical Care Expert-  and am glad to address to your query here. Your scrotum is most probably swollen due to trauma or bleeding in the sac. Is it discoloured bluish black? You should seek immediate surgical consult in an ER. If testis is traumatised, waste of time can cause serious problems. Take simple paracetamol if available at home for pain and use cloth/ underwear support for the enlarged scrotal sac to hold it up and reduce pain. I hope you are fully satisfied with the guidance I gave. I would be glad to answer any further queries. Please ask for any clarifications before closing and rating this answer.keep me posted on the progress.

The liver cyst was surely discovered by chance from the CAT scan and is will rarely be accused as the cause of her gastroenteritis. Rarely, liver cysts may indicate a serious, underlying condition such as: - Polycystic liver disease, an inherited disorder - Echinococcus infection, a parasitic infection - Liver cancer If too worried biopsy might be required. I suggest her stools get analyzed for possible bacterial or fungal cause of the gastroenteritis. If that be the case, treatment with antibiotics will be required and oral rehydration therapy might also be necessary (depending on her state of dehydration).

This month, i went to doctor, he performed all the blood test, endoscopy , ultrasound, etc and he said everything is normal, but still I can feel the pain. So, last week I did the CT scan and the Impression results shows that - small hemangiomas and tiny simple cysts in liver may I know what is small hemangiomas and tiny simple cysts in liver ? Is it searious problem? Thanks, Vijay","Doctor":"Hello, sbears123, Your ultrasound was negative for gallstones which possibly rules out gallbladder problem as the reason for your right sided abdominal pain. I am glad that all the blood tests and endoscopy were negative as well. It is possible to have trapped gas in the part of the large intestine that is behind the liver , called the \\"Hepatic Flexure\\" which is a bend or curve. If you have constipation problems , this could be the reason for pain. Otherwise , it could be musculoskeletal. As for the small cysts and hemangiomas , unless they are more than 5 cm. in size , you don't have to worry. They don't cause problems. If they are big , hemangiomas can bleed and cysts can get infected, rupture or bleed. You may have a followup ultrasound of the liver in six months to see if there have been any change in size of these.

Elevated liver transaminases indicate injury to liver cells which could be due a  transient or chronic affection and  mild or severe liver affections. Causes of elevated transaminases include hepatotoxic drugs such acetaminophen, hepatitis, alcohol, obesity, fatty liver, myositis, muscular dystrophy, liver tumours etc. Oestrogen which you must have taken in the medicine that you used to regulate your menses is known to possibly elevate levels of liver function tests. However, detail examination and investigations have to be made in order to be sure of what is the problem; you will need to see your doctor (not necessarily a gastroenterologist for now) as such for an examination and for further testing such as markers for hepatitis, CBC etc as the case may be following the examination.

Your pain can be caused by umbilical hernia (if the surgery was done laparoscopically) or urinary tract infection. This is not the part of healing process. Sometimes fluid accumulation around the navel can cause such symptoms as well. The skin becomes tender and painful in this area. You should have abdominal ultrasound performed, urine analysis and blood work done. Hope this will help. Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am a 35 year old male, and aside from high blood pressure and high cholesterol (both treated by medication ), I am in very good health. Last week I went to my doctor for a routine physical, and he was alarmed at my total bilirubin level of 1.8. It had always been 0.6 or 0.4 in the past. He also was surprised at a 60 point jump in my cholesterol level, despite my being on medication for that, and having it be stable for many years. I am having another test done in two weeks, but now paranoia has set in as I find every on-line article about elevated bilirubin levels being potential signs of cancer (or gallstones). I could not find anywhere what the typical high total bilirubin levels are in cancer patients, so I do not know how my 1.8 level compares. I would like to know this if possible, and also, is a spike in the bilirubin level likely to happen for any other reason? It does not seem to fluctuate like sugar levels or blood pressure can, so I am worried that it is an indicator of something bad. Any information regarding that type of bilirubin level would be very greatly appreciated. And also, would there typically be other indicators present at the same time in a blood test that would indicate cancer as a possibility? Thank you very much. Sincerely, Marc YYYY@YYYY 2-23-13 UPDATE: Yesterday I had a liver function/bilirubin test. The results were that my total bilirubin came down to 1.2 (0.2 direct and 1.0 indirect). My cholesterol was not checked, but now my sugar went from 92 two weeks ago to 110 now! I am concerned that with a big jump in my sugar now and cholesterol two weeks ago, and in conjunction with a high bilirubin, this may mean that I have some liver or pancreas problem. I am extremely concerned. My doctor wants me to wait a month and then repeat the tests. Any thoughts would be extremely appreciated. Incidentally, all other tested levels were in the normal range, but I don t know if that means I can rule out a liver or pancreas problem. Thank you all so much.","Doctor":"Hello, glaucus, Let me assure you that you don't have liver or pancreas cancer. Bilirubin is a combination of conjugated and unconjugated, that is direct and indirect components. Usually the Direct fraction is more than the indirect. The total can fluctuate anywhere from 1.2 -1.4 mg/dl. In your case you have a slightly higher indirect fraction. This is very commonly seen as a fasting hyperbilirubinemia. There are rare genetic disorders such as Gilbert's syndrome where the indirect fraction is high. This is a benign condition and the bilirubin levels go up more during infections, stress etc. Condition is diagnosed by liver biopsy. Very rarely this is associated with pigment gallstones. As for choleterol levels , if you had a rich fatty meal the day before, even if the blood was drawn after 12 hours of fasting , the level can be high. Caffeine is known to elevate cholesterol levels also. Blood sugar levels that you mention are also in the normal range. Stay with a low fat, low cholesterol diet, stay on the medication and your doctor will decide if you need a change of drug. Continue active excercises. Stay away from smoking and alcohol. I am sure you will do fine. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"Hi, My mother(age=55) is high BP pateint and taking BP medicines since last 6.5 yrs, recently she had LFT test, she had Gamma GT =192 & alkaline phosphate =143, rest all results are in rages.she also had hepataitis test and that test is also clear Please guide me what could be the reason fort high gamma Gt & alkaline phosphate?","Doctor":"Hello Bushra, Nice to see that you are concerned about your mother's health. The common cause for a high level of gamma GT is related to alcohol intake. But other causes related to increase levels could be due to medications ( reason why her BP medicines should be checked again by her prescribing doctor, hepatitis/liver diseases such as cirrhosis ( which must not be necessarily of viral origin; so wish to know what hepatitis tests were done and if an abdominal/ liver scan was done. Biopsy could be helpful) and also some cardiovacular diseases such as myocardial infarction (of course she would have presented with a heart attack, so this is ruled out). Non the less it is better you get to an internist for further review ( so he can relate the cause of the elevated enzymes). Above causes can also raise the alkaline phosphatase and also bone diseases need to be ruled out. First of all if your mother is a heavy or moderate alcohol consumer it is high time she quits, if she is not, then other causes could be investigated. Cheers and wish your mother a better health"},{"Patient":"I am 31 years old lady when take scan of my abdomen it shows the following features about my liver please give the suggestions.

Wall and lumen normal. CBD : Normal Portal vein : normal Spleen Normal in texure. Measures 10.0 cms","Doctor":"Dear patient, i think that you are talking about the ultrasonographic (USG) Scan findings of your abdomen, i don't know the reason why you have got it done but the USG findings that you have mentioned are suggestive of FATTY LIVER . Fatty liver is a condition in which there is accumulation of triglycerides (fat) in excess amount than normal inside the liver parenchymal cells due to various reasons. It is a reversible condition provided the underlying conditions that cause it are treated, removed or controlled. If left untreated it may remain static, or may lead to liver cell injury causing hepatitis which we call steatohepatitis and may even progress to end stage liver disease known as cirrhosis of liver. Common causes of Fatty Liver include Alocholism, Viral Hepatitis espicially Hepatitis C , Metabolic syndrome (which includes Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity and Dyslipidemia) , Certain Drugs like steroids, amiodarone and tetracyclines, environmental hepatotoxions like phosphorus and certain mushrooms and finally malneutrition. So you may require few more test to see wheather your liver function is normal or not and to see wheather you may be having some underlying condition causing fatty liver like diabetes and dyslipidemia . There fore following test are required to be done ,LFT, LIPID PROFILE, BLOOD SUGAR FASTING, HBsAg, HCV Serology, TFT(Thyroid function test because hypothroidism causes dyslipidemia). Treatement measures will include avoidance of alcohol if you consume alcohol, avoidance of high fat and high carbohydrate intake, weight reduction if you are obese or over weight, aerobic exercises, and proper treatement of diabetes, hypertention, dyslipidemia and hypothyroidism if you have happen to have any of these, avoidance of any culprit medicines or toxions if feasible. Periodic reveiw of fatty liver status with USG abdomen and liver function test may be done after six months"},{"Patient":"my father is suffering from chronic liver disease .He is taking heptral,udiiliv, evion ,zevit. serum bil is2.5 Allother tests also deranged No symptoms of portal hypertension He is having very decreased appetite He is nonalcohalic No viral infection in liver and no autoimmune disease How can his appetite be increased He is 78 years and a known case of diabetes although controlled","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query. With the available described symptoms, there appears to be high possibility of Non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced chronic liver disease. Presence of diabetes and deranged liver function with already diagnosed history of CLD suggests the diagnosis. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ gastroenterologist and should go for thorough check up. He must have some degree of portal hypertension as he has CLD with deranged liver function test. He can take Liquid Aptivate for increasing appetite. Other appetizer available in markets contains cyproheptadine which has some sort of sedative effects; avoidable in liver disease. He should take normal diet. Aptivate and normal diet will help your father. Take care, Dr. Mayank Bhargava"},{"Patient":"Had gallbladder removed March 2012.

If stones will be found, ERCP procedure will be necessary and will cure this conditions. If no findings in this tests, abdominal CT should be performed to see if the pancreas is fine and if there is no other things inside the abdominal cavity. Hope this will help.

You mention you drank alcohol a month ago. If you were drinking on a regular basis before, it is possible that your liver enzymes could remain abnormal especially ALT,GGT, not so much the LDH & SGOT. You also mention that you are on a low calorie diet. You must be doing this to lose weight. If you are 10-15 % overweight , it is possible you may have Fatty Liver (Non-Alcoholic-Liver-Disease). Get a complete liver profile, blood count,diabetes check, and also screening for Hepatitis B & C.

Most of them are found during routine sonogram or CT-scan done for some other reason. Liver cysts can be associated with cysts in the spleen and also kidneys. Like in your case, ovarian cyst. Sometimes , a big cyst in the liver called the Hydatid cyst can be associated with parasites. Your cyst in the liver is 5.8 cm in size which is not small and requires close followup. Best thing is to have a sonogram every 6 months and see if the cyst is growing in size. Bleeding, rupture and infection are the complications. If there is any suspicion , you need surgery for excision of the cyst by a competent surgical specialist.

The best approach is to do the following: Quit alcohol completely and not even a single drop,if you want your liver to become normal,otherwise it will progress towards alcoholic hepatitis and ultimately cirrhosis. Maintain your weight at normal level, based on your height. Regular exercise (e.g., brisk walk for 40 minutes a day ) Maintain your blood glucose and lipid levels within the normal range.

This could either be infectious (Hepatitis B or C most commonly), due an intoxication (Drug) or several other factors. An abdominal ultrasound and a Chest X ray might be very usegul in making things clear and guiding further evaluations. Other specific markers of liver lesions like Alpha feto proteins, gamma amino butyrique acid and 5' Nucleotidase exams, shall be asked based on these preliminary results. Excess urination deserves a urinalysis to screen for a urinary tract infection and detect  ketones or glucose for diabetes.

Since the liver is the major organ responsible for alcohol digestion or detoxification it turns to accumulate a lot of fat converted from the high calories contained in alcohol. Ones you are already having fatty liver due to alcohol, it is advisable to stop completely alcohol as recurrence is most likely and continues fatty liver will definitely lead to hepatitis and hence consequently liver failure which when it complicates results to irreversible damage to the liver such as a fulminant hepatitis or hepatic failure/ liver cirrhosis/hepatocellular carcinoma. These complications which started initially as fatty liver (even though you see it as mild diseases) resulted to liver failure and subsequently early death.

Your mother in law had a silent heart attack which is very typical in diabetics. Stents are put to reopen and establish flow in the arteries of the heart which are blocked. Due to the silent heart attack that she had, the heart pumping function seems to have suffered. Hence it is not able to effectively pump all the blood it receives leading to fluid overload. This excessive fluid tends to accumulate in the lungs. This causes breathing difficulty. This condition is known as pulmonary edema. I suppose your mother in law is suffering from pulmonary edema.It requires treatment with diuretics (water pill), nitrates along with other medications for the stent and the heart which she is already on.Once the extra fluid resolves, she will get better. The Left ventricular ejection fraction or the pumping function is normally 55-60%. After a heart attack, it drops down.

The result reports mentions mild hepatomegaly and contraction of Gall Bladder . In my blood test Lipid profile is normal and Fasting sugar was 131 and post meal 99. Apart from this no other ailment. I am also not an alcoholic but drink 2 pegs once a fortnight. Please can you advice the probable cause and course of advice. Is it serious?","Doctor":"Hi for the query, An increase in the size of the liver (hepatomegaly) can be caused by various sources. From infections (viruses, bacteria, inflammatory diseases, genetic diseases and lysosomal storage diseases). Other conditions like heart failure and portal hypertension are also common causes. biological exams to search for viral hapatitis and liver enzymes (ASAT, ALAT), GTP and other exams are usually needed in identifying the cause of the increase. An abdominal ultrasound and CT scan could asked for in some extreme cases. Liver tumours, cysts and abcesses could cause this. Hepatomegaly at times is usually operator dependent and might be necessary to be done again at times to confirm this result. Consulting a gastroenterologist for a proper physical examination and selected paraclinical tests could be necessary to make a coordinated and reasonable diagnosis and making appropriate management plans. At times the increase in the size of the liver is due to a fatty liver, usually due to alcohol consumption, Small increases at times might be benign, that is not serious, but deserves a proper evaluation. Consulting a gastroenterologist is to me is the ideal thing to do. Thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD."},{"Patient":"Hello. I m 30 years old, 1.67m tall and weight 71Kg. During the last 4 years, I started to drink daily; the last 2 years I ve been drinking the equivalent of 2 liters of beer (5% alcohol) per day and also take alprazolam due to physical dependence (I had a depression and that was one of the meds I was prescribed). I measured today my ALT and GGP values and they were 54 and 144 respectively. I decided to stop drinking alcohol altogether. Even taking benzodiazepines, can I expect to see those values decrease to a normal level with alcohol abstinence? Thank you very much in advance.","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for asking. You can continue a benzodiazepine which is absolutely better to be prescribed by your doctor ( to give a benzodiazepine which is not metabolized by your liver preferably and also considering other factors) to be able to tolerate the withdrawal symptoms of alcohol abstinence. Almost in all the cases situation is reversible when it has taken just four years. Alcohol abstinence can lead to improvement from depression as well. You may ask your doctor to check your B12 level since it could be low in alcohol dependence. I wish you a good health."},{"Patient":"Hi, Doctor This is my mother report Liver is enlarged in size & is normal in echotexture. Liver span in right MCL measures 155.6 mm. I.H.B.R.s are not dilated.

It is also distended. She can have acute gallbladder attacks just like if she had gallstones. The liver size is slightly enlarged but the structures are normal. I assume that the reason for doing this was due to some kind of symptoms she was experiencing. It could have been abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting etc. If any of these are present, she needs to have her gall bladder out. Surgery is done through laparoscopic method and it is usually in and out same day surgery. I would have her get all the blood tests for the liver and also blood count. She should also have her lipid levels checked including Cholesterol ,total,HDL,LDL and also triglycerides.Blood sugar too.

Elevated enzymes can be sign of any liver damage or bile duct disorder. If she doesnt have any symtpoms then you shouldnt be worried.

This is usually comes from eating contaminated food or drink. The course usually lasts for 4-6 weeks till all the blood work returns to normal and you start feeling back to normal.

If your stomach is still upset , you can take a tablet of Omeprazole 20 mg. which you can buy over the counter. Take it about an hour to hour and a half before you eat in the morning. I want you to avoid fatty, greasy,fried foods. But you can have icecream , milk shake , hard candies etc. You need a good high protein diet. Eat fresh fruits like grapes, oranges,apple etc. Try to rest for an hour in the afternoon. I also want you to take a Super B-Complex Vitamin along with 1000 mg. of Vit-C daily.

Your symptoms can be caused by kidney stone, gallstones, pancreatitis or rib nerve neuralgia. Kidney stone usually gives sudden pain in the one side back which radiates to the lower abdomen and groin. Frequent urinating and pain while urinating appears. Gallstones or pancreatitis usually give abdominal pain which radiates to the back, nausea, vomiting associated with meals. Neuralgia gives sharp like needle pain which aggravates while moving the chest (breathing).

If it becomes an emergency situation when she develops severe pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting , ans yellow jaundice , that rquires immediate hospitalization and emergency surgery. At that time they may not be able to do the laparoscopic surgery .This type of surgery can be very safely done on an elective basis with in and out procedure, same day. The recovery is faster also. My personal preference would be not to wait till things get worse and turn into an emergency. I am sure the grandparents or other family members can help while she is recuperating.

Repeated attacks of pain associated with vomiting result in less appetite and also the fear of attack makes you eat less.Eating less results in a sustained weight loss over time. However you must get your sugar levels checked as uncontrolled diabetes may also result in gradual weight loss. You must consult a surgeon and opt for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This shall get rid you of your gall stones as well as your symptoms. Thanks"},{"Patient":"Had one episode of a fib brought on by dvt in leg and pulmonary embolism.

Since you have been completely evaluated for the heart including a thallium and persantine scan, there is no need to seek a cardiac evaluation now. Since you had DVT with pulmonary embolism, it may be possible that some amount of lung tissue was affected by the embolism and infarcted. This may be the reason of cough and the chest pain. Another reason for cough can be lung congestion brought on due to atrial fibrillation. But you have mentioned that you had only one episode of AF so i suppose, you have reverted to sinus rhythm.In your case, I suspect there is a lung issue more than a heart involvement. I recommend a chest X ray initially and if it shows any abnormalities, a HRCT chest to look for lung issues.Cardiac wise you need no evaluation except an ECG.Wishing you good healthRegards."},{"Patient":"My Liver Function Test results :- Bilirubin - total, serum by Diazo Method---------- Observed 0.40 Bilirubin - Conjugated, serum by Diazo Method--------- Observed 0.10 Bilirubin - UnConjugated, serum by Calculation------- Observed 0.30 SGOT (AST), serum by Enzymatic method --------Observed 19 SGPT (ALT), serum by Enzymatic method --------Observed 28 Alkaline Phosphatase , serum by pNPP-kinetic --------Observed 83 Protein (total), serum by Biuret method --------Observed 6.67 Albumin, serum by Bromocresol green method --------Observed 4.07 Globulin, serum by calculation --------Observed 2.60 So, are my test results ok?","Doctor":"Hello, Your results are absolutely normal and hence there is nothing to comment upon it.

I do urinate quite a bit and sometimes get up twice at night. I am not diabetic or overweight .","Doctor":"Hello, nancy, The number that you mention for Bilirubin level 26 seems wrong. Probably 2.6 mg. You would be extremely jaundiced and in liver failure if the Bilirubin level was 26 mg. I definitely think you should get a complete liver profile which includes all the enzymes , protein, albumin and globulin, blood count ,prothrombin time ,even Hepatitis screening. You should also get a sonogram of the liver and gallbladder to rule out gallstones and fatty liver. Especially fatty foods can trigger gallbladder attacks. Hope this will be of assistance to you.

If he has retained a lot of fluids , probably he has distended belly with fluid as well. I am not sure if he has been on any water pills or diuretics. Elaevation of the legs will help some but if he has massive ascites (Fluid in the abdomen) this may not be enough. Seeping of fluid indicates advanced condition. He has to be hospitalized, get a complete blood work up , including kidney tests to make sure he is not going into kidney failure also.

The levels of enzyme suggests you have some type of acute Hepatitis. If it is related to eating or drinking some contaminated food , more likely you have Type-A Hepatitis. The other ones are Type-B & C. Again , the type can be determined by blood tests with one hundred percent accuracy. Acute Hepatitis can last for 4-6 weeks before everything comes back to normal. A smaller percentage of patients go into what is called \\"Fulminant Hepatitis \\" and go into advanced liver failure. Your Bilirubin levels are not not dangerously high and the enzyme levels are fluctuating. As for diet , you need to eat lot of protein rich foods. If you are not a diabetic , carbohydrates , ice cream, milk shake, protein drinks are good. Avoid fatty , greasy or fried foods. Fresh fruits and fresh vegetables are good. Take a good Super B-Complex with Vit-C once a day. You don't drink alcohol which is very good. Try to take adequate rest and avoid heavy activities. Routine household work is O.K. Check the blood levels every 2-3 weeks and if they start going down there is no problem. If the enzyme levels stay abnormal after six months then it is called Chronic Hepatitis and this only happens with Type-B & C. Hope this helps you.

Other causes include severe illness and (rarely) tumors of the gallbladder-depending mostly on age and other risk factors. It occurs when bile becomes trapped in the gallbladder. The buildup of bile causes irritation and pressure in the gallbladder. This can lead to infection and a hole (perforation) in the organ. These stones can clear off after a while ( by dissolution) so can not be seen on CT scan ( probably reason for your presentation). Treatment will consist mainly of non-surgical means which include antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, pain killers, antispasmodics, antiemetics. The specialist you will need to consult is a gastroenterologist or a visceral surgeon. Hope this was helpful"},{"Patient":"I AM A 42 YRS MALE . MY LFT IS NORMAL BUT MY SERUM GGTP IS 84 IN VALUE .

You also say that you have been drinking Scotch whiskey on a daily basis and the amount is 6 Ozs. I am not sure how long have you been doing this. Longer the duration , more likely that your liver would be affected. I am concerned that you have an enlarged liver and fatty changes. I can tell you that this is early alcoholic liver disease. Eventhough your rest of the liver tests look normal , usually ALT or GGT can indicate liver problems. This abnormality will stay lot longer even after you completely stop drinking. That is what you have to do. Please quit drinking and pay attention to your diet. A good high protein diet , less fatty and greasy foods will help. If you are overweight , losing weight will help. You need to start taking a supplemental vitamin such as Super B-Complex with Vit-C daily. Eating fresh fruits and vegetables and regular physical activity should be part of your life style. If you continue your present habits , in time, fatty liver will turn into Cirrhosis and all the complications from that. Get your liver tests once in 3 months to see if they are improving.

The main symptom is usually pain and tenderness in the upper right abdomen. The pain can be steady or intermittent. If the pain is severe, it is usually caused by gallstones, not polyps. If there is no other problem with the gallbladder other than the polyps, no treatment will probably be performed unless the polyps are extremely numerous or over 1 cm in size, which could indicate cancer. In that instance, the gallbladder will most likely be surgically removed. Theoretically, if the polyps were large and/or located near the opening of the gallbladder, they could interfere with the normal drainage of bile out of the gallbladder and cause symptoms similar to those potentially caused by gall stones. If all other possible causes of your symptoms of pain are ruled out, then it is worth reconsidering the gallbladder polyps as a cause of your pain.

The right thing was done by doing an angioplasty at that time. Now regarding the other blockages, since you had blockages less than 70% you were kept on medical management. Angioplasty cannot be done for blockages less than 70%.  There is no way to clear all blockages of the heart. Blockages once they appear can be stopped from progressing, but not cleared. An angioplasty can clear the blockages but again by pressing the blockages against the stent. Since its many years since your stenting, I recommend you to undergo a yearly treadmill test to see whether the stent is patent or if other blockages have increased. If the blocks have increased in severity then angioplasty with stents should be done.

In the absence of objective findings such as with an echocardiogram or prior history of heart disease such as something you may have been born with [congenital heart disease], it is unlikely that you will have a major cardiac event with the planned surgery. Generally speaking, for a gallbladder surgery in a 21-year-old male, they would do preoperative labs and possibly a preoperative EKG and chest x-ray.  You would have a history and physical examination as well. The evaluator will then determine if further testing such as cardiac risk stratification with an echocardiogram or stress test is required based on the history you provide, your examination at the time and review of the labs/ekg/xray.

I went to use the restroom and I had a lot of clear mucus come out with a lot of blood in it.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Blood and mucus in the stool is very neglecting symptom and should be checked. It might not be associated with your gallbladder surgery. If it is fresh bright blood on the surface of the stool, hemorrhoids are the most probable reason of it. Otherwise, any other large intestine disease like polyps or even cancer can be a reason. In some cases after gallbladder surgery there are some stones left in the bile ducts or pancreas ducts causing such pains or even acute pancreatitis. Peptic ulcers and severe bacterial infection should be also ruled out. I suggest you to have abdominal ultrasound, full blood work, liver tests (AST,ALT,GGTP,AP), amylase, urine amylase, bilirubin, urine analysis, stool tests performed. If no findings, colonoscopy and upper GI endoscopy should be also done. Hope this will help.

Is this a normal aftermath of gall bladder removal? i cant identify something that i had eaten in common each of the times that it has happened, so i am not really sure what could be causing this. Any direction or thoughts on this is very helpful.","Doctor":"Hello, You seem to be suffering from post cholecystectomy syndrome ( PCS ). Postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) describes the presence of abdominal symptoms after surgical removal of the gallbladder (Cholecystectomy),like persistent pain abdomen,nausea,vomiting,bloating,diarrhea etc. PCS may occur in about 5 to 40 percent of patients who undergo cholecystectomy. Approximately 50% of cases are due to biliary causes such as remaining stone in either remnant of cystic duct or common bile duct,biliary leakage etc. The remaining 50% are due to non-biliary causes like inflammatory strictures around sphincter of oddi or around common bile duct. You must consult your surgeon and get ultrasound and CT abdomen done to find the exact cause. Thanks"},{"Patient":"My mother has COPD but she also has gall stones in her Gallbladder and every doctor that we have talked to has said that it is impossiable to do the surgery to remove her gallbadder because she would be stuck on a ventrolator for the rest of her life and a feeding tube . Is this the only way is there some way they can help to save her life because right now she s beatheing on her own but she is very sick because of her gallbadder.","Doctor":"Hi Thank you for your query If you mother is sick or has complications DUE TO her gallstones then they have to be removed. It is true though she might be on ventilator for prolonged period but then if it is complicated surgery is a must. However there is no non surgical modes of removing gall bladder or gall stones. Also important to know the age of your mother. And it has to be sure that she has major issues primarily due to the stone. In a nutshell the benefits should outweigh the risks.

The causes for hepatosplenomegaly are the following: -Infections (hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, rubella, etc.) -Blood disorders (anemia, thalessaemia, etc.) -Metabolic disorders -Liver diseases -Portal hypertension and many more. Please note that hepatosplenomegaly is just a symptom, and there should be some underlying condition. Please visit your doctor for a more elaborate examination including a complete blood workup. And yes, this condition is reversible, once the cause is treated this gradually subsides. In the meantime, you should avoid all fatty, oily food, and also meat. I hope this information helps.

Chronic hepatitis B is an infection with HBV that lasts longer than 6 months. Once the infection becomes chronic, it may never go away completely. Approximately 90% to 95% of infected adults are able to fight off the virus so their infection is cured. Only about 5% to 10% of adults infected with HBV go on to develop chronic infection. If the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBsAg will become undetectable and will be followed by IgG antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen, (anti-HBs and anti HBc IgG). I think your doctor is waiting for 6 months period to end which might be due to end on 2nd march.

Several factors (eg, viral infection, drugs, environmental agents) may trigger an autoimmune response and autoimmune disease. For more than 3 decades, corticosteroids, either alone or in combination with azathioprine, have been the mainstays of drug therapy for patients with autoimmune hepatitis. The prognosis of autoimmune hepatitis depends primarily on the severity of liver inflammation. Patients with a severe initial presentation tend to have a worse long-term outlook than patients whose initial disease is mild. In children with autoimmune hepatitis, 70% require treatment until adulthood. Many patients already have cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis. Almost 20-25% of children with autoimmune hepatitis die or require liver transplantation as a result of the disease. You have to continue giving this drug to her and the only definitive treatment at the moment is liver transplant.

With regard to the palpitations, since your heart rate remains normal during the episode, I dont think there is any need to worry about them. These may be related to anxiety.

What is the treatment for this and how serious is it. I am going to talk to my transplant co-ordinator tomorrow but I would like some kind of idea tonite to calm my wife down. Thand","Doctor":"Thank you for using healthcare magic Congratulations on your 10th year of transplantation. In order to determine the cause of anemia, more laboratory studies will be required such as iron studies, thyroid panel, B12, folate level etc.  your anemia may be multi-factorial and review of all of the above data would be required to determine an exact cause. Since you have blood in the stool (occult blood based on what you're describing) and you are a recipient of a solid organ maintained on transplant medications, you require a colonoscopy [if not done recently] and possibly an endoscopy to delineate the source of the blood. Your  issues can not be graded as serious or not without more information.  For example blood in the stool with anemia can represent anything from peptic ulcer disease to hemorrhoids or diverticular disease.

Pls help","Doctor":"Thank you for using Healthcare Magic. The difference in color of the tablets may be because the manufacturer of the generic is different.  Both should be standardized and should be equally efficacious. Long term definitive management of gall stone related pain would be removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy).  Please seek referral to a general surgeon.  In the interim seek immediate medical attention for pain that is not relieved or worse than usual, fever and inability to tolerate oral foods entirely as this may be sign of cholecystitis which is when the gallbladder is infected and inflammed.  This would require immediate medical evaluation and more urgent surgical intervention.

Gallstones could could present with similar pains on the left side but most at times they occur at epigastric or right hypochondrial region of the abdomen. In order to confirm this your doctor will need to run serum amylase, serum lipase, urine amylase, abdominal ultrasound and/or CT scan. Other blood tests like Complete blood count, fasting blood sugar, urine test etc. Also important to rule out peptic ulcer diseases which could be responsible for radiation to back and neck. Your back and neck pain could be isolated diseases conditions such as fibromyalgia, neuralgia or other illness. You will need to get an appointment with an internist for review and further treatment.

The fact is there is no treatment of CKD. There are treatments employed like slowing the progression of disease and treating the cause,contributing factors and complications of CKD. Treatment involves restriction on your protein,potassium,fluid ,analgesics,anti biotics like gentamicin etc. Treatment involves controlling  high blood pressure,diabetes,loosing weight,taking care of anemia and low VIT D,etc. The fact remains that you may prolong the progression of your CKD status to end stage kidney disease but you can't prevent it happening. Since you have not mentioned your stage of CKD,I am telling you the general guide lines. Ultimately you would have to go for dialysis and kidney transplant. You must discuss with your doctor and start planning for the kidney transplant ,so that you may be able to enjoy your life normally.

These blocks in the heart are cholesterol depostis which grow over time. Diet and yoga can only decrease the progression if these blocks. Blockages in the heart arteries over 70% severity cannot be treated by medications, diet or lifestyle changes. It requires an angioplasty or if many arteries are involved, a bypass surgery. Also he needs to be on lifetime medications like blood thinners, cholesterol lowering medications and other beneficial drugs for the heart. Please dont underestimate this, as the blocks will grow with time and it may lead to frequent troublesome symptoms which will affect the quality of life. I understand that his creat shot up to 4 during the angio, so you must be afraid that it may shoot up again.

However you should keep on monitoring your ALT levels and if they are ever found above 60,then you would require the treatment with interferons and immune modulators. 40% of individuals with hepatitis B having normal ALT have hepatic fibrosis. Treatment with LIV -52 has no role. One can never get rid of HEP B,if he is having this infection for more than 6 months. Keep in regular touch with your gastroenterologist and start the treatment immediately,the moment you find that there is reactivation of the disease. Get your wife and child vaccinated with HEP B vaccine. Thanks"},{"Patient":"I am a 45 year old juvenile diabetic with three stents int he last 3 years.

Since you have diabetes And history of heart disease with three stents and symptoms of chest pain after exertion,  an angina cannot be ruled out. You define it as non angina pains. But any chest pain in a diabetic person with a history of heart disease should not be ignored. You have premature heart disease with three stents already at the age of 45,  so your pains cannot be underestimated before you don't feel it's typical angina pain.

Alcohol abuse and infection with the hepatitis C virus are the two leading causes of liver cirrhosis. Very sorry to say but the fact is that,the  life expectancy of a patient with end-stage liver disease is bleak, from weeks to a few months. End-stage liver disease is a condition of the liver that is untreatable. End-stage liver disease is considered terminal unless the patient receives a liver transplant.

Your ultrasound report of heterogenous parenchyma is suggesting that you have developed cirrohsis of liver along with dilatation of portal vein. Scarring in your liver makes it difficult for your liver to function. A small number of people with hepatitis C infection may develop liver cancer. Ascites is a major complication of cirrhosis. The development of ascites is an important landmark in the natural history of cirrhosis as it is associated with a 50% mortality over two years,and signifies the need to consider liver transplantation as a therapeutic option. You must consult a gastroenterologist surgeon and prepare for liver transplant.

You mention that the ESR came back high. ESR is very non-specific, eventhough elevation may indicate some infection or inflammation somewhere , it can also be elevated after rigorous physical activities. (Muscle strain).

Anyways. during the 2 day hangover thereafter I cannot sleep, yet am absoluting EXHAUSTED! I feel like I am having panic attacks also. I also sweat profusely, and find it difficult to rehydrate. My first thought is to cut out the drinking. Is there anything else happpening here? What can I do?","Doctor":"Hello thanks for posting here. Hangover is a reaction of the body when it goes into alcohol  withdrawal after a drinking bout. The symptoms of hangover are fatigue, sleeplessness, sweating, concentrated urine, dehydration etc. Binge drinking also causes inflammation of the stomach and hence we have nausea and hyperacidity, headache along with it. It is because of the stomach inflammation (gastritis) that you find it difficult to rehydrate. So i would advice you to take an antacid tablet in the morning as soon as you wake up.. on empty stomach. This will help with the hyperacidity. Alcohol withdrawal also cause palpitations, hence the panic attacks. Wishing you good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"Hello. My liver enzymes are extremely high. The AST was 729 and the ALT was 623. Do you need any other results? I stopped drinking and im curious as to how much i can expect those enzymes to decrease over two weeks, and how long could i expect them to return to a normal range? I think a fatty liver must be pretty obvious. Also, is there a common enzyme level or range that confirms cirrhosis or it s likelihood? Thank You","Doctor":"Hello, Cpver360, You mention that you stopped drinking which is wonderful. The extent of liver damage depends on the duration of alcohol abuse and also the quantity of consumption. If you have been a steady drinker or even a binge drinker for a number of years,then definitely you have caused liver damage. The levels of liver enzyme that you mention above are indeed high. AST should be around 40 units. and ALT should be around 50-55 units. The other numbers that we need are Bilirubin level, Alkaline Phosphatase, Total Proteins, Albumin and Globulin levels, Your complete blood count including platelet count, you also need coagulation factors such as Prothrombin time. You also need to know your electrolytes ,Sodium, Potassium, Chlorides, kidney tests Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, blood sugar, lipid levels. After all this , you need an ultrasound of the liver and gallbladder to determine to see if you already have cirrhosis. I would recommend that you start taking a good Super B-Complex supplement (Vitamin) along with 800 i.u. of Vit-K and 1000 mg. Vit-C. A good diet high in protein will be helpful unless you have advanced liver disease when you might have to restrict proteins to avoid going into liver coma. Hope this information helps you to discuss with your own doctor and proceed accordingly.

Specific biological/blood exams and morphologoc exams (ultrasound) with the aid of a good clinical Acute onset jaundice and chronic, repeated episode and a one time episode are evaluated differently.

It can even occur after a short period of heavy drinking (acute alcoholic liver disease). Genetics or heredity (what is passed down from parent to child) plays a role in alcoholic liver disease in two ways: It may influence how much alcohol you consume and your likelihood of developing alcoholism. And, it may also affect levels of liver enzymes involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of alcohol Other factors that may influence your chances of developing alcoholic fatty liver disease include: Hepatitis C (which can lead to liver inflammation) An overload of iron Obesity Diet treatment, Avoiding unnecessary medications can also help slow or reverse the disease.

You state that you had retained stone in your common bile duct and that was taken care of. I don't think your hernia is responsible for the symtoms of itching. I have a feeling that you may have developed scar tissue around the end of the bile duct, called stricture due to inflammation. It is possible you may have another small stone stuck in the duct that was not removed or reformed. If you start having fever, chills, passing dark urine (Orange ) that is a sign of problem with the duct. You may need hospitalization , intravenous antibiotics and perhaps a procedure called ERCP where th specialist will introduce a scope through the stomach into the duodenum and inject dye to look at the bile duct and also pancreatic duct. If ther is stricture, they can dilate or strech it and sometimes placing a stent to keep it open and relieve blockage.

Regular alcohol intake even in small dosages can lead to liver destruction and liver cirrhosis. Your liver test are only slightly elevated so it can be due to alcohol use, medicines, spicy foods.

You should consult a gastroenterologist and would require treatment if  there is chronic active hepatitis however treatment is most effective in first 6 months of infection. About 50 to 80 % of cases who take treatment get cured completely. This infection resolves spontaneously in 10 to 50% of cases,which occurs more frequently in individuals who are young and female. HCV induces chronic infection in 50 to 80% of cases.Approximately 40 to 80 % of these cases clear with this treatment.In rare cases infection can clear without treatment. Most of the infected cases show minimal or no symptoms during the initial few decades of infection. About 10 to 30 % of cases develop liver cirrhosis over 30 years of infection and those who develop cirrhosis have 20 times chances of developing liver cancer and this becomes 100 times more if a person drinks alcohol. There is no vaccine against HEPATITIS C. Thanks"},{"Patient":"My USG abdomen report says, the liver is normal in size(span-14cm),shape,position and shows bright echotexture.

Only thing is, what is causing the liver damage ? Alcohol is number one cause of liver damage, followed by viral infections like Hepatitis-B and C. Acute Type-A hepatitis can cause elevated enzymes and bilirubin also. This is from eating or drinking contaminated food or drinks. This is usually self limited in majority of cases and gets better in about 4 weeks. All the liver tests should return to normal. Hepatitis could be drug related. auto-immune or certain genetic enzyme deficiency can cause liver damage. Diabetes , very high cholesterol can be associated with fatty liver.

The only way to diagnose this is by a liver biopsy and some special staining . As I said before , this will not lead to any severe liver problems. The only reason to know about it, when the liver tests, bilirubin comes out high on testing. I would not worry about this. Get a base line sonogram of the gallbladder.

The reason for obstructive jaundice a month after surgery could mean a few things. Apparently, there was a retained stone in the common bile duct, the channel that brings the bile from the liver ducts to the gallbladder. If this was not detected prior to surgery ,this can happen. An examination called ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography) could have shown the stone and could have been removed. The other cause is stricture of the bile duct from scar tissue. This also requires the test that I mention, and they can treat it with placing a stent to keep the duct open and relieve the blockage. This is done by experienced gastroenterologists who do this a lot or may be a surgeon trained in these kinds of procedures. I would recommend that you enquire around and some research to find out who is available locally to do this. You can also contact the university hospital if one is close by for additional help.

Enlargement of liver is called hepatomegaly and that of spleen is called Splenomegaly.If both are enlarged,it is called Hepatosplenomegaly. There are many causes of Hepatosplenomegaly.

Abnormal liver enzymes can be caused by any number of things including viral infection, drugs, alcohol, genetic enzyme deficiencies,metabolic disorders and auto-immune problems. If all of these have been ruled out, then you may have fatty liver related to overweight problem,elevated lipids and even diabetes. You stated that your enzymes came down when you were on Udiliv 300. It is O.K. to restart this and stay on it for 3-6 months while you work on other things I mentioned. Along with this, I recommend Vit-E 800 i.u. daily and Vit-C 1000 mg. daily and a good low fat high protein diet. The stomach problem may be separate. If you have acid problems with heartburn or reflux , you can try Omeprazole 20 mg once or twice a day for 2 weeks and see if it helps. If it does not, you need some studies done such as an upper GI series (X-rays) and may be even an endoscopy. Hope this helps you.

Enlarged hart on ECG may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy due to high blood pressure. But there are other causes and types of enlarged heart which should be ascertained.

Hepatitis viruses and other viral diseses such as mononucleosis can cause this. Certain genetic enzyme deficiency can do this. In western culture, alcohol is number one cause. Next is gallbladder and bile duct issues, pancreas problems can cause liver test abnormalities. Most importantly, drugs both over the counter and prescription drugs can elevate liver enzymes. Auto-immune diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis can affect liver and kidneys. I am glad that your MRI tests, endoscopy and other blood work were all normal.

Now , we can not only correctly diagnose Hep-C viral infection, we can actually measure the virus count in an infected person and also find out the Geno type of the virus. In most cases, any time someone has abnormal liver tests that cannot be explained , always test for Hepatitis B & C. If a person has risk factors, like multiple sex partners, intravenous drug abuse, accidental needle prick and exposure to contaminated blood, sharing tooth brushes, razors, getting tattoos with dirty needles, all of these are risk factors and the doctor should know about this. When once the diagnosis is established, after the HCV RNA viral count, Geno type, the doctors can start treatment. The treatment consists of Interferon injections along with an antiviaral like Ribavirin orally. The duration of treatment any where from 24-48 weeks with close monitoring of blood tests. If by week 12 there is significant drop in viral count or disappearance, that is a good sign the treatment is working. Now there are newer more effective drug combinations for cure of this. If the damage to the liver is so severe and there is advanced cirrhosis with signs of liver failure, then transplantation can be considered. There are instances of Hep-C coming back after liver transplantation. Hope this gives you some insight into the problem. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"Hello, my name is , I am 32 years old. I ve been experiencing a fullness in the upper part of my stomach below my rib cage. It s very uncomfortable and painful. My gallbladder has been removed, I ve had repaired hernias so I have mesh in there too. I also recently had surgery two months ago and I ve searched the Web for answers and came across people not being helped by with this issue. Oh and that there is no cure. Can you help!!!!!!","Doctor":"Hello,howlingcraneestell, I can understand your frustration. You mention that you have had abdominal surgeries including gallbladder and also mesh insertin for hernias. Your symptoms of pain and fullness in the upper part of the abdomen may indicate slow passage from the stomach into the intestine of your ingested food. This could happen in different circumstances. If you have some scarring at the lower end of the stomach opening from an old healed ulcer , that could cause mild blockage. If you are a diabetic and not well controlled you can have a condition called Gastroparesis that would slow down the stomach. But my best guess in your case, is \\"Adhesions\\". Especially after multiple abdominal surgeries , scar tissue develops and in some, this can cause kinking of the intestine and cause intermittent blockage or obstruction. If you get relief after passage of gas or after belching , this could be a cause. It is very difficult to identify adhesions but some cases a GI series and a small bowel follow through X-rays can show abnormalities, if there is significant kinking. In some cases mesh itself can cause reaction and scarring with pain. Hope you have had complete blood work. You can discuss these with your doctor and get tested .

Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver and poor liver function. It is the final phase of chronic liver disease. Cirrhosis is the end result of chronic liver damage caused by chronic liver diseases. There can be various causes for this including alcohol abuse and various types of hepatitis and other causes. Cirrhosis is caused by irreversible scarring of the liver. Once cirrhosis develops, it is not possible to heal the liver or return its function to normal. It is a serious condition that can lead to many complications. When cirrhosis progresses to end-stage liver disease, patients may be candidates for a liver transplant. Since you have already been advised for liver transplant,it means it is a end stage liver disease and nothing can be done about it except going for liver transplant.

However , if you have been diagnosed with multiple gallstones , it is extremely difficult to get rid of them by non-surgical methods. There are medications to dissolve the stone, but it does not work for multiple stones. Small single gallstone may dissolve with medication in about 3-6 months and it can come back after the medication is stopped. The other method we have available is called shock wave lithotripsy, blasting the stone with shock waves. Again , this might work for a single stone but multiple stones pose a problem. There are complications from this procedure, because small portions of the broken stone can block the bile passage and cause a major problem requiring surgery. Now a days, gallbladder surgery is a same day procedure done through small button holes on the belly with the use of laparoscope. Recovery is faster. This is done even at 80+ years of age without problems. Low fat diet may help to prevent some attacks, but it is not a cure. Herbal medicine, olive oil and lemon juice does not help to get rid of the stones. I hope this information helps you.

She is of normal weight. She takes minimal over the counter pain meds. I am wondering what could be causing this & what other tests her doctor should run.

These pain killers in general can cause liver injury even when given in recommended dose. One should try to avoid pain killers as far as possible. There is no medicine which can reduce the enzyme levels in blood except removing the offending agent from your diet list. I don't think there is any need for any test regarding the rise of liver enzymes are concerned.

But both these disorders can complicate the situation. It depends on the type of congenital heart disease you have. An abnormal communication like patent foramen ovale, could be a risk factor in this situation for paradoxical thromboembolism to the brain and other organs. In such case this congenital defect should be treated by a surgeon. Regarding hypertensive heart disease, it is important a better control of high blood pressure in order to stop the progression of this disease. You should discuss with your cardiologist on the above issues. Hope to have been helpful!Kind regards, DR. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I am currently suffering from Hepatitis A ....or mild jaundice . I was hospitalized for a week starting from 18th December 2012. I had my latest LFT and CBC tests done and my bilurubin level is in the normal range. The value for the same is 1.2 Though my enzyme levels are a little bit high, Wherein my SGOT and SGPT levels are at 365 and 255. I am thoroughly following a boiled diet routine, with Liv 52 tablets and B-Complex tablets. I am a MBA student and my classes starts from 9th Jan. I have a pretty tight schedule, though we get boiled food at our hostels. I had few queries regarding the disease. 1) Will it ever occur again in my life? Can I follow normal routine diet after some months? 2) Do I need to get vaccinated against Hepatitis A after my health revival? I am already vaccinated against Hepatitis B . 3) Before I was diagnosed with Hepatitis A, I used to go to the Gym regularly and used to do extreme exercises? Will I be ever able to do those exercises again? Maybe after a year or 2? It would be really helpful if someone can help me with the above queries. Thanks - Deepankar","Doctor":"Hello, 1...Once you recover from the infection, you develop hepatitis A antibodies (called anti-HAV) that provide life-long protection from future infections. After recovering from hepatitis A, you won't get it again and you cannot transmit the hepatitis A virus to others. Most patients with acute hepatitis, even when severe, begin feeling better in two to three weeks, and recover completely in four to eight weeks. After recovering from hepatitis A, a person no longer carries the virus and remains immune for life. 2...you can resume your normal diet after you recover completely. 3...No need for any vaccination after you recover. 4...you can start your gym after few months.

High enzyme levels is suggestive of liver dysfunction. Performing biliary surgery in such  a patient could cause further liver damage to the extent of failure as well as a very high chance of bleeding during surgery.

Therefore if you want to avoid pain as much as possible after eating, then avoid any sort of fatty meals. Orange juice or any citric fruits - juices can cause you to have heartburn or stomach discomfort, but should not trigger a gallbladder \\"attack\\".

I m never actually sick however. I ve had blood tests - all OK. I ve had a gastroscopy which showed nothing but a small flat polyp which was removed at the same time. I m due a follow-up on this at an out-patients clinic later this month. I m also due an ultrasound scan as my GP thinks it might be gallstones, however I have no pain in my digestive system. I m prescribed Metaclopramide but this does not really have much impact. It s really getting me down now.","Doctor":"Hello, brucea1, Persistent nausea could be a result of inflammation of the stomach lining. You mention that the doctor found a small polyp and removed it. Usually, these are called Hyperplastic polyps or inflammatory polyps. In other words this happens from inflammation of the lining of the stomach and we call it \\"Chronic Gastritis\\". Metaclopramide or Reglan is a drug that improves contractions of the stomach and helps emptying of gastric contents into the intestine and it for control of nausea. It does have potential side effects such as shakiness of the hands, almost like Parkinson like symptoms in some, especially with higher doses. If you are not on any PPI like Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, Rabeprazole or Esomeprazole, these are available over the counter in drug stores. Try taking one of these once or twice a day about an hour to an hour and a half before meals. This should help. I am glad that you are scheduled for an ultrasound exam to rule out gallstones.

I want to know the best remedy to repair / recover my liver problem as shown above.","Doctor":"Hello, pawankr0022, I understan that you are recovering from Chicken pox which is obviuosly a viral infection. Any type of viral infection can affect the liver, for example the Mononucleosus virus or any Hepatitis viruses such as Type- A, B,C,D or E. Your report of mild liver enlargement and abnormal liver enzymes may be explained by Grade II fatty liver, although I think the viral infection is aggravating the liver enzyme elevation. If you are over weight and have high lipid levels, like cholesterol and triglycerides and have a border line blood sugar, you may fit the definition for \\"Metabolic Syndrome\\". Fatty liver is seen during pergnancy, caused by some drugs such as NSAIDS, sulfa drugs and tetracycline family of drugs as well. Some unusual conditions like amyloidosis can cause fatty liver. What I suggest is that you get your liver blood tests re-checked in about 6-8 weeks and see how much they come down. In the mean time, avoid excess fatty or greasy foods. Good protein supplement is helpful. I would also recommend a Super B-Complex vitamin along with 1000 mg. of Vit-C daily. For fatty liver, Vit-E 800 i.u. daily is also helpful. Losing weight and regular excercises are good for you. Good news is, at this stage Fatty liver is reversible and it can be normal, if you take care. Stay away from alcohol also. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"hi, i have taken LFT test, my bilirubin level elevated to 2.1 mg/dL in total and 1.9 mg/dL in indirect bilirubin.

You should know that it is quite normal to have an irregular heart beat after taking molly or cocaine. But, from the other hand the irregular heart beat can cause cardioembolism to the brain, leading to a stroke. Cocaine itself can also cause spasms of the brain arteries, leading to an increased risk for stroke.  For this reason, I would recommend going to the ER for a careful physical exam and some tests: - a brain CT scan- a resting ECG- a chest X ray study- some blood lab tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes).

Other things that are risk factors include Tattoos,body piercing,sharing tooth brushes, razors etc. Accidental needle prick and exposure to contaminated blood (Lab technecians etc,surgeons ) I am giving you all this background to let you know , you can be completely well till the virus starts multiplying in the liver cells and causes damage. Now that you have been confirmed with blood tests, you need to get HCV -RNA viral count and the Geno-Type of the virus because the response to treatment or cure depends on this. Good news is ,there are very effective treatments using a combination of drugs. You can look for a clinic or a doctor's office that specializes in treating this. It takes patience, dedication and determination on your part to get cured and this can be done. You may have to put up with side effects from the drugs, again most people can tolerate well.Usually the treatment lasts for 24-48 weeks depending on the response of the virus count at 4-8 weeks.

MShakeel","Doctor":"Hello, MShakee, If you have been diagnosed to have gallstones, especially ,mutiple, then removal of gallbladder is the definitive treatment as a cure. You can live without a gallbladder which is essentially a storage organ. Bile is produced in the liver and carried to the gallbladder. It releases the bile periodically after meals to help with digestion. Even after the gallbladder is removed, bile now comes into the intestine directly and helps with digestion. In some people, there could be diarrhea from bile irritation on the lining of the intestine, but his is temporary and gets better with time. As for recuperation, it is faster since the surgery is done through a laparoscope and it is same day in and out surgery. As for as fatty liver is concerned, it depends on the grades. Grade 0-1 or even Grade-2 , is completely reversible with proper diet, weight control, sugar control and lipid control. You should consider taking Super B-Complex Vitamin daily, along with 1000 mg. of Vit-C and 800 i.u. of Vit-E daily. These will help.

You mention that he was positive for Hep-C. I think you need more information about the tests they did for Hepatitis -C. This type , in most people, does not produce any symptoms (Although rarely) it goes into what is called \\"Chronic Hepatitis\\". At this stage, the liver enzymes stay abnormal and one can experience symptoms of fatigue, aches and pains in the joints, skin rash, poor appetite etc. It is important to rule this out. Type-A hepatitis comes from eating or drinking contaminated food or drink. During the acute phase, there can be nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, yellow jaundice, poor appetite etc. This in majority of patients gets better on it's own, with supportive care, within 2-4 weeks. This does not turn into chronic phase. It is important that you discuss with your son's doctor about these.

If you had acute Type-B or Type-C Hepatitis , some of those cases go into a chronic phase. In such cases the liver enzymes stay abnormal or elevated for more than 6 months. You were probably told to stay away from fatty or fried foods during your jaundice. Now that all your tests are normal, you can eat more normal foods. If you drink alcohol, I would advice you to stay away from it for at least six months. You should take a good Super B-Complex Vitamin daily along with Vit-C 1000 mg. a day. High protein diet is good.

You state that he is a light smoker ,half a pack a day, but if he has been a smoker for a very long time , that is of concern. I am glad that he does not drink and we can eliminate that as a possible cause of fatty liver. Poor nutrition can cause fatty changes in the liver. Diabetes , obesity, other metabolic disorders can do this. Certain medications like NSAIDs, Ibuprofen, Naproxen,Sulfa drugs, Tetracycline family of drugs can cause fatty liver. In women, during pregnacy they can develop fatty liver. If your husband does not have fever,chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, it is probably not an infection.

I would expect, with proper diet, vitamin supplementation ,especially Super B-Complex Vitamin, Vit-E 800 i.u. daily and 1000 mg. of Vit-C daily, within three months that should come down to normal levels. You asked, what other things can do this. Hepatitis B and C ,in chronic form can do this. You always have to have tests done for this, because lot of times there may not be any symptoms. Other major cause is drug induced damage to the liver. Even Acetaminophen, taken in excess can cause liver damage. So do NSAIDS such as Ibuprofen, Naproxen etc. Certain antibiotics, sulfa, tetracycline family of drugs can affect the liver in some.

Also while removing the stent, there is always some local trauma leading to bleeding, which is causing your blood in urine. An urinary tract infection can take about 7-10 days to subside.

If I don t remove my gallbladder any problem will arise in future? What about my fatty liver problem is it any serious problem.? what should I do for it?","Doctor":"Hello, jahangir, Tha nk you for providing a very detailed report , ultrasound exams and your complete blood work. There is no question that you have multiple gallstones. There is no obstruction of the bile duct , the channel that carries the bile from the gallbladder to the intestine, which is good. Your liver enzyme levels are normal which means you don't have signs of inflammation of the liver or the surrounding organs, like pancreas etc. You are very mildly anemic, but not to worry. You mention one attack of abdominal pain. As for fatty liver, it is very mild and with normal enzymes, again, I would not worry. Besides, during a laparoscopic procedure, they will take a good look at your liver and if abnormal or suspicious, they can take a biopsy. Laparoscopic approach has made gallbladder surgery very much easier. First, it is same day surgery. Recovery is faster. It used to be 7-10 days in the hospital years ago with tubes in the stomch and bladder etc. Problem with large abdominal incision, infection, wound separation etc. etc . All that is not true now. Very rarely, for technical reasons or location of the gallbladder, they may decide to convert to the old way with open surgery. In experienced hands , this is very unlikely to happen. I would recommend that you start taking some oral iron supplements along with a Super B-Coplex Vitamin daily. Along with this you can take Vit-E 800 i.u. daily and 1000 mg. of Vit-C daily. If you are a little over weight lose a few. I wish you well. Elective surgery is much better than emergency surgery for complications."},{"Patient":"My son is 12 years old and while he was being checked for a cold his blood was drawn. Upon this blood draw, his bilirubin level came back 2.3. His liver enzymes were all normal but I am still concerned. What could be going on? He eats well, is 5 3 and weighs 115 lbs. He was doing a lot of activities during the time his blood was drawn but since the swim season is over he is inactive. We eat a lot of take out, which I know is not good. I am worried about fatty liver disease etc.....","Doctor":"Hi! your son is not an overweight patient as his body mass index is about 20 which is within normal limit , as his liver enzymes were normal so chances of fatty liver disease and intrahepatic/extrahepatic biliary obstruction is almost excluded. Now to rule out exercise induced haemolysis you should repeat his total bilirubin and simultaneously go for his indirect bilirubin, haemoglobin, MCV, RBC count, reticulocyte count, platelet count, serum haptoglobin , serum LDH and urine urobilinogen level. Assessment of these laboratory test will rule out or confirm any ongoing hemolysis. Take care."},{"Patient":"Sir, I am male 44. My Glucose fasting is 115 mg/dl. SGOT (AST) is 91 U/l, SGPT ( ALT ) is 160 U/l. Are my SGOT & SGPT at genger level? Should I immediately start medication? What are the reasons and adverse effects of increased SGOT/SGPT. Can these be controlled by controlling the diet? Should I get an lever ultrasound? Am I be heading towards jaundice? Kindly advice other preventive measures to control them.","Doctor":"Hello, scsaini5294, Fasting blood sugar of 115 mg/dl is mildly elevated blood sugar that might indicate early diabetes. You should have HbA1C tested and also a 2-hr post meal blood sugar test to confirm the diagnosis. Your enzyme levels are elevated. If you are above your average weight for your height , this could all be Fatty liver related. After you get a Hepatitis screening tests for Type-B & Type-C to rule these out , then you can get a sonogram of the liver to see if you have fatty liver and it's grading. If you also have elevated lipid levels, you need to control that by dietary means and may be medications. You should be on a diabetic diet , cutting back on concentrated sugars. I also recommend that you start taking Vit-E 800 i.u. daily, along with Vit-C 1000 mg. daily, and also a Super B-Complex Vit. tab daily. Fatty liver is reversible if taken care of before cirrhosis sets in. I wish you good luck and good health."},{"Patient":"I am taking 200 ml alcohal for the last about 16 yearrs daily.

I have completely stopped alcohal for the last one week and started taking healthy diet. Please advise me medicine if any and how I can naturrally reverse the condition of my life","Doctor":"Hello, devinderadvocate, The amount of alcohol you drink is more than 4-6 oz. that is supposedly beneficial to the heart, depending on whether it is red wine or dark beer. Unfortunately, the longer duration of drinking can have cumulative effect on the body, especially liver or the heart. The enzyme levels in your case are mildly elevated and you also have a high cholesterol level. Usually, this combined with over weight leads to fatty liver. You state that your fatty liver is Grade II. This is not very good unless you really take care of it seriously. This can revert back to normal with proper measures. Number one on the list is to stop drinking, which you have and I applaud you for that. Next you need a high protein diet along with vitamins. I recommend a super B-Complex Vitamin daily along with Vit-E 800 i.u. daily and Vit-C 1000 mg. daily. Avoid high fatty foods and fried foods. Fresh fruits and fresh vegetables are good. After you follow these steps, in about three months your blood tests should improve. Also, try to lose some weight if you are over. Regular excercise , three times a week is good. If you need to take medication to lower the cholesterol, check with your doctor. I wish you the very best of health."},{"Patient":"hi doctor.my mother has a liver problem from last 8 months.her blood reports are abnormal as: platlets: 46 ESR: 40 NORMAL: 20 BILIRUBIN: 3.6 NORMAL: .2-1.2 S.G.P.T: 187 NORMAL: 5-55 S.G.O.T: 473 Normal : 5-40 her hepatitus A,B,C and E Test are normal. i dont know where is the problem because there is no hepatitus A,B,C,E.","Doctor":"Hello, rizwan5125, If your mother has had this for over six months, the condition is chronic liver disease. She seems to have a very low platelet count and her Bilirubin levels are mildly elevated and her enzymes are moderately high. I am glad that her Hepatitis profile was negative especially for Type-B and Type-C. They are the bad ones. Type-A does not cause chronic liver disease. I am sure your mother never abused alcohol, so we can eliminate that as a cause. There are certain drugs (Prescription and non-prescrption) that can cause chronic liver damage. Ibuprofen, Naproxen, sulfa drugs, Tetracycline family of drugs can cause liver damage. Check all the medications she is on or has been taking. The other condition is Auto-Immune liver disease. She should be tested for these-Antinuclear Antibodies, Anti-smooth muscle antibodies, DNA &RNA antibodies, Serum complement level, Protein electrophoresis, R.A.Factor etc. Another condition common in women is Primary Biliary Cirrhosis. This may be associated with fatigue, itching of the skin, jaundice etc. Diagnosis is through Anti-mitochondrial antibodies and liver biopsy. You can discuss all these with her doctor and then appropriate treatment can be given. I wish her well."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with multiple calculi in the lumen of the gall bladder . I do not have any symptoms currently but would like to know what s the best thing to do: leave it until there is a symptomatic pain or go for a cholesystectomy? What are the advantages and disadvantages of having the GB removed? I am a vegetarian and do not consume too much fat containing foods but still a bit apprehensive about having an organ removed.","Doctor":"Hello, thewhizzler, You mention that you have been diagnosed with multiple gallstones. I am sure that the reason you had the sonogram of the gallbladder must have been because of some vague digestive sypmtoms or some abdominal pain. Multiple stones are more problematic than a solitary or single stone. One or more of these stones pass through the bile duct or the channel that brings the bile to the intestine, can get stuck and cause obstruction with severe attack of pain, vomiting and yellow jaundice ,fever etc. This would then become an emergency situation. Small single stone (Cholesterol) without calcium can be treated with medication to dissolve this or even laser treated to pulverize it. It is hard to do this when you have multiple stones. I am glad that you are a vegetarian and avoid fatty, greasy foods. If you have a tendency for gallstone formation, you can't prevent it by diet alone. Good news about surgery is, that can be very safely performed by laparocopic approach with small button holes on the belly without a huge scar like it used to be years ago. Uasually, you go in the morning, have the surgery and you are home by afternoon, ofcourse barring any unusual findings or complications. Your liver will continue to produce bile that we need for digestive process. Instead of being stored in the gallbladder and released , the bile will get into the intestine directly. Occasionally, you might experience a little diarrhea sometime after the gallbladder is removed, but this temporary. Hope this answers your concerns. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"Hi Im 29 m.For last 1 year, im suffering from fatigue ,tiredness and weightloss, bloating ,tiredness,stomach fullness.So i went to General Physican and he advised me to do complete health checkup.Results of thyroid,Sugar,Electrolytes,Iron are in normal range.But there were some abnormalities in indirect billubirin, BUN and he referred me to Liver specialist.

Your liver enzymes are normal and all your other blood work, like calcium,protein levels, hemoglobin , kidney tests are all normal. The serum bilirubin, the indirect fraction is very minimally elevated. Usually, Direct bilirubin is the main fraction. We see this sometime in fasting state and a very rare genetic disorder called Gilbert's Syndrome. Usually this is benign. Some people have jaundice, especially during stress, cold or flu, fasting,lack of sleep kind of symtoms. You mention weight loss, fatigue,and fullness of the stomach. Stress can certainly do this, but, I recommend that you get an upper GI series ,X-rays to make sure there is nothing going on in the stomach. If any thing looks abnormal on x-rays, then you need endoscopy. You can discuss this with your doctor.

It got progressively worse to the point of being unbearable. I would writhe in pain on the floor if I had to get up and walk, since being upright would cause it to worsen greatly. My right upper arm began to ache,and it feels dull and heavy down to the fingers. The pain in the shoulder blade is sharp, stabbing , burning and is in the right scapula and middle of back,more to the right though. I did a olive oil and lemon juice gall bladder cleanse last night, after discontinuing all solid foods, just drinking fresh juices. I passed a handful of gallstones today at 12:30, the largest being the size of a quarter, all others small. The pain has lessoned and I am able to sit and type and bear it, but it is still great. I have NO pain in my front upper abdomen quad. just right area between neck and shoulder, scapula, back, and right arm.","Doctor":"Hello, thegeeksmom, I am really puzzeled by your description of passing gallstones .This is not true gallstones showing up in the stool. Some sort of chemical reaction between olive oil and lemon juice, forms oily balls colored green by bile and comes out in the stool and floats . Real gallstones sink in the water. This liver cleansing and gallbladder cleansing is a quackery. What you probably had was an acute dilatation of the stomach due to excess gas from the butter and cookie dough. Ginger facilitates some digestive process and hence the berps. When the stomach is quite distended, that causes pressure on the nerve endings and that is the reason for shoulder pain (Pressure on the diaphragm ) and the back pain. I am sure, when once the stomach empties and you expel all the gas, you should feel better. I suggest that you get an upper GI x-rays and also a sonogram of the gallbladder to see if you have real gallstones. Try to stay away from fatty and greasy foods.

As you say the heart has been excluded as a cause. And also since the CBC is normal, anemia can also be excluded. I recommend you to check your thyroid function tests. Thyroid abnormalities can cause symptoms like palpitations and occasional light headedness which you may term as dizziness. Also please check your vit D and vit B 12 levels which also can cause dizziness, fatigue. An X ray of cervical spine is suggested.

That is the number one cause for liver damage in the western hemisphere. You mention that you have been diagnosed to have enlarged liver and fatty changes, probably based on ultrasound examination. You are probably about ten pounds overweight considering your height. There is a condition called \\"Metabolic Syndrome \\" and this is associated with overweight, insulin resistence or Type-2 diabetes, elevated lipids. We see fatty liver (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-NAFLD). Other thing that can cause fatty liver are certain drugs including NSAIDS, drugs like ibuprofen,naproxen,sulfa and tetracycline family of drugs. In women, there is fatty liver of pregnancy. Rarely, there are some genetic disorders with enzyme deficiency that can cause this. Metabolic diseases such as amyloidosis etc. can also do this. Losing weight would be helpful. If your lipid levels are high, you need to bring it down with diet and may be medications.

I am not sure if you were just started on it or have been on it for a while. You say that your HCV RNA has cleared which is good news. From that I assume that you have been on treatment for longer than 12 weeks. When there is active viral replication, you can see enzyme elevations temporarily but will come down if you have been treated with proper dosage. If you were treated by single drug like Interferon but not in combination with Ribavirin, there is a slight chance that you can have recurrence. That is something to keep in mind. In that case addition of Ribavarin , weight based dosage would be helpful. I am glad that immune markers are negative. Also, I don't know what your Hep-C Genotype is.

As per your description, he has got blockages in all the three arteries of the heart. In this case a bypass surgery is adviced. But as he is 84, the risks and benefits of the surgery must be weighed. Also other things that matter are associated health issues like diabetes, blood pressure, kidney issues etc. The decision for bypass surgery also depends on where exactly the arteries are blocked i.e. very close from yheir origin or distal from their origin. Another important factor is his expectations and his desire. I dont know him personally, but you must ask him what he wants to pursue, what type of activities he expects himself to do. I would not advice a bypass surgery for him at this age. It is putting him at more trauma and discomfort. One approach can be angioplasty to stent only those arteries which are more critically blocked and can cause a life threat. Rest can be left upon medical management.

Unfortunately CHRONIC HEP B infection is not curable, your hepatologist should tell you this. BUT... When you first get exposed to Hepatitis B, it's called \\"accute\\". If the infection persists for more than 6 months, that's a \\"chronic\\" infection. some people are able to clear the infection within those first 6 months and develop immunity. A chronic infection can be dormant or active. When it is active it can be transmitted to others and it damages the liver. The goal of treatment is to get the infection to a dormant, inactive state, not to \\"cure it\\". Symptoms u ve mentioned depends on bilirubin blood levels and hepatitis b can cause less or more liver damage which raises bilirubin and liver enzymes levels. Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Although, broth, sports drinks, gelatin, frozen ice treats (such as Popsicles), and fruit juices may be better because they also provide calories. Ask your physician before taking any medications, even those that are over-the-counter. Some medications depend on the liver, and liver damage may impair the body's ability to metabolize these drugs. If you are on prescription medications, check with your physician to see if the doses should be adjusted or if the medication should be temporarily discontinued. Avoid drinking alcohol until your health care practitioner allows it. Individuals with chronic HBV should avoid alcohol for the rest of their lives. Try to eat a diet that provides adequate nutrition. Take it easy. It may take some time for your energy level to return to normal. Avoid prolonged, vigorous exercise until symptoms start to improve. Avoid any activity that may spread the infection to other people (sexual intercourse, sharing needles, etc). Wish you good health"},{"Patient":"Hi, I m a nurse, 25 y/o. Last week, I was preparing my patient s lancet and was about to prick him for his blood glucose monitoring when I accidentally pricked myself instead. I didn t notice I was holding the lancet backwards and so I pricked my index finger after pushing the releasing button. I asked the patient if the lancet he gave me was new and said it has been used once, a few hours ago. My patient has diabetes and has jaundice . He was tested for Hepatitis B ( HbsAg ) last week which came out non-reactive, but he s still being considered as having Viral Hepatitis. Is there a possibility of me getting infected with whatever hepatitis virus the patient has after a lancet prick? What should I do? Should I get tested?","Doctor":"Hello, welcome to HCM, I am Dr. Das. Firstly, hepatitis viruses can not get transmitted through needle prick injury, except hepatitis B. As the patient was found to be non reactive, then you have low chance of getting the infection. But, you have to be tested for hepatitis B at the end of 3 month. If that is also negative, then you have nothing to worry about.

After a month of taking the medication his sgpt was stll high and we went to see again the doctor that s when he decided for a ct scan of the liver, the result showed normal size of the liver with hypoplastic left lobe, what does it mean? thank you very much","Doctor":"Dear madam, hypoplasia of right hepatic lobe is a rare anomaly that is sometimes associated with ectopy of gall bladder but it is usually asymptomatic. This anomaly  shoudnt  raise his SGPT levels or any liver enzymes. You should try to find some other reason for it such as alcohol, viral or autoimune hepatitis or metabolic diseases. CT and US can visualize liver morfology but to be sure he needs to do liver biopsy to rule out other disorders.

I am not sure what the underlying cause of his cirrhosis was. Here in Western world, mostly alcohol is responsible for majority of cases. Other are caused by Hepatitis Type-B or Type-C . We are seeing a lot more Hep_C here and fortunately there is a lot of advance regarding early diagnosis and treatment and even cure for this. Your father-in-law's blood work actually does not look very serious. With a Bilirubin level 2.8 mg/dl it is mildly elevated. His Hb, level, white cell count are low but his platelet count is still good. If he does not have a very distended abdomen or markedly swollen legs, then he probably does not have severe \\"Portal Hypertension\\" which could cause enlarged veins in the esophagus and stomach and lead to massive bleeding and liver coma. From the blood picture it does not appear to be that case. He still may be having slow blood loss if he has esophgeal varices (Enlarged veins) from irritation. He needs to have his stool checked for hidden blood and if he has black stools, he needs endoscopy to look inside the esophagus and stomach. If he has any signs of active bleeding, he needs to be hospitalized and may require blood transfusion and treatment for those veins. This is done by specialists. If your town does not have experts then New Delhi a university hospital may be a good choice. Hepamerz is L-Ornithine-1-Aspartate helpful to heal the liver. I am not sure if Lactyhep syrup has lactulose which is a laxative and helps to get rid of ammonia build up in the blood that leads to liver coma. If you father-in-law has any signs of altered mental status like feeling sleepy after eating high protein foods, that may be an indication for \\"Hepatic Encephalopathy\\" in different stages. Neomycin and Lactulose and more recently Rifaximin are helpful in treatment. You can discuss all of these with his doctor.

If you are on 40mg. daily and still having symtoms, you can increase the dose to twice a day and see if that makes any difference. With your symtoms of \\"Food sticking\\" , I am a little concerned that you may have still considerable inflammation of the lower end of esophagus at the juction with the stomach or you might even have a little narrowing at that area.

Your symptoms are suggestige of high blood pressure and its subsequent effect on the heart. BP remains persistently higher called accelerated hypertension so you have to be started on BP medications. If you are already on some BP medications, they can be changed or added. The chest gurgling sounds can be because of some fluid accumulating in the lungs due to indirect consequences of high blood pressure. Also since you have got mild chest pain addition to theabove there is a suspicion of heart disease. You should be worked up for heart disease and hypertension. Please do an ECG, chest X ray, 2D echo and cardiac enzymes. If the above tests show no abnormalities and BP control is acheived, a treadmill test is recommended after 4 days.

In December of 2011 I started noticing extreme bloating and severe fullness after eating as if my food was not digesting, which would last the entire day and get worse as I ate more food throughout the day, only feeling better with long fasting(15+ hours). This has lasted until now. The past couple months, I ve had an endoscopy , a gastric emptying test, a small bowel barium x-ray , a upper right quadrant ultrasound, and a HIDA scan with CCK. All were normal except the HIDA scan. My gallbladder never appeared after 4 hours and they never injected the CCK. My GI doctor told me this may be what is causing at least some of my symptoms. I went to see a surgeon, who told me that my symptoms appear to be inconsistent with what he said were the only 2 reasons for results like mine, inflammation, and a gall stone blocking the duct(I asked about sludge and he said sludge usually shows up on an ultrasound). He said if that were the case, I would be in severe pain where my gallbladder is located. I am really looking for answers. All of my tests have come back normal except for the HIDA, and the surgeon doesn t seem to believe it. I am really worried and am looking for any information I can find. Although I am not a doctor, I ve read that gallbladder problems can FEEL as if your food is not digesting(although clinically I KNOW mine is digesting), and bloating and an unusual feeling of fullness can occur. I have also read that rapid weight loss can contribute to gallbladder issues. I guess what I m asking is, out of all these tests one comes back abnormal and the surgeon is not willing to accept it as abnormal, so MUST you feel severe pain as the doctor said for a test to come back the way mine did? And do my other symptoms(fullness, bloating) fit at all with my abnormal HIDA scan result?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. You have the right to insist that this is gallbladder only if you do suffer from symptoms like: upper right abdomen pain radiating to the back, nausea and vomiting, pain after a meal especially when it is fatty or spicy food. Otherwise, there is no reason for gallbladder removing. Looking into the tests you have had performed, I cannot see colonoscopy and abdominal CT. Weight lost and bloating can be a symptom of colon cancer. Colonoscopy is very important in ruling it out. Abdominal CT with oral contras is another test which should be done to visualize pancreas. Regular ultrasound wont tell anything about its condition. You should also have some blood tests: amylase, lipase, urine amylase, CEA, CA 19.9, CA-125. Stool tests should be also performed. Only if really all other reasons of your pain will be ruled out and you do suffer from symptoms located in the upper right abdomen, you may ask a surgeon for laparoscopic gallbladder removal. Hope this will help. Regards."},{"Patient":"I had laproscopic gallbladder removal surgery yesterday. I ve noticed, today, that both of my upper arms are warm and red.

Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Dear madam, usually after laparoscopical surgeries th increased level of air in abdomen can cause shoulder pain, especially the left one because of irritated phrenic nerve. But skin redness and warmness aren tusualy sign of it. It can be caused by skin infection or allergy or by joint inflammation. So you should do inflammatory markers and shoulder RTG if you are worried about it. Wish you good health, Dr. Romich"},{"Patient":"I had my gallbladder removed last Wednesday.

In addition, food, with the exception of fruit, taste awful and absolutely nothing like it used to taste before surgery.

Thanks, Susie","Doctor":"Dear madam, this can be caused by anesthesia. It is not very common complication. The surgical procedure cholecystectomy cannot effect on your tongue on any way. Your tongue was probably pressed up against the breathing tube. Also some gasses are used during surgery which could affect your taste sensation. The feeling will likely come back over the next few weeks. If there was any nerve damage it will take a bit longer time to resolve.

Even while resting i have discomfort.","Doctor":"Hello, johnpaf7, I see that you aree a weight lifter, which is good. The symptoms that you describe are suggestive of GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). These symtoms may be associated with a hiatus hernia. If a part of your stomach slides up and down through the hole in the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen, that is hiatal hernia. This can get aggravated by heavy lifting , bending, coughing etc. What happens is, there is a sphincter barrior at the junction of the esophagus and stomach that prevents acid from backing up into the esophagus. If the sphincter is weak, then acid can back up and cause pain,heartburn etc. If you are experiencing pain when you eat, drink, or swallow, that may indicate inflammation at the area of the junction. You might even have some scarring from acid damage and spasm or narrowing. What you need is to get an x-ray of the esophagus and stomach first to look for any narrowing or big hiatus hernia. If present, then you need an endoscopic evaluation by a specialist to get a direct look and perhaps biopsy to look for problems. As for the history of gallbladder disease in the family, you can get a sonogram of the gallbladder as a screening test. There are effective medications to treat GERD which you can discuss with your doctor after the tests I mentioned above.

Ultrasound showed gallbladder possibly folded over? Under stress, excercises (lost 15 lbs. past year) (25 yrs. old - good health otherwise. Uses tanning bed - any correlation?","Doctor":"Hello, dbundenthal, Abdominal bloating, vomiting could be suggestive of gallbladder problems. The fact that your daughter lost 15 lbs. makes me think she might have developed small gallstones or even cholesterol crystals (Cholesterolosis) or sand like stones with inflammation. Especially if the weight loss is rapid, the incidence of gallbladder problem is more. Folded over gallbladder may mean a contracted gallbladder from chronic inflammation. I am glad she is havind the scan which would confirm if there is cholecystitis. Slight elevation of bilirubin will go along with this, although we need to know the total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin and Indirect Bilirubin levels. If gallbadder related, the direct bilirubin fraction will be high. If the indirect is high that may indicate a different problem such as hemolysis or destruction of red blood cells from some other problem. I don't think tanning bed has anything to do with this. I wish her well."},{"Patient":"I had a CT scan of the abdomen after receiving an abnormal ultrasound with the following impression: Small area of calcific density noted in the region of the medial aspect fo the second portion of the duedenum.

Gallbladder distension can mean some degree of inflammation. Eventhough you say that you have not had an acute attack , it could be a disaster waiting to happen. Problem is, one of the small stones can get stuck in the bile duct , that is the channel that brings bile into the intestine. Then you can have severe abdominal pain,fever,chills,yellow jaundice and hospitalization. This could result in complications like rupture of the gallbladder and peritonitis. If you had a large single stone, there were options to treat with laser or drugs. In your case, best option is surgery.This can be done as same day surgery through laparoscopic approach. Recovery is shorter and you will not have a large incision. Stomach bloating and gas could be symptoms of gallstones. Some times, you may have a hiatus hernia and GERD to explain this.

Your Liver Function Test (LFT) is slightly deranged from the normal. There is nothing to panic about it and as such no immediate management of it is required. Repeat the LFT after 3 months and check for the results. Your Lipid profile seems to be deranged and is concerning. You must start right away with dietary change and lifestyle modifications including exercises. Get an ECG done too. It seems like you may require lipid lowering agents (Medications) too for this. The cervical spine x-ray shows changes as you mentioned. But nothing needs to be done surgically for this as of now. You will benefit by physiotherapy and neck exercises. My suggestion to you is to get back to your primary care physician and seek his guidance about the management plan. Hope you are in fit health at the earliest.

It is significant only when increased to 3 folds in the hundreds. Simvastatin does not cause an elevation in SGPT but has to be used with caution who already have a rise in the SGPT value.

Liver Heamangioma is generally slow growing and very rarely causes symptoms. You should go for repeat ultrasound imaging along with CT/ MRI scan abdomen for better evaluation of liver pathology.

You dont need to have symptoms during the early stage of disease. You can feel tired, have pain in right side of abdomen,nausea and other non-specific symptoms. You need to do liver US or CT to find is it just fatty liver or some more serious disorder. Also you need to check viral markers and chabge you r lifestyle,avoid food and drinks which are bad for liver and do sport. Also repeat your enzymes tests constantly to see the dynamic of it.

My doctor is trying a gluten free diet right now, but I do not see a change. Please Help Kelly","Doctor":"Hello, kellymccreary, Your symptoms of nausea and bloating is probably not related to your gallbladder surgery. Most often, we see GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) associated with gallbladder disease. If you have a hiatus hernia you could have similar symtoms. Also, the other condition that is more common with these type of symptoms is IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) either with contipation or diarrhea and some will have alternating between diarrhea and constipation. As for gluten free diet , that is helpful only if you have gluten sensitivity. True Celiac disease is  auto immune mediated  and affects the lining of the small intestine and causes malabsorption and subsequent problems. These might include weight loss, diarrhea (Fatty stools), vitamin and mineral deficiencies, brittle bones, skin problems etc. etc. Gluten is present in Wheat, Oats and Barley products. There are a small percentage of people who are allergic to or sensitive to gluten without having Celiac Disease. I would recommend trying a PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor) such as Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, Rabeprazole or Esomeprazole-All are available without prescription, take 20 mg. once or twice a day for 1-2 weeks, about an hour before meals and see if that helps. Try to avoid excess caffeine, alcohol, very spicy foods, citrus and tomato products and see if that makes a difference. If no improvement you may need to have an endoscopic evaluation. I hope you were tested for Celiac through special blood tests. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"I m sitting here at my desk, typing on my laptop and it feels like palpitations all over my upper body.

Since a holter done months back is normal, a heart arrythmia issue is less likely. I recommend you to get your thyroid function tests done.

Few of the people have muddy sclera which appears to be yellow in color. Kindly ask him whether he has any past history of jaundice or not. Sometimes jaundice at any time of life may cause discoloration of sclera permanently. Does he has yellow discoloration of urine/ loss of appetite/ vomiting/ abdominal pain/ itching in body? He should go for ultrasound imaging along with repeat liver function test. If he is getting yellow colored stool with normal color urine then there is no chance of jaundice.

A HIDA scan is an imaging procedure that helps track the production and flow of bile from your liver to your small intestine.

I dont think taht it is asociated with your previous surgery except some kind of liver blood vessels and bile ducts were injured. SGPT is elevated in hepatitis, diabetes, congestive heart failure, liver damage, bile duct problems, infectious mononucleosis and the best way to rule these disorders out is to do ultrasound or CT scan of liver.

Although UDILIV has many side effects like nausea,vomiting,diarrhoea,joint pains etc and should not be taken along with statins,it's role in reduction of GGTP is very doubtful. UDILIV is basically used in treatment of gall stones. The best treatment for reduction of lver enzymes caused by alcohol intake is 1... Complete abstinence from alcohol 2... Regular exercises 3... Consumption of fresh fruits and green vegetables 4.. Avoidance of junk food and controlling of sugar levels if you have diabetes.

For mild cases of acute cholecystitis, antibiotic therapy with a single broad-spectrum antibiotic is adequate. Outpatient treatment may be appropriate for cases of uncomplicated cholecystitis. If surgical treatment is indicated, laparoscopic cholecystectomy represents the standard of care. The rest of your complaints are consistant with your symptoms. On recovery post surgery, pls do dieting and excercise lose weight. Once the normal weight is maintained ,the fatigue problem will also diaappear.It (low energy levels)could be in all probabality associated with Insulin Resistance.

You have mentioned experiencing the same symptoms but not mentioned any symptoms. I would like to know about your symptoms and how they affect your quality of life. The findings of your physician on auscultation seem to be due to mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Mitral valve is a valve which is present between the left atrium and the left ventricle. In MVP, some part of the valve prolapses, and when the ventricle pumps to send oxygenated blood to the body, this valve gets pushed back due to the prolapse and causes minor blood leak in the opposite direction. It is a common finding in young people and it does not cause any health issues. Also there is no need of medications for MVP. Medications are required if and only complications arise and the leak gets severe, which is rare. So you need not be worried about the auscultatory findings. ECG findings show incomplete RBBB which means a defect in electrical impulse conduction on the right side. Again, it seems to be since your birth and will not cause you any health issues neither now nor in the future. CBC shows mild anemia which can be treated with iron supplements. Wishing you good health. Regards"},{"Patient":"My Dad who is 82 years old went to the hospital because his tests showed that he had fluids in his lungs and his abdomen , his liver was congested and the walls of his gall bladder were thick. the doctors at the hospital identified that this was caused by some heart related incident and on doing an echo said that his heart was pumping at 20% only. however, they were amazed that he was walking about on his own, etc though he seems to have slight breathlessness once in a while. Any suggestion or feedback for on his condition and what I should be asking the hospital/ doctors?","Doctor":"Hello Your father is suffering from congestive heart failure( CHF ). With mild to moderate CHF, the heart is not as powerful as it once was. As less blood is pumped out of the heart with each beat, the blood returning to the heart through the veins backs up. This back-up causes fluid congestion in the tissues. When that congestion occurs in the lungs, the person experiences shortness of breath. This is the reason  your father is having fluid in lungs and abdomen and there is congestion in liver. 20% pumping action means ejection fraction is very low. Normal range of ejection fraction is 50 to 75 %. lower the Ejection Fraction number,Higher the Risk. Ejection fraction, or EF, is the percentage of blood that is pumped out of the heart during each beat. Doctors often use EF to determine how healthy your heart is and how well it is functioning as a pump. Your EF number is a key indicator of your heart health. A low EF number is a serious health risk. If you’re a heart patient with an EF of 35 or below, you’re at significantly higher risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Since the EF is 20%,your father is at great risk and should be hospitalised. Treatment required is to remove the fluids and increase the contractile power of heart with help of medications. Let the doctors assess and treat him and so it should be left on them.

Doctor please tell what should i do and what test i have to do.","Doctor":"Hello, bina, Four years ago , you say that you were treated for GERD and also for H.Pylori. During this past four years, I am assuming that you were taking some kind of a PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor) to control your GERD symptoms. If you were not on any maintenance meds, you probably need re-evaluation with endoscopy and biopsy. Recurrence of H.Pylori is not uncommon. Sometimes a triple or four drug combination is needed to eradicate this. Now , as for your stage-2 fatty liver, I have some information for you. This occurs in overweight individuals and also who have high levels of lipid and insulin resistance or type-2 diabetes. As part of the treatment, weight loss is imporatnt, also for blood sugar control. Your cholesterol and Triglycerides have to be lowered, by dietary mens and may be drugs. I also recommend Vit-E 800 i.u. daily along with Vit-C 1000mg. daily. High protein, low fat diet is helpful. If you have not had a complete metabolic panel .have that done. Lipid levels and blood sugar, Hemoglobin A1C levels. Finally, a liver biopsy may be required if your liver tests keep climbing to see the exact stage of liver disease.

Most common disorders which raise liver enzymes parameters are, alcohol, metabolic syndrom, viral hepatitis and biliary system disorders (inflammation, obstruction). So these 4 should be ruled out.  The best way is to to further tests. So I recommend to do viral hepatitis analysis, abdominal CT(more specific than ultrasound) and liver biopsy.

The symptoms which you have seem to be due to effect of some toxic gas probably carbon monoxide. Toxic fumes wont affect the heart so immediately giving rise to pain. So i think that your heart is not affected, but the lungs were affected during the episode. Lungs can remove toxins very effectively hence you need not worry about them retaining the toxins.

This is the first(the earliest stage) of liver cirrhosis and causes are alcohol or metabolic syndrome (diabetes, hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia). He should also check liver enzymes levels, without it I cant tell you the degree of liver fibrosis.

If does she should do ultrasound and liver biopsy. So what about treatment? there is a vaccination but this is not useful anymore for your mother. Treatment depends on severity of liver damage because this infection passes through different phases. There is a very low possibility of liver cirrhosis and cancer development but considering this she should do repeated work ups at least once a year. There is no some specific treatment or cure.There are some antiviral drugs but are not usually used for this condition.

Simply said, these enzymes are elevated when you have liver damage of any kind. So its elevation is a consequence of some liver disorder which you need ti find out. At your age the most common cause is alchohol drinking and viral hepatitis, but also some autoimmune and congential disorders should be ruled out. You should do liver ultrasound and biopsy to evaluate the degree of liver damage and depending on it you can plan further diagnostic tests and therapy. And of course,stop drinking...If you believe you dont drink too much it doesnt mean it. If your enzymes stabilize when you stop drinking then everything is clear.

The most blood delivery to liver comes from portal vein (75%) and the other from hepatic artery 25% so even significant cronic developed thrombosis of artery wouldnt have some serious consequences. Despite it you should try to prevent further formation of atherosclerosis not only in this artey but also in all other especially in heart and extremities.

I am sure your liver has regenerated fully by now. I am also very plesed to see that you are staying  away from anything that could cause damage to your liver. It appears that your weight loss was fairly recent with a what appears to be a strict diet. It is possible that you lacked good amounts of protein in your diet. Extended periods of fasting can cause your liver enzymes to go up. Some of the enzyme elevation could have been present before your weight loss and now the levels very mildly elevated , especially SGPT. Of the two, SGPT or ALT is more important and slower to come down. I would like you to start taking Vit-E 800 i.u. daily along with Vit-C 1000mg. a day. Increase your proteins and limit the fat. Moderate amount of starches are O.K. It is possible that you were excercising as well that could add to SGOT elevation .

I am not sure if you had a laparoscopic surgery or open surgery. If there was a lot of inflammation at the time of surgery, it is possible to have some scar tissue develop after the healing. You may have a pinched nerve in that area under the rib cage on the right side. It is very unlikely to have an infection after all these months. If you have post-operative complications, usually that occurs within the first two weeks. Delayed complications such as a retained stone in the bile duct can show up much later. This is associated with fever,chills, abdominal pain and yellow jaundice. It does not look like you have any of these symptoms. Just keep an eye on that area and you can apply some pian relieving cream that you can find at a drug store. If the pain gets worse, have your doctor check you for any additional tests. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir, I was diagnosed with chirrosis after a blood test and ultrasound scan 3 years ago but I don t have ANY symptoms at all, I feel fine, play tennis every week. i only drink a few glasses of Martini at the weekend, and if there is some VERY good wine on offer I will have a glass. I had a liver ultrasound scan and the clinic doctor said there was nothing wrong with me. liver was looking OK, the right size and aspect) Do you think it is possible that I was wrongly diagnosed?","Doctor":"It is possible that you were wrongfully diagnosed, HOWEVER keep in mind that cirrhosis does not give any symptoms until the disease is very advanced. You should get blood test to check you liver function (liver enzymes can be elevated, your platelets can go down, and your coagulation studies can be altered), and there are better imaging studies to evaluate the liver besides the ultrasound, including CT scan or MRI. Also a liver biopsy can be done as the definitive test to diagnose it, but it is oftentimes not necessary. Until you are not sure about the diagnosis, you should avoid alcohol."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had my gallbladder removed 1 year ago. Last week I strained myself by doing household work. Since then I m having pain on right side of stomach , I m feeling bloated and burping frequently. I have oily and restraurant food too often, could this be one of the reasons for my condition. Should I go back to my surgeon?","Doctor":"Hi, the surgeon is not going to be able to help you in this case. After a gallbladder is removed you are at risk of having symptoms in the future such as those you are describing: pain and bloating, although it should not be related to straining yourself, this is more indicative of something muscular or joint related. Now that you don't have a gallbladder, the bile drains directly from your liver into the bowels, which can also make you have diarrhea. Other potential problems include small bowel \\"bacterial overgrowth\\". I recommend you going to a gastroenterologist who can evaluate you further, and differentiate all of those. Your symptoms could also be completely unrelated to the surgery, and you can have an entity called delayed gastric emptying, gastric ulcers or inflammation, etc."},{"Patient":"Hi sir....I am suffering from alternating constipation/diarrhea , malabsorption , Muscle cramps , brainfog , fatigue..etc..since 2 months..last month i was diagnosed with 4mm gallbladder polyp ..no calculi...nowadays i am suffering from right sided sholder pain radiating from ribs..very slight ofcourse..i am sick of right side abdomen soreness...i am planning to take taurine 2mg daily(divided 2 doses) , Magnesium Glycinate , Omega 3 s 2000mg -(divided 2 doses),Vitamin C 1000mg(divided 2 doses)","Doctor":"Hello, chaitanya.krrish, I am assuming that when you say malabsorption, you are not digesting foods properly. I am not sure if the doctors diagnosed malabsorption after doing x-rays and blood tests. Lot of conditions can be associated with malabsorption such as Crohn's disease, Celiac disease, Pancreatic problems, Tuberculosis involving the intestine or other diseases that can affect the small bowel. Hope you have been tested for all of these. Gallbladder polypis usually asymptomatic and generally does not need treatment. If that is very large and occurs in a very elderly, then we advocate removal because of chance of cancer. Muscle cramps can be due to potassium deficiency along with magnesium. Pain in the shoulder could be bursitis or arthritis and if you have a pinched nerve it could radiate. I am in favor of taking the supplements that you mention. I would also recommend a good super B-Complex vitamin daily. I want you to be tested for Pernecious Anemia due to vit-B12 deficiency. That can give you brainfog . If you have not had your stool tested for ova and parasites, get that done along with a complete metabolic panel of blood tests, thyroid function tests and a complete blood count.

Its hard to describe how it feels but it feels like a kind of ache. It even happens when im hungry. Do you know if this could be serious?","Doctor":"Hello thanks for posting at HCM.I have gone through your description. By sore heart, i guess you mean sore sensation in the chest. Your symptoms seem very typical of hyperacidity or stomach reflux disease. Your stomach produces more acid and hence you have got this sore feeling in the chest. I recommend you to take a course of antacids two times a day for 14 days. This will definitely give you relief. If despite this you do not get any relief, you must see a gastroenterologist to rule out stomach ulcers.Wishing you good health.

If you or the doctor were able to feel the edge of the liver under the right rib cage, that may mean a swollen or enlarged liver. You also mention fluctuating liver enzymes. If you are having pain in the right upper abdomen, nausea, vomiting, fever or chills, you have to have a sonogram of the liver and gallbladder to rule out gallstones or fatty liver which can cause enzyme elevations. \\"Gastric problem \\" usually refers to stomach. Some of the medications, prescription drugs or even over the counter drugs can affect the liver. Alcohol can damage the liver. Viral Hepatitis , especially Types-B & C . can cause chronic liver condition with abnormal enzymes. You need to be screened for those as well.

Are these alterations in liver enzymes due to hypercholestrolemia or it suggest fatty liver or something else??","Doctor":"Hello, zaraarshad, The condition called \\"Metabolic Syndrome \\" is associated with overweight, Type-2 diabetes, elevated lipid levels, and fatty liver in it's complete form. If you have these it is possible that your liver enzyme elevation may be due to mild fatty liver based on the levels of elevation. But you need to have a good ultrasound of the liver to find out the degree of fatty liver (Grades). In it's early stages, if appropriate measures are taken, your liver can be perfectly normal. Losing weight, controlling blood sugar,proper excercise, diet, and reducing the lipid levels. Having said that, there are a lot of reasons for enzymes to be elevated. Drugs, including over the counter ones, viruses such as Types-A, B,or C, Autoimmune diseases, some metabolic disorders, some genetic enzyme deficiency conditions, heavy metals, poison mushroom etc. etc. Start taking a good super B-Complex Vit. daily along with 800 i.u. of Vit-E and 1000mg. of Vit-C. along with a high protein diet.

Thanking you sir Asif","Doctor":"Dear Asif, this is nothing serious and there is no reason to concern. especially if you dont have any symptoms.  Fatty liver is a common ultrasound finding especially at age >50. It is usually associated with raised blood lipids, obesity and alcoholism but often there is no specific cause. You should also check your liver enzymes. Some people are afraid of having liver cirrhosis after they find fatty liver but there is a long way from fatty liver to cirrhosis. You just need to care about your nutrition (avoid alcohol, fatty food and do sport) and control your liver function (US and enzymes) once a year.

Your symptom could be related to your hepatitis problem but it can also be a problem for itself. I dont know the degree of your liver failure, but there are at least 2 factors which can effect on your ankles. The  first one is a higher possibility of infection and second one is a Hypoproteinemia. Those two disorders cause swelling and infection of any part of the body including ankles. Also I ll mention some condition which are not related to the live: tendinitis, arthritis, stress fracture, rheumatoid arthritis and gout of course.

They results of that told the doctor that her all bladder was only contracting at about 30% of the time. My question is will she have to have her gall baldder out and is a dysfuntional gallbladder something you see often?","Doctor":"Dear Michele, the only problem with dysfunctional gallbladder is that it can cause higher incidence of calculi formation. Bile secretion and function s not affected. So if they didnt find calculi , these symptoms can be related to gallbladder but should disappear soon. I suggest you to do frequently US controls ( once in 2 years) to find any gallstones formation. Oral drugs can be administered to dissolve the stones, but any sign of inflammation (fever, chills, jaundice, right subcostal pain)  is a indication for surgery procedure which is usually done laparoscopically and is a routine procedure today.

Any thoughts are helpful.","Doctor":"Hello, bklauk, The important part of your history is the recent use of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen, Naproxen, can cause temporary elevation of enzymes and rarely severe liver damage if taken in excess. Same thing is true for Tylenol (Acetaminophen) taken in overdose can injure the liver. Antibiotics belonging to the Tetracycline family can also affect the liver. Your lipd level being normal is good and probably rules out fatty liver. It is possible to have a very mild  fatty liver even when you are ten pounds overweight, in your case unlikely. It is possible to have asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B or C from a prior infection. If you had a blood transfusion years ago when good screening tests was not available, people received contaminated blood. Needle prick, multiple sexual partners, drug abuse (Intravenous), sharing tooth brush, tattos from a dirty place (Needle) -all are risk factors for Hepatitis. You definitely need to get a screening blood tests for both Hepatitis B & C. They can be treated very effectively with newer drugs now. You are getting the sonogram of the liver and gallbladder which is good. You can rule out gallstones. If the level of enzymes are only minimally elevated , I would not worry about it, especially if related to medications. They will get back to normal on their own. Taking a good B-Complex vitamin once a day along with 1000mg. of Vit-C daily along with a good high protein, low fat diet is very good.

Firstly,you should  do abdominal sonography first to rule out your fear. If the report is ok,then don't worry,its a physiological problem that you have. Now what ayurveda thinks regarding this problem?As you are also suffering from urticaria (sheet pitta) along with yellow skin.This is called tirykgamitva of doshas. My experience says if this is not due to gall bladder stone then its related with blood(rakta) +rasa(lymph) +mamsa(muscle) dhatu. This is called samtajaneet pitta/kaphavrurtta pitta dosha in ayurveda. The best medicines for this are navayas loha/punarnava mandure/shankha bhasma/praval pishti etc along with dhanvantar ghritam/mahatiktak ghritam/dadimadya ghritam. I got excellent results with these medicines in my ayurvedic practice at my clinic.Also maximum intake of ginger/hing/spinach/yam/beet root/turmeric/coriander seeds/black cardamom/oregano/mangostine peel/jaggery/green gram daal is also recommended. Also do various test like LFT,AST GGPT,AP,Urine analysis,BUL,ESR,BSL etc.If any problems occurs the above written treatment is also effective in gall bladder stone +in any liver diseases."},{"Patient":"hi good morning, im phil from phils. i was diagnosed to have dyslipedimia and also fattly liver i was given gemfibrozil and also metformin . my sgpt is not that sky high. my bp is stable im still 31 and i would like to know if these are the right medications or u will still add something. i was 84kg at that time and im now 75kg today. im taking that meds for 2months now.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for using healthcare magic Fatty liver can be as a result of alcohol use or associated with diet and excess weight. The gemifibrozil will treat high triglycerides and high cholesterol if these are the abnormalites seen in your cholesterol results and the metformin would reduce the insulin resistance that is commonly associated with non alcoholic fatty liver. The american college of gastroenterology suggests the following: weight loss, reduce alcohol intake, appropriate vitamin E intake, omega 3 is used if the triglycerides are high but not specifically for the liver disease. The 9 kg weight loss would improve your present conditions.

Thank you for the query. It looks like you have not had proper diagnostics yet. Your symptoms are very characteristic for peptic ulcer. In such case upper GI endoscopy is advisable with Helicobacter Pylori test. It is very common that peptic ulcers cant get healed because of this infection. That is why it is very important to have it checked and if positive antibiotics are necessary. Sometimes such symptoms can be caused by gallstones. That is why if no findings in endoscopy, abdominal ultrasound should be performed as well as full blood work, liver tests and pancreas tests. Hope this will help.

PANCREATIC MEASURMENT ON THE HIGHER SIDE. kindly confirm doctor, is it incurable ? & what should i take action now ?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Strange words your doctor said to you as your ultrasound result is quite normal. Marginally enlarged liver means that your liver size is a little above the regular size. Non dilated IHBR and CBD means that your bile ducts are fine, not dilated. Your gallbladder is fine as well. Some pancreatic enlargement, probably not significant. It is very hard to tell what your doctor was thinking about. Abdominal ultrasound is not a good test for setting final diagnosis so if your doctor have any doubts, he should send you to abdominal CT. If it is about your symptoms, most probable reason of it is peptic ulcer, acid reflux. It is advisable for you to have upper GI endoscopy. Full blood test with pancreatic enzymes and liver enzymes should be performed as well as urine analysis. Hope this will help.

Other possibility may be heart pain if it occur in whole chest and radiated towards the left arm. Consult your doctor and get operated for Gall stones and remove the gall bladder. This will resolve the problem of pain. Also you will get clearance from heart related issue before surgery. So get the surgery done as soon as possible so that it may not result in any complication.

Thank you for the query. As surgery is a very serious procedure it needs some indications to have it performed. Your symptoms might be caused by gallbladder inflammation without gallstones (this is very rare) but it can also be caused by peptic ulcer, severe pancreas disease or even heart problems (including heart attack). That is why before any surgery you should have abdominal CT (to make sure the problem is not pancreas), liver tests (AST,ALT,GGTP,AP - if last two elevated ERCP should be performed), bilirubin level, amylase and lipase level, urine analysis. Heart ECG and heart enzymes should be performed as well (CK-MB, Troponine)  to see if there is any ischaemia. As you do suffer from asthma and it very often is associated with gastric reflux disease you should also have upper GI performed to see if there is no peptic ulcers or duodenum swelling. Only after all this tests if no other reasons of your symptoms you may start thinking about surgery. Hope this will help.

Thank you for the query. Left lower abdominal pain can be caused by diverticulitis, left ovarian cyst, urinary tract infection, pregnancy, inguinal hernia. If you do suffer also from constipations, diverticulitis is probable. If your pain aggravates during the period, ovarian problem can be the cause. If you do suffer also from frequent urinating, burning when urinating it can be uti. If your pain aggravates when coughing and there is some lump in the groin, hernia is possible. Your nausea can be caused by one of mentioned disease or can be caused by peptic ulcer, acid reflux, bile ducts stones.

I have gone through your description. It is very early after a stent placement to get angina symptoms. This occurs only when body does not accept the stent. However the symptoms may be more pronounced in that case. Since you have said that you have suffered from a heart attack, your heart pumping function must have dropped. This may be cause of edema or swelling on the hands. But this edema also tends to accumulate more on the legs. Do have leg swelling also?Protein deficiency can also cause swelling or edema of hands. Please get your serum proteins checked.The headache can be due to some medications that are given to keep the arteries of the heart dilated. These medications also cause dilation of blood vessels in the head thereby causing headache. As of now there is nothing to worry. Get your serum proteins checked. Still if you feel very insecure and want to rule out whether its a stent problem you an do a treadmill test by naughton's protocol. It is a test in which you will be made to walk on a treadmill while your ECG is continuously being monitored. This will help you to ascertain whether the stent is causing problems. But according to me, its patent and should not be a matter of concern. Wishing you good health.Regards"},{"Patient":"I am 34 years old I have a acidity problem for last 6 years I have used lot of medicine but stil in a same position I lost my weight also I did my ultrasound test report showing that my liver is little bit big and lot of gas in my stomach and lower part of the abdomen .

A slightly big liver usually does not mean aanything serious unless the liver function tests show some abnormal readings. So a LFT needs to be done.

You can have no jaundice symptoms visible (especially for you), however still there might be increased bilirubin blood level. Especially if your urine is dark and stool is whitish.

Thank you for the query. First of all you should know that cholelithiasis does not cause jaundice directly as mostly it means that you have gallstones (the correct name for it is cholecystolithiasis). Jaundice is caused by stones in bile ducts what is called choledocholithiasis. Your wife should have this stones removed right away as it can result with acute pancreatitis. To do that endoscopy with ERCP should be performed (surgery for bile duct stones can be done if the stones are really big). After this procedure, you need a break for bile ducts to get healed (at least two weeks) and after that, laparoscopic removal of the gallbladder should be performed as such stones can migrate from gallbladder to bile ducts again.

SGOT is marginally raised, normal level is less than ) IU/L 2. SGPT is also increased, normal level is less than 40 IU/L 3. GGT is also marginally increased, normal level is less than 70 IU/L These values indicate a slight liver cell damage and mild obstruction of the biliary tract. Get few other tests related to liver- bilirubin (direct, indirect and total), alkaline phosphatase and serum preteins. These investigations will provide some more information. An ultrasound abdomen should be done to know the status of liver, biliary tract and kidney. The electrolyte level is normal. Sodium and chloride are within normal limits.

Firstly a liver transplant, which is available in many countries (I don't know whether it is available in your country).However, your treating doctor will be able to tell whether it can be done in your case at this stage.Secondly, it is imporatant to relieve the pain and the disabling edema to improve the quality of life.Therapeutic drainage of ascitic fluid can be done. This implies that fluid is removed from the abdominal cavity as soon as it is filled.Pain can be relieved by drugs or by palliative surgery. In this surgery the nerves causing pain are divided or the the organ causing the pain is partially removed.The curative option is liver transplant.Other options will relieve the discomfort and pain only but will not cure the disease.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"Good day! I am 18 years old and have a problem with increased bilirubin levels since I was 16 years old. Last November 2010, I had my first test containing my bilirubin. And the total bilirubin level was 70+. We were shocked as well as my doctor that s why I d undergone to ultrasound. But Thank God I have no problem with my liver , spleen and gallbladder . After that, I have to checked if I have Hepa . But it was all negative. So they just advised me to eat butterball candies. After few months (May 2011) my total bilirubin went down to 30+. I don t feel any symptoms. Last October 2012, I had a test again for my bilirubin and it became 21. So, doctor, please help me to find answers concerning this matter. Thank you so much!","Doctor":"Dear Concerned., Thanks for writing to us. You could be having in all probability congenital Hyperbilirubinaemia which is a result of congenital absence of certain enzymes in liver 's function at cellular level. There are various eponymous terms such as Gilbert's Syndrome//Criggler Najjar's Syndrome//Rotor's Syndrome//Dubin Johnson's Syndrome named after the Hepatologists who have discovered the same. In some cases an enzyme called Glucuronyl Transferace is congenitally absent leading to unconjugated Hyperbilirubinaemia. The bilirubin levels can be brought down by use of medicines such as Phenobarbitone but the side effects are more so they have to be abandoned after a short time treatment Most of these are not life threatening. But excercise caution in that you should not consume any hepatotoxic drugs such as Paracetamol etc. In addition alcohol is a strict No No.Have a high carbohydrate and fat free diet. Kindly Consult a Hepatologist and evaluate whether it is a Congenital/Acquired Hyperbilirubinemia and also USG abdomen and Pelvis to pinpoint the cause of the syndrome and institute the evidence based treatment accordingly.

A complete course of specific drugs namely T Cifran 5oomgms BID, T flagyl 400mgms TID, T rantac 150mgms BID. this should be continued for 14 days. 2. Stop all other drugs immediately. 3. Stop eating outside food. eat only well cooked and hygenic food. 4. Same applies to water. ensure that you drink clean and potable water, preferably boiled. Repeat a USG of the abdomen. if the liver abscess is still seen then I would suggest that you take a 5 day course of IV antibiotics. That will give quicker and ensured relief .

So if you do not abuse an alcohol and your weight is high this is the reason of such usg result. Fatty liver can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver failure. And as fatty liver is reversible, liver cirrhosis is not. So this is the best time to make some changes. You should test your cholesterol level with LDL and HDL levels and triglycerides level. If increased, you should ask your doctor to have some statins prescribed. You should also change your diet, prevent fatty foods and sugar rich foods, increase vegetables  intake. Physical activity is also advisable. Hope this will help. Regards."},{"Patient":"Male age 42. Mild diveticular disease. Drink aprox 30 units alcohol per week.

My husband has been tested and was negative for the virus as well. I had bloodwork done and was told my liver enzymes was elevated. Any reasons why this could be?","Doctor":"If your hepatitis B virus has been inactive for so many years this is unlikely the source of your abnormal liver enzymes. Given your history of a gastric sleeve, you are at risk for developing fatty liver disease. This is very common in whoever loses weight rapidly, therefore after having a bariatric surgery you are very likely to develop fatty liver, and if this fat in the liver produces inflammation within the liver itself it is then called NASH or Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis. However to make sure this is the problem, further blood tests need to be done to rule out other sources.

Jaundice is yellowish discolouration of skin & mucous membrane. It is just a symptom of the disease & not a disease itself. There are many causes for jaundice.

I'm sorry your mother is having problems. Your email address doesn't transmit to our platform here, so I'll have to answer your question in the forum. Gallbladder adenomyomatosis is a fairly common condition of unknown cause that often gets discovered when people undergo abdominal ultrasound to identify the source of abdominal pain. Adenomyomatosis is characterized by thickening and irregularity in the wall of the gallbladder. This condition is not a precursor for cancer, and it usually doesn't cause any problems. \\"Diffuse renal parenchymal disease\\" refers to an abnormal appearance throughout the tissues in your mother's kidneys. (The parenchyma of any organ is the functional tissue within the organ, as opposed to connective tissue or other nonfunctional elements.) Normal kidneys have a characteristic appearance on ultrasound; when a patient's kidneys don't have this typical appearance (they often have a grainy or \\"snowstorm\\" appearance instead), the radiologist reading the study will usually note it as \\"possible diffuse renal parenchymal disease.\\" This finding must be correlated with clinical signs of kidney disease, such as an elevated creatinine level or abnormal amounts of protein in the urine. Your mother's physician, who is familiar with her medical history and current complaints, is much better qualified to address these issues. I suggest you call him/her. I hope things go well for your mom!"},{"Patient":"SGOT / AST (kinetics ) Normal Range: 5-31 Result: 61.07 LDH (kinetic) 135-214 292.81 ESR (westergreen) 0-20 23 WBC 3.98-10.04 2.5 MONOCYTE 5-12 16.40 i had a cardiac panel test this morning cause i wanna know what s causing my hypertension .

I am not sure of the BP now, but cardioselective beta blockers will help. Do discuss with you cardiologist and obstetrician on the drug of choice.

These symptoms of vomiting, blacking out, sweating  can be cardiac related and hence must be evaluated. These maybe symptoms of vasovagal syncope. Since ENT doctor has cleared him, ENT cause is ruled out. Cardiac work up should be done by a 2 d echo. It will give information about the pumping function of the heart, any damage to the walls of the heart and any leak between the valves. Also he must do a holter monitoringwhich records a   24 hr ECGwhile the patient goes around his normal acitivities. This will document any arrythmias if he is having which can lead to such episodes. The ECG may be normal in the ER but the ECG at the time of symptoms should be checked and hence the Holter should be done.

Thank you for the query. 1. Small GB polyp - this one should not be left alone as polyps can be misdiagnosed with gallbladder cancer.

Mildly enlarged prostate is not anything to worry about, however it should be observed and consulted with urologist to have tranrectal ultrasound with biopsy if necessary Your PSA level is fine and so is CEA, however CEA is not a good way to check if there is colon cancer or not. It elevates in about 50-80% of colon cancers mostly in late stages. Better way to check colon cancer risk is fecal occult blood and the best way is colonoscopy. Hope this will help.

Welcome to Healthcare Magic. Your email address is not available to me, so I'll address your question here at our forum. Hepatitis B is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world, and it is the most common liver infection worldwide. Most patients with chronic hepatitis B (those who continue to carry the virus in their bodies) do not have any symptoms; indeed, many people with chronic hepatitis B don't even know they're infected. If you have chronic hepatitis B and your liver enzymes are elevated, this is a sign that your liver is being damaged by the virus, and treatment might be indicated. If your liver enzymes are NOT elevated, this suggests your virus is quiescent for the time being. Your doctor will probably want to monitor you every six months or so -- usually with blood tests -- to make sure your virus doesn't reactivate. Now, just because your liver enzymes aren't elevated doesn't mean you're not infectious. You can still pass the virus to other people through sexual contact or exposure to your bodily fluids. Whether or not you're legally obligated to report your status to your employer could be influenced by where you live and what type of occupation you hold. In many locations, you're not required to disclose your health information to prospective employers. I hope that answers your question.

If you are overweight then you should lose weight to get rid of any fat in the liver. Avoid alcohol completely. Make sure you have been tested for the most common (and uncommon) liver diseases such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, alpha 1 antytripsin deficiency, etc. If your doctor is unsure about the reason for your abnormal liver enzymes you may require a liver biopsy. Also make sure you are not taking any medications that could damage your liver. Check with your doctor. Hope that helps. Let me know if you have any further comments or questions."},{"Patient":"this the result of recent Liver Function Test ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE PHOTOMETRY 197.4 U/l M:53 to 128 - F:42 to 98 BILIRUBIN - TOTAL PHOTOMETRY 1.12 mg/dl 0 - 1.2 BILIRUBIN -DIRECT PHOTOMETRY 0.26 mg/dl 0 - 0.3 BILIRUBIN (INDIRECT) CALCULATED 0.86 mg/dl 0 - 0.9 GAMMA GLUTAMYL TRANSFERASE (GGT) PHOTOMETRY 404.3 U/l M: 0 to 50 - F :0 to 30 PROTEIN - TOTAL PHOTOMETRY 8.7 gm/dl 6.0 - 8.3 ALBUMIN - SERUM PHOTOMETRY 3.65 gm/dl 3.2 - 5.0 SERUM ALBUMIN/ GLOBULIN RATIO CALCULATED 0.72 Ratio 0.9 - 2.0 ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE (SGOT ) PHOTOMETRY 110 U/l M: 0 to 37 - F: 0 to 31 ALANINE TRANSAMINASE (SGPT) PHOTOMETRY 66.6 U/l M: 0 to 37 - F: 0 to 31 Pl analyse and inform my state of liver","Doctor":"Hi, your alkaline phosphatase is slightly elevated and the SGOT / SGPT as well. There are multiple reasons for this sort of enzymes elevation, however this is not normal and you should get further testing.

Was the liver and spleen were enlarged for you in the scan ? Do you experience frequent cough and cold atleast one in every 3-4 week's. if your fever comes every day at night time with gradual increase then I highly recommend a Mantoux test and a chest x ray or CT chest, tuberculosis needs to be rule out for you .

Is there treatment before surgery?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. There is no other treatment than surgery. In most cases such gall bladder is removed with laparoscopy. Throughout 3-4 small holes the camera and tools are inserted into the abdominal cavity and the gall bladder is removed. This is quite safe and easy surgical procedure. Does not cause much pain after and gives fast recovery. You should not wait as small stones likes to migrate into bile ducts and can cause pancreatitis which is a very serious disease.

Such condition in most cases is caused by gall stones due to migration of a stone to the bile duct. It can cause abdominal pain however it can give no symptoms at all. This has nothing in common with the drugs he is taking. You cannot treat it by yourself. You should visit your doctor as soon as possible as such bile flow blockage can cause acute pancreatitis.

But it has to do with your obesity. It is what is known as NASH- Non alcoholic steatohepatitis. You need to loose weight. Also vitamin E also helps reduce the inflammation of liver. As of now the inflammation is mild . You need to check you Liver function test every 6 months  - 1 year to see how it is progressing .

I have gone through your description. ayou have mentioned she has lupus like butterfly rash on her face. But is she already evaluated for lupus? If not i suggest getting evaluated for lupus by testing her for ANA, Anti ds DNA antibodies, ESR. Since you mentioned that your cardiologist has already checked you, I suppose 2 D echo has been done already and it looks normal. If it has not been done yet, please do a 2 D echo. Another reason can be kidney issues which can be affected if she has got lupus and can cause similar symptoms. So please get a serum creatinine and urine routine done.

You've not mentioned what other test reports were - i.e. S.Bilirubin, SGOT/Gamma GT etc.? There is no specific treatment for reducing ALT.

You have been diagnosed as having Hepatitis B virus in your body. This condition is known as HBSAg +ve. First you need to know something about your condition. Many people may get affected by this virus. Usually the mode of transmission is by using infected needles, blood transfusion and may also be transmitted sexually. In many patients the virus persists in the body for less than 6 months. If the virus persists for more than 6 months then we call that person as Carrier. Healthy Carriers are patients in whom the virus persists but will not affect the liver. So the chances of these patients landing up with Cirrhosis of liver is almost nil. In some Carriers the virus slowly attacks the liver and this is known as Chronic active hepatitis. This can cause Cirrhosis of liver. Overall if you see, out of the patients affected with this virus only 2-3% may have this Chronic active hepatitis and may land up with Liver Cirrhosis. As you have been detected to be HBSAg +ve, you need to be further evaluated with some more blood tests to check the viral DNA load. If its in early stage the chances for a complete cure might be there with Interferon injections. But they are very expensive. My advice is you need to consult a Gastroenterologist or Hepatologist so that he can further evaluate you and can suggest you regarding the use of Interferons. Good luck to you."},{"Patient":"I am a 53 year old female, weight 146-height 5 4 . I recently had an ultra sound because of elevated liver enzymes . There was some fat infaltration. One month after the ultra sound my liver enzymes were AST-29, ALT-57. I was told to continue to abstain from drinking alcohol for a total of three months and have my enzymes checked again. I had been drinking 3 to 4 glasses of wine a night for many years because I have high cholesterol and thought this would help with the cholesterol. If my liver enzymes return to a normal range is it all right to have an occasional glass of wine?","Doctor":"Hello madam, I have gone through your problem. You said that you are drinking wine for many years and had fatty infiltration of the liver along with raised liver enzymes. Fatty infiltration of the liver is seen in obese patients and patients who take alcohol. You also had raised liver enzymes which shows that you had alcoholic hepatitis. Now your liver enzymes had returned to normal, but still there is a chance for you to have hepatitis (raised liver enzymes) in future if you take alcohol. My advice is to abstain from drinking alcohol and consult your physician for your high cholesterol. There are cholesterol lowering drugs with which you can maintain your body cholesterol at a low level. good luck to you."},{"Patient":"I am on Accutane 3rd month- 60 mg/day and 145 pounds. My baseline liver test was ALT and AST 25-20 pre accutane and after one month the went to 235 after two months on accutane. How bad is this? My doctor did other blood tests and ruled everything else out.. I don t drink, I m healthy? Just confused... How abnormal/dangerous is it for it to spike like that?","Doctor":"Hello, I have gone through your problem. You have been using Accutane since 2 months and now your liver enzymes had shown a spike. First you need to know that any drug we take will be excreted either by the liver or by the kidney. And many of the drugs will have adverse effects on these organs. They can be Hepatotoxic (injurious to liver), nephrotoxic (injurious to kidney) or Neurotoxic (injurious to brain and nerves). If the drug is Hepatotoxic, there will be rise in the ALT and AST values. You have taken Accutane and after that the liver enzymes got elevated. So it had an adverse reaction on your liver. If you continue the drug there is every chance for the liver enzymes to get elevated further. My advice is to stop the drug immediately and consult your physician. You need to get an Liver function test done after few days to make sure that the liver enzymes reverted back to their normal levels. Also you can ask your doctor to prescribe an alternative medication. good luck to you."},{"Patient":"i had my gall bladder removed yesterday.i have had two serious pain spells while trying to get into bed.with paralizing pain from my stomach and under my right rib gage going up my chest into my shoulder my doc is off for two days.his nurse said it is probably due to gas left in the stomach after surgery.should i have other concers","Doctor":"Hello, I have gone through your problem. You have undergone laparoscopic surgery for gall bladder removal. During this surgery carbon dioxide gas will be sent into your Peritoneal cavity (abdominal cavity).

Daily alcohol intake may cause Cirrhosis of liver with Portal Hypertension due to which you will have permanent liver failure and its dangerous to life.

You have mentioned that your SGOT and SGPT levels are high. You didn't mention about any of your complaints like fever, abdominal pain or vomiting. SGOT and SGPT are liver enzymes present in the liver cells (Hepatocytes). When there is destruction of the liver cells, these enzymes are released into the blood circulation. These high levels can be seen when we get an Liver function test done to the patient. Now you need to know the reasons for liver cell destruction. Some common causes are 1. Viral hepatitis 2. Cirrhosis of liver 3. Alcoholic hepatitis Usually in viral hepatitis the liver enzymes will come back to normal after few days of conservative treatment. But in Alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis of liver there will be continuing liver cell damage and so these enzymes may be persistently elevated. You need to consult your physician or Gastroenterologist and get his advice. You need further evaluation with an Ultrasound scan of the abdomen to look for the status of Liver and gall bladder. It's always safe to avoid surgery till the liver enzymes revert back to normal levels.

You should also check FBS and PPBS and kidney function and a Complete Blood count. Both the amount and the duration of alcohol consumption are critical in the development of liver disease. Contrary to general opinion, the type of alcoholic beverage is not important. Thus, one drink (1 ounce, 30 ml) of liquor (whisky, gin, vodka) contains the same amount of ethanol (13 grams) as one glass of wine (4 oz, 120 ml) or a can of beer (12 oz, 360 ml). There is no ‘threshold level’ of alcohol intake beyond which liver damage must occur. Instead, there is a gradual transition of increasing liver injury as the quantity increases. who drink > 200 g/day of ethanol for > 10 years have a 40% chance of developing cirrhosis? You can do a Ultrasonography to see fatty changes in liver and consult a Gastroenterologist and a Psychiatrist to help you out. Good luck to you"},{"Patient":"Hi, my husband was an alcoholic.

I don t need any hands to feel it now - it pounds and I can count the beats by the sensation in my chest (Look Ma, no hands!). I ve been monitoring my blood pressure for the past month - it fluctuates between marginally high to marginally low mmost of the time but lately I m up to 160 over 95. Any suggestions for what might be happening to give these new sensations?","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for posting at HCM. I have gone through your symptoms. Because your decreased activity of your adrenals, you have chronic fatigue syndrome.  Hypoadrenalism also causes loss of weight which also makes your chest wall thinner,  thereby heart gets more closer to the rib cage and when you lie on your side you can feel the vibrations and leadinf to subjective feeling of palpitations.  It is not a serious thing to be worried about. You have to be on replacement steroids to keep up with your adrenal functions, which i suppose you already on. Long term steroids can lead to osteoporosis or softening of bones so you need to be on calcium supplements and biphosphonates to keep your bones strong. BP is slightly on the higher side, so i suggest regular monitoring of your blood pressure for three weeks and if three of these readings at rest are persistently higher, you need to be started on blood pressure medications. As of now i feel there is no requirement of blood pressure medications.  You may so worrying about the heart beat sensations.

However, the type of bilirubin which is raised whether direct or indirect is important to know the the cause of rise in bilirubin. Direct bilirubin (Normal levels: 1. Obstruction to the biliary tract by a stone, growth in the biliary tree or outside the biliary tree, groth in the head of pancreas 2. Injury to the hepatocytes Indirect bilirubin (Nornal levels: 0.3-1.0 mg%) is raised in: 1. Injury to hepatocytes 2. Haemolytic anemia Along with blood bilirubin, urine bilirubin also needs to be done. Presence of bilirubin in urine indicates rise in direct bilirubin. For hypothyroidism, hormone replacement needs to be taken in the form of eltroxin or any other preparation. Your blood parameters suggest an increase in lymphocytes and decrease in neutrophils. This indicates a chronic infection. Get an ESR done and complete check up to rule out any chronic disease.

Jaundice due to bile ducts appears when the flow throughout bile ducts is either impeded or completely blocked. It happens when some small stones from gall bladder gets stuck in bile duct, when some mass is compressing bile ducts. Sometimes jaundice appears due to primary sclerosing cholangitis. In all this cases ERCP should be performed and if necessary with stenting of bile ducts. This ERCP will decrease bile pressure in bile ducts and should be a remedy for your son. Hope this will help.

Mitrla valve prolapse is not a serious condition and people suffering from MVP lead a normal life. But of course there must be regular ECGs and 2D Echo to see if there is any progression of disease in form of leak betwen the valves (MR). So yearly 2 D echo has to be done. Also since he has a prolapsed valve, it is more prone to blood borne infections (infective endocarditis). So any surgery if required to be done anywhere in the body in future, he must be on prophylactic antibiotics. Otherwise he can lead a symptom free life. As your cardiologist has already evaluated you for palpitations, you can be secure enough. I recommend taking an ECG during the symptoms of palpitations.  If ECG during this period is normal, you can stop worrying about it. Wishing him good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"Hi..I just got my Bilirubin/SGPT/ SGOT test done. My SGPT is 148 and SGOT is 156.

The treatment for restrictive cardiomyopathy is medical management including diuretics, drugs increasing filling of the heart like beta blockers and nitrates. The total daily water intake should also be restricted because the heart loses its distensibility and does not accumulate even the normal amount of blood that it can accomodate. So any extra fluid will cause fluid overload and symptoms like feet swelling, breathlessness, right sided abdominal pain, facial swelling and liver issues.  Pacemakers and external devices are of no use in restrictive cardiomyopathy.

I hope you are fully satisfied with the guidance I gave. I would be glad to answer any further queries. Thank you and Good luck !"},{"Patient":"I am a 46 year old female. I weigh 145 and am 5 2 tall.

Also, I recently started having serere hearburn and lower back pain on my right hand side under my rib cage. In 2004 while I was 7 months pregnant, I had my gallbladder removed since I had gallbladder disease/pancreatits.

Just repeat the tests in a fortnight. It is good that you don't consume drugs now.   Great indeed...Keep it up .

Please advise. I am very much worried about the Fatty Liver. Thank","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to the forum. It is nice to know you are interested in getting well. Yes, fatty liver is a serious disease when left neglected, it may lead to jaundice, hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure/ liver cancer and finally death. If a person is aware, the situation can be made better. To bring back the liver to normal should be your goal. Liver is the largest and the most important organ of the body. You should get immunized with hepatitis A, B and C. This is a precautionary measure that can be taken to help the liver get better. You should consult your treating doctor about which vaccination will be the best for you. You should lose your weight, exercise regularly, take plenty of water ( pure and hygienic). You should quit smoking, alcohol or any other addiction. Cut on your carbohydrate and sugars, cut down on caffeine intake, avoid butter, red meat, myonaise, oily junk food. Take more fruits, juice and veggies. Prefer boiled and blanched food over spicy food. Eat papayas, take sugarcane juice ( these are good for the liver ). You can take white meat ( limited). Eat whole wheat grain products, eat low fat milk products. Yes, you should  keep in touch with your treating doctor and take medicines as prescribed. Some appetizers, antacids and liver tonic will be very helpful for you. Strictly follow the doses prescribed by the doctor. Adequate rest and good sleep are essential for a healthy liver. Have a good day. Take care."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, I have got my LFT report which says that my SGPT ALT is 62 and GAMMA GT is 174.

Since you had a radiology done and have an enlarged liver, you need to be very careful about your diet and health. Hope you are already immunized with Hepatitis A and B vaccination. If you have not taken it yet do get immunized to stay safe and get faster relief from your symptoms. Since you have a high bilirubin content in your blood, it was better for you to get admitted and treated in a hospital. You need IV fluids and necessary antibiotics to get better soon. Liver is one of the main organs of the body, do not neglect. You are getting loose stools because your liver is unable to digest food properly. You can take some antidiarrheal and antacids to feel better. You need enzymes that will help the functioning of the liver and aid metabolism. You should eat boiled food, avoid fried oily spicy junk food. You can take soups, juices and fruits or berries. Take oatmeal and porridges made lightly. You may not be able to digest dairy products or eggs, avoid it. Take home made substantial food. Keep yourself well hydrated. If you feel weak do not stay at home, you need some investigations ( blood, stool tests and USG ) and care in a hospital. Have a good day. Take care."},{"Patient":"My Dad is 61 year old .

I responded really well to these treatments and then was told that all of my tests were back down to normal so they stopped treatment and i have been fine for three years, just before i went to spain back in July i took some Piriteze tablets which i have read can cause problems with the liver and abnormal liver function tests and that is when i had a blood test a few months ago and was told that the Liver function tests were high (262) is this down to the tablets or is it a relapse? Many thanks, AAA","Doctor":"Hi Tom, usually autoimmune liver disease comes and goes. You can check your liver enzymes one time and they may be normal, and then one month later they may be up and so forth. Usually a low dose of azathioprine (generic) is enough to keep the disease under control. Keep in mind that if you don't keep it under control (with normal liver enzymes), then the inflammation can progress to \\"cirrhosis\\" which when the liver is almost non-functioning and requires a liver transplantation. Make sure you go to a liver specialist for treatment recommendations. You may even need a liver biopsy."},{"Patient":"I have a blocked off right-hand carotid artery - it's not \\"blocked\\" in the way that heart arteries become blocked with plaque.  It's thought to have been caused by a coil embolisation of a cerebral aneurysm some years ago.  The left-hand carotid is working well, but there is obviously increased blood flow on the left of the brain.","Doctor":"Hello thanks for posting here. A previously placed coil in a cerebral artery to migrate into the carotid artery is very rare and unusual, because it has to go against the floors. Coil migration itself is rare and if it migrated, it does into distal arteries. So suggest we have to first confirm whether it is really the coil which is causing the obstruction. A MRA of the brain and neck arteries should be done to get sufficient information. If a coil migration is detected it can be removed by endovascular procedure through an approach from the leg artery (femoral artery) with the help of a snare. The area must be stented after the removal of the coil. If its not possible to remove the coil via endovascular techniques, an open vascular surgery should be done, and coil can be removed and a great repair can be done. So in short it requires investigation and interventional management. In the meantime you should be on blood thinner medications and statins. Wishing you good health.

I have gone through your description. You have not provided information about how is his current health status, like if he is in the hospital, is he on ventilatory support or oxygen requirement or if he is in the icu or wards.

Both the amount and the duration of alcohol consumption are critical in the development of liver disease. Contrary to general opinion, the type of alcoholic beverage is not important. Thus, one drink (1 ounce, 30 ml) of liquor (whisky, gin, vodka) contains the same amount of ethanol (13 grams) as one glass of wine (4 oz, 120 ml) or a can of beer (12 oz, 360 ml). There is no ‘threshold level’ of alcohol intake beyond which liver damage must occur. Instead, there is a gradual transition of increasing liver injury as the quantity increases Again my advise would be stop alcohol,if not possible take in limited quantity.

To get rid of the virus completely is more difficult, but again to keep it under control is easy. The treatment consists of one pill a day, with minimal chances of side effects."},{"Patient":"Hi I had got ultrasonography done as part of health checkup. The report mentions hypoechoic sol in right lobe of liver probably due to focal fat sparing. Suggested MRI for confirmation I m 29 years old and would like to understand what this hypoechoic sol in right lobe of liver is and its implications. Do I really need to get MRI done ? thanks, weight 70 Kg height 167cm","Doctor":"Hi, There is no need for a MRI. You should get a contrast enhanced CT done(double contrast IV and oral) which will reveal the true state of affairs. Once that confirms the benign characteristics of the lesion then you need not worry at all. With regards"},{"Patient":"Thank you. My daughter is in a hospital in India. Her CT scan shows mild hepatosplenomegaly and mesentic lymphadenopathy with diffuse thickening of ileum. She has been on antibiotics in her IV and pain killers. Her condition has not changed in the past five or six hours. They are speaking about laproscopic surgery in eight or ten hours. The also have said they suspect appendicitis . Can you explain what might be going on please?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing in HCM. The CT findings point towards a chronic infection. Thickening of the ileum associated with abdominal pain is usually due to chronic infections such as TB or Crohn's disease.However in India TB is more common. If the appendix is not seen on Ct it would be futile to remove the appendix. A good trial of conservative treatment accomapanied by a proper reassesment will help rule out appendictis.

Don't drink any alcohol and visit your primary care physician or emergency department as soon as possible. If you have known liver issues from the past, then these elevated liver enzymes reflect that your liver is starting to fail, and you might need a liver transplant evaluation."},{"Patient":"I have been suffering from Congestive Heart Failure for 3 1/2 years.

You probably have had the virus for much longer than 2009. You should be seen at a transplant center for evaluation and consideration for liver transplantation, since you won't be a candidate for hepatitis C treatment with all these problems (the antiviral therapy could precipitate acute liver failure in your case). You need to be on diuretics (such as furosemide plus aldactone) for your fluid overload. You should be on lactulose or rifaximin for your encephalopathy. You should get an upper endoscopy to check if you have esophageal varices. You should get a liver ultrasound or CT scan to check for liver cancer.

Atrial fibrillation means irregular contractions of the heart. Due to irregular contractions of the heart, clots tend to form in the heart which may later go towards the brain and other organs leading to stroke. Hence such patients are kept on blood thinners which prevent the clots from forming. These clots when they migrate to the brain can cause falls. Also since the heart rate is irregular, the heart may not receive blood supply for short intervals which can also lead to falls. As you said he has stopped hid blood thinner medications, this may be due to formation of clots. Cramping in the legs is less likely due to clots or blood thinners, but some heart patients are on diuretic medications like lasix which can cause electrolyte imbalance and result in cramps. Kidney problems can also lead to electrolyte imbalance and cramps.Calcium deficiency, Vit D deficiency are also important causes of cramps. Please do an ECG, serum electrolyte levels, serum calcium, Vit D ad 2 D Echo. Brain imaging  (MRI + MRA) and carotid (neck artery) doppler should also be done to rule out narrowing of the vessels of the neck and the head which may cause falls.Wishing you good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"I have been to the ER 2x this week due to violent nausea spells lasting aprox 2 hours prior to going in I have a long health history and have had over 30 surgeries they have discovered cysts on my ovaries during the recent pain spells but the last 2 visits a 16mm gallstone was discovered just at wits end I am going to the mayo clinic to see my previous surgeons on Monday 24th is it wise to wait what can I do to control the pain until then...so confused and scared","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing in.

However, now my LFT test was not very positive and I am having mild swelling on the liver . I would like to know whether continuos medication will have any major impact on my body?","Doctor":"Hi nikhilkalantri.ca, Taking medications for Ulcerative Colitis should not have a major impact on your body. It is actually very beneficial to keep your colitis under control, even if you have to take those medications for the rest of your life. The LFTs being elevated however is concerning. You may want to discuss with your doctor regarding further evaluation, since Ulcerative Colitis is associated with a liver disease called \\"PSC\\" or Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis, which if it's advanced you can end up with a liver transplant. Also, Azoran can cause an elevation of liver enzymes if your blood levels of the medication are too high. I don't mean to scare you, as there are many other causes for elevated liver enzymes, but you should definitely follow up on the liver enzymes ASAP. You may need a dose adjustment of your Azoran. The only way to certainly diagnose if you have PSC is with a liver biopsy, but again I would recommend you checking with a liver specialist or gastroenterologist."},{"Patient":"My husband recently had an incident of diarrhea for a week.

However let me tell you that every time I see elevated potassium together with elevated liver enzymes in a generally healthy person makes me think of a \\"hemolyzed\\" blood sample, meaning that the blood sample is not good, since the red blood cells have been broken down giving a wrong laboratory result.

The liver is only functioning to a minimal degree. One of the indications that the liver is failing is acumulation of fluid inside the belly, this is called \\"ascites\\". There are other problems associated with cirrhosis (confusion which is called \\"encephalopathy\\", esophageal varices which are blood vessels in the esophagus that can burst and bleed out, liver cancer..).Liver transplant is definitely a good option. The survival after a liver transplant is about 85-90% at 5 years after liver transplantation and depends on the experience of the center, the reason why he is getting transplant (hepatitis C patients do slightly worse than the rest), the quality of the care post-transplant. To qualify for a transplant the doctors will calculate a score based on some of his labs, which is called the \\"MELD\\" score (a high score above >15 is really bad, and a low score is good By the way the cost of a liver transplant varies from country/city.

Common causes of liver enzyme abnormality include (but not limited to): alcohol, fatty liver, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, certain medications, stones in the biliary tree, autoimmune liver disease.

You are already physically active and your weight is quite good (Body mass index at 25 which is just at the upper limit of normal), but a good diet and exercise is always recommended.

Unfortunately if the liver tumor is too large, there is not much to do to prolong her life. So everything depends on the size of the tumor, the number of tumors, if it is invading other organs or vessels, and if it is a primary liver tumor or if it is a metastasis from another organ. Bilirrubin is inevitably going to go up as the liver gets invaded by the tumor. This will cause liver failure, and ultimately death.

In some cases patients however recover spontaneously without treatment. Till date there is no vaccine available for  hepatitis c . It is only in the process of  research. It is very important to check for co-infection with Hepatitis B and HIV . You do have to follow up with HCV PCR especially six months after completion of treatment.

To do surgery just based on these results, you would need to have a function (or ejection fraction) of the gallbladder below 35% AFTER the injection of cholecystokinin.

There are umpteen number of causes of jaundice. The first step is to have a complete liver function test done. Based on LFT report further tests may have to be done to see whether the jaundice is due to hepatitis or obstruction to bile flow. Only after knowing the cause one can tell when you will recover from jaundice. Viral infection is the most common cause and complete recovery can be expected in 4-8 weeks. If it is due to obstruction ( for eg by a stone), removal of the stone will provide rapid relief. So the first step is to find the cause of jaundice."},{"Patient":"my brother is an alcaholic who has not had a drink for 4 months he has been really well for a while but has been readmitted to hospital again , he is really confused and seems to be going back in time, he is talking about things that happened years ago, is this a result of his liver damage and is this permanent or can he recover from this.","Doctor":"hi james, i feel your brother has liver problem but to make sure please consult the doctor for routine tests for liver damage like Ultra sound abdomen,liver function tests . if these tests are suggestive of chronic liver disesase, i am afraid it is not reversible.if your brother does not have jaundice,abdominal distension then he requires neurologist opinion.all this confusion can be avoided with above tests that advised. hoping for the best outcome,bye"},{"Patient":"Good afternoon Doc. !

Instead, there is a gradual transition of increasing liver injury as the quantity increases. According to  studies those who drink more than 200 ml for >10 years have 40%chance of developing cirrhosis. Obesity, high cholesterol level,Pre diabetes or diabetes are other non alcoholic causes some other are Medications,Viral hepatitis,Autoimmune or inherited liver disease,Rapid weight loss,Malnutrition. Alcohol is metabolized in liver mainly small amount in kidney and stomach. Fatty liver is due to reduced fatty acid oxidation. So avoid or stop alcohol,your gas problem also may related to this as it can cause peptic ulcer disease or Non ulcer dyspepsia. Take healty life style regular exercise, drink lot of water. Consume fresh fruits and regular breakfast,lunch and dinner at proper time with a walk after dinner for 30 min shuld help you lot You can consult physician or a Gastroenterologist in this regard if problem persist.

Welcome to healthcaremagic.com.  There are many causes of epigastric pain, but due to your symptoms, which appear to be similar to gallbladder-related pain, I am going to take this answer in that direction.  If you had your gallbladder removed due to gallstones, there may be a retained gallstone that can cause symptoms that make you think you have a gallbladder again.  This would be the first route that I would investigate if you were walking into my office with this complaint.  I would advise that you need to talk to your physician and both of you need to decide further steps to be taken. I want you to keep a journal of the foods eaten, the time of the attack related to food intake, record any foods that seem to make the attacks worse, and make note of any other associated symptoms like heartburn or diarrhea.  Take this journal with you to your physician when you see them.  I hope that this helps.

Please advise what could be the reason and how to lower the amylase levels? My ultra sound also shows multiple fibroids.","Doctor":"Hello, sujathareddy4ever, Isolated elevation of Serum Amylase with all the rest of the liver tests being normal suggests that your pancreas may not be the cause of elevation. If you are not having any symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever etc. it is unlikely that you have acute pancreatitis which is an inflammation of the pancreas which produces insulin and also digestive enzymes. During the very phases of this condition, serum amylase will be elevated and subsequently serum lipase would also go up. Causes of pancreatitis, here in western culture, alcohol and gallstones predominate. Viral and other causes account for the rest. Amylase is also produced in the salivary gland. For example, if someone has \\"Mumps\\" their amylase levels could be elevated. There is a special test called fractionation of amylase that can show where it is coming from. Kidneys are also a source. I don't believe the fibroids have anything to do with this and finally a minor elevation could be perfectly normal for you.

First, surgery should be considered if there are gallstones along with the polyp - since this increases the risk of cancer. If gallstones are not found, polyps larger than 10mm should have surgery performed.  Smaller than 10mm should have close ultrasound followup.  Repeat ultrasound in 3-6 months, then yearly afterwards can be considered. Since in your case the size of polyp is bigger than 10 mm,you may opt for gall bladder removal. Consult your doctor for the final opinion.

Due to lack of exercise, the heart is not accustomed to it, hence heart rate increases rapidly when you exercise. Once you do it regularly, the heart rate will start getting under control and your treadmill will not lower its speed automatically. Continue taking bisoprolol.

So they scheduled an HIDA scan, That showed that my gallbladder is working at about 60% and that there is stones. Know they want me to have a camera down my throat to look at my stomach for an ucler!

You need to visit the surgeon who will advise you appropriately.If this is a mild case of uncomplicated calculous cholecystitis, treatment requires oral antibiotics ( eg. levofloxacin and metronidazole) and analgesics( oxycodone acetaminophen  combination). If severe abdominal pain, vomiting , fever you might have to get admitted and be given IV fluids etc. The ultimate treatment of complicated cholecystitis is removal of the gall bladder(cholecystectomy) You also need to get some blood tests done like complete blood picture and liver function test.

HIDA scan, in this case, was performed to differentiate between the two conditions : neonatal hepatitis and extra-hepatic biliary obstruction(EHBA). Neonatal hepatitis doesn't require surgery, while the other requires surgery. If HIDA shows tracer excretion into the intestines, it rules out EHBA. On the contrary, if it doesn't show tracer activity in the intestine, it can be because of both the conditions. UDCA (Udiliv) is thought to liquify the bile secreted and improve the drainage in to the intestines. It is used both as treatment and also before HIDA scan (atleast 5 days before HIDA scan) to improve the clearance of bile into the intestines. If HIDA scan showed tracer activity into the intestines, you can continue giving UDILIV. LFTs are deranged because there is damage to the liver cells because of inflammation."},{"Patient":"hi,may my god bless you i want to cunsult with you about my mother.she is 40 years old.recently an operation of stone in the gall bladder has done with her.now the problem is she is suffering from hardness in breathing too much. suffocation is with that.she has been so weak for a few months . so what can i do for her. pls let me know","Doctor":"Hello,mashuq muhammad, I hope everything went well with gallbladder surgery.

If your gallbladder was removed surgically, this can be a cause of diarrhea. There are so many other things that can cause diarrhea, including things in your diet that you can't digest well anymore (example: dairy products). Gluten intolerance. Parasites (diagnosed by stool samples). There is an entity called Microscopic colitis, which can only be diagnosed by biopsies of the colon - make sure your gastroenterologist took random biopsies of the colon.

You have chronic inactive hepatitis B (that is if you have normal liver enzymes as well). The guidelines state that there is no treatment necessary with such low viral load (anything <2000), if liver enzymes normal and no evidence of cirrhosis. However keep in mind that hepatitis B virus is carcinogenic, and increases your chances of liver cancer exponentially. I do know of some agressive liver doctors that treat Hepatitis B no matter what, and there are many treatment options. These include interferon (an injection given weekly, with A LOT of side effects), then Tenofovir or Entecavir (which are pills, it's taken once a day, minimal side effects). In your case with only 20 iu/ml, I would probably just watch you, as you might become negative in the future (chances are about 1-2% per year). You can't donate blood, and your sexual partner should be vaccinated against hepatitis B if he/she negative."},{"Patient":"HELLO SIR I AM 26 YEARS OLD.

And unless you have a genetic liver disease such as Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, etc or a viral hepatitis that you got when your were born transmitted from you mother, I would NOT expect that you have any symptom at such a young age. Even if you drink everyday! The other option is an \\"acute hepatitis\\" (either hepatitis A,B or more rarely acute hepatitis C and beyond), however besides feeling sick, you would turn yellow, specially your eyes (jaundice).

I used to take ayurvedic medicines to cure gastric but problems increased, Then before 2months i got to know there is increasement in s bilurubin(1.5) and sgot . I was feeling severe weakness even i couldn t walk properly, too much pain on right side of stomuch,not able to eat anything and too much itchiness. first of all, i consulted with alopath doctor but even after 20days problems increased then i consulted to an ayurvedic doctor, he gave me kutki medicine capsules which i needed to take twice daily. i used to take mosambi juice also from one and half months. i could see very little improvement like now i can take some food, liver pain is less, little bit improvement from weakness. currently, my weight is reduced to 43kg. Is this improvement fine or i should do anything else?","Doctor":"Hello, shakti.mntri, You are a young lady and you should be enjoying life at your age. Sudden loss of appetite can happen due to stress or depression due to something that might have happened whether it is work or relationship or loss of someone close to you. You say there is pain on the right side of the stomach.If the pain comes after eating and followed by vomiting , problem could be an ulcer in the stomach or if you have lost considerable weight in a short time, have to think gallstones also. You need to have a sonogram of the abdomen to rule out gallstones and an upper GI X-ray series to look at the stomach. Mild elevation of liver enzyme and very little elevation of Bilirubin are not very serious. I also hope that you were not trying to lose weight and avoid eating. Wish you well."},{"Patient":"I am having indirect bilurubin high that direct Indirect=1.5 Direct is 1.0 and total is 2.5 . I have lose my weight and now i am on ayurveda medicine .

It is often seen with what is known as Gilbert's syndrome which is a mild birth disorder without any serious or long term consequences. with this disease there is often fluctuation of bilirubin which is often normal.

My GGT is 208, AST 74 and ALT 84. The doc said this was due to my excessive alcohol use (8 drinks most nights or more for a few years) and I was told to stop drinking and to retest in 2 weeks. My question is are my elevated levels indicitive of permanant liver damage or can I expect them to drop once I quit drinking?","Doctor":"Hi, Your doctor is right. Because of continued alcohol intake your liver has developed early inflammation. There are various stages of alcoholic liver damage- the earliest is alcoholic fatty liver - then alcoholic hepatitis and finally cirrhosis of liver. With raised AST and ALT you have started to develop alcoholic hepatitis. continued abstinence from alcohol can reverse some of the damage caused to the liver. Also drugs like ursodeoxycholic acid can reverse some liver inflammation. You need not retest so early- you can have a repeat LFT after 3 months of abstinence.  Also there are some other drugs that are advised in alcoholic hepatitis - your doctor with calculate what is known as a Discriminant fraction and would advise you for the same. I would also advise you to undergo Fibroscan- a  non invasive test that would test the stiffness of the liver and can estimate how much permanent damage that has already happened to the liver. Hope this helps Regards Dr. Om"},{"Patient":"Hi there. I had a cholystectemy back in March and as of 4-5 days ago the same pain I had prior to surgery has resurfaced.

The symptoms are right quadrant pain,nausea,vomiting,bloating etc. In 50% cases the cause is biliary and due to remaining stone,choledococyst etc while in remaining 50% cases,it is due to non biliary causes. You must consult your surgeon and get yourself evaluated. Your temperature is due to residual viral infection and shall be all right soon. For PCOS you must take METFORMIN 500 mg twice a day to reduce your insulin resistance and must start a regular exercises schedule to reduce your weight. Get yourself tested for hypothyroidism.

Hepatitis C is virus that effects the liver and causes chronic liver damage that can leads to cirrhosis and even cancer of the liver.  Hence it is very important to treat HCV. However HCV treatment is expensive and requires regular monitoring. Without taking treatment of HCV only 10% of patient have spontaneous clearance of the virus that means most patients require to be treated with medications. Genotype 3 carries a relatively good prognosis and hence treatment is possible and effective. If we begin treatment for HCV you need to do the following: 1. HCV RNA quantitative assay 2. Liver biopsy to see the stage of liver damage - if you are not willing for a biopsy you can go for a newer non invasive technique called FIBROSCAN. Based on the above reports we can start you on treatment for HCV with Peg interferon and ribavrain. after starting the medications you need to recheck the HCV RNA levels at 4, 12 and 24 wks of therapy and 24 wks after therapy is completed. the treatment is generally for 24 wks depending on the response."},{"Patient":"Hello... I am taking a low dose of Crestor 5mgs . My doctor told me that it was not necessary to have liver function or other blood tests every 6 months as long as I don t have any symptoms of adverse reactions( which I don t). Is that ok? I was always under the impression that these semi- annual blood tests were necessary , thanks.","Doctor":"Hi mutzel, Welcome to healthcaremagic.com Currently experts believe that liver injury due to statins is not as serious as it was thought to be earlier.  A dose-related rise in serum aminotransferase levels develops in 1% to 3% of people who take statins (Crestor is Rosuastatin- a statin). A minor (less than two-fold normal) rise in the serum ALT and AST levels (without symptoms) is the most common manifestation of liver injury with these compounds. These elevations usually reverse rapidly with discontinuation of the statin and also reverse if therapy is not interrupted. The US Food and Drug Administration labeling information includes liver function testing before and at 12 weeks following the initiation of statins, and at any elevation of dose and periodically thereafter. This recommendation is based upon expert opinion, and many authorities do not feel that routine monitoring of liver function is necessary except to identify and then monitor patients with preexisting liver disease or who are receiving concomitant medications with a potential for drug interactions. Hence the opinion on this is divided. However most patients in my clinical experience have very little liver effect because of statins and hence my opinion is that going for repeated testing of liver function is not required."},{"Patient":"I was just diagnosed with fibromyalgia .

My question is that I have read that Ursodesoxycholic Acid is beneficial only in PBC or in removing Gall Stones. My gall bladder has been removed 8 years ago. So why did he prescribe Udihep 300 ?? Can this medicine damage my Liver further? Should i stop it or continue it ? If continue, for how long ??","Doctor":"Hi Divir, welcome to healthcaremagic.com Your question is \\"Does udihep help in your case ?\\" .  Basically you liver produces bile salts which are normally removed through the bile duct into the intestine. They help in digestion of fat. The bile salts when they reach the intestine may change in form, some of them get reabsorbed into the circulation. Some bile salts are bad and can cause damage to the liver when reabsorbed. Udihep is basically good bile salts which replaces the bad bile salts and prevents further damage to liver. In case of gall stone disease it helps in dissolving the cholestrol rich stones formed. So in summary, Udihep does help in alcoholic liver disease also. Though the benfits of udihep are not as roubust as in other conditions, they will help on a long run and certainly causes no harm. Apart from that if you alkaline phosphatase is high we need to get done an ultrasound of abdomen just to  rule out any stasis of bile or any stone in the bile duct. Please get an ultrasound done and revert back.

Thanks for  using this forum. As per your description this seems to be what is called Cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder wall. The treating doctor is right in prescribing antibiotics with Udliv tablets, which will help in curbing down the infection. Yes, at a later stage when the infection has been treated or if it still persists despite the conservative treatment, surgery would be the best option to remove the gall bladder. There fore Udliv can be given. Hope this helps. Regards."},{"Patient":"HI, my son is 21 years old and is in the small town of Sitka Alaska. We have no health insurance. he has been into emergency 3 times in 3 weeks with severe stomach pain. He has been vomiting blood . Doctors dont know whats wrong in this small town. just had ultra sound yesterday and now they say his galblader is inflamed and needs to be removed. My brother is a registerest nurse in Belvue Wa. He said another possibility is radiation posioning. my son has been scuba diving, finding thing wahed up from japan. I am very worried, what do u think?","Doctor":"Hello As far as the symptoms of inflamed gallbladder are concerned, as per my opinion it doesnot present with blood vomiting. As you did mention that he has been scuba diving, there is a chance that it has something to do with that also. As far as going in for surgery is concerned, i dont think its an emergency situation as far as inflamed gallbladder is concerned which can also be treated conservatively. Advise would be to get complete blood profile done and if possible to get an upper gastroscopy to rule out any pathology within the upper gastrointestinal tract.

It is very important to find the source tumor (of course it this is really metastatic tumors). Regarding the symptoms and age of your mother it could be an ovarian or a large intestine cancer, but it can be also something else (not cancer as well). The CT should tell about the localization. Thus tumors as well as the main tumor can be treatable but it depends on localization and a stage of disease.

Last year my echo show that now mitral valve is thick and fibrosed valve leaflet and I have moderate mitral stensis 1.58 cm2 with calcified tip. Along with this Aortic calve is also trileaflet, thickend and fbrosed with (moderate leakage) having Lt, Atrium dimension 35 mm and LA-Aorta (1.6).Left atrium dilated and left artrial overloaded. wall motion is normal and ejection fraction is 60 percent,.Sir here one doctor say that i have moderate heart failure and i need both valve replacement in near future, another says I can wait for few years.Now a days I am feeling palpitaion daily.I am taking 25 mg metopropal, dytor plus 10. how much time I can wait for valve replacement? both valve can be replaced at once?wtah would be the cost?and wahts is the expexted life expectancy after valve replacement? thanks","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for posting here. I have gone through your description. Your mitral valve area of 1.5 8cm2 is classified as moderate. patients with Moderate MS with symptoms should undergo a valve replacement. your symptoms are only palpitations. You must get an EKG done to see whether you have irrgeular heart beats called atrial fibrillation which is common in mitral stenosis. Treatment for atrial fibrillation can be given if required. Aortic valve also has moderate leakage so surgery not adviced at this point. Your LA size and aorta size are normal so again no indication for surgery. I suggest you be on lanoxin, diuretic tablets and other medications at present. Yearly 2d echo must be done to see the valve stenosis and to evaluate ejection fraction. You MAY require surgery at some point of time.But heart surgery is to be done only when its the right time and not as a preventive thing. Yes both the valves can be changed during the same surgery. I do not know about the cost of two valve replacement abroad, in INDIA it is about 3-5 lacs depends on where you are doing it. The life expectancy after a successful valve replacement is more than 20 years, but it has to be done at the hands of a good surgeon, so please dont compromise on the cost.

But depends a lot of other factors also. Like your activity, mental stress at that time. Also one high reading of blood pressure is not diagnosed as high blood pressure or hypertension. For a diagnosis of hypertension to be established, there must be atleast three high readings one week apart. If all readings are consistently high, then you need to be started on blood pressure medications.

In this case as we are not sure if the child has swallowed the medicine fully[part of it may be on the floor where it was spilled] Even if the child has consumed full 15 ml it will not cause any liver damage.

Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi. Had report regarding liver test. It says...Smooth outlines with diffuse fatty infiltrations. Irregular necrotic caseating focal lession is seen involving the medial segment of the left hepatic. No dilated ihbrs.

Was heavily over-weight and topped the scale at 123 kg but has lost it in a matter of 6-7 months. Has consistently kept the weight off for 3 consecutive years. Continues to eat healthy. Is a virgin . Has never smoked, used drugs or/and alcohol. Is tattoo free. Is on anti-depressants such as: Zoloft 50 mg (against depression), Risperdal 1 mg (anti-psychotic) Lyrica 150 mg, ( mood stabilizer ), Levaxin 50 mg, (thyroid) and last but not least, Sobril 5-10 mg (tranquilizer). Was diagnosed with Hep C 2-3 years ago. A biopsy test later revealed that she has cirrhosis too. Her blood work is positive and the blood flow is very good. Her liver function is almost like a normal person s. A “fibros examination” determined that the level of the virus is at 12,9 where as some people have 70. She has no liver pains but does have joint and flu- like symptoms. Because of her mental state her psychologist and gastric & hep doctor has warned her that the treatment is very emotionally and physically taxing. Some patients with the same disease have taken their lives. Also she has undergone a examination where a camera was placed in her throat and down to her stomach to check for any changes or any detection of cancer. It showed no changes or cancer. Same thing with ultrasound. Is afraid to take treatment and the doctors feel at this time that she should wait. My question(s) now are the fallowing: 1: What is the best plan of action, what can be done to eliminate the chance of developing cancer and liver failure , and also in some severe case, death? 2: Are there any new studies concerning treatment, some breakthrough remedies? 3: What happens if one does not choose to take treatment? 4: What happens if one cannot fulfill treatment? 5: Is there anything I can personally do to manage the virus?","Doctor":"Hi, Well the patient is in a condition where medical help is must. things are worsening probably because she is down with spirits. Something bad must have happened to her and on which she is dwelling from long. The depressed spirits are discouraging her day by day. In my opinion along with the current treatment, which of course is must to preserve the vital organs and functions of the body, you shall take the help of some Psychoanalyst. Once she will start taking interest in her daily schedule she will start improving and all the existing medical problems will start improving gradually. Morale and confidence are very essential for an healthy existence so we need to work on it. The only way is to make her speak with all her feelings and expressions. In nutshell kindly carry on with the treatment we should not leave hope and consult a psychoanalyst for the state of mind. Wish you health and prosperity"},{"Patient":"hello I m Bappi Kumer Das , I have A poor Family, I m 27 years old unmarried. I have Any Bad Habit. I work A comuter Furm Post of Normal servent.

A dose-related rise in serum aminotransferase levels develops in 1% to 3% of people who take statins. A minor (less than two-fold normal) rise in the serum ALT and AST levels (without symptoms) is the most common manifestation of liver injury with these compounds. These elevations usually reverse rapidly with discontinuation of the statin and also reverse if therapy is not interrupted. If your father had normal LFT before starting statins and have increased now - statins could be the cause, however they donot cause serious liver problems. apart from statins, there is a risk of your father having NASH (non alcoholic steatohepatitis). I would advise you to get an ultrasound done. If your father doesnt require statins necessarily you can stop it, if not you can continue them and repeat the LFT after 3 months. If the enzymes are increasing then you need to stop the drug, else you can continue."},{"Patient":"Hallo Doctor, My age is 31 and as per my US Scan Whole Abdomen Report, My utreus is retroverted and measures 9.8*5.6*4.8cm, myometrial echopattern normal.

I am from india my 3 year old son is suffered from jaundice . Last Saturday 14 July he suffered from fever I gave him paracitamol 125mg syrup after three days fever had gone on Friday 20 July I noticed that he passes dark yellowish color urine I take the sample of urine for lab. The test shows Bilirubin 357 points I go through rapid malaria test it comes negative result What treatment you suggest for him? What precaution should be taken? Which diet is good during the period?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for using the HCM. I am happy to address your questions, jaundice is a symptom of many medical problems but it is most often associated with conditions of the liver or the gallbladder. Jaundice causes yellow skin and eyes because of an excess amount of the bile pigment bilirubin in the fat layer under the skin. Either the body is producing too much, or it's not getting rid of it fast enough. The liver breaks down old, inefficient red blood cells in a process called hemolysis. This releases large amounts of bilirubin. Some causes of jaundice due to poor liver function include viral hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E can all cause temporary liver inflammation. Types B and C can also cause chronic, lifelong inflammation. Cause of jaundice due to obstruction (blockage) include gallstones formed in the gallbladder, other can be due to excessive red blood cell destruction as in malaria, the liver destroys red blood cells infected with the parasite.  If a fever or flu-like illness comes before jaundice, it's usually a sign of a viral hepatitis infection. Brown urine, common in hepatitis, is generally a sign of poor liver function or increased red blood cell destruction. The body is trying to get rid of excess bilirubin in the urine. Pale, white, or clay-coloured stool, on the other hand, is an indicator of obstruction in the gallbladder or bile ducts. Jaundice itself is unlikely to hurt you unless the bilirubin reaches very high concentrations. It is a sign, however, of an underlying problem. Would recommend you show  your child to a doctor if you think you have jaundice.  A blood sample will also be taken and checked for hepatitis virus antibodies, abnormal red blood cells, bilirubin levels, and various other substances that give clues about liver function. Your doctor may also order other tests such as an ultrasound to determine the cause of jaundice. There's no treatment for jaundice as such, since it's not a disease but a sign of a medical problem. The approach is to treat the underlying cause, if possible. Many, like hepatitis A, aren't curable but go away on their own. Usually treatment is unnecessary. Conditions like chronic hepatitis are lifelong problems that may cause permanent or recurring jaundice. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help. Thanks"},{"Patient":"i just had blood work,....was told my live enzymes were elevated,....the dr wants me to come back in a month,if they are still elevated,...he wants to do an ultrasound ,.....im a little nervous,....i take high blood pressure meds and ativan for anxiety and drink on occasion,...I was on vacation the week prior and drank more than usual,..can that be the reason they were elevated???","Doctor":"Alcohol intake does cause you liver enzymes to be elevated but there are other reasons too. Like viruses which attack the liver , some medications or simply being overweight can cause what is now known as NASH (non alcoholic steatohepatitis). You must get the ultrasound done , also you need to avoid alcohol and have you meds reviewed by your doctor. Also get viral markers- hep B and C done.

The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is from 7 to 56 units per liter of serum. AST (SGOT) is normally found in a variety of tissues including liver, heart, muscle, kidney, and brain. It is released into the serum when any one of these tissues is damaged.  The interpretation of elevated AST and ALT levels (which are not significantly high) also depends upon the entire clinical evaluation of an individual, and so it is best done by physicians experienced in evaluating liver disease and muscle disease. If there are no other symptoms hence he would have mentioned only on your elevated cholesterol which could be affecting your other organs, hence control on your cholesterol and a re-test after few months can be evaluated.

He is now 22, and we were told that before he started school, probably by the time he was 2, he would need a liver transplant. When he was 13 days old, they did a surgery called a Kasai procedure to buy him time. He has been hospitalized over 50 times since birth with infections of the liver, but IV antibiotics both in and out of the hospital plus a lot of prayer has allowed his liver functions to return to almost normal. Now that he is older and wants to be out on his own, but still lives with us, we try to allowing him to make his own decisions about his health, but the compliant boy while he was growing up is no longer. The many thing that has me concerned is that he takes his health in a way that would suggest that nobody is going to tell him what to do even if it does mean what he does will damage the liver more. He is totally addicted to snuff. We used to have fun watching tv together. He and I love the same kind of humor. Now, he is doing his own IVs and he is on them now, but very jaundiced and the other liver functions are not coming down as quickly as they used to. He knows he s not allowed to have the snuff around us, so he spends most of his time in his room and I know he must dip it there. I can t read his mind, but being his mom, I feel sure he must be thinking that he might as well enjoy what he wants because he might not live a full life span and he knows where he is going when he dies. He has tried to quit. He said he was going to quit for Mother s Day. LIke any addict s promises, that didn t happen and he says he won t be comfortable going to an addictions meeting at our church...and he just loves our Pastor. My question is this. Even though I know that the snuff will ultimately make his liver worse, would you say that right now the snuff could be weakening the effectiveness of the antibiotics and that s why it s taking him so much longer to get better. When he was little, after a few doses of antibiotics we could see him becoming less jaundiced before he even left the hospital.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to hcm. Snuff is a tobacco taken by nose. It is just a alternative of smoking. Though effects to lung are not present,the tar wil be absorbed in the body causing varied effects. There is little research on effects of snuff on systems of our body,it cannot be positively ruled out that it causes decreased response to antibiotics. If liver transplant was done,then your might have normal life span and he needs to be motivated to make his life more meaningful. I advice you to make him stop this habit as precaution is better than finding a cure. You can try again for de addiction centres as many addicts once shying away from these centres, wil like it when they feel they are accepted by its members.

The incidence of Hepatitis B has been quoted variously but World Health Organisation says India is neither high or low intermediate.

In general only those people whose HB e antigen is positive are likely to transmit the disease. If you are negative, be happy. I am treating several children born to Australia antigen positive mothers. What we do is we give these children gamma glouin as soon as they are delivered. Best way for your spouse is to check whether he has taken hepatitis B vaccine. If not let him take 3 doses in 3 months. In another 3 months time he will be protected. Then you can go for children. Being frank with the prospective spouse will be helpful.

Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Dear Ocoastalpost, Sorry to hear that you are experiencing problems even after successful gallbladder removal surgery. There are some possible explanations for your recurrent pain in that area. Most common one is , you may have some scarring or adheshions around the area of the gallbladder. This can cause some pulling or pinching sensation. If you had multiple stones in your gallbladder , once in a while a smaal stone can be retained in the channel that carries the bile into the intestine causing problems. In such cases , pain could be persistent and may be associated with nausea or vomiting or even yellow jaundice. I don't believe you have this. With time it should improve.

Ideally you should undergo surgery to remove gall bladder. Gall bladder dysfunctioning causes gall stones to form. And even though gall stone may be removed once, the diseased gall bladder is still present in body, which may cause new gall stones to form.

Binge drinking does do as much or more damage to your liver . Initially you will develop a condition called \\"Fatty Liver \\" which will cause your liver enzymes to be abnormal . Also, alcoholic hepatitis can occur. Your weight needs to come down by at least another 20 lbs. Beer can make you retain fluids and add to the wight. If you want to stay healthy and qualify for insurance, I suggest you quit drinking beer altogether for at least 2-3 months. Drinking 1-2 beers a day or having a glass of red wine will be O.K. if your liver is not already damaged. Good diet of proteins, fresh fruits and vegetables and adequate fliuid intake is advisable. There are no reliable home tests for liver function.

SGOT value of 170 is definitely significant and with SGPT in the range of 24, SGOT/SGPT ration seems to be very high.

Warm Regards, Pradeep","Doctor":"Dear Pradeep, The level of Bilirubin and enzymes do indicate that there is some form of inflammation in the liver. It is possible that someone can have Hepatitis due to viral causes and not have severe symptoms and when it begins to heal you may still show some changes in the blood tests. However , other things that could affect the liver include alcohol, even some prescription medications (Even over the counter ), Gallbladder problems etc. Sonogram will show if you have stones in the gallbladder. You do need complete screening for Hepatitis A & B. It does not appear to be serious. Good luck."},{"Patient":"My wife have fatty liver .. last month she diagnosed Hep C ... some alregic medcine doctor advised stop all the medcine until alergic gone.. so she not taken any medcine for last month.. before last month SGOT/ SGPT is 89/98... but now it is 250/220.. what was the reason how increased this levels... please advice","Doctor":"Dear Rajesh, Your wife is diagnosed to have Hepatitis C with probably high viral load. In that case gastro-enterolgist gives treatment to control multiplication of Hepatitis C virus in body.

The rising level of SGOT/SGPT may be due to active multiplication of virus in body, is another reason to consult gastroenterologist to start appropriate treatment of hepatitis C virus.

The first occurs following a meal or after maneuvers that cause the muscle of the gallbladder to contract, for example, ingestion of fat or injection intravenously of the hormone that is responsible for causing the gallbladder to contract. In either case, the gallbladder empties, becomes smaller, and is said to be contracted. This is the normal situation. The second situation is when the gallbladder is diseased, specifically when there has been inflammation, for example, due to gallstones, that has resulted in scarring of the gallbladder. Scarring causes the gallbladder to become smaller, for example, contracted, and the gallbladder no longer functions normally. The \\"contraction\\" in the latter situation is clearly different from the \\"contraction\\" in the first. Is she having any symptoms now ? If no I would recommend wait for some time reevaluate her and then decide for surgery?

Thanks a lot","Doctor":"Dear Suganda, It seems that your mother is either overweight  or obese that may be the reason to loose weight. Long standing overweight or obesity leads to deposition (storage) of excess fat in liver. So fatty liver is a very common finding when obese person gets sonography, even he/she is asymptomatic. This excess fat in liver causes liver damage if it remains in liver for very long time. At this time person usually complains of easy fatigibility, less desire to eat, mild upper abdominal discomfort and liver specific blood test showed some sort of liver damage in form of elevated liver enzymes (SGOT/SGPT). In your mother's case, this is a warning sign that now weight loss should be sincerely considered and to be maintained for forever.

Secondly the endotracheal tube that might have been introduced through your throat for general anaesthesia could have caused some irritation and caused a little bleed. bronchitis in itself can cause a small amount of hemoptysis. Surgery in general is very unlikely to have caused you this symptom. Either way it is not ideal to ignore any blood in sputum You should be seen by a chest physician at the earliest to make sure everything is alright.

In obstructive jaundice, there may be blockage anywhere from liver to intestine in bile duct (bile flow tube).

It appears to be that your sister is habituated to consuming raw rice. This can be prevented by firstly avoiding raw rice lying around in the house. Give her cooked rice well flavoured so that she may forget about raw rice. She may try alternative like chewing gum or liquorice sticks as their consistency may engage her curiosity similar to the experience with raw rice. Usually gall bladder showing crystals indicate growth of possible gall bladder stones. Do get her blood tested for cholesterol. Rice does not show as crystal as it would be digested in the stomach by acids. If the technique does not work, kindly do approach a Psychiatrist and Behavior therapist who will be able to evaluate her and decide proper management of this problem. Regards,"},{"Patient":"HI !

Thanks for understanding and wish you all keep helping people like us on a daily basis. regrds Anand","Doctor":"Dear Anand! Many thanks for the query. I have gone through your mail in detail and could grasp the slaient points regarding your mother's illness. I understand that she has decompensated cryptogenic cirrhosis. Her tense ascites is troubling her and prevents her from lying on the bed comfortably and requires periodic removal of the fluid in the abdomen. TIPS is a good and acceptable procedure for intractable ascites and gives good comfort to the patient. this procedure should ideally be done in a center experienced in TIPS. There will be increased urination but there will not be any loss of protein  through the urine. Hypoproteinemia ( low protein in the blood) is essentially due to decreased production of proetin by the diseased liver. TIPS is not a life thretening procedure but can cause hepatic encephalopathy(altered sensorium / irrelevant actions and talk etc..) over a period of time and occassionally this TIPS stent can get blocked. You need to check with your hepatologist whether she is a candidate for an early liver transplantation. If so you can wait for a while before TIPS.

Please read the answer on assuming that the gall stone you have mentioned is in the gall bladder; in other words we are discussing about gallbladder stone. 1. If you do not have symptoms referable to the gallbladder stone which is of ~ 7 mm diameter, you need not hurriedly go in for surgery. You can monitor the course of the stone by serial ultrasound scans (once every 6 months for initial 2 years, followed by once a year). Decision to operate can be taken anytime if the need arises (e.g. continued dyspeptic symptoms like indigestion in the absence of acid reflux (proven on endoscopy) / attacks of acute infection / jaundice etc.). 2. If indication for surgery is clear-cut, then removal of the gall bladder is the operation of choice in today's time. 3. Only stones can't be removed leaving behind the gall bladder to avoid the recurrence of stone formation. 4. If the operation has gone well without complications, then usually there are no post-operative problems. 5. Medicines are available even in modern medical field to dissolve stones. However, these medicines can't be prescribed life-long due to their potential side effects. Moreover, +ve effect if any, reverts back after the medicine is discontinued.

The 'key investigation' for the diagnosis of both is ultrasound scan. 2. The disappearance of stones without having caused any symptoms (particularly severe pain) and spontaneous disappearance of polyps is unusual. 3.

It is found that less than 5 percent of people with hepatic cysts develop noticeable symptoms. When the cysts grows larger to about 7 cm, or if there is bleeding inside the cysts, then only they cause symptoms. Bleeding into the cysts is characterized by sudden pain in the upper right abdomen. Since liver cysts don't disturb the normal functioning of the body, there are no significant treatment methods. In case, the cysts are big enough (for example more than 3 cm), it is advisable to go for a follow-up abdominal imaging to check the growth of cysts. People go for treatment of liver cysts only after they experience discomfort symptoms that disturb their normal routine. Treatment for the same is done by aspiration and/or surgical removal of the cysts.To To conclude, no specific treatment is needed for asymptomatic liver cysts. However, one should be aware about the complications of liver cysts, such as infection, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and sclera), bleeding into cyst (causing pain) and disturbance of the flow of bile juice. If anybody suspects that he/she has liver cysts, it is recommended to consult and seek advice from a physician so as to get proper medical attention. Except for the mild discomfort cases, hepatic cysts do not pose risks for liver cancer and liver failure.

A person infected with Hepattis B and australia antigen positive may not be symptomatic and and aggresive treatment is not required except for having a healthy lifestyle. If symptomatic then treatment is accorded as per the symptoms and immunoglobulins are also used.

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM.:Good to hear that you are in good health. Your blood pressure reading of 150/70.Currently - in 2017 medical experts disagree on what is the best goal for Blood pressure control.Some recommend lowering blood pressure  to just less than 150/90 mmHg in adults aged 60 years and older without diabetes mellitus. You are in that age  group, and you did not mention having diabetes, so if your Blood pressure was just  slightly lower = 149/70 you would meet the goal.Other experts on hypertension in the elderly recommends that the blood pressure be reduced to less than 140/90 mmHg in adults aged 60-79 years and the systolic blood pressure to 140 to 145 mmHg if tolerated in adults aged 80 years and older.Your age group fall in the 140/90 mm Hg goal under these recommendations.You are already taking a medication for your BP - lisinopril at 10 mg. You only provided one reading of your BP of 150/70. Depending on what other readings are, your doctor may decide to just keep you on the current dose, or to increase the dose of   lisinopril or even perhaps to add another medication to get your BP under better control - it depends on what recommendation your doctor is following.Patients are able to check their Blood pressures at home. There are a variety of BP machines available for home use which can be purchased in pharmacies.Your doctor also probably discussed with you so called lifestyle modifications, but I will also mention them here because they are important.Based on your height and weight I calculated your BMI = body mass index which is  29.65 which is elevated and means that you are overweight and would likely benefit from weight loss. (normal BMI is up to 25).Diet and exercise are known to bring both weight and BP down, so this would be strongly recommended for you, and may avoid the need to increase your dose of lisinopril or add another BP medication.Your HR of 58 is slightly below normal - while normal range for HR is from 60-100 beats per minute, but in itself it is not a serious problem. Your doctor would look at your EKG - Electrocardiogram and this would give him some indication of what may be causing this slow HR. Sometimes the cause of a slow heart rate is not determined.Hope I answered your questions.If you need additional information I will clarify further.Regards and best of health.BMI:     29.65"},{"Patient":"I did something stupid last night, and I know it.

There are five main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. These five types are of greatest concern because of the burden of illness and death they cause and the potential for outbreaks and epidemic spread. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis B, C and D usually occur as a result of parenteral contact with infected body fluids.

Muddy sludge is a powder like material formed and seen in the gall bladder which eventually get hardened to form gall stones. Sludge is more dangerous than stones as this material can get into the bile duct and can cause jaundice and pancreatitis due to obstruction to passage of pancreatic secretions. Pain and abdominal discomfort are not common after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy after 2-3 days after surgery. Pain abdomen a week after surgery would suggest a retained stone in the common bile duct or some pancreatitis due to residual sludge in the CBD, gastritis, duodenal ulcer etc...

These changes are quite specific and characteristic and it is not likely that other medical conditions like indigestion would have produced them. Also, since these changes were seen on several different occasions, this makes an anteroseptal infarct  quite certain.After an infarct the damaged area of the heart muscle undergoes scarring and it may also result in thickening of that area as seen on the Echocardiogram.Some patients, especially diabetics, do not have symptoms like chest pain when they are having their heart attacks, so it is possible to just see the EKG changes of an \\"old MI\\" old myocarial infarction on an EKG while the patient does not even know that they had a heart attack.Typically an acute heart attack causes severe chest pain, Shortness of breath and makes one very ill and treatment in the hospital is required , where blood tests are done to confirm a diagnosis of so called acute MI.Hope this helps you understand this issue.Wishing you best of health."},{"Patient":"i have recently been diagnosed by gilbert s syndrome ... i have a bilirubin count of 2. i want to lower it down to standard range so as to clear my medcials for armed forces. please help...","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to HealthcareMagic forum.

It takes lots of abuse before it becomes too damaged to function. As long as you don't have any viral hepatitis or other liver diseases, your liver enzymes should return to within normal limits.

Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver caused due to viral infection.Since you have mentioned its Chronic, you need to take good care of your liver. As you have mentioned, it is very important to avoid any food that add more stress on your liver. Liver is the main organ that helps in metabolizing the body nutrients. Excessive fat can end up in storage of fat in the liver sometimes which can be fatal over period of time. Hence, as you are aware, cut down foods which contain fat. Also, include more fruits, vegetables and lot of fiber in your diet to provide enough resistance to your body. Alcohol/smoking should be completely stopped. Also, care should be taken to not gain weight and maintain blood sugar levels as people with hepatitis B tend to get diabetic slowly as one consumes more calories while avoiding fatty foods. A balanced meal with sufficient calories and low fat is important which is easily achievable through whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, pulses and low fat milk. Good luck to you !!!"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, I am having Autoimmune pancreatitis . I am under treatment now since 2 months.

For your faster relief, you may be prescribed low dose of Aspirin. Slight  impairment of vision, specially night vision and color blindness can persist. If your eye condition do not improve, you may have to undergo laser surgery for the eyes. Relapse of Autoimmune pancreatitis can occur in 20-30% cases, which may require prolonged course of corticosteroid. Chances of relapses are more if there is an involvement of extrahepatic or intrahepatic bile duct. One thing to remember is that in case you have to start again the steroid , your doctor must closely monitor the doses and  blood levels of the steroid, because it is directly related to your chances of CIS.

Welcome to HCM. You need to tell us the complete test reports- bilirubin - both direct and indirect, along with liver enzymes, hepatic viral markers, history of medicine/ drug/ alcohol use. With all these findings, probably a USG abdomen would also be needed. Depending on age,there can be many causes for jaundice and the final diagnosis requires minimum basic of the above mentioned investigations. An accurate diagnosis is the only thing by which a treatment can be suggested. So get these tests and visit a physician, who will also examine you for enlargement of liver and other signs of liver malfunction.

I can tell that his self esteem is very low and he has several acciedents daily.When born he had a premature liver and went home on a light with a home nurse comming daily for 2months. As I said he is eight do you have any positive suggestions that might help?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to Healthcare Magic forum. Your grandson is suffering from encopresis and hence may have related psychological problems like low self esteem which is commonly seen in about 20% of children with encopresis. Also,Encopresis can develop from a range of causes apart from medical reasons including simple phobia, poor toilet training experience, painful constipation experience, social immaturity, fear of getting older, as an attempt to regain/exert control etc. Untreated encopresis can pose several risks to a child's health: megacolon- enlarged colon, desensitisation of nerves and muscles, bleeding and cracking of the skin fissures, urinary tract infections and wetting accidents. The psychological concerns include: shame, guilt, loss of self esteem, social ostracism by peers, delayed social development, withdrawal, anxiety and hopelessness. Parents often also feel a range of emotions when their child has encopresis including feelings of embarrassment, and fears of incompetence as a parent. The most important thing needed for your grandson is accurate medical assessment. Once all possible medical avenues have been exhausted psychological causes and maintenance factors need to be explored. Generally, the earlier treatment begins for encopresis, the better. The first step in treatment focuses on clearing the colon of retained, impacted stool. After that, treatment includes encouraging healthy bowel movements. This includes training your child to go to the toilet as soon as reasonably able when the urge to defecate occurs. in cases of encopresis without constipation and simple toileting refusal psychological treatments are often very simple and effective. Psychological assessment will involve a detailed history of development, absences from parents, history of increasing independence, toilet training history and the child's general behaviour . Once the psychological assessment is complete it may be that toileting refusal is not the major concern, there maybe difficulties in the parent child relationship or frequently the child may have low self esteem and poor self confidence. Psychological treatments for encopresis generally tackle a number of areas of concern at once. They usually work on improving the parent child relationship, improving the child's self esteem including their sense of accomplishments and independence. So I would advice you to get your grandson first evaluated by a pediatric gastroenterologist to rule out any medical causes and complications and with his recommendation a psychotherapist can be consulted for appropriate psychotherapy. Please do not worry as with appropriate therapy your grandson can grow into a normal self esteemed individual. Wishing him a speedy recovery and good health forever.

It can cause liver inflammation (hepatitis) and enlargement of the spleen and in your case  due to poor appetite the child has lost weight,which he is likely to regain once he starts recuperating.In most cases of mononucleosis, no specific treatment is necessary.

At times, she also forgets things (doctor says mild hepatic encephalotpathy). What is the life expectancy of such a patient if her liver function tests show retrn to normalcy through some ayurvedic medicines?","Doctor":"Hi, Often the complication of liver cirrhosis is hepatic encephalopathy. It is due to biochemical abnormalities associated with liver failure. Hepatic encephalopathy [HE]is marked by an intractable cycle of relapse and remission, followed almost inevitably by relapse. Episodes of acute encephalopathy can be reversed; however, people with chronic liver disease are consistently susceptible to future relapse. If your grandmother is taking some ayurvedic medicine [I can not comment much as I am allopathic doctor], and if liver functions are returning to normal; may be it is a relapse. Approximately 80% (8 out of 10 patients) die if they go into a coma. Recovery and the risk of the condition returning vary from patient to patient. If you are able to control underlying liver disease, then prognosis is good; in terms HE will not return/progress. Take care.

My question is that I feel drowsy in general and it becomes very unbearable after lunch specially. What shall I do? What shall I eat? I am on fat free diet .","Doctor":"Hi, The liver is one of the most important organs of your body and also one of the most sensitive. That's why it takes more time than many other organs to recover. Drowsiness is common post-jaundice because the liver is still recovering from the virus and is not able to digest the food you eat optimally. A dysfunctioning liver manifests excess sleepiness and drowsiness as one of the symptoms. Continue with your fat-free diet, but don't let your liver get used to no fat. Continue with Liv 52 till your physician suggests and slowly restore yourself to a normal diet. You can try a simple home remedy. Have a teaspoonful of honey every night before you sleep. When you wake up in the morning, squeeze the juice of one lemon in lukewarm water and drink it. It will help your liver to recover faster."},{"Patient":"hello.... i am 26 years old .... hieght 5.9 ft, weight 102 kg . recently after three days fever i have tasted my sgpt and s. bilirubin ..... and the reports r ... sgpt - 1590.0 U/L and bilirubin - 3.0 mg/dl........... doctor sujjested me to take rest to decrease my bilirubin level .... how can i decrease my sgpt level soon ......

Nevertheless there are several things you can do to slow the disease and even reverse it. 1. Alcohol abstinence. It is proven in studies that liver biopsies show reversibility when abstinence from alcohol occur. 2. Weight loss. Weight loss as little as 7% of total body weight have shown to improve fatty liver. 3. Diet. Low rapidly absorbed carbohydrates (sugars, candy, etc.) and high protein diets help slow the disease. 4. Exercise. Exercising 20-30 minutes a day 5 times a week is recommended. You can do cardiovascular workup such as walking, running, swimming and cycling. 5. Treating underlying conditions. If you suffer from diabetes or high-cholesterol there are some medication that can control your sugar or cholesterol spikes, reducing the pace of the disease.

Hepatitis b is caused by the hepatitis b virus and is transmitted through sexual contact or during childbirth. It has two possible stages : the acute stage and the chronic stage. In the acute stage you have now become infected with the virus. Symptoms occur 1 to 4 months after contact with the virus. Chronic infection is infection lasting longer than 6 months. About 5 to 10 % of people may go on the have chronic infection. In chronic infection you can be a carrrier ( the virus is there but you do not have any symptoms although you can still transmit to other people) or you can have active disease which require medication. Some persons with chronic active disease can develop cirrhosis and blood test will help to identify this. Most persons with acute infection the infection resolves, acute hepatitis is not treated with any antiviral medication like the lamivudine you seem to have been given because it is expected to resolve on its own. In cases where the person is dehydrated  because of vomiting or diarhoea they may be given iv fluids or medication. Antiviral medication is given in some cases chronic hepatitis in persons with active hepatitis and those likely to progress to cirrhosis. They are given based on the liver function tests which would let your doctor know how well your liver is working and blood tests to see how much of the virus is in the blood. Anti viral medication stop the virus from multiplying, but not all persons given antivirals respond to them in the same way. You need to find out whether your doctor believes you have the acute or chronic infection"},{"Patient":"hi!i am having hepatitis B since 1994.Ten months back i started allopathic medicine Tenvir.After treatment my viral DNA & HBeAg are negative but HBsAg is still persisting.Two months back I also started LIV 52 Hb along with Tenvir but HBsAg is still positive.I am 43 yrs & having no general problem.My LFT remains normal.I take alcohol thrice a week.How to get rid of HBsAg.Due to TENVIR i am suffering from muscle & joint pains frequently.Should i stop Tenvir now & continue liv-52 Hb.Please advice me.I am worried now about liver cirrhosis etc.","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM Dear THE surface antigen remains positive for long periods , and if you keep on taking alcohol it will be very harmful for hepatic cells HBeAg [envelop antigen] may become  negative but you still have hepatitis virus in your blood , you did not write that what was your viral load prior and after treatment with tenvir you can take dry extract of Phyllanthus amarus [trade name Nirocil] in dose of 1 tab tid if you want to shun tenvir it has been proven with modern study that it has got anti viral activity and it chek the replication of viruses By Ayurveda it can be treated with very good results Aim of treatment in Hepatitis -B is two folds 1 neutralization of toxins secreted by viruses along with stoppage of viral replication 2- Regeneration of hepatocytes with herbs witch contains growth factors as well as anti-oxidant effects some of Ayurvedic herbs contains interferon which is strong viral inhibitors and there is not intolerance as compared to synthetic ones DR SHAILENDRA NAITHANI www.ayurvedadivine.com"},{"Patient":"yes and thank you, two weeks ago after Ultra sound and blood tests the Doctor here in Thailand came bacfk with the diagnosis of AAAAAAA liver disease .

Whats the main cause of it? What they ll do?","Doctor":"Hello. I suppose you wanted to ask about hernia operation. Hernia operations are done to repair the defect in the frontal wall of the abdomen as the hernia forms due to the weakness in the muscle layer wall of the abdomen. This weakness can be caused due to persistent inguinal duct in the inguinal canal, any previous surgeries, other underlying pathology within the abdomen which increases the intra abdominal pressure, defect in the correct formation of the muscle layers or due to underlying defect  in collagen production due to genetic defect. This procedure involves placing a mesh which will form and strengthen the abdominal wall. Hope this will clarify.
