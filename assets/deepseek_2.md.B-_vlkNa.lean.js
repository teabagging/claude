In a neurogenic bladder, there may be incomplete evacuation of bladder with residual urine after evacuation, which predisposes to recurrent UTIs. The first issue here is to treat the current infection, which can be done by using broad spectrum antibiotics. Second and more important issue to prevent UTIs from occurring in the future. This can be done by using antibiotics as prophylactic agents. In addition, clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC) may be taught to the patient, which can alleviate the problem of incomplete evacuation.I hope it helps.Best wishes,Dr Sudhir Kumar MD DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant Neurologist"},{"Patient":"After undergoing a C/T scan following a concussion, my doctor told me that they found an \\"additional finding.\\"  I either have a tumor hanging down from my pituitary gland or, as she thinks, a brain aneurysm.

Welcome to HCM! The path of facial nerve is long and complex,so there are many causes that may result in facial nerve paralysis.The most common is Bell's palsy, the exact cause is unknown most probably due to viral infection. Bell's palsy causes sudden weakness in your facial muscles. This makes half of your face appear to droop. Your smile is one-sided, and your eye on that side resists closing. Although for most people, Bell's palsy is temporary. Symptoms usually start to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery in about six months however as the symptoms are aggravating my advice is that you should get your wife examined by a neurologist. During the physical examination, a distinction will be made between paralysis and paresis (incomplete paralysis). paralysis is far more serious and requires immediate treatment. It must also be determined whether other nerves are involved in the motor defect or not.

If your have no worrisome symptoms right now, then it means you fully recovered.The most important thing to do right now is to get consulted.

I was diagnosed in 2004 (relapse/remit) and am considered relatively intelligent. There was a time, when II was around 25 or so that I became involved with a very controlling older man. To this very day, I don t know why I was so weak that he was able to control my life for about 6 years. Could that possibly be due to the dormant MS and the cognitive impairment, or other MS causation? Naïveté is also a possibility but during that time, there are many blank memories, which happens to me now as a diagnosed patient. This is a nagging question that you may or may not be able to answer, but at least I ve tried!","Doctor":"1.  probably your Axons [which are damaged in MS must not have been extensively injured during 2004, resulting in dormant MS], There is no way to predict, at the beginning, how an individual person’s disease will progress.[Because symptoms come and go in the majority of people with MS, the presence of symptoms is called an an exacerbation (relapse/remit)]2. As you are diagnosed now, probably the myelin sheath [which helps to speed nerve impulses] is damaged.3. because it is an Autoimmune disease thus secondary cause is very difficult to establish the cause of damaged myelin.4. because MS causes difficulty in making decisions, planning, or prioritizing at work or in private life, thus can be one of the cause of cognitive vulnerability.5. New research has revealed that: : people with MS can experience difficulty with thinking, learning, memory, and judgment. The first signs of what doctors call cognitive dysfunction may be subtle:i. The person may have problems finding the right word to say, or trouble remembering how to do routine tasks on the job or at home. ii. Day-to-day decisions that once came easily may now be made more slowly and show poor judgment. iii. Changes may be so small or happen so slowly that it takes a family member or friend to point them out.6. Many of your problems are best treated by neurologist who have advanced training in the treatment of MS and who can prescribe specific medications to treat the problems, and because of the risk of interactions between complimentary & alternative therapies, people with MS should discuss all the therapies they are using with their doctor, especially herbal supplements. Although herbal supplements are considered \\"natural,\\" they have biologically-active ingredients that could have harmful effects on their own or interact harmfully with other medications.."},{"Patient":"I'm in a bit of a shock and not having a good day with the new information I received today.

I have done some tens and other various therapy but no improvement as of yet. Please advise what you might recommend to correct my condition. Thank you Mark.","Doctor":"Hi MarkThank you for your question to HCM.Overuse related pain in the upper extremity joints is a common complaint and occurs as you need to put all your body weight on the arms during transfers. Try to exactly locate your pain whether it is coming from the joint itself or the attachment of the tendon or some other structure around the joint. An examination by an orthopaedic surgeon can help to find this out.Triceps tendinitis is one of the causes which is an irritation at the attachment of triceps tendon. This is caused by repeated heavy weight lifting which is the case when you transfer body weight frequently.To start with if the pain has lasted for long time an Xray of the elbow joint and if Xray is normal then MRI is recommended to find/rule out any structural cause. Ibuprofen, tramadol, local steroid injections and physical therapy will help keep pain under control till triceps tendinitis resolves if that's the cause as it is usually a self limiting condition.Hope this is helpful.

It would be helpful to know the findings in your recent MRI if you have had one. Revision spine surgery can be technically quite challenging due to scarring as you have had so many surgeries already. However surgery is not the only option. Here are your options1 Visiting a pain specialist so that a formal pain management protocol can be charted out. I am sure you might have visited the specialist in the past or already seeing one but since you don't want surgery (whether it is needed depends on imaging and correlation with your symptoms) this will be the mainstay of managing the pain.2 Epidural injections and selective nerve root blocks can be tried depending upon MRI picture but again will be challenging due to a lot of scarring.3 Medications like pregabalin and gabapentin help to keep nerve related pain under control.Hope this is helpful.

It is not clear from your description what 'L4 and L5 discs are growing together' means. Careful study of MRI images is needed to decide what type of surgery you need if at all surgery is needed.L1 and L2 discs are rarely symptomatic as compared to L4 and L5.If your complaints are of leg pain, heaviness, tingling, numbness or weakness you will need further intervention. Pain killer medications, physical therapy and bracing are the initial lines of treatment. Epidural injections and nerve specific medications will be helpful if pain is the only complaint. Decompression is the process of freeing nerves with removal of thickened ligaments, compressive part of disc and bone as necessary. Putting rods and screws and fusing the back is done for instability in the spine where the possibility is high that such instability would lead to recurrent problem. One of the examples of such instability is spondylolisthesis or slip of one vertebra on the other one. Detailed evaluation of imaging studies by a spine surgeon is advised.Hope this is helpful.

Still I would advise you to get her EEG done in order to rule out seizure discharge.Other rare possibility is dissociative disorder. Due to some mental tension or conflict some times dissociative symptoms are seen. Other possibility is some neurological complaint.

She has recently experienced a twisted colon which we belive may be from her body being bent over and twisted. She has informed me this evening that both arms have turned blue on the back of her arms, it started over a month ago with her right hand swelling. After seeing several physicians, a sports medicine doctor put a cortisone injection in her hand and fingers. That was 2 weeks ago - she said afterwards her right arm turn bruised on the back side of her arm and she went back to the Dr. who told her it was where the needle hit a vein and it was nothing to worry about.  Now her left arm is the same way - bruised on the back side - and has been this way several days. She also has experienced an increase in acid reflux at night and has began to spit up because of it.  IS it possible the bruising of her arms is poor circulation - or heart condition from being bent over and twisted? IS there any hope she can ever be better?","Doctor":"Hi Thank you for your question to HCM.Bruising in elderly individuals not related to trauma may either be a result of fragile soft tissues and blood vessels or blood disorders. Swelling of the hand may again be related to blood or blood vessel problems. From your description of her body being bent over and twisted I believe it is related sideways tilting and forward bending of her spine as a result of degeneration in the vertebral joints. This is unlikely to be the cause of twisted colon. Acid reflux may or may not be related to the bruises that is difficult to say without detailed clinical examination.I would suggest seeing a medical doctor to find out if there is a link between all these symptoms who can also seek help from hematologist if needed.Hope this is helpful.

Regards","Doctor":"HiThank you for your question to HCM.These findings indicate that the dimensions of the spinal canal have changes. The space available for the nerves has been compromised and that is leading to compression of the nerves.For my patients I always interpret the MRI findings in relation to clinical signs and symptoms. Specifically the stenosis you have mentioned can cause right leg pain on the back or front of thigh. It may also cause a feeling of pain/heaviness or numbness in legs particularly on standing or walking or even weakness of feet/toes in some cases. If this is the case the narrowing discs are the cause of symptoms. Pain medications like ibuprofen, meloxicam, tramadol and lifestyle modification as well as physical therapy are the first line of treatment. Epidural injections in spine can be done if pain does not respond to these. Pure back pain without any leg pain/tingling/numbness is unlikely to be caused by these findings in MRI.Hope this is helpful.

Doctor has advised strict bed rest.My question is whether this treatment is in order.  Second when he will be able to walk.  Whether any other medicine is to be given","Doctor":"HI and thank you so much for this query.I am so sorry to hear about the spinal TB that your father has and the resulting complication of being unable to move.From the information you have provided, this treatment plan is the classical treatment for tuberculosis. The truth is that they change from country to country according to national guidelines. Doctors simply apply the recommendations handed down to them in this case. This is exactly how I would have treated a similar patient in my clinic. This treatment would again be modified towards the end to a two regimen drug plan.The goal of treatment here is to stop the progression of the disease. Restoring most functions is always very difficult and in most cases not fully recovered. We can only hope that he regains some of his lost functions but the hopes on this are largely determined by how much damage the disease has caused already.I would have suggested that he gets pyridoxine tabletes as prophylaxis for isoniazide toxicity given his age. Check whether the doctor considered this as well. this is simply for the comfort during treatment and doesn't really change the outcome if no side effects results in abandonment of treatment.I hope this addresses your query fully. If you have any further questions, please feel free to come back to us. ThanksDr. Ditah, MD"},{"Patient":"My father has just commenced treatment for spinal TB , ATK 4 has been prescribed. He has been suffering from body pain for over a year and now after two MRIs that show degeneration of D7&8 vertibre, they are treating him for spinal TB. The treatment commenced 8 days ago but the body pain has increased significantly, so much so that he is finding it very difficult to move about. My questions :-1.  Is this a reaction to the ATK 4 ?2.  How long for the medication to take effect ?3.  Does he need a second opinion / tests for some other ailment ?He is 75 yrs old","Doctor":"Hi. Spinal tuberculosis is treated for atleast 1.5-2 years with anti-tuberculous medications. It takes a long time to heal and for the pain to subside. Bed rest is recommended atleast for the initial few months. AKT4 usually does not cause body pains unless there is some side effect like hepatitis and loss of appetite associated with this. By the way, im not really convinced based on the MRI report that he has tuberculosis of the spine, because degeneration is a very normal physiologic phenomenon at his age. I guess you need to take another opinion from a good doctor for the same. Thank you."},{"Patient":"I had back surgery on 4-24-13 for spinal stinosis.

The inability to put weight on the right leg is bad whenever I stand after sitting. A recent xray found I have moderate to severe L4-L5 degenerative disc disease. Mild degenerative disc disease at L2 -L3. Facet sclerosis is present at L4-L5 and L5-Sl. My back surgeon said I am not a candidate for more surgery that I am getting old (73) rusting, need to lose weight (l58 lbs and 5'5\\") and exercise. I referred myself to physical therapy and paid myself but can't do the exercises because they are too painful.

From your description it sounds like it was just the decompression however detailed description about the type of procedure would be helpful. At this point MRI of lumbar spine with and without contrast will demonstrate the cause of persistent problems. Many times spinal instability coexists with spinal stenosis as both result from degenerative changes. If your imaging (Xray and MRI spine) shows signs of instability instrumentation and fusion of unstable segment may be required. At age 73 if you do not have diabetes, hypertension or other medical problems increasing operative risk, the surgery should be safe. Degeneration is a problem of advanced age and is commonly seen in people of your age.Hope this is helpful.

Screw heads may become prominent in thin individuals and cause problems. Infection is a major concern if there is increasing pain and MRI scan and blood tests can help with diagnosis. Diagnosis of nonunion requires a CT scan.An Xray will reveal a broken screw in most of the cases. CT scan images the spine in three dimensions and is confirmatory. For your condition I would recommend a CT scan and MRI of the spine with and without contrast. A prominent or broken screw is uncommon to be the cause of pain by itself. It is the nonunion which is indirectly indicated by a broken screw that is the cause of pain.Hope this is helpful. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

L5, S1 and L4 are the common ones to get compressed. The cause of this is degeneration of the spine which means age related arthritic changes in the spine. The intervertebral disc bulges, bone spurs from the vertebrae (osteophytes) and a thickened ligament between vertebral bones contribute to this stenosis.Initial line of treatment for this is pain relieving medications, brace and physiotherapy. Epidural injections are done in spine around the affected nerves and reliably offer pain relief.

Also the part of my brain on my right side near where my brain hurts (Just below or at the processus mastoideus). I went to the doctor and he recommended Cervical Spondylosis. But I don't think it's this. What could it be?","Doctor":"HiThank you for this question to HCM.Disorientation, disturbance in thinking and difficulty to remember are disturbances of higher neural functions related to brain and unlikely to be coming from cervical spondylosis. Cervical spondylosis is a terminology used for degenerative changes in cervical spine which are age related. Common symptoms are neck pain, pain at the junction of head and neck and pain at the base of neck radiating into shoulders. Severe changes may lead to compression of the spinal cord and nerves to give tingling, numbness, grip weakness, difficulty with fine hand functions like buttoning clothes and frequent loss of balance while walking.It would be helpful to know if you have fever, blurring of vision, sensitivity to light or any other symptoms. Evaluation of other central nervous system function is necessary. I would suggest consulting a neurologist for clinical examination, objective testing and imaging as necessary. Hope this is helpful.

However, if the sacral nerves are pinched or compressed due to listhesis or due to surgery, bladder symptoms may occur.A careful examination is required by a neurologist and urologist. Ultrasound should be done to look for post void residual urine.

The tingling that you are having may be a result of the fall. It would be helpful to know your age, if you have diabetes and if you have had such tingling episodes before.Tingling stems from involvement of a nerve in the arm. The nerve may be pinched from a bulging disc or stenosis in the spine or peripherally like in carpal tunnel syndrome. In my opinion if tingling symptoms resolve on their own nothing needs to be done. If it persists or gets worse clinical examination and MRI of cervical spine and/or nerve conduction studies to find out the location of nerve involvement will be necessary.Hope this was helpful.

Getting enough sleep, avoiding too much caffeine, and eating healthy foods (like lots of fruits and vegetables), can help prevent some muscle twitches.

It may be due to a number of causes, like an underlying depression, anxiety or adjustment disorder, which needs to be diagnosed and treated if present. also, significant life stress (particularly financial, social etc.) further compounds the problem. While in school, a person has very little responsibilities, and is mostly focused on his studies, thus giving attention and retaining study material information is easier. But coming to your age, obviously, you have a lot of other activities and engagements that needs to be taken care off, thereby, diverting your focus. However, once the underlying cause is identified, your problem can be managed more easily. A detailed history, and mental status examination is required to reach a definitive conclusion about your problem. i would suggest you to visit a psychiatrist an give a detailed account of your routine and your problems.hope i've been able to satisfy your query. please feel free to contact me for further needful. best of luck."},{"Patient":"I appreciate any and all help. My daughter was born in June and all was well. She was a few weeks early and we had a few complications. Fast forward to one month and we noticed her doing a few things that we don t remember my other two girls doing. We recorded it and wrote it down. Fast forward to Thanksgiving. My daughter was almost 5 months and the whole family came down with the flu . She had a 104 fever which lasted two days and was very lethargic. During this time, I thought she had a seizure as I was holding her. The next week I took her to the dr and they said she had bronchiolitis . I was told if she developed a fever to bring her back. A week later she did and we landed right back in the dr office. Once again, we were sent home. I gave her breathing treatments and this time her fever remained 104 for 3 days. On day 3 I took her to the emergency room and we were dxed with double ear infections and given 10 days amoxicillin . On day 11 I once again returned to pediatrician and was told daughter had one ear infection remaining and was still suffering from bronchiolitis. To continue treating at home. We pursued the possibility of seizures and went to a neurologist . They wanted a full work up. So we scheduled MRI and bloodwork. At this point we had been on 15 days of antibiotic. We went for MRI and the MRI was refused due to a low pulse ox when sleeping. My daughter was running 89-92 and sent home. The MRI dr came in and listened to her, he said it sounded like she had bronchiolitis and if not better in a few days to return to the children s hospital. he also mentioned something about a heart condition that can cause fluid in the lungs. We went home and waited. Then the beginning lab results came in from her bloodwork. her WBC was 25.8 RBC 4.23 Hemoglobin 10.8 Hematocrit 32.5 MCV 77 MCH 25.5 MCHC 33.2 RDW 13.9 Platelets 467 Neutrophils 40 Lymphs 50 (atypical lymphocytes) Monocytes 10 EOS 0 Basos 0 Neutrophils (Absolute) 10.4 Lymps (absolute) 12.5 Monocytes (absolute) 2.6 EOS (absolute) 0.1 Baso (absolute) 0.1 Immature granulocytes 0 Immature grans (ABS) 0 Let me add we have seen her turning blue around her mouth as well as her extremities going blue/purple. She cannot eat a whole bottle without falling asleep and eating takes her a couple of hours. We returned to the children s hospital a few days later as she was not better and her WBC was still 24. We were dxed wtih bronchiolitis and leukocytosis and told to retest her blood in a few days. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. My daughter ahs been sick for over 6 weeks. Is there anything concerning in these numbers our pediatrician does not seem to concerned. I was also informed her carbon dioxide level was 19%. What does this mean?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.You have provided an excellent and detailed description of your daughter's illness.Based on the information, she is suffering from a respiratory infection, most likely a bronchiolitis, causing fever, breathing difficulty and feeding problems. She would need to continue the course of antibiotics for full recovery. Low oxygen saturation and feeding problems can be explained by this illness. blue extremities (peripheral cyanosis) could occur if she has breathing problems and can not inhale or exhale properly.In addition, we need to exclude a cardiac problem, such as right to left shunts, as they could cause cyanosis and make a child prone to get infections. An echocardiography would help.Seizures can occur with high fever (febrile seizures) and if her MRI and EEG are normal, no anti epileptic drugs would be required.Best wishes,Dr Sudhir Kumar MD DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant Neurologist"},{"Patient":"Male, 65 old, excellent health.

Discs above and below the level of previous fusion tend to degenerate faster because of increased movement.A disc bulge at C6-7 which does not result in cord or nerve root compression is not likely to be the cause of your symptoms. Atlantoaxial(first and second vertebra in neck) joint degeneration occurs in elderly individuals and causes headache as well as neck pain but is commonly underdiagnosed.

It did not improve. Also, he could not keep his foot on the floor and had to kept at some height. After going to Coimbatore, he did all possible tests after going to multiple hospitals to rule out things like brain problem, etc... All tests came well, there was NO PROBLEM whatsoever to brain, etc... But this falling while walking continued. He had in total four falls. Hence, the doctor advised him to be very careful, watch every movement and use a walking stick. Now he is using a walking stick. He has also been taught various exercises and medication is also on. One tablet name I remember is SUPERIOR. I would like him to recover fully from this problem rather than walk around with a stick, permanently. Can you help.","Doctor":"HiThank you for your question to HCM.Causes of foot drop can be either in lumbar spine where nerves come out, along the course of nerve in the leg or the muscles and joints. Foot drop from a lumbar disc herniation or stenosis generally is associated with radicular pain or numbness but may occur in isolation. Peripheral nerve lesions can involve common or deep peroneal nerve that may lead to foot drop. Joint and muscle problems lead to deformity rather than a true foot drop. A detailed examination by a neurologist can differentiate between these cause. A lumbar disc is obvious on MRI of the lumbar spine whereas nerve problems can be localized by Electromyography and Nerve conduction testing (EMG/NCV). Muscle weakness in the absence of nerve involvement can be detected on examination. So plan would be EMG/NCV and MRI of lumbar spine if these are not already done.Hope this is helpful.

It would have been helpful to know the current symptoms. However it is difficult to imagine having no symptoms with such an advanced stenosis picture.For the findings you have described unfortunately medicines won't help. When symptoms are progressive surgery is the only solution. Moreover, earlier the surgery better would be the outcome. The problem of cervical myelopathy is always progressive. Finding of myelomalacia indicates some damage to spinal cord has already occurred and the cord must be decompressed surgically as early as possible to prevent further worsening. Also risk of getting weakness in arms and legs is high even with a trivial fall or trauma to neck.Hope this is helpful. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

IF I move my arm towards the front of my body than I can move upward with less dificulty","Doctor":"HiThank you for your question to HCM.Pain and inability to lift the arm sideways beyond a particular point but easily able to lift it towards front indicates joint stiffness one of the reasons being frozen shoulder. Subacromial bursitis will also be painful on sideways movement and a tender spot can be elicited on the side of point of shoulder. An examination by physician can differentiate this.Muscle weakness if at all is the cause will never give painful restriction of movement though weakness of longer duration in the absence of physical therapy can lead to joint stiffness. Regarding your current symptoms treatment would be 1 Analgesics like ibuprofen or naproxen which are antiinflammatory as well.2 Physical therapy to improve range of motion of the joint.3 Local injections can help with pain relief.Hope this was helpful.

From your description you back pain seems very likely from muscle strain. MRI is sensitive to detect pathological lesions in the spine causing back pain. Disc bulges with nerve compression commonly cause leg pain but the disc bulge with no nerve compression as described in your report is unlikely to be causing back pain.The reason for bone scan may be a suspicion for spondylolysis which is one of the causes of back pain in teenagers. However, MRI would demonstrate hyperintensity indicating edema around the lysis. A CT scan will confirm the diagnosis of spondylolysis. The bone scan in your case is likely ordered to doubly rule out the possibility of spondylolysis.Hope this is helpful. Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

It is an injection of a streroid and local anesthetic in the spine. This helps many patients and is also diagnostic that the compressed nerve is the problem. The injections can be repeated if needed.If the injection helps for some time but pain recurs surgery (microdiscectomy) is indicated.

Treatment for pure back pain would be as described above. In the presence of radiating leg pain if it is right sided L4-5 foramen narrowing on right side may be the cause. In that scenario after trying above mentioned medications and physical therapy, epidural injections can be done by a spine surgeon or pain specialist.

The 3 knots you feel look to be incisional hernia with entrapment of the bowel loops, causing the symptoms you described. I would suggest to get a high resolution ultrasonography done and visit a Surgeon to confirm the diagnosis. Hernia has only one solution, and that is surgery."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am pregnant 17wks and almost 35years old. I have not taken my thyroid meds in a year. I have graves disease, treated by radioiodine therapy when I was 21. Three years ago, I started to get full body cataplexy drops, expecially after climbing stairs or elevations. Hospitalizations many times ruled out many cardiac and sleep study concerns. It was found that any slight decrease in my postassium level caused the hospitalizations after comparing notes for every visit. The doctor experimented and left me on IV potassium for a week and my levels would not go past 4.0 to make me hyperkalemic at any point, but did not make me feel better. Once the symptoms stopped, I would get released. Finally, they diagnosed me with hypokalemic periodic paralysis and potassium supplement nor potassium sparing diaretic would suffice. It actually made it worse. Ultimately, after discovering that sipping Pedialyte slowly all through the day kept me out of the emergency room, they put me on time released low dose potassium capsules 4x a day (10meq) as well as noting my thyroid levels had finally thrown me into hypothyroid after all these years since therapy. A year ago my TSH w T4 reflex was 1.80 and today it is 13.6. My potassium levels have been fine and I do take B12 monthly injections since I was 20 for pernicious anemia diagnosed by spinal tap a year before the Graves disease. I will see my endocrinologist this week but I am worried that the OB referred me to a maternal/fetal medicine specialist. They are getting familiar with electrolyte imbalances and taking the proper chromosome testing for my age and I await results. I am concerned about possibly getting paralysis attacks and falling while pregnant. It has not happened since I got pregnant, even though I feel awfull and stay in bed or on the couch. I am assuming the thyroid levels contribute to this worse feeling of my life because of my own neglect. I thought thyroid medicines made my heart race and made me have paralysis attacks more often, so I stopped to prove I don't have them as often when not taking Synthroid or Levothryroxine. The only other abnormality any specialist came up with during hospitalizations was a nuerologist noted strange brain waves during the test they make you hyperventilate to go to sleep (I did not sleep, only paralyzed myself) and he noted a small sclerosis on my hippocampus that was missed from a different hospital. I have not followed up with the nuerologist in fear because he had no answer for what causes it. Is it possible that tweaking my thyroid levels with treatment can cause the electrolyte issues to suddenly reappear and make it unsafe to be unattended or exert myself as before, noted by my frequent hospital visits of the past? My second fear is how much worse can it get until I deliver if I do not treat my thyroid? So in short I ponder: Obey doctor and suffer possible hypokalemic paralysis attacks/cataplexy body drops and treat as they come, or can the consequence of not treating my thyroid be more harmful to myself and the baby? I am not sure how bad a thyroid can get over another 20 weeks to guess which suffering of myself is worse, by for the baby, I am not sure how either symptoms can affect him.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand the concern you have regarding your baby. The most concerning for me at this point would be the report of a high TSH, since you were off thyroxine supplements, because hypothyroidism during pregnancy is known to affect the fetus and its development including neurological development. So I think a visit to your Endocrinologist should be done as soon as possible, and this needs to be corrected. Otherwise you will need to check and monitor your potassium levels and take supplements as required. You must already must have been informed about avoiding high carbohydrate diets which can increase the risk of hypokalemia. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a condition known to be associated with hyperthyroidism. So take care and get your thyroid status corrected. Thank you."},{"Patient":"my husband and I moved to a new city, he was on treatment for two continuous years in our last state with no interruptions in treatment medications.

If due to legal problems  morphine is not available then best thing that can be done is to gradually tapering the doses of morphine over 4-8 weeks. This will not cause sudden withdrawal and will not precipitate seizure. If that is not possible then consult his doctor regarding the replacement drug for morphine. Currently morphine is not a first line drug for seizures and many other non sedating drugs are available for seizures without legal issues.Thanks"},{"Patient":"HI, I have been described as having border line brain waves.

I am a 29 year old BF.  280 lbs, 5' 4\\".  I have a similar query as one posted on the webpage.  I have been experiencing a throbbing sensation in my spine.  It does seem to throb in sync with my heartbeat.  It usually occurs when I have just sat down or when I am about to stand up.  I have been on anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medications over the last 10 years.  I have finally gotten to a wonderful cocktail of Lexapro 40 mg and Wellbutrin 150mg.  (I am aware of being over the recommended dose for the former).  My tests have shown that I do not have any issues with my thyroid, I do not drink alcohol nor do I smoke.  I've experienced this throbbing for about 6 years or so, but it has been increasing over time- I may have the sensation 3-4 times per week.  They last for several seconds to a minute.  My reflex is to tighten up and freeze as movement makes the pain worse.  My body does seem to get hot during this \\"attack\\", and I do not normally feel tense or anxious before as it usually occurs when I'm relaxed.","Doctor":"Hi, it appears to be the pain due to the gastric hyper acidity, or a muscular pain due to the over weight.

I sincerely doubt your diagnosis that you have some memory problems.There are so many memory losing diseases and associated ones. You don't fit into any of them. Memory loss means not remembering to eat food, not able to recall what you ate for breakfast (sincerely), etc.The incidents you point out do happen to busy people and that is why keep a schedule of events and a calender of appointments. Orators keep notes and refer them when they speak. Most people take a list while shopping trip. You don't have to worry about these silly happenings. Keep your brain active and work hard.

Does the subarchnoid impingment mean it is going into his spine?","Doctor":"HiThank you for your question.Subarchnoid impingement in the report means the disc is impinging on the membrane that is surrounding the nerve. It does not necessarily mean the nerve is compressed. It is not clear from your description why this MRI was obtained.

Stenosis is narrowing of the spinal canal that predisposes to paralysis. If that is the case documented on your MRI you will need to see a spine surgeon as surgery is indicated in that scenario. A CT scan of the cervical spine can diagnose the nonunion.

Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Velocity (EMG/NCV) test can find out the exact location of nerve problem. Management as well as need to repeat the MRI in 3 months depends on what the problem is.

Over the past year, her hands have started to become numb. And more-so recently, they have become more numb than usual . Well, over the past couple of days, the left side of her neck and face have also started to become numb as well. She went into school today (she s an 8th grade math teacher) and an associate said she looks awful and her temples are green because the veins in her temples are sticking out. any idea what it could be? She had surgery in both of her shoulders in high school due to torn rotators cuffs and had screws put in. I don t know if this will have anything to do with it, I was thinking it may have something to do with the circulation in her hands until the recent neck problems arisen. She s been to a neurosurgern and they couldn t find anything wrong. They re thinking it has to do with MS, but the MRI s couldn t really say what it was. Any ideas?","Doctor":"HiThank you for your question.Numbness of the hands and recent engorgement of the neck and face and numbness may be indicative of something compressive around thoracic outlet. This is the area where the nerves to arms are coming out. Blood from neck and face drains into a large vessel called Superior vena cava which is also in the same area. I would advise seeing a vascular surgeon to rule this out. CT scan of the chest may be helpful if compression is suspected.Wish you the best."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have a concern about my husband.

Xray of the pelvis with both hips and spine Xrays will also be helpful.Wish you the best."},{"Patient":"I have had a discectomy, followed  by another discectomy and now have two lg. ruptered disc's one above and one below the fusion.

I'm not taking anything now, but my right arm is so tight it is miserable and my leg nerves on the r side keep me awake at night.  My head is so muddled that I can't think straight.  My son and daughter don't think I should be driving, so I have a caretaker 3 hours a day, abnd she usually drives me to Dr. appointments, but I still drive to get my blood tests, and occasionally to the store.My caretaker fixes my lunch, but I still fix my own dinner.  I asked Dr. Leger at the Cleveland Clinic if he could give me something to clear my head up, and he said \\"No\\".  He said for me to go back and see my neurologist, but I haven't seen him for about a year.  Is there anything I can do , diet, etc. to clear my head.  I no longer have any energy, and have to rest during the day.  I always had plenty of energy before before my stroke.  I want to go to a new neurologist, but who do you recommend - I live in zip code 0000, so would like someone near to me.  Thank you.  Patty S.

Dynapar/Hifenac are pain killers and will definitely help. Other options are1 Pregabalin and Gabapentin are nerve specific medications that help to relieve radicular pain like this. 2 Oral steroids like methylprednisolone can help reduce acute pain if there are no contraindications like diabetes.3 Epidural injections can be done directed to the specific nerve. See a spine surgeon to discuss this.These modalities are helpful for alleviating pain in most of the patients. However if it persists for long time surgical decompression of the nerve is needed.

It is very obvious a new MRI of cervical spine is needed to evaluate this. The treatment options are1 Pain killers like diclofenac or stronger ones like tramadol +/- muscle relaxants.2 Neck exercises are better avoided in acute pain. Once the pain is under control physiotherapy is helpful.3 Nerve specific medications like pregabalin or gabapentin.4 Steroids like methylprednisolone are also helpful to control acute pain.5 Nerve root blocks in cervical region are technically challenging to perform and not very useful in multilevel disease.If symptoms keep worsening despite these or signs of myelopathy are present in the arms/legs on examination surgical decompression is recommended.Wish you the best."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, How many months are required to become normal ( once you start taking medicines) to get rid of vitamine deficiencey ?

About five months ago I woke up one morning feeling tingling all in both of my feet. It went away once I got up and began moving. This next couple of mornings it was the same thing. Well almost two weeks in this had progressed and was pretty much constant. I began feeling tingling in my lips and nose. I have a very sore spot in my back that sends a wierd electric signal up my neck to the midline of the back of my head. After going to ER they said it sounds like MS. I went to my primary doctor who said it sounds like Guillain-Barre syndrome . He referred me to a neurologist whoo confirmed it was Guillain-Barre syndrome after only doing a nerve conduction test. He said it is my periphreal nerves sp its not MS because that would be my Central Nervous System . The symptoms got to where I could not walk. I had been ordered to go through a week of IVIG infusions. This helped give me an edge but I haven t seen the recovery that my doctor expected. I told my neurologist that I have tension headaches and that I have had a sore neck (muscles) since this has started plus a sore throat. He told me that I can consult another neurologist if I wished. I just wanted some advice to what this could be. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi,Based on details you had Guillain barre syndrome ,which is an autoimmune disease affecting the peripheral nerves. IV IG has prevented further progression of the disease.It is the drug of choice.It takes a month to 3 months for complete recovery.Meantime you need to continue with physiotherapy which is most important.Tension type headache is due to the worry of the disease.You need to have neck relaxation exercises and local analgesic application at neck.If headache is worrisome and the weakness is worseing from beginning then need further evaluation.Hope this would help you"},{"Patient":"I would like to know how effective Potiga is in reducing partial onset seizures (percentage wise)?

I am a male and im only 39","Doctor":"HiThank you for your question.For the weakness you feel in your legs and persistent back pain I would recommend getting an MRI of your lower back sooner rather than later. Low back is more likely to be the cause because neck problems usually present late in 50s and 60s. Also clinical examination by a neurologist or spine surgeon can help to distinguish between neck and low back problems.Please let me know if I can be of further assistance."},{"Patient":"About two years ago I started getting numbness and pain in my left toe .

The pain and numbness started in my left thumb and mentioned it to my GP as my father has peripheral neuropathy which has caused him to loss feeling in his legs now to mid thigh.

It would be very important to know what is the cause of peripheral neuropathy. Please consult a neurologist who can investigate this further. The pattern of progression of symptoms is not very typical of spinal cord problems in the neck though it is possible.I would suggest consulting a neurologist, obtaining EMG/NCV which is a test to assess the peripheral nerves and finally MRI of the neck.Please let me know if I can be of further assistance."},{"Patient":"my dad was working construction and all of a sudden his neck hurt and his drill got so heavy he dropped it.

What stenosis means is the vertebral canal in the neck that contains spinal cord is narrowed. It happens due to age related changes in spine in some people. When there is even trivial trauma to the neck the spinal canal can not move freely in already narrowed canal and gets compressed leading to weakness in arms and legs. Some recovery is seen most of the times and may continue for months.MRI of the cervical spine (neck) is recommended and consultation with a spine surgeon.Please let me know if I can be of any help."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am having issues with my right foot . I am a 33 year old male and this problem has existed for several years now but has progressively gotten worse over the past 2 years. it seems to be mostly in the area between the big toe and where the big toe connects to the rest of the foot on the bottom side of my foot. as i spend more time on it throughout the day it spreads slowly back into the main muscle of my arch. it is a painful but more so it feels kind of Nerve-ish kinda like when you hit your funny bone. later in the day it feels like its swollen but doesn t look like it. when i wake up in the morning it feels fine and slowly gets worse by the end of the day, no matter how much or little i m on it. I went to see a foot doctor here is what he said... there is a round tendon that connects the toes to the foot that help to spring up as we walk and mine on my big toe is two little circles meaning either i was born that way or I injured it at some point but should be memorable because it would be extremely painful that very moment if so. he taped it up to release tension and said keep it that way for two days, gave me a prescription and seemed to believe I would be all better afterwards, although he did not suggest i stay off it, i did manage to completely stay off it for two whole days, but still no results. sorry to be so long but does this sound like anything you have dealt with before? I really hope it is fixable. hank you for your time, and i look forward to hearing back soon","Doctor":"HiThank you for your question.From the symptoms you have described the pain is coming from imflammation of first metatarsophalangeal joint. Such a localized pain associated with swelling is unlikely to be nerve related pain. It may be related to intrinsic structure of foot causing metatarsalgia or remote trauma.

It is advisable to do a biopsy where small piece of tissue from the mass is sent for pathological examination to find out what it is. If the leg is not working as a result of the 'flesh' compressing the spinal cord, surgery is indicated as early as possible. She will of course go through a preoperative evaluation before surgery and only if she is fit for surgery they will proceed. Keep in mind. LASER is an experimental technology.

One of the causes of localized pain after surgery like scoliosis which involves long fusions is pseudoarthrosis or bones not uniting to form one solid mass of bone which ideally should happen. Though this is seen frequently in adults it is uncommon at your age. Smoking can affect fusion negatively. Your pain is very specific and has a pattern related to particular activities which points to muscular and posture cause. I would suggest- Adopting good posture- Avoid bending and twisting of back particularly when you anticipate pain.- Keep a log of pain to find out any particular position or action after shower that causes pain.- Physical therapy to help back muscle strengthening and posture training.I would suggest seeing a physician because of associated symptoms like breathlessness and fainting which in no way are related to spine surgery.I do understand your situation and I would be glad if I can be of any further assistance to you."},{"Patient":"My nan has been suffering from symptoms which we can only link with vertigo for a month now.

Your help would be most appreciated as i just want to get back to normal. Regards","Doctor":"HiThank you for your question.From what you have described seems like you had L5-S1 laminectomy. Numbness appearing after surgery may be related to prolonged retraction or excessive traction on the nerve though it can not always be explained. Traction has been recommended for less than 48 hours as its effect is only due to bed rest. Traction by itself is very unlikely to have caused the numbness. The numbness may take long time to resolve upto 6 months and may not always resolve completely. If your pain is getting worse it is worth obtaining the MRI of lumbar spine with and without contrast as it has already been 3 months, to find or rule out scar tissue or stenosis at the adjacent level. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance."},{"Patient":"Hi I have two problems which are annoying me, I have convex curve in my back, I do a lot of exercise and I have tried doing yoga , do you know of any ways I can widen my shoulders and straighten my spine? My second problem is I have a permeant blocked nose , my face has swollen all over, my eyes look really small. I hope you can help thanks Aubrey ps I breath through my mouth when sleeping. I have tried breathing through my nose,but if makes me feel like I am suffocating?","Doctor":"Hi Thank you for your question.I am a spine surgeon and I can answer the first part of your question. The convex curve that you have described is called kyphosis when it is in front to back plane whereas side to side curve is scoliosis. The kyphosis if it is postural which is common in adolescent girls and presents with stooped shoulders and slouched trunk. This can be corrected with physical therapy and strengthening of back muscles with posture training. If the kyphosis is structural which means the alignment of vertebrae is fixed in kyphosis it needs to be corrected by surgery which is indicated if associated with weakness in legs or trouble walking and not for the cosmetic reason. Structural and postural kyphosis is differentiated on Xray of the spine. So answer to your question is- it is likely to be postural kyphosis. See a good physical therapist."},{"Patient":"Good morning. I will try to summarize. I was Dx with a craniopharyngioma and underwent a craniotomy in June 2010 to have it removed. It recurred and in January 2011 I underwent transsphenoidal surgery to again remove it, followed by six weeks of radiotherapy. Ever since the first surgery I have experienced swelling of my forehead over my right eye. At least once or twice a month. However, with the heat the swelling increases. This summer the swelling is happening right over the bridge of my nose, in the center of the forehead, reaching a size and shape that resembles half an egg. When the swelling goes down my eyes are bruised and puffy for a couple of days. This is now happening on a weekly basis with at least 3-4 days of swelling. None of my doctors can seem to find an explanation. I am very worried. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.","Doctor":"hi dearthanks for choosing HCMthe swellings which appear off and on are usually HERNIAS or vascular swellings 1. get a fresh CTscan of brain . you have not mentioned the cranial approach during the first surgery  .it could be a herniation from the craniotomy   site 2 if it is a vascularised swelling  get a contrast enhanced CT.bruising and puffiness after subsidence of swelling points more toward herniation as reduction of the mass would increase the intracranial pressure good luck"},{"Patient":"Hi I have suffered from epilepsy since I was really young.

Tingling of the thigh is a symptom of spinal stenosis at a higher level particularly L1-L3. It may also be seen after long standing diabetes and is called meralgia paresthetica.

Questions OPTIONS?","Doctor":"Hi my name is Niranjan Kavadi. I am a spine surgeon. The pathology can be better appreciated by looking at the images but if the stenosis is at so many levels as you have described, disc replacement is definitely not the best option. Your options depend on what your symptoms are. Cervical stenosis can lead to myelopathy, radiculopathy or both. Myelopathy is a compression of the spinal cord and leads to changes in the gait pattern. The gait becomes wide based and spastic. Fine hand functions decline and grip strength worsens over time. Radiculopathy is a symptom of nerve root compression and leads to pain and numbness in the arm. With multilevel stenosis like yours symptoms and signs usually point to myelopathy. Early surgery is recommended in myelopathy and has been shown to arrest the progression of myelopathy and worsening of symptoms. It is unlikely but if your symptoms are of radiculopathy you can chose to wait and tray pain management. Regarding surgical options, again viewing the images is necessary but generally if the cervical spine is lordotic which means the neck is swayed backwards with the convexity of the curvature in front and 3 or more levels are involved approach from the back of the neck is preferred. Again to be honest each case is different and the decision needs to be individualized based on evaluation of images."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Angela and I am 50. A year and a half ago I was in an automobile accident. C5 and C6 went into my spinal cord. I had surgery two weeks later. ACDF w cage plate and screws. It was put in wrong hitting C4 and severely compressing nerve 6. At the end of November 2012 I had posterior laminectomy with 2 rods C4C5C6. Released nerve six as wellas bone graph. I recently just had another anterior surgery taking out plate and screws fro first surgery. The screws had pulled out because it was over a bone spur and I could not swallow. I am still in severe pain. Base of skull, neck, arms are numb. CT Scan shows C7 and T1 are distressed. How do I get out of pain and will I ever be better? I can not live this way.","Doctor":"Hello. My name is Dr Niranjan Kavadi and I am a spine surgeon. From what is described it seems the first surgery was for decompression and fusion by anterior approach. The indication for second surgery will be more clear from the images however it is very likely the aim was again decompression and supporting the anterior construct from back. If the screw from the front was backing out it is an indication that the segments are not fusing leading to pseudoarthrosis which in simple terms means the bones are not uniting to form single solid mass of bone which ideally should happen. The risk is particularly high in smokers. I am not sure what is meant by C7 and T1 are distressed but the CT scan needs to be studied to assess if there is instability at the cervicothoracic junction. Also loosening of the screw strongly indicates nonunion. I assume you have tried analgesics and other nonoperative pain management modalities. Though there is no certainty of pain relief but treating the nonunion (if demonstarted on CT) and addressing the instability across the cervicothoracic junction to extend the fusion into thoracic spine if needed can definitely make pain a lot tolerable. It is difficult to comment upon the numbness in arms without looking at the recent MRI. Please let me know if I can be of any further help."},{"Patient":"I am looking for a Dr. of Neurology as my question pertains to a surgery that my husband had back in April by a Neurologist in Kelowna, BC.  He had a spinal stenosis surgery done in mid April 2013.  This all had to do with his feet as he has had sore feet for the last 3 years.  He started by going to our Family Physician who suspected stenosis from the get-go, however, he went to various specialists over the course of 2 years who suspected he might have Tarsal Tunnel but no one could say for sure.  He then ended up at the Neurologist who said that all the pain in both of his feet was due to stenosis.  He was experiencing excruciating pain and at the same time numbness .  It was at the point wherein he could barely walk.  After his surgery, he was told that because his nerves were severely damaged, it might take up to 1.5 years for him to feel a difference.  It has now been 4 months and he feels worse rather than better.  We are both wondering if this is normal since he shows absolutely no sign of recovery.  Is it possible that there was enough nerve damage that he will never get better?","Doctor":"Hi My name is Niranjan Kavadi and I am a spine surgeon. Spinal stenosis is diagnosed in its strictest sense when MRI picture of narrowing of the spinal canal correlates with the symptoms. The classic symptom of spinal stenosis is neurogenic claudication which is described as pain/fatigue/feeling of heaviness or numbness in buttocks, back of the thigh or calves. Pain increases on standing and walking and is relieved by bending forward. Regarding your husband's case presentation of pain only in feet is not impossible but not that common with stenosis. Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Velocity or EMG/NCV test can typically distinguish pain from spinal stenosis and from peripheral causes like tarsal tunnel though the picture is not always black and white. The numbness may sometimes take 6-12 months to improve after surgery. If he is feeling worse, it would be definitely advisable to look for or rule out other causes like tarsal tunnel syndrome, vascular claudication or diabetic neuropathy.

Do not look down at your feet. Avoid walking in dark areas or on unstable ground. * Use a cane, walking stick, or walker for support and to give additional pressure and touch (tactile) orientation.* Avoid activities that move the head up and down repetitively.* Try to avoid keeping the head tilted back for long periods of time, for example painting or dusting above your head.* Be cautious when using medications that may cause balance problems as a side effect.Hope this information is helpful.

I've gotten every procedure that they've suggested, continue to see a slew of dr.s trying to get a confirmed dx so that I can work at the core of the problem and not just the symptoms. I realize I forgot to mention my problem with her care. She has me on 75mcg fentanyl patch, which has been the only long acting medication that even keeps me moderately functional though she refuses to prescribe a short acting med for breakthrough pain. She's been putting me on a wild goose chase where she tells me to do something like see a pain psychologist then tells me not to, then told me to see him again last week. I feel that my pain is the primary symptom that is keeping me from finishing my bachelors and being a more functional person. I don't want to be on opiates all my life but I believe that keeping me as functional as possible until I find out what is causing all of this is a lot better than not. I've tried physical therapy, yoga, meditation, ice packs, heat, hot baths w/ magnesium, distraction, etc. and nothing else seems to help. My PCP, psychiatrist, and family all believe it's a logical idea but she does not. There is a Dr. in charge of the pain center and the last ditch effort is to ask him to intervene but I'm afraid of getting nowhere and if I have to find a new Dr. I know that many are reluctant to take on patients who've seen pain doctors in the past. I hope you may help steer me in the right direction. Thanks in advance.

No injuries, except one, occurred below my head. I had completely fractured the right side of my head, in which, resulting in 4 titanium plates and a titanium mesh holding my right eye up. The impact brain injury area is within my hair lines. In the ICU I had a hematoma which burst just as the brain surgeon was prepping. Longer story shorter, and to the main question, the brain injury scar now has a immovable, hard as bone, protrusion about an inch in diameter. The more panicking detail is that it has grown behind my right ear, in the midst of my scar.  Lastly, I have had an amazing recovery, but early last month, July, I had my first documented seizure a month shy of two years since the accident. Also, I had seizure like abnormalities last Friday. Finding this lump in a very medically troubled area has me severely worried, and nervous seeing how after 23 years of my life a seizure manifested out of no where. Need I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.Seizures can occur in a person after head injury. In your case, these are called as late post-traumatic epilepsy, as almost two years have passed since the time of head injury.These seizures occur due to the scar in the brain resulting due to old head injury.There is no need to worry. You would need to start anti epileptic drugs, after doing a CT scan of brain.Best wishes,Dr Sudhir Kumar MD DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant Neurologist"},{"Patient":"I had a grand mal seizure about 3 weeks ago, I am 72 years old and had never had a seizure before. I was under severe stress, no sleep for many days and was caring for my husband who died a week later. Anyway I was kept in the hospital for three days because I had developed before the seizure the ability to carry on a conversation and my words were staggered. Tonight I think I took my afternoon Dilantin and I took my night time one because my pill box for the afternoon dose was empty. What do you think is the right way if this happens again?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.First seizure needs evaluation to find out the underlying cause of seizures. I presume you underwent MRI of brain, EEG and other blood tests.Regarding Dilantin, you need to take 5 mg per kg body weight. So, if your weight is about 60 kg, then, a daily dose of 300 mg is needed. A capsule of Dilantin is 100 mg, so, you would need three capsules daily. Since the duration of action is 24 hours, for convenience sake, you can take the entire three capsules together at night. Other options include taking one in morning, after noon and night each OR one in morning and two at night.Best wishes,Dr Sudhir Kumar MD DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant Neurologist"},{"Patient":"I have diverticulitis and I have been experiencing pain in my lower abdomen for 2 days, I have been using a heating pad and took a laxative when I have pass gas it feels a little better.

It treated the Acne vulgaris problem well but it gave me other issues to deal with. Such as a pain in the top of the stomach and a pain in the lower back of the head & it feels like in the center of the head too. These two pains come together with the feeling of something moving up through the area where the pain of the back of the head takes place and when this thing moves up it feels like it is dealing with the pain where it makes it go less intense for a moment. Roaccutane also made my depression and fear overcome me which lead me to some kind of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder . I went to see a doctor about the stomach pain and he took tests..(a lot of them) and he told me that my test results have shown no problems but he pointed me to a psychiatrist. all psychiatrists I met have agreed on that I have a depression problem anyway and they decided to treat me for it. the medicine the gave me for it was Seroxat and it has made the case of depression much better. I had it for about about 8 months. Seroxat made both pain in the top of the stomach and the lower back of the head pain less appearing by about 77% because me fearing these two pains has got less power and once they appear this thing that move up in the back of my head which got even stronger after Seroxat makes them go away. (these two pains usually appear when I m stressed out, didn t eat for a while, didn t sleep for a while, change sleeping or eating time habits, After physical exercise). I stopped taking seroxat because it made me fat from about 75 Kgs after roaccutane to 100 Kgs and the tests have show my cholesterol level as 200 & I also lost more hair than I did while on Roaccutane.. when I stopped taking seroxat about a year and two months ago pain in the top of the stomach and a pain in the lower back of the head started to come back and also fear & depression took over again. My questions are that, what is happening to me ? if I leave my case to time..is everything going to be ok and everything will come back to my normal state before taking these medications and when could it be?, is my weight coming back to normal, are these pains, fear and depression going away? IF NOT what do you think I should do ? *I did (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test ) and it showed no problem. I also did (helicobacter Pylori Antigen Stool test) and also showed no problem)!! -about 19 years ago I ve had Tonsillectomy!","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.

I was on the phone with her and she had rapid and sudden onset of slurred speech and was also repeating the same comment over and over. A CT of the head w/o contrast was dome and showed the following: -ventricles/sulci unremarkable -moderately severe patchy and confluent leukoencephalopathy present, consistent with changes secondary to microvascular disease. -scattered chronic lacunar infarcts are seen in basal ganglia and external capsules bilat. -superimposed acute infarct can not be excluded. Her hx is of mild HTN, on exforge . Mildly elevated chol, but with good ratio and excellent HDL and low triglycerides. Hx of cigarette smoking. 1/2-1pack/day x 20+ yrs and was smoking at the time of this ER visit. Fam Hx of Hashmotos thyroiditis in ALL females for at least 3 generations. Hx of anxiety, Reynauds, B12 deficiency and B12 deficient anemia. Also c/o palpitations and had a greatly increased pulse rate (100-140) intermittently. She was prescribed Xanax .25mg prn, and after 2 days admitted and on a holter monitor was sent home being told to quit smoking and gain weight . She had not been eating, c/o either her new dentures hurting too much or stomach spasms causing intense pain (previously seen and treated by rx of Bentyl prn) Hospital intake stated she was cachectic . A follow up MRI of the brain was done as well with the following findings: -cystic changes noted to choroid plexus in trigone region of lateral ventricles -very small foci of cystic encephalomalacia within the basal ganglia and thalami are identified -moderately extensive, patchy and confluent foci of abnormal T2 signal are spread around the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, and also noted within the midbrain and pons -scattered paranasal mucoperiostal thickening with no significant sinus opacification Can you PLEASE sum this up? I am a nurse, and while I understand most of this, the doctors where she was treated told her she didn t have a stroke or TIA...or at least that is what my mother came away thinking. However, am I incorrect that what I am seeing is that she has evidence of multiple small, deep, old strokes present, as well as diffuse white matter disease/small vessel disease? I ask because I have seen a marked change in my mom since this began. She becomes angered more easily, jumping on people. She seems to forget things I have told hre just a few days/weeks ago, she exhibits almost manic/depressive type swings, she does not plan well, and she laughs and/or reacts inappropriately. She also has episodes of extreme anxiety and cries uncontrollably saying she can t stop . These all seem to me to be symptoms of Vascular Dementia, no? My Dad was diagnosed with colon cancer this past summer, and I am an only child trying to care for them both...please help me understand these results. I feel she needs further evaluation...","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Sorry to hear that you are having a tough time having to care for both parents who been ill for a while. Coming to your mom's ER visits, from the CT scan findings, there is mention of periventricvular white matter changes due to microvascular disease and scattered chronic lacunar infarcts are seen in basal ganglia and external capsules bilaterally. These refer to mini strokes in the past which might have gone unnoticed. Further, as the CT scan could not be conclusive regarding an underlying acute infarct, a follow up MRI scan was done. As per MRI report there are cystic changes noted to choroid plexus in trigone region of lateral ventricles -very small foci of cystic encephalomalacia within the basal ganglia and thalami are identified -moderately extensive, patchy and confluent foci of abnormal T2 signal are spread around the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, and also noted within the midbrain and pons. This also does not pin point to any acute cerebrovascular event.Your suspicion on possibility of Vascular Dementia needs imaging and clinical coreelation. One of the most useful tests in the evaluation of Vascular Dementia is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI is very sensitive to changes in the brain caused by stroke. The principal findings in Vascular Dementia are lacunar infarcts (small, spherical strokes in the deep parts of the brain) and abnormal findings in the cerebral white matter. This is the region where axons (the long part of a nerve cell) travel. It is called the \\"white matter\\" because the fatty insulation on the axons makes it look white in real life. These changes can be seen in many people who appear to have no cognitive complaints, however, studies have shown that as the total volume of these changes increases, cognitive difficulties are more likely.Clinically Vascular Dementia needs to be differentiated from Alzheimer's Disease. A Psychiatry consultation and work up will help you further.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I ve been havin problems with my hand going numb on me and hurting really bad.

She has pain in abdomen, with nausea; when she stops eating and gets OK. This happens once in 6 to 8 months ion recurrent basis. The most probable cause of such a problems is sub-acute intestinal obstruction which gets instigated on certain foods or so, which are more fibrous.

Since then I have a real tight neck that wants to keep dropping , neck pain , light headedness, back pain, occasional loss of balance and trouble walking and climbing steps. I recently lost my job because of these issues. My Neurologist thinks it is all coming from the neck tightness. My Neuro Surgeon disagrees and sent me to Physical Therapy and a Pain Management Doctor. They both agree with my Neurologist. The Pain Management Specialist told me that there is nothing that can be done. He told me 1 out of 10 or 1 out of every 12 with this surgery end up like me. In the past 3 months I started experiencing tremors in my right hand, right arm, shoulder, neck & head. Aggressive at times. I have tremors pretty much daily now. My Neurologist retired but wanted me to get a second opinion because I am progressing. I have not yet had a second opinion away from the same Medical Practice. I was about to when my Neuro Surgeon called and wanted me to get a Neck MRI. She referred me to another Neurosurgeon she works with to have more surgery. I saw the new Neurosurgeon. He explained he wants to take the hardware from my previous surgery out of the back of my neck and put it in the front to hold my head up. I was told it would not relieve the pain or any other symptoms I am having. I was also sent to another Neurologist in the same practice. She has no idea what is going on. Parkisons was ruled out. Both Neurosurgeons think there is something else going on and it s not coming from my neck. I can feel everything coming from my neck. I have had since May 2 neck MRI s & 4 Botox Injections, in the last 30 days an EEG, Brain MRI & CT Scan. All are normal except CT scan. It was to check healing for removing metal in my neck. I have an appointment to talk about that in a few weeks. Do you think there could actually be 2 different problems? My neck is really tight and like I said before I feel everything but my hand and arm tremors coming from my neck. I am really confused.","Doctor":"Thanks for writing to us.You have complex story with multiple issues and not pointing to a particular one problem.

You should not take drugs to stop your diarrhoea because it is the natural method of elimination of the harmful things that have gone into your abdomen and defending you from further toxicity. The remaining pain is also a natural process of eliminating the toxic substances either through rectum in the form of diarrhoea or through the mouth as vomiting.The fever also is  a defence mechanism to eliminate the toxins that have already been absorbed into your body. Best way is to wait with liquid food and rest.

I feel like I need something to take when this happens. What would you recommend I do?  I am afraid to tell my neurosurgeon because of my age. Should I just tell him?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.As per your description, you have LUMBAR DISC DISEASE with SEVERE CANAL STENOSIS.You can try a trial of conservative management as follows -* avoid lifting heavy weights * avoid forward bending activities  which will cause worsening of disc protrusion* Use a lumbosacral back support * Intermittent pelvic traction to cause regression of discs* Maintain optimum body weight,if you are obese* Physiotherapy to strengthen your back muscles. Physiotherapy has to be done only after the acute pain has subsided.* Judicious use of analgesics and muscle relaxants.If the above measures fail to provide symptom relief and if you have shooting pains down the leg or inability to walk for long distances, then you may need surgical decompression.Approach your neurosurgeon and follow his advice.Hope this information is helpful.

I am a 50 year old woman with mild high blood pressure which is controlled with medication.  I have recently had a MRI with and without contrast of my brain.  This was ordered because I have been experiencing burning nerve pain on face, on arms, hands, legs and feet for five months (after a bout of shingles). I am currently taking 100 mg. of gabapentin twice a day for the nerve pain.  This does not completely control it, but I do not like the side effects so I am trying not to increase the dosage.    A previous MRI without contrast (for numbness and tingling in face two years ago) showed some possible white matter lesions in right frontal lobe. At the time, I was told that I was experiencing \\"silent migraines\\"...no pain, just numbness and tingling.   This most recent MRI showed \\"slight progression minimal periventricular and moderate deep white matter disease since last MRI.  This is nonspecific and consistent with demyelinating process, vasculitis, or chronic small vessel ischemic change.\\"  It also stated that \\"two new adjacent white matter lesions at the right frontal lobe centrum semiovale measuring appr. 1mm.  The remainder of the white matter lesions appear relatively stable on the right.  There are two new foci of T2 prolongation at the posterior aspect of the left frontal lobe deep white matter at the junction of the centrum semiovale and corona radiate also measuring on the order of 1 to 2mm.\\"Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.The MRI brain findings are non-specific and minor, and there is no need to worry about them. As your doctor suggested, they are most likely related to migraine, and the other diagnostic possibilities such as vasculitis and demyelination are unlikely in your case.The pain and burning are not related to MRI findings. Gabapentin dose can be gradually increased based on the relief from burning and possible side effects. If you are unable to tolerate gabapentin, then, other options include pregabalin and carbamazepine.Best wishes,Dr Sudhir Kumar MD DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant Neurologist"},{"Patient":"My neurologist says that Cymbalta is not a good drug to take because there are too many drug interactions associated with it.

The ventricles, cisterns, and cortical sulcal pattern are within normal limits in size and configuration. There is no midline shift. There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or edema. There is no hydrocephalus. There is no evidence of significant cerebellar tonsillar ectopia.Impression:Subtle focal region of nonenhancing abnormal signal in the right periventricular white matter. Similar findings can be seen as a result of remote infection, inflamation, or trauma. These can also be seen in patients with chronic migraine headaches and in the proper clinical setting, a demyelinating disorder could appear similar. Further clinical correlation is recommended.What does it mean??? I had blood work done, all good and there was no trauma.Please help me understand the findings.","Doctor":"demyelinating disorder means, the sheet around the nerve tissue made of myelin, start disappearing. hence the nerve function starts deteriorating. hence you will get symptoms of these sort. this again depends on your age, more common in old age people. this can even happen with infections of nervous system.  if you have migraine/chronic headache then also you could get such MRI findings. so dont worry, go to your clinician, he will do some blood tests and some clinical examination and history to rule out other things. wish you good health"},{"Patient":"I am a 39 year old female.

Yes this can be a sign of a sinus infection. You have not mentioned which gland was found to be swollen.He also uses CPAP. Reason for using it? Obstructive sleep apnea? If it needs adjusting then do get it done as soon as possible. There may be difficulty in adjusting the mask or it may lead to dryness of airway. The humidification needs adjustment. If he has symptoms of anxiety and depression then an evaluation by a psychiatrist would be beneficial. He may need to be started on antidepressants depending on what examination reveals. Psychiatric disorders usually do not show up on tests. Waking up tired and not feeling refreshed by sleep and easy fatiguability are one of the few symptoms of depression.Hope this helps,Dr A Rao"},{"Patient":"The are couple of months now, I have been having difficulty concentration, Forgetful ness, can't talk right sometimes slurred., back of ears to base of neck hot, like fever.

This may prevent you from permanent damage. For time being to relieve pain you can take analgesic, stretching exercises. If you leave it to progress then the chances of nerve compression and loss of few functions are there. So consult your doctor for examination and management.  Hope I answered your question.

They cannot confirm this.  She's had an EEG which did not show any seizure activity.  She also had an MRI which is very confusing as our neurologist did not give us much info, and when we ask questions she acts like she's too busy, frustrated, etc to answer.  Here's the MRI results:  MRI of the brain w/out contrast.  Exam performed on a 3.0 Tesla Philips Achieva MRI Scanner.  Multiple pulse sequences used, images were obtained in the acial, sagittal and coronal planes.  FINDINGS:  There is a band of increased T2 signal in the deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally.  This is most prominent in the parietal lobes where it measures up to 5mm in thickness.  On the T2 weighted sequence, this band has the same signal as the gray matter.  It is slightly higher than gray matter on the FLAIR sequence and the T1 weighted sequence.  In addition, there are nonspecific scattered high T2 signal changes in the deep white matter of the frontal lobes bilaterally and in the peritrigonal region bilaterally.  The subcortical white matter of the frontal and parietal lobes demonstrates immature myelination signal.  IMPRESSION:  Possibly gray matter heteropia, however on the FLAIR sequence and T1-weighted sequence it demonstrates signal that is higher than the peripheral gray matter, which suggests that this could represent a demyelinating or dysmyelinating process such as metachromatic leukodystrophy.  In addition there are patchy nonspecific high T2 signal changes in hte deep white matter of the frontal lobes bilaterally and in the peritrigonal region bilaterally.  Location suggest terminal zones of myelination although leukomalacia or demyelination cannot be entirely excluded????Thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for your query.Thanks for sharing the information and I can understand your concern. MRI findings do suggest that there is leukodystrophy which is responsible for the developmental delay. However the findings will not affect the management of the developmental delay for which you need to pursue with a developmental/physical therapist. MRI does not reveal any treatable cause for the delay.I hope I have answered your query to your satisfaction.Wishing your daughter all the best.Regards,Rajiv K Khandelwal"},{"Patient":"My husband had a stroke in 2006.

Any pathology in the Vestibular apparatus in the inner ear, which maintains posture & balance.2. Any fluctuation in the blood pressure & blood sugar levels.3. Inadequate hydration status & electrolyte balance of the body.4. Deficiencies of certain nutrients like Iron, Vitamin B 12, Folic acid, etc. which helps in blood formation & nerve conduction.5. Hormonal & metabolic causes.6. Stress, inadequate sleep, etc.Investigations like complete blood count, estimation of blood pressure & blood sugar levels will be helpful to rule out any pathological cause for the symptoms.And it is also needed that you take certain precautions regarding your diet & lifestyle, such as:1.

SULFASALAZINE (saaz -DS) has got modest efficacy in treating arthritis of AS. It is only useful in the \\"early stages\\" of the disease and is not effective in chronic form. Also, it is a very slow acting drug among the DMARD's.Methotrexate is some times used in ankylosing spondylitis as an alternative to sulfasalazine with varying therapeutic results.Anti tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents like ETANERCEPT & INFLIXIMAB are the most potent of the currently available therapies for AS.Ocassional oral steroids will suppress the acute disease flareups.Consult a rheumatologist and discuss all the issues.Hope this information is helpful.

You are having frontal lobe lesion on MRI which can explain the extreme fatigue, excessive sleep and sometimes depression like symptoms or low motivation to do any work - which may happen in some patients with similar histories.

I can tell you why for now. But if you like you can post a paid query to a neurosurgeon of your choice.The cause that seems most likely for your leg pains seems to be ichemia. The brain injury must have somehow caused your brain to act and reduce blood flow to the periphery. Also, since you might have had internal bleeding this might be the cause. The muscle recieveing less blood must have necrosed or started to die. This is the cause of your pain. Anyway, you should go to a neurosurgeon in person to confirm the diagnosis.

I had surgery a year later they put in rods, screws, a cage, and done a spinal fusion from T-2 through T-8. While testing before the surgery they found I also have osteoporosis of the spine, stenosis at multiple levels, degenerative disk disease and kyphosis. Anyway during surgery they found the spine wasn't straight and that it was worse then the MRI and X-rays showed. The Surgeon told my husband and family that he couldn't get the spine completely straight and the hardware could never be removed. I have been having lots of pain in the shoulders, chest, back, neck, hands and arms. At times my hands and arms feel like they are asleep and or I could be holding something in my hand and just drop it like my hand isn't even there. I can get cut doing dishes from a knife or burn my hands and not even feel it! When lifting my arms up or reaching something in my back, well the best way I can put it is, it feels as if something is pulling, snapping, and popping. I have been on Norco 7.5mg for 2 years now at first they were helpful but now they don't help at all. As of three weeks ago the doc decided to take the pain meds and told me to take Ibuprofen and over the counter Tylenol. Which I am having to take 1600mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and 1500mg of Tylenol every 4 hours and that just puts me to sleep it does nothing for the pain. I think the surgeon believes it should all be better and refuses to listen. My back burns,pulls, feels like I am being stabbed from the inside out, and just plain hurts all the time, so I went back to my surgeon whom without any new x-rays or anything, in fact the last tests he done was 3 months after my surgery and they havent even tried sending me to physical Therapy. This same doctor now tells me they need to go in and take the hardware out. I reminded him of his previous statement about the hardware havin to stay in and he replays it will be fine. My questions are is this anywhere normal, what could happen if they remove the hardware? Will i be in worse shape then I already am? Should I even consider doing the surgery to have it removed? I am very confused and in so much pain that it effects everything in my life. Anyone with any Ideas? Anything Please!","Doctor":"Thanks for writing to us.I understand that you had thoracic spinal fusion for fracture vertebra.

While you cannot modify the risk based on your age or gender, you can take certain precautions to reduce the risk for stroke. 1) Keep a watch on your blood pressure and blood sugar levels (have your hypertension and diabetes in check)2) Have physical activity as per your physician's advice. Based on your general health and your heart condition, he will prescribe you an exercise regimen.3) Eat a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low in oil and fat.4) Have mental activity - like solving the crossword, other puzzles, or reading books which will help you to avoid the other consequence of lacunar infarcts i.e. dementia (memory loss and cognitive decline). You may still consult your neurologist especially because your giddiness could be related to the small infarcts in certain brain areas. You will be prescribed medications that can bring relief of symptoms even though they may not reverse the infarcts that have already occurred."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I have flickering lower lip and also get constant flickering of upper eye lids.

Ideally, you should undergo Endoscopy to see directly, the condition of the stomach inner lining, as well as, ulcers, if any.A course of a combination of anti-acid drug, such as Lansoprazole or Rabeprazole, along with a Prokinetic drug, such as, Metoclopramide or Ondansetron, will give you complete relief. If Breath test for H.pylori turns out to be positive, a 2 weeks' course of anti-H.pylori therapy will also be needed.Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion. I am certain that he will agree with me, order required tests, and- based on the reports-  will prescribe suitable/modified treatment as advised.If you find my response helpful and informative, do not forget an “excellent” (5-star rating)  to my answer, to ENCOURAGE ALL doctors- engaged in social service- to render sound advice to the FREE queries.

I hope that your disease is diagnosed as a case of young- onset Parkinson's disease ( YPD). I am a Homoeopath and so I will be answering your query in the Homoeopathic perspective.In Homoeopathy, the name of your disease is less important. What is more important is your condition of health. The diagnosis gives us the idea which system , organ or tissue is affected. In addition to that a Homoeopath needs the diagnosis of the patient. That we will give the idea how you are reacting to the life situations. For that a detailed case taking is required. Only a Homoeopath will do it in the perfect manner.Therefore my advice to you is to approach an expert Homoeopath at the earliest. He will find for you your genetic constitutional remedy and will cure YOU. Once YOU are cured, all your neurological complaints will be disappearing. You will become free from the drugs you are taking at present. Since you were on those drugs for a prolonged period, it may take some time for you to taper the dosage of them and finally you will be free from all the medications.My best wishes for a rapid and gentle cure through Homoeopathy.Dr. C.

During these dizzy spells I wouldn t be able to walk and my legs were weak and would give out on me, they felt like jello. My vision gets so bad that I wasn t able to read things because of the moving room. I saw a doctor they said I had vertigo and gave me betahistine . I went to my family doctor for a second opinion. They said it was likely an inner ear infection and wanted to prescribe the same meds for vertigo. I still felt fuzzy for the remainder of the day. When I got dizzy again and I took the pills, they did absolutely nothing for the dizzy spell. The next day I was dizzy the entire morning to the point that it affected my job. This carried on randomly for the rest of the week. There was no connection to the dizziness and a certain activity, it would strike whenever. There was no pattern that I could notice. However, part way through the week I remembered that my family doctor had upped my prescription of Carbamazepine , which I ve been taking for nearly 2 years, from 800mg a day to 1200mg a day. I had started taking the larger dose on the Sunday before the dizziness originally started so I thought that maybe my doctor had upped the medication too quickly and it was giving me negative side effects. I was required to stay on the higher dose for 2 weeks and then get blood work done. During those two weeks I was dizzy nearly every day. After getting the blood work done I went back down to the 800mg a day dose and things seemed to get better for nearly a week. I was sure it was the pills that had caused this. Until yesterday, when I went to try snowboarding. Around 9am while waiting for the lesson to begin I started to feel hazy again. At about 9:45am during the orientation of the equipment and how to get set up I began feeling dizzy and nauseous again. This continued but I didn t say anything, my surroundings weren t spinning but I was unsteady and couldn t focus. At about 10:30am while trying to ask the instructor a question I noticed my words sounded weird. For about 5 minutes while talking I was having a really difficult time. My words were coming out slow, my mind was still quick but there was a delay in what I was thinking of saying and it actually coming out. Finally, it got to the point where the lady was asking me to repeat myself because she couldn’t understand me. I asked if I was talking weird and she said yes. It sounded as if I were drunk or handicap and my words were slow and slurred. A friend said that the right side of my face, (beside my mouth and nose), were visibly twitching and that my right eye lid was drooping. I sat down for about 5 minutes and felt a little better and I tried to continue the lesson. I remained dizzy and finished the lesson at 11:30 and then left the hill and went to the hospital. There they did a blood/urine test, ECG, CT (without contrast), and checked my blood sugar- it was 4.1, all of them came back as normal. From what I could tell they also performed the Cincinnati Stoke test a few times and four hours after my arrival they said I was okay to leave. They didn’t tell me what they thought happened or what may have caused this, only that the tests were all normal and they would refer me to a urgent neurology clinic. I got dressed and literally had to walk out holding onto the wall all the way out of the hospital because I was still so dizzy. Also, while waiting at the hospital I developed a really strong headache which was sensitive to light. It was behind my eyes and on the top of my head. Last year I took a 6 month emergency medical responder course and we learned about Strokes and TIAs. Obviously, I’m no doctor or nurse however I was showing a lot of the symptoms yesterday. I’m concerned because I don’t feel they took it seriously. The nurse had said it could be anything from migraines (I typically don’t experience head pain during these episodes), to anxiety (I’ve had several anxiety attacks and I know what they feel like, this is nothing like that), a diabetic, (I don’t have diabetes), to being extremely tired (I sleep 8 hours a night, I love my beauty sleep!). The doctor didn’t say anything about what it could be, when I asked she just said it could be anything. I’m no doctor and I’m not looking for something to be wrong but I do know that stoke is usually ruled out in young people and often misdiagnosed as migraines which is concerning. Any advice you may have would be helpful. I am 22 years old, and otherwise very healthy.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.It is unfortunate that a clear cut diagnosis has not been arrived in your case.The possibilities include peripheral vertigo due to labyrinthine dysfunction, or migraine with vertigo.

About a year ago these episodes have become more frequent and more extreme. when she passes out she will most times began to posture then convulse, sometimes violently.Her tongue has begun to swell to the point of almost suffocating her. then starting about 6 months ago she began to come out of these spells slower and slower and with longer lasting aftereffects. The most alarming being the speech impediment, plus a disorianteation as to simple things. Three days ago she was exiting the bathtub and got flushed and passed out. i was in another room but when I went to check on her she was facedown in front of the cabinet having blocked the door when falling. I flicked some water in her face and revived her enough to sit up long enough for me to squeeze through the door. Ever since then her speech is highly irregular. To the point of a retarted/ babylike quality. She believes she may have struck her head on the way down but we could find no marks or abrasions. she has failed to come back to her normal speech pattern when it usually subsides within about 30 minutes.

From the very day I hurt my back I ve had problems with bad fatigue , muscle aches and pains and also joint pains which have gradually gotten worse with each flare. Three months after my back surgery I felt really unwell with all the above problems plus worsening of back pain. Had blood tests done and my ESR came back at 104. Had more MRI s done as they thought I had an infection in my spine but to this day there is still no answer. After having these problems on and off for over a year my Rheumatologist admitted me to hospital for test after test due to a history of TB in my lymph nodes and a family history of Lupus . After a week gave they me the diagnosis of Fibromyalgia on April 2011. Hurting my back is what triggered off the Fibromaylgia badly but when I look back now I ve had some of these symptoms since I was 12 years old, now I ve just turned 29 on Tuesday just gone. My current problem is that when I do have a fibro flare (which I don t tend to get a break between) I have bad joint pains and my ESR always goes up. I can usually guess what my ESR will usually be to the exact number before my dr gives me the results and my CRP also goes up as well. I ve been trying for last couple of years for my Rheumatologist to listen to me and tell him that when I do have a flare my ESR goes up and get the bad joint pains and I know that Fibromyalgia isn t an inflammatory condition. The last 3 times my Rheumy has seen me he s just brushed me off and said that its just normal for me. So now have stopped seeing him and waiting for a second opinion but have to wait til end of May and having a family history of Lupus, I like to definitely have that ruled out. When I do flare my ESR goes up, CRP but not all the time, I become anaemic, sometimes my white cell count goes up with no reason, bad joint pain (especially the knees, wrists, fingers and sometimes the toes) my hair falls out in handfuls, become extremely sensitive to sunlight which usually ends up in a migraine, swollen glands in throat, armpits and groin and mouth ulcers which I don t all the time and I m starting to notice a lot of dizziness. Then there is all the common Fibro symptoms on top of that aswell so not sure if its just that causing them or if it s something else. The reason why I want the lupus ruled out is because I have a brother (whom I have nothing to do with) who gets a raised scaly red rash across his nose and cheek area when he becomes run down and then also have 2 other family members that have Ulcerative colitis which are all on my dad s side of the family including the Lupus. My ESR has been up to 104 at its highest but usually sits around high 50 s to mid 60 s. When I was diagnosed with Fibro, it was at it s lowest it has ever been which was 33. In my last blood test a just over a month ago my ESR was up to 78 and CRP of 15. I had tested weakly positive to Barmah Forest Virus from mosquitos and dr had thought that had been the cause of the pain and fatigue but a second test a couple of weeks later had ruled it out. So the high ESR is still a mystery!! The only thing that is helping with the pain especially in the joints when the ESR does go up is steroids. I m due to have another blood test next week but have a feeling that it will be high again as I ve had quite a busy and stressful week and going through a flare at the moment. Have been tested over and over again and all tests for Lupus and other autoimmune disorders come back negative. I know that Fibromyalgia doesn t cause my high ESR problems and my Rheumatologist did think I had PMR at one stage but wasn t diagnosed with it.

What does a broad based annular disc bulge at L5/S1 with anterior theca distortion mean? There is disc material seen impinging onto the exiting S1 nerve root. Also disc bulge at L3/4 and L4/5. I frequently have quite severe pain across my lower back and this creates sciatic nerve pain through my legs. I have pulling, pinching sensations. I can have intense burning in the back of my thighs, pain on the outer part of my calf and pain shooting intensely into the middle of my heal. I can also experience some loss of feeling in my legs. I would greatly appreciate it if I could get a more detailed explanation of what is happening inside me and what kind of exercises could best help me manage this problem. Thankyou, AAAAA","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicBetween the vertebra (the bones in the back), there are discs. These discs are made up of an outer ring called the annulus fibrosis and an inner part called the nucleus pulposus.The bulge that was seen between L5 vertebra and S1 vertebra was a bulging of the outside ring or annulus.The theca is a sheath covering the spinal cord, due to the bulging of the annulus, there is also is distortion of this sheath.The imaging also saw bulging between L3 and L4 vertebra and L4 and L5 vertebra.The bulging disc is compressing the nerve that is exiting from the S1 vertebra or bone at the level of S1.These results would definitely contribute to your pain. Your doctor would likely suggest referral to the physiotherapist.The physiotherapist would be able to demonstrate exercises that may help you.You may also need medication to help reduce your symptoms.It can sometimes take a months,sometimes up to a year for improvements to be seen.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"i have very serious  lower back problems i  applied for the chronic pain pension was refused be cause of  something called  Dish  since 1978 my back was hurt the lumburg spine and others  dish was discovered in2001  i dont under how this  caused my pain as WCB treated me  all them years the also  went back to 1978 takeing away my  payment for prescriptions i take 60 mgs  every day plus other  drugs can you tell me if  that would have been there since 1978  and well i am also a diabitic and upon reading up on this  this also causes  the dish i have your in put would be greatly appriciated Bob Power","Doctor":"Hi,The causes of back pain are many like disc problem, musculoskeletal problems etc. You need a clinical examination to diagnose the condition so that we can plan appropriate investigations.

I was hospitalized for 3 days, all the tests have shown ok. The Neurologist said it is vestibular neuronitis.  I have been patient waiting to get better.  I went to visit Eye Dr and ENT Dr, they all told me they look ok too.  Now I'm seeing physical therapy.  The first visit to physical therapy she found out I do have BPPV because she saw my right eye was moving while lying down.  So she correct it with Epley Moneuver.  It has been one week, my dizziness still there.  Can you assist with my problem?  How long the dizziness can last?  Any other ways can make my dizziness go away?  Can the Moneuver be repeat?  How can Physical therapist tell if Epley Moneuver works or not?  Thank you so much!","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM.Thank you for your query.The fact that you have been experiencing dizziness for this long, does suggest you could be suffering from vertigo.The most common form of vertigo is BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo). In this condition, crystals are former in the semi-circular canal, which result in nystagmus (movement of the eye in the fashion the examiner described), vertigo (dizziness) in certain positions, etc.The mainstay treatment for BPPV is the Epley maneuver. This maneuver is a very tricky one, and can only be performed by an experienced and well-trained individual; through which the crystals are removed out from their current location.This might take more than one attempt, so yes, this can be repeated, and must be repeated till all the crystals can be removed.The Epley maneuver is designed in such a way, that the crystals should be expelled, but as this can vary from person-to-person, we cannot be completely sure whether they were expelled or not. What most therapists do is, to wait and watch if the patients complaints subside within 24 hours, and if the patient reports to him/her again, the first attempt was not completely sucessful.The dizziness will almost completely disappear immediately, provided your diagnosis of BPPV is accurate (and the cause for your vertigo) and the crystals are successfully expelled. In the meantime, you can request for medication, which patients with vertigo are usually treated (eg. betahistine hydrochloride). Please also make sure you do not make any swift head movements, and be slow while changing positions (supine to seated, standing to seated, etc.).I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for.

I am glad to know that you have a doctor's appointment scheduled.  I believe that the best thing to do at this point is to wait for your doctor's appointment and explain to the doctor in detail about your problems, and give a detailed history.  This should prompt a detailed physical examination and necessary laboratory work and imaging studies such as an MRI.  If you have previous reports from prior physicians it would be helpful.  I also believe that you might need medications until all the tests are back to help deal with the pain and it is not unusual for the doctor to prescribe one.  If it does not happen please ask for it during the consultation itself, so as to help with the pain.  There are many surgical procedures that can help correct your condition and relieve your pain, so do not be anxious.I hope this helps.

Now these blocks of bones and connected to each other by spongy cushions called discs between them. At the posterior part of the pillar and behind the discs we have the spinal cord running down from the neck to the tail region.In your report, the disc at L4-5 (lower back) is showing some degenerative changes. Further there is a slight increase in the posterior transition of the disc at that level.At L5-S1 level, the disc might have got fragmented due to degenerative process.For you it means that if the pain is severe and unbearable, please let your doctor know and they will guide you towards a pain free future.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi.ive just had mri and shows horizotal tear of body and posterior horn of the medial meniscus with inferior artcula extension plus subchondral cyst formation at the anterior root of lateral meniscus.plus keeps filling up with fluid have had drained four timed alredy plus two cortosion injection the pain is very bad whats next can you advice","Doctor":"Hi,I understand that you just had a MRI and earlier you have had fluid drainage with cortisone injection.Coming to your MRI findings, horizontal tear body and posterior horn of medial meniscus and subchondral cyst formation, there is a need to see an orthopedic surgeon.The situation is not serious but there is always a discomfort associated with meniscal tears.If your doctor suggests, please go in for a curative surgery.

MRI was done every 6 months for one year then every year with no significant changes but my MRI that was done this year recently last 2/21/2013 rebealed an enhancing mass at the left parafalcine vertex is slightly increased in size since the prior exam, measuring 3.5x3.5x2.1cm formerly 3.3x2.4x2.3 cm at a similar level. The mass has broad dural base, compatible with a meningioma. As previous, the mass appears heteregeneous in its superior aspect with GRE hypointensity suggesting a possible calcification. There is a stable degree of mild surrounding vasogenic edema. No new enhancing lesions are visualized. I am waiting for a neurosurgeon consult. I was told the radiosurgery is ony a one time treatment. If craniotomy is the trreatment option for now, how dangerous the surgery can be? Are there major blood vessels involved in the location of the mass? How fast is the recovery after surgery and what are expected neurological deficits. Please advise, I'm really scared about the surgery. Thank you, appreciate your response.","Doctor":"Hi,As you have told, you are suffering from a meningioma presently measuring 3.5x3.5x2.1cm which was earlier 3.3x2.4x2.3 cm in left parafalcine vertex location.Coming to your specific question on surgery, any surgery to do with the head is not simple. However, in your condition (meningioma), most surgeries are safe with minimal associated complications.Further, there are no major blood vessels in that part of the brain where the meningioma has formed. The recovery in your surgery will be real fast and you will be able to do almost every thing as you are doing now. Your doctor may give you few medicines immediately after the surgery.Please consult a neurosurgeon and I am sure you will be cured soon.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi there i have been having this problem for 6 years. 1 day i was sitting there after waking up in the morning i think i was 16 at the time (now 22) and i scratched my head and i felt a dip in my skull it was big enough for me to put my pinky in. i kept it secret for a long time but now the dip has grown i can only describe as it has flattened my skull i am all ways wearing a cap as i am so embarrassed. it is all most the size of my hand now but another worrying thing is that i can hear what has been described as pop rocks in the head i get the noise (you can feel the noise in your head) all around the miss shaped side of my skull and i get it all around my neck 2 and the other day i started getting pains in my head they were severe and i did a symptoms check and i could only match it up to cluster headake i hope someone can help me plaese","Doctor":"Hello,You are ignoring the problem for the last 6 years.Please consult a neurosurgeon immediately and get a CT scan or MRI scan of your head as per their advise.We need to know what is happening (CT scan or MRI scan will detail this) so that a good treatment option can be advised to you.Do not feel embarrassed and get a cure at the earliest.Hope it helps."},{"Patient":"Can rolling off a pelatius ball during a gym workout cause serious damage especially if the person  hit the back of his  head against a iron clad wall edge - person got hit at the  medulla oblongata area.

As a doctor belonging to a different system of treatment, it is also painful to read your letter . You were made to believe that your father will be improving by the twelve medicines he is taking at present and hundreds of medicines might have been pushed into his system with the same assurances  in the recent past. From experiences you should learn.Dear friend, you are invited to imagine a train accident taken place because of the loose bolts connecting between two iron plates of the rails. it was a small problem to start with, which could have got repaired by an ordinary labourer with least technology, but a great calamity when the compartments of the fast running train got derailed and fell into a river killing hundreds and injuring thousands. It is painful to see and painful to read. Your father had shown several simple symptoms in the past, but you were administering medicines which were very strong and addressing those symptoms and never trying to cure the disease. Disease is a very deep dynamic problem caused fundamentally by the genetic tendencies of an individual, we call them Miasms in Homoeopathy. They may be precipitated by the exciting life situations. Symptoms are manifested through mind and body symptoms. So a fundamental treatment taking into account his mental make up, physical make up and general make up was to be done in the initial period of his life. My intention is not to give you further disappointments. But my advise is to drop or taper the quantity of chemical drugs administered into the weak body of your father and then to approach an expert Homoeopathic physician who can give relief for the suffering patient. He will pick up individualizing characteristic genetic symptoms shown by your father and will give safe and simple remedies, to bring him back to better mental attitudes and dispositions. With best wishes for a rapid relief for your father through Homoeopathy,Dr. C. J.

The medicines that can be tried are acetazolamide, steroids and furosamide.Among shunts lumboperitoneal shunts are more advised than ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Usually a shunt works for high pressure headaches, but the headache may be replaced by low-pressure headaches. Papilleda may be relieved. Only 38% showed vision improvement.

I have checked it on a few occasions since and it remains throbbing. My blood pulse when I took it was about 80 - normally it is about mid to upper 60s. The pulse throbbing remains visible. I am currently on a lot of medication for sciatica and wonder if this could be the cause. I am also continuing to have a lot of pain re the sciatica which an MRI scan has revealed to most likely be spinal stenosis - bone spurs pressing on the nerves at the base of my spine. Should I contact my Doctor about the pulse issue?","Doctor":"Hello,Your pulse rate as per your count is 80/Mt. Normal count rate is 72/Mt. Count rate can be enhanced in so many conditions - smoking, anemia, fever, stress, anxiety, worry and so many causes. Throbbing may be due to the increased volume by lowering peripheral resistance.Otherwise 80/mt do not produce any symptoms.The problem in the spine is not a dangerous sign (slow progressive problems) and do not warrant for immediate surgery as you don't have the extension of pain to your lower limbs. A few changes in your life and work style and sleeping without pillows, some physiotherapy and medications will relieve the pain. I don't understand why too much of medications for your spine problem. Anyhow whatever I have expressed is my opinion. You have to discuss with a Neuro surgeon for the treatment of your spine problem.Regarding your throbbing pulse take an ECG and necessary blood test to evaluate your cardio vascular system and treat accordingly.I wish you a speedy recoveryWith warmest regards"},{"Patient":"Hello.

Through the years I've had a lot of neck and back pain. In 2008 I had a cervical fusion of C4-C7. I am in severe pain all the time. I had a MRI in 2010 and one a few weeks ago. I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia as well, so I'm not sure if the chronic, severe pain is from the neck problems, the fibromyalgia, or both. I had to quit work due to the pain makes me sick at times, severe headaches. legs & hands give out and tire very easily. I am a 41 year old female. This is very frustrating to me. I feel like if it keeps progressing, I'm not going to be able to do much of anything. I can tell it just continues to get worse. This is the MRI results from 2010-There has been anterior fusion of c5, c6 & c7 with surgical screws & an anterior plate creating metal artifacts. Hypertrophic changes of the odontoid process & associated atlas are noted without narrowing of the adjacent subarachnoid space. There is no visible abnormality of the cervical spinal cord. At c4-5, osteoarthritic changes of the left facet joint are noted. There is a mild left-sided neural foraminal encroachment. There is bulging of the c4-5 disc without focal disc herniation or obliteration of the anterior subarachnoice space. No cord compression. At c6-7, posterior osteophyte formation without neural foraminal encroachment or disc herniation is noted . Ok now this is the results of the one I had a couple of months ago. There are postop changes consistent with an anterior fusion from c4-c7 with a compression plate transfixed of the vertebral bodies with screws at all three levels. There is a mild to moderate disc space narrowing at c4-5 and mild disc narrowing the AP diamter of the thecal sac to 10mm and very mildling effacing/flattening the cervical spinal cord. No significant spinal canal stenosis is seen at the surgical site. The neuroforamina are patent though there is mild right foraminal stenosis at c6-7 due to hypertrophic changes of uncovertebral joint. The visualized portions of the posterior fossa is unremarkable. So my question is has my problems progressed from 2010 to now, and are all these issues enough to cause this severe pain, numbness, & weakness in hands and legs. Or is it a combination of this plus the fibromyalgia. I try to go get a massage when I can afford it. The lady that does my massages said I have huge knots in my neck and shoulder muscles. She can never get them worked out completely. The massage does help at the time, and for a short time afterwards, but never last. I have tried injections and physical therapy. Nothing helps for any amount of time. Some days are so painful, I can hardly stand it. My neurosurgeon says another surgery is definetly in my future, but he wants to try and treat me with facet injections for as long as possible because I am so young.

I have limited mobility in my neck already, so I know that another surgery would probably make it impossible for me to continue to drive. I would appreciate another opinion.

I am currently taking Percocet 10-325 four times a day, however this is not helping.  The main problem I am encountering is the both the strength of the medication and duration that the medication lasts for.  I have spoken to my doctor about this problem, and he gave me a choice of several other pain relief medications that I can try.  They are Oxycodone, Oxycontin supplemented with Percocet, and MS Contin.  I am wondering which of these medications would have the longest duration of pain relief, while at the same time delivering a stronger effect than the Percocet I am currently taking.  As an aside, I have had both Percocet 10-325 and Oxycodone 10 available to me at the same time due to a prescription mix up.  When these two medications were taken together, they alleviated my pain completely for more than the 6 hour time period that the dose was supposed to perform for, and allowed me to take regular Percocet 10-325 for the rest of the day without any significant increase in pain.  However, this solution in and of itself has not been something that has worked as well as I hoping it would work.My question is, of the options I have been offered, keeping in mind they are the only ones available to me at this given time, I need to know not only which would be the most efficient and longest lasting, but also, mot probably the safest.I would also like to add that during two recent visits to the hospital, each of which lasted one week, I was given 4 mg of morphine every 6 hours with no ill effects whatsoever.Thank you for any advice you can offer.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.It is unfortunate that you are suffering from severe pain, following Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS).I see many patients with GBS and about half of them have severe neuropathic pain.Most of them get better with pregabalin and gabapentin.

This pattern is atypical.  This could represent a small actively demyelinating plaque from demyelinating disease.  A late subacute or early chronic lacunar infarcts may also have this appearance.  This could also represent very early mild ischemic white matter disease.  Regardless, followup as indicated.  Recommended six-month MRI with gadolinium.  I am curious as to your impression of the MRI and what this could mean?  I have had severe vertigo off & on for about 17 years which usually happens about twice a year for at least a month at a time & is very debilitating.

Other cause could be lack of blood flow to brain (ischemia). the exact diagnosis would be confirmed once your neurologist has seen you and the MRI.

Apple cider that has been boiled down to syrup, taken by tablesspoon as a tonic, can ease enlarged spleen.  Milk thistle supplement, in the form of a capsule or tablet supports liver and spleen function. The two organs work closely together, and an enlarged spleen is often caused by an overworked liver.  A diet high in fruit, along with plenty of water, will help keep the lymphatic system clean. Increase intake of high-fiber fruits such as apples, bananas and blueberries.When suffering from an enlarged spleen, avoid fatty and processed foods. These foods are difficult to digest and put significant strain on the liver and spleen.  Increase water intake to shrink spleen.  Also add dark green leafy vegetables, such as spinach and kale, dried prunes, dried raisins.  Wish you speedy recovery.  Thank you"},{"Patient":"Hi .  I have back pain.

I had a cervical epidural injection for neck pain and arm numbness and pain (all on the left side) 11 days ago. I was under under anesthesia for the procedure but did not notice any concerning pain upon waking. When I went home for recovery I had severe soreness, enough I could barely sleep. but it seemed to get better after three days. Six days after the injection I felt the injection site still looked like a hump on my back and that I was having severe occipital neuralgia up the back of my head. My neurologist gave me topamax and told me to visit with my pain management specialist that gave me the injection. I tried to get a hold of him for two days and could not get a phone call returned (since the day before I went to the neurologist). Because my pain increased and I developed the worst headache of my life, like something was sitting inside my skull and hurting the front of my face and the nerves on the back of my head have become so sensitive I cannot touch them without my head feeling like it is going to explode or is on fire from pressure and pain, I went to the hospital the Friday (I think day seven, maybe day 8) after the procedure. The ER Drs. thought it might be a spinal headache because of the pain locations, however, the headache did not, and does not, get immediately better when I am flat, and because it presented itself almost a week away from the injection it made the diagnosis unclear. The Emergency room surgeon talked to me and said even if it is a dural puncture that no one does cervical blood patches because they are too dangerous. They did a CT scan that only showed only a 10 mm sublenticular cyst, incidentally noted on the right side. They sent me home with pain meds and steroids and told me to come back if the pain worsens. I went again to the hospital on sunday night, day 10, due to increased pain at site of injection and increased feeling of pain and pressure in neck and head. Also, when I would lay flat on my back the pressure on the back of my head and/or injection site caused me to feel like my blood pressure around my head was terrible and my heart rate would rise suddenly or fall suddenly . I am unsure if this was due to stress or related to the cause of my pain. The ER doctor ordered an MRI. He said there was nothing that gave him an idea as to what exactly was causing the problem and suggested it was some sort complication from the injection but could not tell if it was just irritation or something else. I was sent home and told to contact my pain management Dr. I noticed there was a small difference in the MRI findings and I want to post the original MRI impressions and the post epidural injection MRI impression and ask that you explain the differences. The pain management Dr. said that the differences were really only in the wording from the different radiologists. There is a specific part that I am interested in. The reason I want to have this explained is because my pain management Dr. seemed very certain there was nothing he could do for me and my symptoms and then after asking him what direction I should take and if I should see a specialist he said he wanted to try a cervical blood patch in two days. He wants me to stay home and rest and drink caffeine and see if I improve. He said my symptoms represent some aspects of a spinal dural puncture headache but others do not. If I had no improvement in these two days he will go ahead with the blood patch in the thoracic region right below the original injection site. By the time I went in for this office visit I could only lay on my side for some relief. Laying on the cervical site or on my head or standing made things worse. However, as I am typing this the pain and pressure has increased and I am no longer able to lay down at all in any direction for relief. It is very scary, as you can imagine. There is also more stiffness around my neck and spine and down my back. It feels like there is just a tight squeeze on my spine. The heaviness inside my head is not letting up. The point of this is that I called him tonight to discuss whether I should be seen in the ER due to worsening symptoms. He said no and to rest and we will do the blood patch in two days. I asked about alternative diagnosis possibilities because he says he is unclear of the diagnosis and the only other possibility we talked about was a cervical hematoma because of the pressure and pain at the injection site. He said this is unlikely, however, because of how long it was been since the injection and because the MRI did not pick up on it. I reminded him that the MRI did not pick up on a dural puncture and he also said that the spinal headache was a small chance as well. If both a hematoma and a dural punture are low possibilities, but possibilities, why does he choose to one possibility over the other? Also, if there is pressure on my spinal cord and he attempts the blood patch, this pressure will increase and might cause harm if it is not a dural puncture, but in fact is a hematoma or some other pressure issue on my dural sac or spinal cord. How do I know the difference? How does he? Should he be preforming this cervical blood patch without the consult of experienced surgeons about alternative diagnosis or risks considering he is uncertain as to the diagnosis? Should he be preforming a cervical blood patch in a surgical center? Would I be better off in the hospital for the procedure in case of emergency complications? What would you do if it was you or your loved one? Please think carefully and let me know your advice. This is so important to me and I need a bit of direction as to what I need to be asking and demanding for and what possibilities there are I may not be aware of. Thank you for any help. A quick reply is needed. The MRI before and after impressions are posted below. 1st MRI Before Cervical Epidural Injection: Impression- 1. Uncovertabral arthropathy result in moderate to severe left foraminal stenosis at C5-C6 and mild to moderate left foraminal stensosis as C6-7. 2. No spinal stenosis 3. Focal t2 hyperintense nodules within the strap muscles are nonspecific. Consider ultrasound for further evaluation.  Impressions from MRI after the Injection, which is from the ER visit two days ago. 1. No evidence of epidural abscess 2. Posterior disk osteophyte complex at C5-6 with partial effacement of the anterior thecal sac and moderate to left neural foraminal narrowing.  Back to my question...or one of my questions....could the partial effacement of the anterior thecal sac be causing these terrible symptoms? Is there a notable risk that there could be more compression and damage to the thecal sac if I have the blood patch in the thoracic region? Please, do read through and be very thorough about all my questions. I know there are a lot, but I need each one to get attention and receive an answer please. Thank you so much. I really need any help I can get in this frightening and painful situation.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting this query.I have gone through the details of your symptoms, MRI spine, CT scan brain and the complication you have developed following CESI  (cervical epidural steroid injection) diligently. I understand your pain and have multiple unanswered questions. I shall proceed to provide my opinion which I hope can help you. Should you have any doubts/have unanswered questions, please write back to me. Your MRI cervical spine is consistent  with uncovertebral arthropathy resulting in moderate to severe left foraminal stenosis at C5-C6 and mild to moderate left foraminal  stenosis as C6-7.Uncovertebral joints are formed between uncinate processes below, and the uncus above. They are located in the cervical region of the vertebral column between C3 and C6. Two lips project upward from the superior surface of the vertebral body below, and one projects downward from the inferior surface of vertebral body above. They allow for flexion and extension and limit lateral flexion in the cervical spine. Arthropathy is a degenerative disease and in your case involving these jointsRepeat MRI cervical spine following CESI also reveals the same arthropathy of uncovertebral joints but in different radiology words. These means the major complication - which include Dural and epidural hematoma, epidural abscess, spinal cord rupture, infarction of spinal cord - following CESI has been ruled out. Further compication following CESI depends upon the approaches (which you have not mentioned). By now you would have known that CESI done by two approaches interlaminar and transforaminal approach. Complications reported with transforaminal cervical epidural steroid injections include neck pain, transient increased radicular pain, nausea, vasovagal reaction, dural puncture, non-specific headache, abscess, paralysis, and cord injury. And complications reported with interlaminar cervical epidural steroid injections include dural puncture, bloating, nausea and vomiting, vasovagal reaction, facial flushing, fever, nerve root injury, pneumocephalus, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, stiff neck, Cushing’s syndrome, transient paresthesias, hypotension, respiratory insufficiency, transient blindness, epidural transient lightheadedness, dyspepsia, fluid retention, transient global amnesia, vertebral artery injury, paralysis, cord infarction and cerebellar infarction. Lastly incidence of dural puncture with interlaminar CESI ranges from 0.25% to 2.00% and transforaminal CESI is 1.12%With this back ground details, the following possibility need to be considered responsible for your headache1) Spinal headache2) Dural puncture3) Arachnoiditis (steroids and lidocaine are injected during epidural steroid injection to give better symptomatic relief, This itself can cause inflammation of arachnoid membrane )4) Chemical meningitis (mild tear in dura which cannot be picked by MRI, this cause blood to come in contact with arachnoid space and irritate producing similar complaints5) Secondary bacterial infection( Even though strict aseptic precautions taken during CESI still there is risk for infection)These (above) are the possible causes where your MRI cervical spine does not show any fresh lesion. Therefore my suggestions for you in view of your unbearable pain and neuralgic symptoms are1) Get hospitalized for observation, vitals monitoring, Neurological observation for meningeal signs , and deficits .Take bed rest and IV fluids for hydration. Coffee can be continued. 2) A short course intravenous steroids such as intravenous dexamethasone can be given to take care of arachnoiditis and chemical meningitis (if any)3) Flupirtine maleate can be used to relieve painful symptoms.4) Get your blood tested - blood count, ESR, blood culture and blood sugar. The test preferable should be done before starting steroids5) If total leucocyte count is raised, you may require CSF penetrans antibiotics parenterally (ceftriaxone + Staphylococcal sensitive antibiotics) to take care of bacterial infectionThe above regiment should take care of your symptoms by a week's time. Else blood dural patch can be considered. As such, the autologous blood does not \\"repair\\" the leak, but rather treats the symptoms. Discuss with your treating doctor/neurologist about this protocol of evaluation and treatment.Finally - Is there a notable risk that there could be more compression and damage to the thecal sac if I have the blood patch in the thoracic regionAns: Your query regarding further worsening of thecal sac after patch is not possible as indentation are at cervical disc level and patch is planned at thoracic level.RegardsDr sandhya ManorenjNeurologistHi tech city Hyderabad"},{"Patient":"Dear could you tel me, a 13 year boy got birth in a family whos parents get married in relation.

Problem of this disease is this formed clot may dislodge and travel through heart and might obstruct large artery which is known as Pulmonary artery also known as Pulmonary embolism.Pulmaonary Embolism (PE) is potential life threatening condition, people can dye immediately in main pulmonary artery is obstructed. To prevent this life threatening condition blood thinner(anticoagulant) is used (warfarin or low molecular weight heparin) and if can correct underlying risk factor then it will be required life longManagement of anticoagulant is real challenging and things become more tricky if there is increased chance of blooding for example in your situation it is hemorrhoids they can bleed in the presence of anticoagulant. We usually keep  balance if it actually starts to bleed then temporarily we stop blood anticoagulant and fix the bleeding problem and restart anticoagulantFor any procedure or operation then again temporarily stop anticoagulant and restart initially short acting anticoagulant injections post procedure. After few days when there no increase risk of bleed then we switch on long acting oral anticoagulant You discuss with whole issue with treating doctor and request them to have good liaisoning among different specialty doctor because require of one speciality may be undesirable to other and we have to find mid way toreduce the risk of life first then reduce the morbidityHope this answers your query.

There is no guarantee that you will be more comfortable after the surgery on our spine. At least take some time to think very seriously before undergoing surgery. It is a wrong notion that your problem is because of the mechanical alterations in your spine and spinal cord. It can be the other way. You had some problems earlier and that is why your disc material protruded and made compression on nerves. Your two times diffusion was only a mechanical correction. As a Homoeopath, I would suggest you to approach an expert Homoepath and get his treatment. Most probably you had a very shocking conflict before the attack of back ache and this was repeated in subsequent episodes. They are not resolved. Physical expression is only a subsequent manifestation following the mental problem. Resolve the problems in the mental level by a good counselling and take homoeopathic treatment from a good Homoeopath. From my experience of 35 years of Homoeopathic treatment in a classical manner, I can assure you that it is the mental causes that produce this sort of disc problems and they can be corrected through Homoeopathic treatment after taking into consideration, the mental, physical and general make ups of the patient.

I have seen several specialists and they have no idea what is wrong with me. One said it was seizures but had no evidence of it. For the past few years now I have been having \\"blackouts.\\" I call them this because I haven't heard of anything like them before. They are brought on for no reason, although they have happened more frequently and gotten more severe since I had my son 8 months ago. They consist of me going blind in both eyes and sometimes I get a headache, my ears ring, and parts of my head go numb (most of the time in my mouth and ears). I do not pass out and can still move, talk, and have my eyes open (though I cannot see anything). One time I fell down and started twitching but it hasn't happened again since. What could this be!?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.The most likely diagnosis in your case is migraine with visual aura. It is common to have blindness in visual aura, which is followed by headaches. The episode with twitching is likely to have been a seizure attack. It is not uncommon for migraine and seizure to co-exist as both have common underlying causes, and some medications used for treating migraine and seizures are also common.In your case, the best drugs to treat your problem would be either topiramate or divalproex.Please get back if you require any additional information.Best wishes,Dr Sudhir Kumar MD (Internal Medicine), DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant NeurologistApollo Hospitals, Hyderabad,My personal URL on this website:   My email: drsudhirkumar@yahoo.com"},{"Patient":"Hi, my name is Kyle. I have tethered spinal cord syndrome. I had the tethered spinal cord release surgery back in 2006.

On top of these 2 symptoms I get mild to very painful ejaculations which lead to urinating all over the place. Now I have had this symptom ever since the surgery, and I never did get it checked out, but it has been making me wonder and question what is causing it.

Also he is a Skin Cancer survivor in which the treatment after surgery was to self inject Interferon for a certain length of time.  He was supposed to take anti-depressants along with this treatment, which he did not take.  Could this have had an effect on the dopamine levels or depletion of dopamine in his brain causing this very quick onset of Parkinson's?   Thanking YouBonnie Thorpe","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. Thank you for your query.This is not well investigated yet, but environmental factors arent playing such a big role in parginsons development and progression All these things you ve said are not proven to have effects on parkinsons.PArkinsons is neurological, genetically determined and it is hard to predict will it occur and how fast will this progress. ANtidepressants have no effect too, I dont think this is important anyway.All you need now is to find appropriate therapy for your nephew.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"my euthanasia tube has been blocked for years.

Many are benign, while some are malignant.NETs are believed to arise from various neuroendocrine cells whose normal function is to serve at the neuroendocrine interface. Neuroendocrine cells are present not only in endocrine glands throughout the body that produce hormones, but also diffused in all body tissues. In your case it affects spine so peripheral nervous system is affected,it can be either neuroblastoma or paraganglioma or schwannoma.So pain will be more of neuralgic in nature.You require pregablin 75 mg once daily then increase to twice daily as per your symptoms plus amitryptilline /nortryptilline 10mg bed time.Hope this will help you.RegardsDr Sandhya ManorenjNeurophysicianHi Tech city Hyderabad"},{"Patient":"I live in Buffalo, NY.

Is there any way to look up credientials and results of surgeries performed by a specific doctor in our area.  The doctor that we have been dealing with is Dr. Robert D. Galpin of University Orthopedics who supposedly specializes in pediatric scoliosis but we can't find any information on him besides from the University Orthopedic website.","Doctor":"Hi,Early or mild symptoms of adult degenerative scoliosis may respond well to non-surgical treatments. Physical therapy can improve strength and flexibility in the trunk and legs, while nutritional changes and aerobic exercise can help patients lose weight, thereby decreasing the stress on the lumbar spine. Injections into the epidural space or into the spinal joints may help decrease inflammation and reduce back or leg pain, and alternative treatments such as acupuncture may also give relief. Bracing does not usually provide satisfactory relief.In some patients, symptoms may progress in spite of non-surgical care. This is often the case when a nerve root is chronically compressed.  Surgery may then be appropriate.

Clinically speaking, retrolisthesis is the opposite of spondylolisthesis (anterior displacement of one vertebral body on the subjacent vertebral body)Initial treatment strategies are aimed at controlling and reducing the pain. These include:Nutritious Food –Although this seems to be a very common suggestion by most of the physicians, taking nutritious food that aids in the repair of the soft tissues of the spine is very helpful. The required nutrients include:Zincis an essential element for the proper utilization of vitamin A. Shrimps and oysters are rich sources of zinc. Without zinc, this vitamin does not get released from the liver.Vitamin Awhich aids in tissue repair can be obtained from cod liver oil, butter, orange and yellow vegetables etc.Copperplays a key role in adding strength to ligaments and membranes by cross linking the proteins.Vitamin Cacts as a tissue builder and an antioxidant.Glucosamineis essential for cartilage repair (1500mg/day).Wateris a required component of spinal disc cartilage and aids in the height of the intervertebral disc. The taller the disc the more taut the fibers in it.Manganeseaids in cross linking the proteins.Reposition of the displaced vertebra –The position of the displaced vertebra needs to be corrected in order to decrease the irritation of the nerves and to reduce unnecessary stress on the soft tissues of the spinal column.Weight Reduction –Being overweight puts pressure and stress on the spine that may lead to back related disorders, especiallyRetrolisthesis.Hence it is advised by the doctors to maintain healthy body weight.Microcurrent Therapy –This technique not only stimulates tissue repair but also controls the pain. Through this therapy, the energy components of the cells (ATP) are increased. Since this is like a boost to the spine, cells can perform all tasks including cell repair effectively.Surgery –This treatment option should be given a nod only after trying all or some of the above therapies and the patients still do not find symptomatic relief.Taking some precautions such as sitting in a proper posture, having nutritious food and exercising regularly can prevent.Hope this would help youRegardsDr Sandhya ManorenjNeurologistHi tech city hyderabad"},{"Patient":"My daughter has a pea sized lump at the base of her skull.

If possible please upload fresh MRI to help you to understand your spine problem.Thanks."},{"Patient":"hi this is Eleni in 2011 i had difficulties when i talk i had slurred speech and when i tried to walk i couldn't control my right leg also my right hand it was shaking an voluntarily and then my doctor was investigation and decided to treat me again TB because already i treated when i was in Ethiopia 10 years ago and again when i came London 9 years again they treat me as well  but this wasn't enough so my doctors said maybe because of that this happening so they treated me again for six months and i was four months pregnant ......everything was back to normal and i was so happy ................ but after i finished my medication maybe after two or three months i have become experienced different different things  such as my half left head,face, ear, neck,hand,arm,and leg so much hurting like sharp pain and it comes every one hour my doctor told me may come nerve and i had three time MRI the result there is some inflammation come from my back side but its not MS or Nerve  so am confused and i don't know what to do i can't sleep night time","Doctor":"Hi Ms Eleni, Thank you for contacting Healthcare magic. I have read your details, and it is unfortunate that despite treatment, you have not improved much. It would be useful, if you can upload a copy of the MRI report, so that we can give a better answer. For relief of symptoms, you could take pregabalin capsules.

I suffer from a pilonidal cyst. Yesterday I had a general surgeon lance and pack it. I am on antibiotics. Since the cyst began infected I have been suffering from a bad fever, chills, tiredness, loss of appetite, and nauseous. I have also noticed my lumbar area is really hot and incredibly swollen. Should I be worried? What should I do ?","Doctor":"Thanks for writing to us.Pilonidal cyst is usually at the coccyx and the lower end of the sacrum. Fusion is unlikely to get infected due to cyst. Swelling in that area is common due to cyst infection. However I would suggest to treat the infection aggressively and may be with IV antibiotics. Any such infection can cause bactremia and secondary lodging of the bacteria at the implant. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 24 years old and I delivered my first child when I was 21. The pregnancy was perfect, no troubles. I had an epidural for birthing pain and right after the epideral was taken out (after delivering) I had extreme back pain. Come to find out, I have congenital spinal stenosis and a disc (L-5 S1)  that herniated during or close to my delivery.  I had surgery done 3 days after giving birth on the disc. I've been seeing my Spinal surgeon off and on for the past two years. We've been talking alot about myself having another pregnancy.  Besides rest in the later months and physical therapy again, he keeps saying, \\"There's no way to tell what may happen during delivery.\\" I know I can't have an epidural, should I do a c-section? I'm worried about birthing and my back herniating again.","Doctor":"Thanks for writing to us. Pregnancy is not contraindicated.  Unfortunately you had disc herniation but it does not mean it will happen again. There is a risk of having back pain due to increase load on spine. I would suggest to go ahead with pregnancy and dont worry about spine. Prophylactic c section to avoid disc herniation may not be a good option. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My wife just has spinal surgery and is on a combo of oxycodone and Tylenol for pain relief. Her stool is dark sort of grainy soft like baby poop and really stinks.  Her hemorroids are killing her.  She has a supository for the H's.  I have been giving her metamucil in the evening along with a colace and miralax.  What kind of food should she be eating?","Doctor":"Oxycodone cause constipation. Try to minimise the dose. She should take more of green salad leafy vegetables and soft diet. Avoid having high protein diet for time being. Please take lots of water. More of walking around. Things will improve over a period. If pain is under control then opt for non opiod pain killer.
