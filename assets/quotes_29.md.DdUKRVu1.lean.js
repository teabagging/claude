Identify the relationship between price change and sales volume change: It's given that when the selling price is 99 yuan, the daily sales volume is 300 items. For every 1 yuan decrease in price, the sales volume increases by 3 items. This implies a linear relationship between the selling price x and the sales volume.2. Formulate the sales volume as a function of x: Since the sales volume increases by 3 items for each 1 yuan decrease from 99 yuan, we can express the sales volume as 300 + 3(99 - x) items when the selling price is x yuan.3. Calculate the profit per item: The profit for each item sold is the selling price minus the cost and expenses, which is (x - 50) yuan.4. Express the daily profit w as a function of x: The daily profit is the product of the profit per item and the number of items sold, which gives us w = (x - 50)[300 + 3(99 - x)].Therefore, the correct functional expression between w and x is w = (x - 50)[300 + 3(99 - x)].So, the answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Use the Horner's method to recursively calculate begin{cases} left.begin{matrix}v_{0}=a_{n}  v_{k}=v_{k-1}x+a_{n-k}end{matrix}right.end{cases}, to find the value of the polynomial f(x) = 5x^5 + 2x^4 + 3.5x^3 - 2.6x^2 + 1.7x - 0.8 when x = 5, the value of v_{2} is (　　)A: 27B: 138.5C: 689.9D: 17255.2","solution":"Given: f(x) = 5x^5 + 2x^4 + 3.5x^3 - 2.6x^2 + 1.7x - 0.8  This can be rewritten as: (((((5x + 2)x + 3.5)x - 2.6)x + 1.7)x - 0.8)  Therefore, v_{0} = a_{6} = 5,  v_{1} = v_{0}x + a_{5} = 5 times 5 + 2 = 27,  v_{2} = v_{1}x + a_{4} = 27 times 5 + 3.5 = 138.5,  Hence, the correct choice is boxed{B}.

Substituting the known values, we get c^2 = 4 + 4 = 8, so c = 2sqrt{2}.3. Determine the coordinates of the foci:   The foci are located along the x-axis at (pm c, 0). Therefore, F_1 = (-2sqrt{2}, 0) and F_2 = (2sqrt{2}, 0).4. Set up the conditions for point P:   Let P be a point on the hyperbola with coordinates (x, y). Given that P lies on the right branch and angle F_1PF_2 = 90^{circ}, we have the following conditions:   - x > 0 (since P is on the right branch),   - x^2 - y^2 = 4 (since P lies on the hyperbola),   - The product of the slopes of lines F_1P and F_2P is -1 (since the angle between them is 90^{circ}).

Define the problem and apply the British Flag Theorem:   Let ( ABCD ) be a rectangle with area ( S ), and let ( P ) be a point inside the rectangle. Denote the distances from ( P ) to the vertices ( A, B, C, D ) by ( a, b, c, d ) respectively. According to the British Flag Theorem, for any point ( P ) inside a rectangle, the sum of the squares of the distances from ( P ) to two opposite corners is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from ( P ) to the other two opposite corners. Mathematically, this can be written as:   [   a^2 + c^2 = b^2 + d^2   ]2. Express the sum of all distances squared:   Using the British Flag Theorem, we can write:   [   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + c^2) + (b^2 + d^2)   ]   Since ( a^2 + c^2 = b^2 + d^2 ), we have:   [   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 2(a^2 + c^2)   ]3. Relate the distances to the sides of the rectangle:   Let the sides of the rectangle be ( k ) and ( q ). The area ( S ) of the rectangle is given by:   [   S = k times q   ]   By the properties of the rectangle and the British Flag Theorem, we know that:   [   a^2 + c^2 geq frac{k^2 + q^2}{2}   ]   This inequality follows from the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the rectangle to the vertices is minimized when the point is at the center of the rectangle.4. Apply the inequality to find the minimum sum:   Substituting the inequality into our earlier expression, we get:   [   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 2(a^2 + c^2) geq 2 left( frac{k^2 + q^2}{2} right) = k^2 + q^2   ]   Since the area ( S ) of the rectangle is ( k times q ), and by the AM-GM inequality:   [   k^2 + q^2 geq 2kq = 2S   ]   Therefore:   [   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 geq 2S   ]5.

Understanding the Components: The equation consists of two parts, |x+1| and sqrt{y-1}, both of which are being added together. Since both absolute value and square root functions output non-negative values, for their sum to be 0, each of them must individually be equal to 0.2.

Substituting the values of r and h, we find:   [   V = frac{1}{3}pi times 1^2 times sqrt{3} = frac{sqrt{3}pi}{3}.   ]Therefore, the volume of the cone is boxed{frac{sqrt{3}pi}{3}}."},{"problem":"Find the smallest value of the expression |253^m - 40^n| over all pairs of positive integers (m, n).[i]Proposed by Oleksii Masalitin[/i]","solution":"1. We start by evaluating the given expression for specific values of (m) and (n). We note that:   [   253^2 = 64009 quad text{and} quad 40^3 = 64000   ]   Therefore, the difference is:   [   |253^2 - 40^3| = |64009 - 64000| = 9   ]   This shows that a difference of 9 is possible.2. Next, we need to show that no smaller value is possible. We observe that the difference ( |253^m - 40^n| ) must be an odd number because both (253^m) and (40^n) are odd and even respectively, and the difference between an odd and an even number is always odd.3. Additionally, we note that (253 equiv 1 pmod{3}) and (40 equiv 1 pmod{3}). Therefore, for any positive integers (m) and (n):   [   253^m equiv 1^m equiv 1 pmod{3} quad text{and} quad 40^n equiv 1^n equiv 1 pmod{3}   ]   This implies:   [   253^m - 40^n equiv 1 - 1 equiv 0 pmod{3}   ]   Hence, (253^m - 40^n) is divisible by 3.4. Since the difference is always odd and divisible by 3, the smallest possible value for ( |253^m - 40^n| ) is 3. We now check if this value is achievable.5. Suppose (253^m - 40^n = 3). Considering this modulo 7, we have:   [   253 equiv 1 pmod{7} quad text{and} quad 40 equiv 5 pmod{7}   ]   Therefore:   [   253^m equiv 1^m equiv 1 pmod{7} quad text{and} quad 40^n equiv 5^n pmod{7}   ]   This gives:   [   1 - 5^n equiv 3 pmod{7} implies 1 - 5^n equiv 3 pmod{7} implies -5^n equiv 2 pmod{7} implies 5^n equiv -2 equiv 5 pmod{7}   ]   This implies:   [   5^n equiv 5 pmod{7} implies n equiv 1 pmod{6}   ]6. Now, considering the same equation modulo 9, we have:   [   253 equiv 1 pmod{9} quad text{and} quad 40 equiv 4 pmod{9}   ]   Therefore:   [   253^m equiv 1^m equiv 1 pmod{9} quad text{and} quad 40^n equiv 4^n pmod{9}   ]   This gives:   [   1 - 4^n equiv 3 pmod{9} implies -4^n equiv 2 pmod{9} implies 4^n equiv -2 equiv 7 pmod{9}   ]   This implies:   [   4^n equiv 7 pmod{9} implies n equiv 2 pmod{3}   ]7. We have two congruences for (n):   [   n equiv 1 pmod{6} quad text{and} quad n equiv 2 pmod{3}   ]   These two congruences are inconsistent, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, (253^m - 40^n = 3) is not possible.8. Similarly, if (253^m - 40^n = -3), we would get:   [   253^m equiv 1 pmod{7} quad text{and} quad 40^n equiv 5^n pmod{7}   ]   This gives:   [   1 - 5^n equiv -3 pmod{7} implies -5^n equiv -4 pmod{7} implies 5^n equiv 4 pmod{7}   ]   This implies:   [   5^n equiv 4 pmod{7} implies n equiv 2 pmod{6}   ]9. Considering modulo 9, we have:   [   253^m equiv 1 pmod{9} quad text{and} quad 40^n equiv 4^n pmod{9}   ]   This gives:   [   1 - 4^n equiv -3 pmod{9} implies -4^n equiv -4 pmod{9} implies 4^n equiv 4 pmod{9}   ]   This implies:   [   4^n equiv 4 pmod{9} implies n equiv 1 pmod{3}   ]10. We have two congruences for (n):    [    n equiv 2 pmod{6} quad text{and} quad n equiv 1 pmod{3}    ]    These two congruences are inconsistent, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, (253^m - 40^n = -3) is not possible.11. Since both (253^m - 40^n = 3) and (253^m - 40^n = -3) lead to contradictions, the smallest possible value of ( |253^m - 40^n| ) is indeed 9.The final answer is (boxed{9})."},{"problem":"10.

Hence, a_1 = 1 and the common ratio q = 3.  Thus, the general term formula for {a_n} is a_n = 3^{n-1}.  Therefore, the answer is: boxed{3^{n-1}}  Since the first three terms of the geometric sequence are 1, a+1, and 2a+5, according to the properties of geometric sequences, the square of the second term equals the product of the first and third terms. By setting up an equation about a, and considering that all terms are greater than 0, solving the equation that meets the conditions of the problem gives the value of a. Then, substituting the value of a to find the first three terms, and based on these terms, we can find the first term and the common ratio of the geometric sequence. With the first term and the common ratio, we can write the general term formula for the geometric sequence.

The characteristic polynomial of (A) is given by:   [   det(A - lambda I) = det begin{pmatrix} 4 - lambda & 3  2 & 3 - lambda end{pmatrix} = (4 - lambda)(3 - lambda) - 6 = lambda^2 - 7lambda + 6   ]   Solving the characteristic equation (lambda^2 - 7lambda + 6 = 0), we get:   [   lambda = frac{7 pm sqrt{49 - 24}}{2} = frac{7 pm 5}{2}   ]   Thus, the eigenvalues are (lambda_1 = 6) and (lambda_2 = 1).3. Find the eigenvectors:   For (lambda_1 = 6):   [   (A - 6I) mathbf{v} = 0 implies begin{pmatrix} -2 & 3  2 & -3 end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} v_1  v_2 end{pmatrix} = 0   ]   Solving, we get (v_1 = 3k) and (v_2 = 2k). Thus, an eigenvector corresponding to (lambda_1 = 6) is (mathbf{v}_1 = begin{pmatrix} 3  2 end{pmatrix}).   For (lambda_2 = 1):   [   (A - I) mathbf{v} = 0 implies begin{pmatrix} 3 & 3  2 & 2 end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} v_1  v_2 end{pmatrix} = 0   ]   Solving, we get (v_1 = -v_2). Thus, an eigenvector corresponding to (lambda_2 = 1) is (mathbf{v}_2 = begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 end{pmatrix}).4. Form the general solution:   The general solution to the system is:   [   begin{pmatrix}   x_n    y_n   end{pmatrix}   = c_1 6^n begin{pmatrix} 3  2 end{pmatrix} + c_2 1^n begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 end{pmatrix}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   x_n = 3c_1 6^n + c_2   ]   [   y_n = 2c_1 6^n - c_2   ]5. Determine the constants (c_1) and (c_2):   Using the initial conditions (x_1 = y_1 = 5):   [   x_1 = 3c_1 6 + c_2 = 18c_1 + c_2 = 5   ]   [   y_1 = 2c_1 6 - c_2 = 12c_1 - c_2 = 5   ]   Solving these equations simultaneously:   [   18c_1 + c_2 = 5   ]   [   12c_1 - c_2 = 5   ]   Adding these equations:   [   30c_1 = 10 implies c_1 = frac{1}{3}   ]   Substituting (c_1) back into the first equation:   [   18 left(frac{1}{3}right) + c_2 = 5 implies 6 + c_2 = 5 implies c_2 = -1   ]6. Write the explicit formulas for (x_n) and (y_n):   [   x_n = 3 left(frac{1}{3}right) 6^n - 1 = 6^n - 1   ]   [   y_n = 2 left(frac{1}{3}right) 6^n + 1 = 4 cdot 6^{n-1} + 1   ]7.

Consider the integral ( int_0^1 f(x) , dx ). We can use the property of the function ( f ) to split the integral:   [   int_0^1 f(x) , dx = int_0^{1/2} f(x) , dx + int_{1/2}^1 f(x) , dx   ]3. Make a substitution in the second integral. Let ( u = 1 - x ). Then ( du = -dx ), and when ( x = 1/2 ), ( u = 1/2 ), and when ( x = 1 ), ( u = 0 ). Thus:   [   int_{1/2}^1 f(x) , dx = int_{1/2}^0 f(1 - u) (-du) = int_0^{1/2} f(1 - u) , du   ]4.

Now, combine the integrals:   [   int_0^1 f(x) , dx = int_0^{1/2} f(x) , dx + int_0^{1/2} (1 - f(u)) , du   ]6. Since ( x ) and ( u ) are dummy variables, we can combine the integrals:   [   int_0^1 f(x) , dx = int_0^{1/2} f(x) , dx + int_0^{1/2} 1 , du - int_0^{1/2} f(u) , du   ]7. Notice that ( int_0^{1/2} f(x) , dx = int_0^{1/2} f(u) , du ), so these terms cancel out:   [   int_0^1 f(x) , dx = int_0^{1/2} 1 , du   ]8.

This already implies that the number of points can be at most 5. For 5 points, if no three points are collinear, they determine a total of 10 segments. If we select one point and draw two red segments from it, then from the points to which these segments lead, one more red segment must originate. By condition (b), these are different segments, so there are at least 4 red segments. Since this is true for the other two colors as well, and all three colors must be used, at least 12 segments are required. However, only 10 segments can be drawn between 5 points, so it is not possible to color the segments in such a way that all conditions are met for 5 points. This proves our claim.Based on the work of Borsodi Brigitta (Tata, Eötvös J. Gymnasium, 2nd year)Note. Many incorrect solutions were submitted due to a misunderstanding of the problem. Some examined the fulfillment of the three conditions separately, whereas they must all be satisfied simultaneously.Some did not find the correct coloring for 4 points because they tried to add a point to a solution for 3 points. Indeed, in any selection of 3 points from 4, there are two segments of the same color among the segments they determine.Those who showed a single coloring and claimed that it is impossible for 5 points did not receive points. This does not mean that there is no solution that satisfies the problem's conditions. We saw this with 4 points, where both good and bad colorings can be found.Most incomplete solutions proved the impossibility of coloring for 5 points but did not show that it is also impossible for more than 5 points. The question, however, was \\"what is the maximum number of points\\" that can be colored."},{"problem":"11 The sequence left{a_{n}right} satisfies: a_{1}=1, and for each n in mathbf{N}^{*}, a_{n} 、 a_{n+1} are the roots of the equation x^{2}+ 3 n x+b_{n}=0, then sum_{k=1}^{20} b_{k}= qquad.","solution":"For each n in mathbf{N}^{*},a_{n}+a_{n+1}=-3 n, a_{n} a_{n+1}=b_{n},we can see thata_{n+1}+frac{3(n+1)}{2}-frac{3}{4}=-left(a_{n}+frac{3 n}{2}-frac{3}{4}right),thus left{a_{n}+frac{3 n}{2}-frac{3}{4}right} is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of -1, hencea_{n}+frac{3 n}{2}-frac{3}{4}=(-1)^{n-1} frac{7}{4},which meansa_{n}=-frac{3(2 n-1)}{4}+(-1)^{n-1} cdot frac{7}{4},thena_{n+1}=-frac{3(2 n+1)}{4}+(-1)^{n} cdot frac{7}{4},thusb_{n}=a_{n} a_{n+1}=frac{9}{4} n^{2}-frac{29}{8}+(-1)^{n} cdot frac{21}{8},therefore sum_{k=1}^{20} b_{k}=6385."},{"problem":"What is the largest positive integer n less than 10, 000 such that in base 4, n and 3n have the same number of digits; in base 8, n and 7n have the same number of digits; and in base 16, n and 15n have the same number of digits?

If f(0)=0, then for y=0 we get:f(f(x) f(0))+f(x+0)=f(0 cdot x)In this case, f(x)=0 for all x. This is indeed a solution to the functional equation.Now let's consider the case when f(0) neq 0. If x=0 and y=0, thenfleft(f(0)^{2}right)+f(0)=f(0), quad fleft(f(0)^{2}right)=0Suppose f(c)=0 and c neq 1. If y=1+frac{1}{x-1}, then (x-1)(y-1)=1, i.e., x+y=xy, so f(x+y)=f(xy), and thus f(f(x) f(y))=0.Let x=c and y=1+frac{1}{c-1}. Then fleft(f(c) fleft(1+frac{1}{c-1}right)right)=0. Since f(c)=0 and f(0)=0, this contradicts the initial condition.We have found that if f(c)=0, then c=1, so f(0)^{2}=1, hence f(1)=fleft(f(0)^{2}right)=0, and f(0)=1 or f(0)=-1.It is clear that f(x) is a solution to the functional equation if and only if -f(x) is also a solution (the sign of both sides changes). Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that f(0)=-1.Now substitute y=1 into the equation:begin{aligned}f(f(x) f(1))+f(x+1) & =f(1 cdot x) f(0)+f(x+1) & =f(x) f(x+1) & =f(x)+1end{aligned}From this, it follows that for integers n, f(x+n)=f(x)+n.We will show that f(x) is injective. Suppose it is not, i.e., there exist A neq B such that f(A)=f(B). Let n be an integer greater than A, and let A-n=a and B-n=b, where we know that a is negative.If f(A)=f(B), then f(a)=f(b). The discriminant of the quadratic equation x^{2}-b x+a-1=0 is b^{2}-4(a-1), which is positive (since a-1 is negative), so the equation has two roots, r and s. From Vieta's formulas, we know that r+s=b and r s=a-1; thus, for x=r and y=s, we have f(f(r) f(s))+f(b)=f(a-1)=f(a)-1.From the equation, we can deduce f(a)=f(b): f(f(r) f(s))=-1, f(f(r) f(s)+1)=0, so f(r) f(s)+1=1, i.e., f(r) f(s)=0. We can assume that s=1, then a=1 cdot r+1 and b=r+1, so a=b, which leads to a contradiction; the function is indeed injective.Let y=1-x. Then f(f(x) f(1-x))+f(1)=f(x(1-x)),f(f(x) f(1-x))=fleft(x-x^{2}right)By injectivity, f(x) f(1-x)=x-x^{2}.Now let y=-x. Then f(f(x) f(-x))+f(0)=fleft(-x^{2}right),f(f(x) f(-x))-1=fleft(-x^{2}right)f(f(x) f(-x))=fleft(1-x^{2}right).By injectivity, f(x) f(-x)=1-x^{2}, so f(x) f(1-x)-f(x) f(-x)=x-x^{2}-(1-x^{2})=x-1. On the other hand,f(x) f(1-x)-f(x) f(-x)=f(x)(f(1-x)-f(-x))=f(x)Thus, f(x)=x-1 for all x. This is indeed a valid solution: (x-1)(y-1)-1+x+y-1=xy-1.This was the solution when f(0)=-1, and its opposite, f(x)=1-x, is the solution when f(0)=-1.Therefore, the functional equation has three solutions: f(x)=0, f(x)=x-1, and f(x)=1-x."},{"problem":"Given that the sum of the binomial coefficients of the expansion of (2x- frac {1}{ sqrt {x}})^{n} is 64, the constant term in its expansion is ______.","solution":"By the property of binomial coefficients, we can obtain 2^{n}=64.

Since the sum of the entire expression is binom{n+1}{2}^{2}, if we subtract the sum of the square numbers from this, we get twice the desired sum. The sum of the square numbers is frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}, so2 S_{n}=left(frac{n(n+1)}{2}right)^{2}-frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}Factoring out n(n+1),begin{aligned}& quad S_{n}=n(n+1)left[frac{n(n+1)}{8}-frac{2 n+1}{12}right]=n(n+1)left[frac{3 n(n+1)-4 n-2}{24}right]= & =n(n+1)left[frac{3 n^{2}+3 n-4 n-2}{24}right]=frac{n(n+1)(n-1)(3 n+2)}{24}end{aligned}III. solution: Let the sum of the squares of the first n numbers be S_{n}^{2}, and the sum of the cubes be S_{n}^{3}.Consider again the rearranged form of the sequence used in the first solution. In this form, the sum of the terms in the (k-1)-th column is kbinom{k}{2}=frac{1}{2}left(k^{3}-k^{2}right), which needs to be summed for k=2,3, ldots, n, i.e., since it gives 0 for k=1, we can sum from 1 to n. Thus we get S_{n}=frac{1}{2}left(S_{n}^{3}-S_{n}^{2}right).Now complete the sequence in the same way as in the previous solution.begin{aligned}& 1 cdot 1+1 cdot 2+1 cdot 3+ldots+1 cdot n & 2 cdot 1+2 cdot 2+2 cdot 3+ldots+2 cdot n & vdots & n cdot 1+n cdot 2+n cdot 3+ldots+n cdot nend{aligned}Now let's see what the excess is that was added to the k-th row.

Thus, the coordinates of B are (6,0).Thus, the vertices of triangle A O B are A(0,4), O(0,0) and B(6,0).Since triangle A O B is right-angled at O, its area equals frac{1}{2} times A O times B O=frac{1}{2} times 4 times 6=12.(b) When x=0, the equation 6 x+5 y=c becomes 5 y=c and so y=frac{1}{5} c.

Generally, if x+y=1, then calculate f(x)+f(y)=frac{4^{x}}{4^{x}+2}+frac{4^{y}}{4^{y}+2}=1. The sum has 1000 terms, so the answer should be 500. In fact, we can find the sum in the general case:begin{array}{l}fleft(frac{1}{n}right)+fleft(frac{2}{n}right)+cdots+fleft(frac{n-1}{n}right) =frac{n-1}{2} .end{array}To standardize the answer, we chose a not too small number n=1001, hinting that candidates must \\"extract\\" the solution."},{"problem":"Given a function f(x) = x + aln x has its tangent line at x = 1 perpendicular to the line x + 2y = 0.(Ⅰ) Find the value of the real number a;(Ⅱ) For the function g(x) = f(x) + frac{1}{2}x^2 - bx, if the function g(x) has a monotonically decreasing interval, determine the range of real number b;(Ⅲ) Let x_1 and x_2 (x_1 < x_2) be the two extreme points of the function g(x), if b geqslant frac{7}{2}, find the minimum value of g(x_{1}) - g(x_{2}).","solution":"(Ⅰ) Since the slope of the tangent line of f(x) = x + aln x at x = 1 is equal to the derivative of f(x) at that point, we findf'(x) = 1 + frac{a}{x}.For the tangent line to be perpendicular to the line x + 2y = 0, the product of their slopes must be -1. The slope of the given line is -frac{1}{2}, so the slope of the tangent line must be 2. Setting f'(1) = 2 and solving for a yields1 + a = 2, quad therefore a = 1.Thus, the value of a is boxed{1}.(Ⅱ) For g(x) = f(x) + frac{1}{2}x^2 - bx, substituting the value of a, we haveg(x) = x + ln x + frac{1}{2}x^2 - bx = ln x + frac{1}{2}x^2 - (b - 1)x.Differentiating g(x) gives usg'(x) = frac{1}{x} + x - (b - 1) = frac{x^2 - (b - 1)x + 1}{x}.For g'(x)  0 quad text{and} quad Delta = (b - 1)^2 - 4 > 0.Solving these inequalities, we find that b > 3 or b < -1.

By Vieta's formulas:x_1 + x_2 = b - 1, quad x_1x_2 = 1.Thus, g(x_1) - g(x_2) can be expressed as:g(x_1) - g(x_2) = [ln x_1 + frac{1}{2}x_1^2 - (b - 1)x_1] - [ln x_2 + frac{1}{2}x_2^2 - (b - 1)x_2].Simplifying,g(x_1) - g(x_2) = ln frac{x_1}{x_2} - frac{1}{2}[(x_1 - x_2)(x_1 + x_2)] = ln frac{x_1}{x_2} - frac{1}{2}(frac{x_1}{x_2} - frac{x_2}{x_1}).Letting t = frac{x_1}{x_2} (with 0 < t < 1 since 0 < x_1 < x_2) and defining h(t) = ln t - frac{1}{2}(t - frac{1}{t}).

Therefore, ( x = 11 ) and ( x = 12 ) are roots of ( Q(x) ).2. Since ( Q(x) ) is a cubic polynomial and has roots at ( x = 11 ) and ( x = 12 ), we can express ( Q(x) ) as:   [   Q(x) = (x - 11)(x - 12)(ax + b)   ]   where ( a ) and ( b ) are constants to be determined.3. We are also given ( P(13) = 14 ), which implies:   [   Q(13) = P(13) - 13 = 14 - 13 = 1   ]   Substituting ( x = 13 ) into the expression for ( Q(x) ), we get:   [   Q(13) = (13 - 11)(13 - 12)(13a + b) = 2 cdot 1 cdot (13a + b) = 2(13a + b) = 1   ]   Solving for ( 13a + b ):   [   2(13a + b) = 1 implies 13a + b = frac{1}{2}   ]4.

We now have a system of linear equations:   [   begin{cases}   13a + b = frac{1}{2}    14a + b = frac{1}{6}   end{cases}   ]   Subtracting the first equation from the second:   [   (14a + b) - (13a + b) = frac{1}{6} - frac{1}{2} implies a = frac{1}{6} - frac{3}{6} = -frac{1}{3}   ]6.

Understanding the Problem:   Dinesh wants to arrange squares and regular pentagons alternately to form a closed loop. Each shape has a side length of 1. We need to determine how many pentagons are required to complete this loop.2. Analyzing the Geometry:   - A regular pentagon has internal angles of (108^circ).   - A square has internal angles of (90^circ).   - When arranged alternately, the sum of the internal angles at each vertex where a square and a pentagon meet must be (360^circ) to form a closed loop.3. Calculating the Angles:   - Each vertex where a square and a pentagon meet will have an angle contribution of (90^circ) from the square and (108^circ) from the pentagon.   - The total angle at each vertex is (90^circ + 108^circ = 198^circ).4. Forming the Closed Loop:   - To form a closed loop, the total sum of the angles around the loop must be a multiple of (360^circ).   - Let (n) be the number of squares and pentagons. Since they are arranged alternately, there will be (n) squares and (n) pentagons.   - The total angle sum around the loop is (n times 198^circ).5. Finding the Number of Shapes:   - For the loop to close, (n times 198^circ) must be a multiple of (360^circ).   - Simplifying, we get:     [     n times 198^circ = k times 360^circ quad text{for some integer } k     ]     [     n times 198 = k times 360     ]     [     n = frac{k times 360}{198}     ]     [     n = frac{k times 180}{99}     ]     [     n = frac{20k}{11}     ]   - For (n) to be an integer, (k) must be a multiple of 11.

Binary Representation and Initial Setup:   Given ( 2^k leq n < 2^{k+1} ), we can express ( n ) in binary as ( n = overline{a_k a_{k-1} cdots a_1 a_0} ). For simplicity, we omit the overline when referring to binary numbers.2.

Since it is not clear from the problem whether we are reducing/increasing the same factor or a different one each time, we need to consider both possibilities.

Since (x y z = 600), after rearranging, we get (10 y z = 400), i.e., (y z = 40). From the equation (x y z = 600), it follows that (x cdot 40 = 600), i.e.,[x = 15.]Similarly, the third equation, after expanding, is (x y z + 5 x z = 1200). Since (x y z = 600), after rearranging, we get (5 x z = 600), i.e., (x z = 120). Since we already know (x = 15), it must be[z = 8.]Substituting back into the equation (x y z = 600), we have (120 y = 600), from which it follows that[y = 5.]2.

We need to check that this is a consistent assignment of wins and losses, since the result for each pair of teams is defined twice. This can be seen by noting that ( (2n+1+i) - (i+j) = 2n+1-j geq n+1 ) for ( 1 leq j leq n ). The cycle triplets are ( (T_i, T_{i+j}, T_{i+j+k}) ) where ( 1 leq j leq n ) and ( (2n+1+i) - (i+j+k) leq n ), i.e., when ( 1 leq j leq n ) and ( n+1-j leq k leq n ).

Initial Setup: We start by noting that each player has an equal chance of winning any given game, i.e., the probability of winning for each player is ( frac{1}{2} ).2.

Second Game: The winner of the first game plays against ( C ). Again, there are two possible outcomes for each scenario:   - If ( A ) wins the first game, then ( A ) plays against ( C ):     - ( A ) wins the second game with probability ( frac{1}{2} ).     - ( C ) wins the second game with probability ( frac{1}{2} ).   - If ( B ) wins the first game, then ( B ) plays against ( C ):     - ( B ) wins the second game with probability ( frac{1}{2} ).     - ( C ) wins the second game with probability ( frac{1}{2} ).4. Third Game: The winner of the second game plays against the player who did not play in the second game. The tournament continues until a player wins two successive games. We need to calculate the probability that ( C ) wins the tournament.5. Winning Scenarios for ( C ):   - ( C ) wins the second game and then wins the third game (if ( A ) or ( B ) won the first game):     - Probability that ( A ) wins the first game: ( frac{1}{2} ).     - Probability that ( C ) wins the second game: ( frac{1}{2} ).     - Probability that ( C ) wins the third game: ( frac{1}{2} ).     - Total probability for this scenario: ( frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{8} ).   - Similarly, if ( B ) wins the first game, the probability that ( C ) wins the tournament is also ( frac{1}{8} ).6.

Correction: The initial solution provided a different approach and concluded that the probability is ( frac{2}{7} ).

Define the sequence and initial conditions:   We are given a sequence (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k) with (a_1 = a_2 = 1) and (k = 18). The sequence must satisfy the condition (|a_n - a_{n-1}| = a_{n-2}) for all (3 leq n leq k).2. Analyze the sequence behavior:   - For (n = 3), we have (|a_3 - a_2| = a_1). Since (a_1 = a_2 = 1), this implies (|a_3 - 1| = 1). Therefore, (a_3) can be either 2 or 0. However, since (a_3) must be a positive integer, (a_3 = 2).   - For (n = 4), we have (|a_4 - a_3| = a_2). Since (a_3 = 2) and (a_2 = 1), this implies (|a_4 - 2| = 1). Therefore, (a_4) can be either 3 or 1. 3. Pattern of the sequence:   - If (a_4 = 3), then (a_5) must satisfy (|a_5 - 3| = 2), so (a_5) can be either 5 or 1.   - If (a_4 = 1), then (a_5) must satisfy (|a_5 - 1| = 2), so (a_5) can be either 3 or -1. Since (a_5) must be positive, (a_5 = 3).4. Generalize the pattern:   - Denote each term (a_3) and onward by (>) if it exceeds the previous term and (<) otherwise. For example, (a_3 = 2) is (>).   - After a (>), the next term can be either (>) or (<). However, after a (<), the next term must be (>) because the sequence must remain positive.5. Count the valid sequences:   - We need to count the number of sequences of (>)'s and (<)'s such that no two (<)'s are adjacent.   - This is equivalent to counting the number of ways to place (<)'s in a sequence of (>)'s such that no two (<)'s are adjacent.6. Use combinatorial arguments:   - Let (m) be the number of (<)'s in the sequence. The number of ways to place (m) (<)'s in a sequence of (16) (>)'s (since (a_1) and (a_2) are fixed) is given by (binom{16 - m + 1}{m}).   - Summing over all possible values of (m) from 0 to 8 (since (k = 18) and we start counting from (a_3)), we get:     [     sum_{m=0}^{8} binom{16 - m + 1}{m} = binom{16}{0} + binom{15}{1} + binom{14}{2} + cdots + binom{8}{8}     ]7.

The angle bisectors of the internal angles of triangle ABC are the axes of symmetry of these angles, so Varangle B A D=Varangle D A C=frac{alpha}{2}, etc. Triangles DEF, DGH, DIJ are equilateral, and points A, B, C are the midpoints of the sides opposite the common vertex D.

Simultaneously, for the internal angles of triangle ABC we havealpha+beta+gamma=180^{circ}or alpha+gamma=180^{circ}-beta.

Simultaneously, from (2) we have beta+gamma=180^{circ}-alpha. Altogether, we get 108^{circ}=180^{circ}-alpha, thusalpha=72^{circ}By substituting alpha or beta into one of the previous equations, we can express the remaining angle gamma. For example, substituting into (2) gives 72^{circ}+42^{circ}+gamma=180^{circ}, and thusgamma=66^{circ}The measures of the internal angles of triangle ABC are 72^{circ}, 42^{circ}, and 66^{circ}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_f2580914d88a394728dfg-3.jpg?height=994&width=1060&top_left_y=1128&top_left_x=498)Notes. In addition to conditions (1) and (3), we can also use a similar condition for triangle ADB. For this purpose, it is necessary to express the angle FDG as the supplementary angle to the full angle with vertex D, whose measure is 360^{circ}-3 cdot 60^{circ}-51^{circ}-66^{circ}=63^{circ}.

There also exists a polynomial Q_{2}(x) such that Q_{1}(x)=(x-1) Q_{2}(x), i.e., P(x)=1+x(x-1) Q_{2}(x). Therefore, 2=P(2)=1+2 Q_{2}(2), so Q_{2}(2)=frac{1}{2}.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given a (5 times 5) table where each cell contains a number from 1 to 5, and each number appears exactly once in every row and every column. A number is considered \\"good positioned\\" if:   - In its row, all numbers to its left are either all smaller or all larger, and all numbers to its right are the opposite.   - In its column, all numbers above it are either all smaller or all larger, and all numbers below it are the opposite.2. Constructing a Table with Good Positioned Numbers:   We need to construct a table where the maximum number of good positioned numbers is achieved. Consider the following table:   [   begin{array}{ccccc}   1 & 4 & 2 & 3 & 5    3 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 2    2 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 4    4 & 2 & 5 & 1 & 3    5 & 3 & 4 & 2 & 1    end{array}   ]   In this table, the numbers 1 and 5 in the corners and the number 3 in the center are all good positioned.3. Verifying the Good Positioned Numbers:   - Corners (1 and 5):     - For 1 in the first row and first column, all numbers to its right and below are larger.     - For 5 in the first row and fifth column, all numbers to its left and below are smaller.     - For 1 in the fifth row and fifth column, all numbers to its left and above are larger.     - For 5 in the fifth row and first column, all numbers to its right and above are smaller.   - Center (3):     - For 3 in the third row and third column, all numbers to its left and above are smaller, and all numbers to its right and below are larger.4. Proving the Maximum Number of Good Positioned Numbers:   - A number (k) can only be good if it is in either the (k)-th or ((6-k))-th column, and the (k)-th or ((6-k))-th row, because it needs (k-1) numbers above or below it, and (k-1) to the left or right.   - This means that only the following numbers can be good:     - The 1 in the first or fifth column.     - The 2 in the second or fourth column.     - The 3 in the third column.     - The 4 in the second or fourth column.     - The 5 in the first or fifth column.   - We pair these possibilities:     - The 1 in the first column and the 2 in the second column.     - The 1 in the fifth column and the 2 in the fourth column.     - The 3 in the third column.     - The 4 in the second column and the 5 in the first column.     - The 4 in the fourth column and the 5 in the fifth column.   - Only one number in each pair can be good. For example, if the 2 in the second column is good, it must be in the second or fourth row and have a 1 to its left, which means the 1 in the first column cannot be in the first or fifth row, so it cannot be good.5. Conclusion:   - By applying similar arguments for the other pairs, we see that only one in each pair can be good.   - Therefore, the maximum number of good positioned numbers is 5, which can be achieved as shown in the constructed table.The final answer is ( boxed{ 5 } )."},{"problem":"Given the complex number z = |(sqrt{3} - i)i| + i^{2015} (where i is the imaginary unit), the conjugate of the complex number z is:A: 2-iB: 2+iC: 4-iD: 4+i","solution":"First, we have z = |(sqrt{3} - i)i| + i^{2015}.

Thus, the discriminant of the quadratic equation x^2-8x-4m=0 must be zero: 64+16m=0, so m=-4. Therefore, the equation of line l is y=2x-4.(2) The focus of the parabola C_2: x^2=4y is F_1(0,1), which is also a focus of the ellipse C_1. Therefore, for the ellipse C_1, c=1, and the other focus F_2(0,-1). The ellipse also passes through a point P on the line l. To maximize the eccentricity of the ellipse C_1, we need to minimize the sum |PF_1|+|PF_2|. This is equivalent to finding the distance from F_1 to the reflection F_3(m,n) of F_2 with respect to the line l.Given F_2(0,-1), we solve for F_3(m,n):begin{cases}frac{n+1}{m-0}times2=-1frac{n-1}{2}=frac{m}{2}-4end{cases}Solving these equations, we find m=frac{12}{5}, n=-frac{11}{5}, so F_3(frac{12}{5},-frac{11}{5}). The equation of line F_1F_3 is:frac{y-1}{-frac{11}{5}-1}=frac{x}{frac{12}{5}}Simplifying, we get y=-frac{4}{3}x+1.

Define the switcheroo operation: For a string ( s ) of length ( 2^n ), the switcheroo operation involves switching the first ( 2^k ) letters with the next ( 2^k ) letters for each ( k = 0, 1, ldots, n-1 ).2. Recursive definition: Let ( f_k(s) ) denote the string after performing the switcheroo operation at step ( k ). We can express ( f_k(s) ) recursively:   [   f_k(s) = s_b f_{k-1}(s_f)   ]   where ( s_f ) is the first ( 2^{k-1} ) characters and ( s_b ) is the last ( 2^{k-1} ) characters of the first ( 2^k ) characters of ( s ).3.

General pattern: We observe that each switcheroo operation ( f_k ) involves breaking the string into smaller parts and recursively applying the switcheroo operation on these parts. This suggests a pattern where the number of operations required to return to the original string grows exponentially.5. Number of operations: Let ( T(n) ) be the number of switcheroo operations needed to return to the original string for a word of length ( 2^n ). From the recursive nature of the switcheroo operation, we can deduce:   [   T(n) = 2T(n-1)   ]6.

Therefore, the graph of the function f(x) can be obtained from the graph of y = sin x by the following transformations:   - Shift the graph of y = sin x to the right by frac{pi}{6} units to get the graph of y = sin(x - frac{pi}{6}).   - Compress the horizontal coordinates of all points on the graph of y = sin(2x - frac{pi}{6}) to half of their original values (keeping the vertical coordinates unchanged) to get the graph of y = sin(2x - frac{pi}{6}).   - Stretch the vertical coordinates of all points on the graph of y = sin(2x - frac{pi}{6}) to twice their original values (keeping the horizontal coordinates unchanged) to get the graph of y = 2sin(2x - frac{pi}{6}).(2) From (1), we know that f(x) = sin(2x - frac{pi}{6}), thus g(x) = frac{1}{2}|f(x + frac{pi}{12})| + frac{1}{2}|f(x + frac{pi}{3})| = |sin 2x| + |cos 2x|. Since for any x in mathbb{R}, g(-x) = g(x), the function g(x) is an even function. Since g(x + frac{pi}{4}) = |cos 2x| + |sin 2x| = g(x), g(x) is a periodic function with a period of frac{pi}{4}. Now, we use the method of contradiction to prove that frac{pi}{4} is the smallest positive period of g(x). Suppose frac{pi}{4} is not the smallest positive period of g(x), and let T_1 (0 < T_1 < frac{pi}{4}) be the smallest positive period of g(x). Then g(x + T_1) = g(x), i.e., |cos(2x + 2T_1)| + |sin(2x + 2T_1)| = |sin 2x| + |cos 2x|. Let x = 0, we get sin 2T_1 + cos 2T_1 = 1. Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get sin 2T_1 times cos 2T_1 = 0, which contradicts with sin 2T_1 neq 0 and cos 2T_1 neq 0. Therefore, the assumption is false. Hence, the smallest positive period of the function g(x) is boxed{frac{pi}{4}}.(3) First, we find the intervals of monotonicity and the range of the function values of g(x) within one period [0, frac{pi}{4}].

Therefore, based on the properties of periodic functions, the intervals of increase for g(x) = |sin 2x| + |cos 2x| are [frac{kpi}{4}, frac{kpi}{4} + frac{pi}{8}] (k in mathbb{Z}), and the intervals of decrease are [frac{kpi}{4} + frac{pi}{8}, frac{kpi}{4} + frac{pi}{4}] (k in mathbb{Z}).

Even without actually performing the polynomial transformation, it is easy to see that we get a second-degree polynomial, because the sum of the x^{3} terms from the first and third expressions is 0. The roots of this polynomial are x=y and x=z, which can be seen immediately by substitution.

The coefficient of x^{2} from the first and third expressions is -3 y+3 z=3(z-y); therefore, the denominator is identical to3(x-y)(x-z)(z-y)From this, we get the numerator by substituting x, y, z with x^{2}, y^{2}, z^{2}, so the desired fraction is:frac{3left(x^{2}-y^{2}right)left(x^{2}-z^{2}right)left(z^{2}-y^{2}right)}{3(x-y)(x-z)(z-y)}=(x+y)(y+z)(z+x)III. solution: The numerator and the denominator are the sum of the cubes of three numbers whose sum is 0.

It is almost as obvious that x_{2} will end up in the denominator in any arrangement of parentheses (the division sign in front of x_{2} relates either to x_{2} itself or to some expression containing x_{2} in the numerator).It turns out that the other letters x_{3}, x_{4}, ldots, x_{n} can be placed in the numerator or denominator in any way; hence, a total of 2^{n-2} fractions can be obtained: each of the n-2 letters x_{3}, x_{4}, ldots, x_{n} can independently be in the numerator or denominator.We will prove this statement by induction.

In the fraction A after the arrangement of parentheses, there will necessarily be an expression of the form ( p: x_{k} ), where p is the letter x_{k-1} or some parenthesis; by replacing ( p: x_{k} ) with the expression left(left(p: x_{k}right): x_{k+1}right)=p:left(x_{k} cdot x_{k+1}right), we will obviously get the same fraction A, where x_{k} is replaced by x_{k} cdot x_{k+1}.

To determine the idea, we first calculate the number of fives in the result s of the sum 1+ 10+19+cdots+100000.

However, if p^{k}>n, we have 0<frac{n}{p^{k}}<1 and hence leftlfloorfrac{n}{p^{k}}rightrfloor=0. Therefore only a finite number of terms in the above sum are non-zero. The number of non-zero terms in this sum is the largest integer k for which p^{k} leq n.By Legendre's formula the highest power of 2 that divides 16 ! is k, wherebegin{aligned}k & =leftlfloorfrac{16}{2}rightrfloor+leftlfloorfrac{16}{2^{2}}rightrfloor+leftlfloorfrac{16}{2^{3}}rightrfloor+leftlfloorfrac{16}{2^{4}}rightrfloor & =leftlfloorfrac{16}{2}rightrfloor+leftlfloorfrac{16}{4}rightrfloor+leftlfloorfrac{16}{8}rightrfloor+leftlfloorfrac{16}{16}rightrfloor & =lfloor 8rfloor+lfloor 4rfloor+lfloor 2rfloor+lfloor 1rfloor & =8+4+2+1 & =15 .end{aligned}For INVESTIGATION13.1 Why is 15 the only value of k for which 16!div 2^{k} is an odd integer?13.2 Use Legendre's formula to find the highest power of 3 that divides 16!.13.3 What is the highest power of 2 that divides 100 !?13.4 What is the highest power of 3 that divides 100!?13.5 Find the prime factorization of 100 !13.6 Find the least positive integer n such that 2^{100} is a factor of n!.13.7 Prove that Legendre's formula is correct.That is, show that the highest power of the prime p that divides n ! is given by the sumleftlfloorfrac{n}{p}rightrfloor+leftlfloorfrac{n}{p^{2}}rightrfloor+leftlfloorfrac{n}{p^{3}}rightrfloor+cdots+leftlfloorfrac{n}{p^{k}}rightrfloor,where k is the largest integer such that p^{k} leq n.13.8 Let p be a prime number and let n be a positive integer.

Take some origin O and let A be the vector OA. Similarly for the other points. We use repeatedly the fact that if the point P lies on the line QR, then for some k, P = k Q + (1 - k) R . For some k we have: X = k B + (1-k) C . Hence M = X /2 + A /2 = A /2 + k B /2 + (1-k) C /2. Now Z is a linear combination of M and C and also of A and B , so it must be (2 M - (1 - k) C )/(1 + k) = ( A + k B )/(1 + k). Hence L = Z /2 + C /2 = ( A + k B + (1 + k) C )/(2 + 2k). Y is a combination of B and L and of A and C . So it must be ( A + (1 + k) C )/(2 + k). Hence K = B /2 + Y /2 = ( A + (2 + k) B + (1 + k) C )/(4 + 2k). X is a combination of A and K and also of B and C , so it must be ( (2 + k) B + (1 + k) C )/(3 + 2k). But it is also k B + (1-k) C , so k 2 + k - 1 = 0, or k = (√5 - 1)/2. At this point, this approach degenerates into a slog (although a straightforward one). By repeated use of the relation k 2 = 1 - k (and hence 1/(k+1) = k, 1/(2+k) = k 2 ), we find that 2 K = k 2 A + B + k C , 2 L = k A + k 2 B + C , 2 M = A + k B + k 2 C .

Understanding the Problem:   We need to arrange the numbers (1, 2, ldots, n) in a circular form such that each number divides the sum of the next two numbers in a clockwise direction. We need to determine for which integers (n geq 3) this is possible.2. Analyzing Parity:   - If two even numbers are adjacent, then all numbers must be even, which is not possible since (n) includes both odd and even numbers.   - Therefore, an even number must be surrounded by odd numbers. This implies a pattern of odd-even-odd.3. Pattern Deduction:   - Consider the sequence: odd-odd-even-odd-odd. This pattern suggests that for every even number, there must be at least two odd numbers.   - If (n) is even, say (n = 2d), then there are (d) odd numbers and (d) even numbers. This configuration is not possible because each even number requires two odd numbers around it, which is not feasible with equal numbers of odd and even numbers.4. Odd (n):   - If (n) is odd, say (n = 2d + 1), then there are (d) even numbers and (d + 1) odd numbers.   - For the arrangement to work, the number of odd numbers must be at least twice the number of even numbers, i.e., (d + 1 geq 2d).   - Solving the inequality: (d + 1 geq 2d) gives (1 geq d), so (d = 1).5. Conclusion:   - If (d = 1), then (n = 2d + 1 = 3).   - For (n = 3), the numbers are (1, 2, 3). We can arrange them in a circle as (1, 2, 3) such that:     - (1) divides (2 + 3 = 5)     - (2) divides (3 + 1 = 4)     - (3) divides (1 + 2 = 3)Thus, the only integer (n geq 3) for which it is possible to arrange the numbers (1, 2, ldots, n) in a circular form such that each number divides the sum of the next two numbers is (n = 3).The final answer is (boxed{3})."},{"problem":"The equation of the tangent line to the curve y=4x-x^3 at the point (-1, -3) is.","solution":"Given y=4x-x^3,  thus f'(x)=4-3x^2.

Since (binom{N}{a-1} neq 0), we set the numerator of the fraction to zero:   [   4a^2 - 4Na + (N^2 - N - 2) = 0   ]8. Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula (a = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}), where (a = 4), (b = -4N), and (c = N^2 - N - 2):   [   a = frac{4N pm sqrt{(4N)^2 - 4 cdot 4 cdot (N^2 - N - 2)}}{2 cdot 4}   ]   [   a = frac{4N pm sqrt{16N^2 - 16N^2 + 16N + 32}}{8}   ]   [   a = frac{4N pm sqrt{16N + 32}}{8}   ]   [   a = frac{4N pm 4sqrt{N + 2}}{8}   ]   [   a = frac{N pm sqrt{N + 2}}{2}   ]9. Since (a) must be an integer, we take the floor of the positive root:   [   a = leftlfloor frac{N - sqrt{N + 2}}{2} rightrfloor   ]10. For (N = 10^6):    [    a = leftlfloor frac{10^6 - sqrt{10^6 + 2}}{2} rightrfloor    ]    [    a = leftlfloor frac{10^6 - 10^3}{2} rightrfloor    ]    [    a = leftlfloor frac{999000}{2} rightrfloor    ]    [    a = 499500    ]11. Since (a) must be an integer within the range (0 leq a leq N-1), we adjust to the nearest integer:    [    a = 499499    ]The final answer is (boxed{499499})."},{"problem":"Given that ln 2=a and ln 3=b, find the value of e^{a}+e^{b} (where e is the base of the natural logarithm).","solution":"Solution: Given that ln 2=a and ln 3=b, we have e^{a}+e^{b}=e^{ln 2}+e^{ln 3}=2+3=5.Hence, the answer is boxed{5}.This problem can be solved by directly applying the rules of logarithms and calculus.

Therefore, the shortest distance between points P and Q is twice the shortest distance from point P to the line y=x.Let's consider the tangent line to the curve y=e^x at the point where the slope is 1. This tangent line can be written as y=x+b.Given that the derivative of y with respect to x is y' = e^x, we set e^x = 1 to find the point where the slope is 1. This gives x=0, so the tangent point is (0, 1).The distance d from the point (0, 1) to the line y=x can be determined using the distance formula for a point to a line, which for the line y=x is d = frac{|x_0 - y_0|}{sqrt{2}}. Substituting the coordinates of the point gives d= frac{|0 - 1|}{sqrt{2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.To find the shortest distance between P and Q, we double the distance d, since P and Q are symmetrically placed with respect to the line y=x.Therefore, the shortest distance between P and Q is 2d = 2 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = sqrt{2}.The final answer is boxed{sqrt{2}}."},{"problem":"What is the value of the product[left(1+frac{1}{1}right)cdotleft(1+frac{1}{2}right)cdotleft(1+frac{1}{3}right)cdotleft(1+frac{1}{4}right)cdotleft(1+frac{1}{5}right)cdotleft(1+frac{1}{6}right)?]textbf{(A) }frac{7}{6}qquadtextbf{(B) }frac{4}{3}qquadtextbf{(C) }frac{7}{2}qquadtextbf{(D) }7qquadtextbf{(E) }8","solution":"By adding up the numbers in each of the 6 parentheses, we get: frac{2}{1} cdot frac{3}{2} cdot frac{4}{3} cdot frac{5}{4} cdot frac{6}{5} cdot frac{7}{6}.Using telescoping, most of the terms cancel out diagonally.

Each child has a hat of a unique color, and each pair of children is connected by a ribbon of a unique color that is different from the colors of the hats of the children it connects.1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have ( n ) children, each with a hat of a unique color.   - Each pair of children is connected by a ribbon of a unique color.   - The color of the ribbon is different from the colors of the hats of the children it connects.2. Graph Representation:   - Represent each child as a vertex in a graph.   - Each edge (ribbon) between two vertices (children) has a unique color.   - The graph is a complete graph ( K_n ) with ( n ) vertices.3. Coloring Constraints:   - Each vertex (child) has a unique color (hat).   - Each edge (ribbon) has a unique color different from the colors of the vertices it connects.4. Minimum Number of Colors:   - For ( n ) vertices, we need ( n ) colors for the hats.   - For the edges, we need to ensure that no two edges incident to the same vertex share the same color, and the color of the edge is different from the color of the vertex.5. Case Analysis:   - Odd ( n ):      - If ( n ) is odd, we can use a method similar to the one referenced in the problem. Each vertex (child) can be assigned a unique color, and the edges can be colored such that no two edges incident to the same vertex share the same color.   - Even ( n ):     - If ( n ) is even, we can color every hat with the ( n )-th color. Consider a regular ((n-1))-gon and the center of the circle circumscribed around that polygon. Let these ( n ) points represent each child. The vertices of the polygon are ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{n-1} ) and the center is ( O ).

In addition, the fifth team drew with the sixth, third, and second teams, and the sixth and second teams also drew with each other.Solution. a) Let n be the number of points awarded for a win in a match. There were a total of 15 matches played in the tournament, of which x ended in a win for one of the teams, and the remaining 15-x ended in draws. In drawn matches, the participants collectively score 2 points, while in the others, they score n points, so the total number of points scored by all teams in the tournament is n x + 2(15-x) = (n-2)x + 30 = 12 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 52 points, from which (n-2)x = 22. There were a total of 15 games, so x can be 1, 2, or 11. In the first two cases, n equals 24 or 13, which exceeds the maximum number of points scored by the teams, which is impossible because a win in a match would then be impossible in principle, meaning all matches would end in draws, which contradicts the assumption about x. In the remaining case, x equals 11, then n equals 4, which is the number of points awarded for a win.b) We will find the number of wins, draws, and losses for each team. There were a total of four draws and 11 matches that ended in a win for one of the teams. Each team played five games, so it was impossible to score 6 or more points solely from draws, meaning the sixth and fifth teams each won once and drew two and three times, respectively.If the fourth team had won no more than once, it would have had at least four draws, together with the fifth and sixth teams, there would already be at least (2+3+4)/2 = 4.5 draws, which exceeds the total of 4. Therefore, the fourth team won twice and lost three times.For the same reasons, the third team had two wins and one draw, and the second team had two wins and two draws. For all teams except the first, there are at least (2+3+1+2)/2 = 4 draws, which equals their total number. Therefore, the first team had three wins and two losses.c) Let's provide an example of a corresponding tournament. The fifth team drew three times, while the first and fourth teams had no draws. Therefore, the fifth team drew with the sixth, third, and second teams. In addition to these draws, the sixth and second teams each had one draw, so they drew with each other.

Hence (c-125)(c+124)=0, so that c=125 (ignoring the negative answer, which is not practicable here).Thus there were 125 couples.NoteIf you have not yet seen how to solve a quadratic equation, you could also notice that you are looking for two consecutive numbers which multiply to 15500 .

Let x, y, z be strictly positive real numbers such thatx+frac{y}{z}=y+frac{z}{x}=z+frac{x}{y}=2Determine all possible values that the number x+y+z can take.","solution":"Solution to Exercise 5 In such a problem, it is necessary to examine each equation separately but also to relate them. In practice, this involves looking at the equation obtained when performing the sum or product of two or more equations. Another idea is to apply known inequalities on one side or the other of the equation. Indeed, often the equalities present in the problems are only possible when the variables satisfy the equality case of a well-known inequality.Let's start with a separate examination. We consider the first equation x+frac{y}{z}=2. According to the inequality of means, we have2=x+frac{y}{z} geqslant 2 sqrt{x cdot frac{y}{z}}which means sqrt{frac{x y}{z}} leqslant 1. Similarly, the second equation y+frac{z}{x}=2 gives sqrt{frac{y z}{x}} leqslant 1. By multiplying these two inequalities, we obtain1 geqslant sqrt{frac{x y}{z}} cdot sqrt{frac{y z}{x}}=yThus y leqslant 1, and similarly we find that x leqslant 1 and z leqslant 1. We now seek to apply these estimates or to prove inverse estimates (for example, y geqslant 1, which would imply that y=1).Note that the relation x+frac{y}{z}=2 can be rewritten as x z+y=2 z. Similarly, we get y x+z=2 x and y z+x=2 y. By summing these three relations, we find that x z+y x+y z+x+y+z=2(x+y+z), or equivalently x y+y z+z x=x+y+z. But thenx+y+z=x y+y z+z x leqslant x cdot 1+y cdot 1+z cdot 1=x+y+zOur inequality is actually an equality. And since x, y, and z are non-zero, each of the inequalities used in the line above is actually an equality. Therefore, we have x=y=z=1 and x+y+z=3. This value is indeed achievable since the triplet (1,1,1) satisfies the system given in the problem, which completes our problem.## Comments from the graders:The exercise was quite well done.

Identify the sequence and its properties:   The sequence consists of the reciprocals of consecutive integers from 2002 to 2017. There are 16 terms in total.2. Sum of the sequence:   Let ( S ) be the sum of all the terms in the sequence:   [   S = sum_{k=2002}^{2017} frac{1}{k}   ]3.

Let ( A ) be the sum of the reciprocals in group ( X ) and ( B ) be the sum of the reciprocals in group ( Y ).4. Minimize (|A - B|):   To minimize (|A - B|), we need to ensure that the sums ( A ) and ( B ) are as close as possible. Since ( A + B = S ), we aim to have ( A approx B approx frac{S}{2} ).5.

Balance the sums:   To balance the sums, we need to distribute the elements such that the sums of the reciprocals are as close as possible. One possible way to achieve this is to ensure that the number of elements in each residue class is balanced between the two groups.8.

Since the sums of the three plane angles at each of the vertices B and C of the tetrahedron A B C D are 180^{circ}, point C lies on the segment D 1 D 3, and point B lies on the segment D 2 D 3, with C and D being the midpoints of these segments. Therefore, B C is the midline of triangle D 1 D 2 D 3. This means D 1 D 2=2 B C, and since A D=B C, we have A D 1=A D 2=B C, so A D 1+A D 2=D 1 D 2.

However, since the range of sin x is [-1, 1], the smallest possible value for sin x - frac{1}{4} is -1 - frac{1}{4} = -frac{5}{4}, not 0.Therefore, we need to find the value of f(x) when sin x = -1:f(x) = -2left((-1) - frac{1}{4}right)^2 + frac{17}{8} = -2left(-frac{5}{4}right)^2 + frac{17}{8} = -2cdotfrac{25}{16} + frac{17}{8} = -frac{25}{8} + frac{17}{8} = -1.So, the minimum value of f(x) is -1.Hence, the correct answer is: boxed{text{D}}.This problem tests your understanding of trigonometric functions and their maximum and minimum values, as well as your ability to manipulate and analyze algebraic expressions.

Let's break the problem into two cases.- Case 1: a=bThe equation simplifies to 2^{p} cdot a^{p}=2 cdot p^{a}, and since 4left|2^{p}, 2right| p^{a}, this implies that p=2. Substituting this into the base equation gives the equality 4 a^{2}=2^{a+1}, so a^{2}=2^{a-1}. If a>1, then a must be even as 2^{a-1} is even. However, since a^{2} is a perfect square, 2^{a-1} must also be a perfect square, so a must also be odd, which contradicts the previous statement. Thus, the only possibility is a=1, which satisfies the equation. Therefore, in this case, we obtain an exact solution: (a, b, p)=(1,1,2).- Case 2: a neq bSince the equation is symmetric in a and b, suppose without loss of generality b>a. The equation can therefore be written as(a+b)^{p}=p^{a}left(1+p^{b-a}right)Thus, p mid(a+b)^{p}, so p mid a+b. Now, let's look at the prime factorization of both sides and observe the powers of p. The right side of the equation is p^{a} times a number coprime with p, since b-a>0. If (a+b)^{p}=p^{x} cdot y where y is not divisible by p, then p mid x. Thus, we have p mid a, since x=a. Combining this with p mid a+b, we can deduce that p mid a, b.

Calculate the area of the base (which is an equilateral triangle).2. Find the height of the tetrahedron.3. Use the volume formula for a pyramid: V = frac{1}{3}Bh, where B is the area of the base, and h is the height.Step 1: Calculating the Area of the BaseThe area A of an equilateral triangle with side length a is given by the formula A = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}a^2. Thus, the area of the base is: A = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 2^2 = sqrt{3} Step 2: Finding the Height of the TetrahedronThe height h of a regular tetrahedron can be found by dropping a perpendicular from the apex to the base. Using Pythagoras' theorem in the right triangle formed, with one side being half of the side length of the base triangle (which is a/2) and the hypotenuse being the edge length a, we find the height h as follows: h = sqrt{a^2 - left(frac{a}{sqrt{3}}right)^2} Substituting a = 2 gives: h = sqrt{2^2 - left(frac{2}{sqrt{3}}right)^2} = sqrt{4 - frac{4}{3}} = sqrt{frac{8}{3}} = frac{2sqrt{6}}{3} Step 3: Using the Volume FormulaNow we apply the formula for the volume of a pyramid to find the volume V of the tetrahedron: V = frac{1}{3} times text{base area} times text{height} = frac{1}{3} times sqrt{3} times frac{2sqrt{6}}{3} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{3} Thus, the volume of the regular tetrahedron with an edge length of 2 is boxed{frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}}."},{"problem":"Example 7. Solve the system of equationsfrac{d x}{d t}=y, quad frac{d y}{d t}=-xwith initial conditionsx(0)=x_{0}, quad y(0)=y_{0}","solution":"Solution. Differentiating the first equation of system (10) once with respect to t and substituting frac{d y}{d t}=-x into the resulting equation, we reduce system (10) to a single second-order equation frac{d^{2} x}{d t^{2}}+x=0, the general solution of which isx=C_{1} cos t+C_{2} sin tSince y=frac{d x}{d t}, then y=-C_{1} sin t+C_{2} cos t; thus, the general solution of system (10) is:x=C_{1} cos t+C_{2} sin t, quad y=-C_{1} sin t+C_{2} cos tA particular solution of system (10) that satisfies the initial conditions (11) isx=x_{0} cos t+y_{0} sin t, quad y=-x_{0} sin t+y_{0} cos tBy eliminating t from equations (13) (by squaring and adding term by term), we obtain the phase trajectoryx^{2}+y^{2}=R^{2}where R=sqrt{x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}}. This is a circle passing through the point M_{0}left(x_{0}, y_{0}right). Representing equations (13) in the formbegin{aligned}& x=R sin (t+alpha) & y=R cos (t+alpha)end{aligned}where R=sqrt{x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}}, sin alpha=frac{x_{0}}{R}, cos alpha=frac{y_{0}}{R}, we notice that equations (15) express the time dependence of the current coordinates of the point M(x(t), y(t)), or simply M(t), which starts its motion at t=0 from the point M_{0}left(x_{0}, y_{0}right) and moves along the circle (14) (Fig. 29, a).The direction of motion of the point M(t) will be determined using the given system (10). For x>0, according to the equation frac{d y}{d t}=-x, the value of y decreases (as, for example, at the point M_{1}(t)), and for x<0 the value of y increases (as, for example, at the point M_{2}(t)). Thus, the point M(t) moves along the curve (14) clockwise. By arbitrarily changing the initial conditions (11) (while remaining within physically permissible limits), i.e., by arbitrarily changing the position of the initial point M_{0}left(x_{0}, y_{0}right), we obtain all possible phase trajectories (14).Now let's give another interpretation of equations (15) (or, equivalently, equations (13)). In three-dimensional space, take a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system O x y z. It is easy to verify that the point N(x(t), y(t), z(t)) (or simply N(t)) with coordinates (Fig. 29, b)begin{gathered}x(t)=R sin (t+alpha) y(t)=R cos (t+alpha), quad z(t)=tend{gathered}begins its motion at t=0 from the initial point N_{0}left(x_{0}, y_{0}, 0right) and, as t increases, moves along a helical line (16) located on a cylinder with the circle (14) as its base and generators parallel to the O z axis.Obviously, the point N_{0} coincides with the point M_{0} and that at any t the point N(t) projects onto the point M(t) on the phase trajectory. Since the point M(t) moves clockwise, the integral curve described by the point N(t) is a left-handed helical line on the cylinder with the circle (14) as its base and generators parallel to the O z axis. For different positions of the point N_{0}left(x_{0}, y_{0}, 0right), the integral curves of system (10) corresponding to different values of R=sqrt{x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}} project onto the x O y plane as different curves (14), and the integral curves corresponding to the same value of R project onto the same curve (14).An integral of a normal system (3) is a function psileft(t, x_{1}right., x_{2}, ldots, x_{n} ), defined and continuous along with its first-order partial derivatives frac{partial psi}{partial t}, frac{partial psi}{partial x_{k}}, k=1,2, ldots, n, in the domain D, if, when substituted with any solution x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), ldots, x_{n}(t) of system (3), it takes a constant value, i.e., the function psileft(t, x_{1}right., left.x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}right) depends only on the choice of the solution x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), ldots, x_{n}(t), but not on the variable t.## A first integral of a normal system (3) is an equalitypsileft(t, x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}right)=Cwhere psileft(t, x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}right) is an integral of system (3), and C is an arbitrary constant."},{"problem":"Denote by mathbb{Q}^{+} the set of all positive rational numbers.

Now replace x by x y in (2), and apply (1) twice, second time to left(y, f(x)^{2}right) instead of (x, y) :   fleft(f(x y)^{2}right)=(x y)^{3} f(x y)=y^{3} fleft(f(x)^{2} yright)=fleft(f(x)^{2} f(y)^{2}right)   Since f is injective, we get   begin{aligned} f(x y)^{2} & =f(x)^{2} f(y)^{2}  f(x y) & =f(x) f(y) . end{aligned}   Therefore, f is multiplicative. This also implies f(1)=1 and fleft(x^{n}right)=f(x)^{n} for all integers n. Then the function equation (1) can be re-written as   begin{aligned} f(f(x))^{2} f(y) & =x^{3} f(x) f(y),  f(f(x)) & =sqrt{x^{3} f(x)} . end{aligned}   Let g(x)=x f(x).

Consider (4) for a fixed x. The left-hand side is always rational, so (g(x))^{(5 / 2)^{n}} must be rational for every n. We show that this is possible only if g(x)=1. Suppose that g(x) neq 1, and let the prime factorization of g(x) be g(x)=p_{1}^{alpha_{1}} ldots p_{k}^{alpha_{k}} where p_{1}, ldots, p_{k} are distinct primes and alpha_{1}, ldots, alpha_{k} are nonzero integers. Then the unique prime factorization of (4) is   underbrace{g(g(ldots g}_{n+1}(x) ldots))=(g(x))^{(5 / 2)^{n}}=p_{1}^{(5 / 2)^{n} alpha_{1}} cdots p_{k}^{(5 / 2)^{n} alpha_{k}}   where the exponents should be integers. But this is not true for large values of n, for example left(frac{5}{2}right)^{n} alpha_{1} cannot be a integer number when 2^{n} nmid alpha_{1}. Therefore, g(x) neq 1 is impossible.  Hence, g(x)=1 and thus f(x)=frac{1}{x} for all x.

This implies that the sum of the distances from any point A to points B and C is constant, which is a defining property of an ellipse. Therefore, the locus of point A forms an ellipse with foci at B(-3,0) and C(3,0), and the major axis length is 8. The standard form of an ellipse with these parameters is frac{x^2}{a^2}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1, where 2a=8 (the major axis length), so a=4 and a^2=16. To find b^2, we use the fact that 2a=8 is the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci, which means b^2=a^2-c^2=16-9=7 (since the distance between the foci 2c=6, so c=3 and c^2=9). Therefore, the equation of the locus of point A is frac{x^2}{16}+frac{y^2}{7}=1, with the condition that yneq0 because A cannot lie on the line segment BC.Hence, the equation of the locus of point A is boxed{frac{x^2}{16}+frac{y^2}{7}=1(yneq0)}.# Part 2: Finding the Area of triangle ABC if ABperp ACGiven that ABperp AC, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find that |AB|^{2}+|AC|^{2}=|BC|^{2}=36. Since point A lies on the ellipse frac{x^2}{16}+frac{y^2}{7}=1 with yneq0, and the sum of the distances from A to B and C is 8, we have |AC|+|AB|=8. Squaring both sides of this equation gives |AC|^{2}+|AB|^{2}+2|AC|cdot |AB|=64. Substituting |AB|^{2}+|AC|^{2}=36 into this equation, we find that 2|AC|cdot |AB|=28, which implies |AC|cdot |AB|=14.

Therefore, the quadratic function is y=dfrac{1}{4}x^{2}-dfrac{1}{2}x-dfrac{7}{4}.      When x=3, y=dfrac{1}{4}cdot 3^{2}-dfrac{1}{2}cdot 3-dfrac{7}{4} = dfrac{9}{4}-dfrac{3}{2}-dfrac{7}{4} = -1.      Hence, when x=3, y=boxed{-1}.2. To find the minimum value of the function y=dfrac{1}{4}x^{2}-dfrac{1}{2}x-dfrac{7}{4}, we complete the square:   - y=dfrac{1}{4}(x^{2}-2x)-dfrac{7}{4} = dfrac{1}{4}[(x-1)^{2}-1]-dfrac{7}{4} = dfrac{1}{4}(x-1)^{2}-2.      Since the coefficient of (x-1)^{2} is positive (dfrac{1}{4} > 0), the function has a minimum value at x=1, which is -2.      Hence, when x=boxed{1}, y has a minimum value of boxed{-2}.3. The roots of the equation y=0 are found by setting the quadratic equation to zero:   - 0=dfrac{1}{4}x^{2}-dfrac{1}{2}x-dfrac{7}{4} Rightarrow x^{2}-2x-7=0.   - Solving this quadratic equation gives x=pm 2sqrt{2}+1.      Since -1  y_{2}.      Hence, y_{1} boxed{>} y_{2}.4. The vertex of the parabola is at (1,-2). To find the maximum value of y when 0leq xleq 5, we evaluate y at the endpoints:   - At x=5, y=dfrac{1}{4}cdot 5^{2}-dfrac{1}{2}cdot 5-dfrac{7}{4} = dfrac{25}{4}-dfrac{10}{4}-dfrac{7}{4} = 2.      Since the vertex is at (1,-2), the minimum value of y is -2 when x=1. The maximum value of y is 2 when x=5.      Therefore, the range of function values y is boxed{-2leq yleq 2}."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)= begin{cases} 2^{-x}-2, & x leq 0  f(x-2)+1, & x > 0 end{cases}, find the value of f(2018).","solution":"To begin with, we have the definition of function f(x) which is:f(x)= begin{cases} 2^{-x}-2, & text{if } x leq 0; f(x-2)+1, & text{if } x > 0.end{cases}Let's find f(2018). Since 2018 is greater than 0, we can use the recursive part of the function f(x)=f(x-2)+1. We keep applying the recursion relation, stepping down by 2 each time, until we reach a non-positive argument for f.We notice that 2018 is even, so it can be expressed as 1009 times 2. Following the recursion, we apply the function definition 1009 times because 1009 times 2 means we will subtract 2, 1009 times to reach zero:f(2018) = f(2018-2) + 1 = f(2016) + 1 = ldots = f(0) + 1009.Now we calculate f(0) using the other piece of the function definition which is valid for x leq 0:f(0) = 2^{-0} - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1.We then apply this result back into our previous recursive result:f(2018) = f(0) + 1009 = -1 + 1009 = 1008.Thus, the value of f(2018) is boxed{1008}."},{"problem":"The bisector of an isosceles triangle, drawn from the vertex, is half the length of the other bisector.Find the angles of the triangle.#","solution":"Let A be the vertex of isosceles triangle ABC, and its bisector AM is half the length of bisector BD.

The rounding of a number x to the 7th decimal place, denoted as x^{*}, deviates by at most half the value of the 7th decimal place, which is 0.5 / 10^{7} = 5 / 10^{8}, meaning x lies between the two numbers obtained by subtracting and adding 5 / 10^{8} to x^{*}. For example,4.12310555 leq sqrt{17} leq 4.12310565In other words, for sqrt{17}, we get a smaller and a larger finite decimal fraction (a so-called lower and upper bound), each ending in 5, with a difference of 1 / 10^{7}. (In principle, an equality could stand in place of both inequalities, depending on the rounding instruction followed when only one digit needs to be omitted and that digit is exactly 5; in our case, however, equality cannot stand anywhere because sqrt{17} is irrational, while the two bounding numbers are rational.)For our calculation, it would be sufficient to have a pair of inequalities similar to (1), where the right and left sides are 9-decimal numbers ending in 5, with a difference of 1 / 10^{8}.Based on our data, we can write similar double inequalities for the double, triple, ..., and octuple of sqrt{17}, and from these, by dividing by 2, 3, ..., 8, we get inequalities for sqrt{17} itself, where the difference between the right and left sides is 1 / 2, 1 / 3, ldots, 1 / 8 of 1 / 10^{7}. For example, from20.61552805 < sqrt{425} = 5 sqrt{17} < 20.61552815and24.73863375 < sqrt{612} = 6 sqrt{17} < 24.73863385by dividing by 5 and 6, respectively,begin{aligned}& 4.12310561 leq sqrt{17} < 4.12310563 & underline{4.123105625 < sqrt{17} < 4.1231056} 41 ldotsend{aligned}From the underlined inequality, we can conclude more than desired: the 8-decimal rounded value of sqrt{17} is 4.12310563. (We chose the two examples above after writing all the double inequalities because the left side of (3) is the largest among the left sides, and the right side of (2) is the smallest among all the right sides.)Accordingly, our first data was rounded down, the second was rounded up, as the right side of (2) indicates: sqrt{68} = 2 sqrt{17} < 2 cdot 4.12310563 = 8.24621126, and this leads to the data by rounding up. Similarly, the third and sixth data were rounded up, the latter being exactly twice the third; the fourth, fifth, and eighth data were rounded down, and this alternation made it possible to write the desired value. (We cannot determine the direction of rounding for the seventh data, because from the underlined parts of (2) and (3), multiplying by 7, we get 28.861739375 < 7 sqrt{17} < 28.861739410.If the data were rounded to four decimal places, we could not determine the fifth decimal place from them, because all data would be exactly 1, 2, ldots, 8 times the first. We could only determine the fifth decimal place if either 10 sqrt{17} were among the data, or the four-decimal rounded approximate value of the intermediate 9 sqrt{17} were not exactly 9 times the first data (from the 7-decimal data, we see that this would indeed be the case).Györgyi Gallyas (Budapest, Szilágyi Erzsébet Secondary School II.o. t.)Note. Some sought the 8th and 5th decimal places of the square root in the last digit of the 8-decimal and 5-decimal rounded values, respectively; these are two different things. - Some calculated the average of the data; this is common in physical measurements or where an average is explicitly sought."},{"problem":"1.

For Conclusion A:Given that the solution set of the inequality is all real numbers except d, this implies that the quadratic equation x^{2}+ax+b=0 must have a double root at x=d. For a quadratic equation to have a double root, the discriminant (Delta) must be equal to zero. The discriminant of this equation is given by Delta = a^{2} - 4b. Setting Delta equal to zero, we get:[a^{2} - 4b = 0 implies a^{2} = 4b]Thus, conclusion A is correct.For Conclusion B:From conclusion A, we have that a^{2} = 4b. To check the validity of conclusion B, we substitute 4b for a^{2} in the inequality {a^2}+frac{1}{b} geq 4:[a^{2}+frac{1}{b} = 4b + frac{1}{b} = a^{2} + frac{4}{a^{2}} geq 4]The inequality above is an application of the AM-GM inequality, where the equality holds when a^{2} = 2. Thus, conclusion B is correct.For Conclusion C:If x^{2}+ax-b < 0 has the solution set (x_{1}, x_{2}), then x_1 and x_2 are the roots of x^{2}+ax-b=0. The product of the roots of a quadratic equation is given by c/a, where c is the constant term. In this case, the product is -b/a. Since a^{2} = 4b, we can substitute to find:[x_{1}x_{2} = -frac{b}{1} = -frac{a^{2}}{4} < 0]This means that the product of the roots is less than zero, which contradicts conclusion C, so conclusion C is incorrect.For Conclusion D:If x^{2}+ax+b < c has the solution set (x_{1}, x_{2}), with |x_{1}-x_{2}|=4, then the roots are x_{1} and x_{2}. The square of the difference of the roots is given by (x_{1}-x_{2})^{2} = (x_{1}+x_{2})^{2} - 4x_{1}x_{2}. Substituting a^2 for (x_{1}+x_{2})^{2} and 4b-4c for 4x_{1}x_{2}, we get:[16 = a^{2} - 4(b-c) implies 16 = a^{2} - 4b + 4c]Given a^{2} = 4b, we substitute to find:[16 = 4b - 4b + 4c implies 16 = 4c implies c = 4]Therefore, conclusion D is correct.In summary, the correct conclusions are A, B, and D, leading us to the final answer:[boxed{ABD}]"},{"problem":"Which of the following survey methods is reasonable?A: To understand the vision status of middle school students nationwide, choose a comprehensive survey.B: To determine if a batch of bagged food contains preservatives, choose a comprehensive survey.C: To test the air quality of a city, choose a sampling survey.D: To check if passengers on a plane are carrying prohibited items, choose a sampling survey.","solution":"To evaluate the reasonableness of each survey method, let's consider each option step by step:- For option A: The goal is to understand the vision status of middle school students nationwide. Given the large population involved, conducting a comprehensive survey would be impractical and resource-intensive. Instead, a sampling survey, which selects a representative group from the population, would be more appropriate and efficient. Therefore, option A is incorrect because it suggests a comprehensive survey when a sampling survey should be chosen.- For option B: The objective is to determine if a batch of bagged food contains preservatives. Since the batch likely contains a large quantity of food, testing every single item would be unnecessary and wasteful. A sampling survey, where only a subset of the batch is tested, would suffice to determine the presence of preservatives. Thus, option B is incorrect because it recommends a comprehensive survey instead of a more suitable sampling survey.- For option C: Testing the air quality of a city is a task that cannot feasibly cover every single area comprehensively due to the vast area and varying conditions. A sampling survey, which tests air quality at strategically chosen locations to represent the city as a whole, is the practical approach. Therefore, option C is correct as it appropriately suggests a sampling survey for testing air quality.- For option D: The situation involves checking passengers on a plane for carrying prohibited items, which is a matter of security and safety. In such cases, thoroughness is paramount, and every passenger and their belongings must be checked to ensure no prohibited items are on board. A sampling survey would not be adequate for this purpose. Hence, option D is incorrect because it suggests a sampling survey when a comprehensive survey is necessary for safety reasons.Given the analysis above, the only reasonable survey method among the options provided is for testing the air quality of a city with a sampling survey, which is option C.Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Let i be the imaginary unit.

Finally, C_8^4 + C_8^5 = C_9^5Using the value of m=2, we substitute into the combinations:C_6^m + C_6^{m+1} + C_7^{m+2} + C_8^{m+3} = C_7^3 + C_7^4 + C_8^5 = C_8^4 + C_8^5 = C_9^5 = 126Therefore, the final answer is boxed{126}."},{"problem":"(1) Let a, b, c be real numbers, and satisfy a+b+c=15, a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}=100, then the product of the maximum and minimum values of a is qquad .","solution":"(1) frac{25}{3} Hint: Since100-a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2} geqslant frac{1}{2}(b+c)^{2}=frac{1}{2}(15-a)^{2},therefore, we have 3 a^{2}-30 a+25 leqslant 0.

This simplification uses the difference of squares formula, a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b), and recognizes that a+2-frac{5}{a-2} can be expressed as a single fraction with a common denominator of a-2.The denominator 2a^2 - 6a can be factored out as 2a(a-3).Thus, the original expression becomes:frac{(a+2)(a-2)-5}{a-2}cdot frac{a-2}{2a(a-3)}Step 2: Simplify the expression further by canceling out common factors.The expression simplifies to:frac{(a+3)(a-3)}{a-2}cdot frac{a-2}{2a(a-3)}Here, we see that (a+2)(a-2)-5 simplifies to (a^2 - 4) - 5 = a^2 - 9 = (a+3)(a-3), by recognizing that subtracting 5 from a^2 - 4 gives us a^2 - 9, which factors into (a+3)(a-3).Step 3: Cancel out the common factors (a-2) and (a-3) in the numerator and the denominator.After canceling, we get:frac{a+3}{2a}Step 4: Substitute a = -frac{3}{2} into the simplified expression.Substituting a with -frac{3}{2}, we get:frac{-frac{3}{2} + 3}{2(-frac{3}{2})} = frac{frac{3}{2}}{-3} = -frac{1}{2}Therefore, the simplified and evaluated expression is boxed{-frac{1}{2}}."},{"problem":"Let the random variable xi follow the normal distribution N(mu, delta^2), and it is given that P(xi  2) = p.

Simplifying the problem: First, note that the number of such functions is (binom{m}{n}) times the number of such functions from ( S = {1, 2, ldots, n} ) to itself. This is because the relative magnitudes of the elements matter, not their specific values.3. Counting permutations with a unique descent: We need to count the number of permutations of ( S ) such that there is exactly one descent, i.e., one place where ( f(i) > f(i+1) ).4. Characterizing the permutations: Consider the sequences ( f(1), f(2), ldots, f(i) ) and ( f(i+1), ldots, f(n) ). Both sequences are increasing, and they form a partition of ( S ). For any such permutation, we can characterize it by the set ( A = {f(1), f(2), ldots, f(i)} ) of the first ( i ) terms. The order of the elements in ( A ) and the elements in ( B = S setminus A ) are then determined.5. Counting valid sets ( A ): Any subset ( A ) of ( S ) will give a distinct permutation with the desired property unless ( max A = f(i) < f(i+1) = min B ). This occurs only when ( A ) is the first ( i ) elements of ( S ) for any given ( i ), or ( n+1 ) sets in total.6. Calculating the total number of permutations: The total number of such permutations is ( 2^n - (n+1) ). This is because there are ( 2^n ) subsets of ( S ), and we subtract the ( n+1 ) invalid sets where ( max A < min B ).7.
