There can be some other causes like severe dehydration, side effects of medications if you take any, salivary gland dysfunction, nerve damage supplying salivary glands, oral infections like thrush, Sjogren's Syndrome, etc. -For dry mouth chew sugar-free chewing gums. -Drink plenty of water. -Avoid regular mouthwash and use a specialized mouthwash that is formulated for dry mouth patients like Biotene. -You can also instill artificial saliva drops. -Suck tart candies as it also stimulates saliva flow.

However about 26hrs prior before the drug test I smoked some weed, I was wondering if there s a chance that the medicated mouthwash along with the deep cleaning could have washed traces of the thc out of my saliva. I swished with the mouthwash less than 10min before the test. Thanks Veeda","Doctor":"Hi, Well, there is no sure shot document that deep cleaning can help in clearing swab test, if you have recently smoked weed. However, cleaning the mouth thoroughly can help in clearing old saliva and this can help in reducing the positivity of the test as the new saliva has lower concentration of the drugs. But the best way is to avoid using recreational drugs at least 72 hours before the swab test. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Other causes can be due to viral infection, warts etc. So, first of all, you should consult an Oral Physician or an Oral Surgeon and get yourself checked.

I have been getting sick more easily this year. Just these past few weeks I have been sick with so much stuff I cant even remember.

I did not have to use the bathroom, I had not eaten anything, I was not on my period, and I had not been in a fight or anything yet I could not even move without crying out in pain. I would just be lying still and it would feel as if someone was slowly twisting a dozen knives in my gut. After about 2-3 days it went away and has not happened again.

To remove doubts and also for family history of diabetes, get blood sugar tested.It is unlikely that abdominal pain has anything to do with diabetes.It could have been just spastic bowels due to food irritant (most Likely), however keep a watch ,if it recurs show to a doctor.

Also, at about this same time I have had digestive changes, more constipated than usual and bowel movements that are difficult to start and take the form of lots of small pebbles. Any suggestions? I do take a Centrum Silver and a prostate supplement, but I have been on them for 10 years.","Doctor":"Hi, Drugs used to treat thyroid problem, multivitamins and drugs to treat prostate disorders can cause allergic reactions involving tongue, oral mucosa. The tongue can inflame, look reddish and the patient can feel dryness. Thyroid drugs can also cause as you are taking now sweating which may lead to dehydration that can also contribute to dryness. Digestive changes can be seen when a patient takes drugs and most of the drugs have impacts on the gut. Your hormonal changes can also contribute to constipation. Diet may be a factor which is well aware as I tell you frequent non-vegetarian, lack of sufficient intake of fluids can cause it also. Habits like mouth breathing or snoring may be in your case due to some problem.

I was on 7 days of antibiotics, the last one being today but I ve noticed tenderness where the initial lump was.

If there is severe infection with a lot of pus and swelling then you can complete 10 days of antibiotics and go for extraction and even after extraction you need antibiotics for another one week or a minimum of 5 days.

I had been taking antibiotics for acne before the white-coated tongue started; they were capsules and I opened them and took them in powder form for around a week. Once I started getting symptoms of oral thrush, I assumed it was from the antibiotic and took 3 or 4 rounds of fluconazole. This helped a bit, but the white was still there. I proceeded to take Nystatin oral suspension for a week and a half, 4 times a day. This didn t completely solve my problem. My doctor told me to start gargling hydrogen peroxide and water; I did this for a few days. 2 days ago, I gargled without water and just the concentrated dose of hydrogen peroxide. Today my papillae are extremely swollen and I have a horrible metallic taste in my mouth. Food also tastes more diluted. I also started taking nasal spray for the cough, which is still heavily-rooted in my chest. I am nervous that it could be strep - I am very prone to it. I had a case last year which actually turned into scarlet fever because I had no symptoms until I broke out in a rash that covered my entire body. My main concern right now is my tongue.","Doctor":"Hi, As you said you had concentrated H2O2 (Hydrogen Peroxide). That means 6 percent, this is the cause of your swollen tongue. Because of the heavy concentration of hydrogen peroxide you have got a chemical burn. The region where you have a chemical burn is prone to streptococcal infections. For thrush you should have taken the tablets like Ketoconazole at least for two weeks. There is no need to change medication after every three days, anti-fungal infection like candidiasis takes 10 days to two weeks to subside permanently. Now don't use hydrogen peroxide, instead take Chlorhexidine mouthwash twice daily. You may need another course of antibiotics after consulting your doctor if streptococcal infection persists.

It's weird it's like the skin is coming from my cheek but it's sort of covering my extracted wisdom tooth. It's sort of painful when I touch it with my tongue. I 1st noticed it a couple of days ago","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The flap that you are talking  about  that is also seen covering  your extraction site seema to be the gum flap only..As the gum in the extraction  area is very  close to the cheek therefore  it looks like coming  from the cheek. Slight tenderness  is not abnormal after few days of extraaction.You can also consult your Dentist and get checked. You can also send me images of the flap and extraction  site so that  I can advise you more appropriately. Do warm saline gargles and apply Lidocaine gel over it. Hope I have answered your query.

I think I have thrush.  PC ordered a swish perscription of Nystatin Sus 100,000u as a swish & swallow.  My dernatologist did a sample to be examined & too soon for results yet.  My tongue is still coated in am and sore.  Help-thanks!","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.From your explanation it looks like oral thrush only as cheesy thick white coating on tongue along with soreness and  redness are typical symptoms of Oral Thrush. Nystatin mouthwash gargles will definitely help in improvement as it is antifungal preparation but in severe infection you should also take oral antifungal medicine like Fluconzole or Itraconazole. Along with it you should also take probiotics like yogurt and garlic. Drink plenty of water to avoid dry mouth  that is also common in case of oral thrush. Please wait for microscopic examination result and then proceed. Hope I have answered your query.

I have taken Benadryl and I don’t think it’s working, I’ve been told that if Benadryl doesn’t work in an half hour to an hour to go to the hospital but nothing else is wrong. What do I do? Or what should I try at home?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. From your explanation  it looks more like obstruction  in the duct of salivary  gland leading to swelling  under the tongue  especially  during eating. As during eating  the salivation increases,  therefore the swelling  can also increase. If it would be allergic reaction then taking benadryl would have helped in reducing the swelling. So my suggestion is to consult an oral physician and get evaluated. A clinical examination and x ray can be done for confirmation. If it is obstruction in the duct of the gland then superficial stones or foreign bodies can be removed manually  however deeper stones needs surgical removal under endoscopic /sialoscopic guidance.

Thank you,  Shauna Hi, can I answer your health question? Please type your question here...","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Numbness of jaw and lower gums after injury seems to be most probably due to injury to the nerve that supplies the area and can be probably due to injury to Inferior dental nerve.So my suggestion is to consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated.An x ray and MRI Scan can be done to rule out the exact condition of the nerve and to check if it is nerve damage or just due to inflammation,For now you should do alternate hot and cool compresses over it and along with it you can also take Vitamin B complex daily.It will help in improvement .Regards, Dr. Honey Arora"},{"Patient":"I have been told that my wisdom tooth, which has a crown on it, has a cavity with infection and pain. I was told the tooth must be extracted. I have been prescribed a 7 day dosage of the antibiotic, amoxicillin, to clear up the infection first.

Does my infection have to be completely cleared up before I go to an oral surgeon to have the infected tooth removed?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As your wisdom tooth is having a cavity it is deep enough to cause infection and pain due to nerve irritation then taking antibiotics will clear up infection but it takes time.However, if there is associated severe pain then you need to take painkillers to reduce pain.Also if pain is so severe the crown must have been removed so that pressure is released that will also ease pain to some extent.As far as removal of tooth is concerned, the infection should be significantly reduced if not completely resolved and then extraction is done.In 7 days infection will be significantly reduced.For now to reduce pain you van take painkillers like Ibuprofen or Ketorolac.Hope I have answered your query.

I had it checked by ear, nose, and throat Dr., she said it's most likely nothing","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. From your explanation it looks like a mucocele or a mucous cyst. Mucocele is a false cyst caused due to injury to the minor salivary glands present under the tongue in abundance leading to spillage of mucous and its accumulation into the soft tissues leading to formation of a fluid filled lump. You need not to be worried about it as it is harmless and will not cause any serious problem rather than being uncomfortable. It is worse during eating as during eating the saliva flow increases and it fills up which gradually goes  down in some tine post eating. Many a times the mucocele ruptures by itself by spilling its contents into mouth and gradually heals but in case if it does not resolve surgical removal is the only left out option. As of now you should not only do salt water rinses but should take a concentrated salt water solution and gargle at least 3 to 4 times a day. But in case of large mucocele or if it does not get better or continue to grow in size surgical removal has to be done and you need not to worry as it is not a very extensive surgery and can be done with ease and success by an oral surgeon. For a correct diagnosis Oral Physician should be consulted. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

What can be done?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to 'Ask A Doctor' service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. White like thing coming out of gums seems to be due to gum infection causing pus discharge. As the infection will gradually subside the discharge will subside. You should consult your Dentist again  and ask for a prescription of antibiotic like Metronidazole. Also chew a Vitamin C pellet daily. Continue doing warm saline gargles. Swollen face can be due to punching and inflammation of soft tissues. Do cool compresses over it and take anti inflammatory painkillers like Advil. Hope I have answered your query.

There is no decay,and I see a dentist regularly. I was told that the cause of this is the Lithium. It causes dry mouth, which I had, and have, and that this can cause tooth loss. Have you come across any cases such as this?","Doctor":"Hello,As per your query you have tooth loss which is due to medication-related dry mouth i.e Xerostomia as in this case natural moist layer is removed which causes tooth demineralization. You should chew sugar-free gum. Consult your doctor, so that he/she can take a complete history and check other symptoms to find what exactly causing dry mouth. The doctor may prescribe an alternative medication course. Need not to worry. Apply numbing gel on the tongue and you can use lignocaine patches if the pain is there. You should take plenty of fluids and avoid fried food. You should use saliva substitute as it will enhance secretions of saliva and try to breathe from the nose instead of the mouth.

It is a non-emergency, elective procedure at this time.  I am an otherwise healthy 30 year old male.  I had a medical checkup and bloodwork with my general practitioner about 6 months ago, and everything appeared to be normal.  During my consultation with my oral surgeon, my blood pressure was taken throughout most of the consultation, and no one mentioned to me that anything was out of the ordinary.  I regularly exercise 3 days a week with no significant shortness of breath or dizziness.  For my procedure on Friday, I am scheduled to undergo \\"twilight\\" anesthesia as explained by my oral surgeon.  I am unsure what exact drugs they will be using, but my understanding is that they will be similar to (if not the same) drugs used for general anesthesia.My question and high concern involves my recent recreational drug use and its potential adverse effects with the anesthesia.  I typically use alcohol and marijuana on the weekends (including this past weekend) with friends, which have caused no problems in the past.  More recently (as recent as last weekend), I have also engaged in moderate cocaine use.  I will be taking any and all steps necessary to abstain from cocaine usage going forward.  I would not consider myself \\"addicted\\" to it at this point, so abstinence should not be an issue.My understanding is that cocaine, due to its relatively short half-life, will typically leave your system within 72 hours.  I will be abstaining from all previously mentioned usage this entire week, and it will have been approximately 5 days between any usage and the procedure.Due to the nature of my work and my father's relationship with the oral surgeon (he is a dentist, they refer work to each other, and I have given my father permission to view my medical records if necessary), I would strongly prefer to not mention any of this to the oral surgeon.  At the same time, I understand my safety is important.To boil all of this information down to my question, if the cocaine metabolites have left my system by Friday morning, will I be in a safer condition to undergo the procedure?  Because the procedure is elective, I have no problem postponing the procedure for another 1-2 weeks at a minimum to ensure my system is clean and my vitals are stable.  I have read conflicting medical research online, with some journals indicating a cocaine positive patient is not at any greater risk for complications than a cocaine negative patient, but I have seen other medical professionals recommending that such patients wait closer to 2 weeks.I apologize for the rather lengthy question, but I wanted to provide as much information as possible to receive a more informed response.  I do appreciate your help and advice.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Yes, it is true that you should be clean of any recreational drugs in your blood before you go for any anaesthesia procedure. You should be free from any drug intake for about 2 weeks.But still without intimating your Doctor/dentist, it is not appropriate to proceed for treatment procedure. So, my suggestion is to discuss with your dentist and get a blood test done and once you are assured then you can proceed for anaesthesia and treatment.  Hope I have answered your query.

I had root canal redone & crowned 18 months ago, shortly after (a few weeks) my tongue swelled up (and I had two days of fever)... dentist said all the x-rays looked fine and it wasn't my tooth.As the tongue swelling when on for months & months I realized I was getting re-flux while I slept (mind you I'm young, thin, eat well, don't smoke, don't drink caffeine or soda, etc). I went on a few clean eating programs for sometimes up to 90 days and it would subside... so it got me thinking to the tooth again.

An oral surgeon had to remove it as it was a complex removal and probably touching my sinus cavity. Sure enough, ABSCESSED! The removal and tissue damage also left a hole in my sinus cavity that was patched up with collagen during surgery.I'm less than a week post op and still getting the reflux, however it was gone the first two days after, I'm thinking when my body was happy it was gone.

I just turned 18 mid-July. I have trismus on the left-side of my jaw, which is painful to the point that it affects my throat muscles on my left-side, making it half-way hard to swallow (my throat has pretty much healed, but nothing else). The swelling on my left cheek is barely going down as the days go by, while my right-side (cheek, throat, and jaw) has pretty much healed completely. I knew trismus was a complication of the surgery while under seeation. However, last night, I started to lose my voice. My throat no longer hurts except for a minor tinge, yet when I woke uo this morning, I had lost my voice even more. I've been taking my antibiotics every six hours as prescribed (while I'm awake), so I don't see how this could be an infection. Even so, this was not listed as a side affect of my wisdom tooth removal surgery. Why did I lose my voice and how can I get it back. I wouldn't be that concerned if hoarseness was listed as a side affect, but since it wasn't and I'm starting college this Friday (where I need to be able to speak to people), this is very concerning.","Doctor":"Hello,It looks like inflammation causing Laryngitis [inflammation of vocal cords causing loss of voice] and if the swelling is not yet subsided then it is probably due to the wisdom tooth extraction.The inflammation can spread to the throat as the area of wisdom tooth is close to the throat.

This follows dental surgery 25 days ago to remove  teeth (front bottom), two implants, and two bone grafts.  Also follows 5-6 weeks of flu-like symptoms (respiratory, high fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.), but doctor tested me twice (two weeks apart) for flu type a and b and tests were negative.  Doctor concluded some type of respiratory infection that mimicked the flu that had to run its course.  I was on 3 different rounds of antibiotic before and after the dental surgery, which I finished clindamycin last Thursday, but this 'sore throat feeling in the glands' began Tuesday (two days before finishing third round of antibiotic.  I am diabetic due to severe pancreatitis so diabetes behaves like Type 1.  I am totally insulin dependent.  I take huge doses of levamere (60 units a.m. and 50 units p.m.) and use Humalog sliding scale (high scale used at local hospital).  I take Lyrica 100 mg 4 times daily for severe neuropathy for years now, and synthroid.  Today I saw my doctor's nurse practioner who diagnosed my swollen, painful mouth as post dental surgery trauma.  Tomorrow I will see dental surgeon who is unhappy with the speed at which I am healing (he's not the only one!).  I have tried ice, heat, Tylenol, ibuprofen.  Thankfully the nurse practioner gave me a few hydrocodone (7.5) to take today until I see dental surgeon tomorrow.  I am a 56 years old woman and I live in assisted living so my diet and my medication are handled professionally.  I am very afraid that my dental surgeon is not going to be able to diagnose this tomorrow and since last Tuesday the condition only worsens no matter what I try.  Even the hydrocodone is not completely relieving my pain and what little help it does provide only seems to last for about 2 hours.  (After the pancreatitis and complications, I have a high tolerance for pain meds).  My doctor and I rarely choose the narcotic pain relief route unless we absolutely have to (i.e. following the dental surgery, I took 3 days of Percocet 10s.  Since then I have only used Tylenol and Ibuprofen (neither of which are any help right now--they were helping until this swelling began last Tuesday.  I am in tears as I sit here describing all of this.  I realize my case is complicated:  I had to move into assisted living 5 years ago when I started having TIAs and could no longer live alone.   The professional care I receive here has made the TIAs almost non-existent.  When I lived alone, prior to coming here, I did not take care of my diabetes.  Now I do.

Which antibiotics are fine to take with methylprednisolone?","Doctor":"Hello,First of all, if the swelling is subsided after stopping antibiotic then it was probably an Allergic reaction to Amoxicillin only. So, if the swelling is subsided now then you need not to take Methylprednisolone for the swelling.As far as another antibiotic is concerned then you should consult an Oral Physician and get checked and take the antibiotic according to the need as you have already taking sufficient dose.If you are allergic to Amoxicillin, then you can take other group of antibiotics like Cephalexin, Clindamycin et cetera.

So I pulled a bit away and it’s soft gel and stuff should I leave it as I think it’s medication the dentist put their. But I’ve lost a lot will I get dry socket if I take it all away ???","Doctor":"Hello,It can probably be a blood clot that is responsible for the healing of the extraction site. As you are removing it, complete removal can cause a dry socket.If the tissue is coming out of the socket, you should consult your dentist to get it checked. He can either gently compress the tissue back in the socket and put a stitch over the gum.If the clot is significantly lost, he can put a medicated dressing that will help in the healing of the extraction site and also will not let pain and infection to occur. So better get the extraction site examined soon.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Honey Arora"},{"Patient":"Good morning Dr. Andrew. I am Deborah. Recently I had some pains in my molar gum, I went to see the dentist and was given some anti-biotic Flucamox for 5 days. but to my worry on the fifth day, very smelly mucus started coming from my right nose and later I realized must be pus. it is now 5 days and I am getting worried what abt what to do. pls advise","Doctor":"Hello,It looks like sinus infection causing the discharge of infected fluid from the nose. As the sinuses drain through the nose, any infectious fluid accumulation in the sinuses can come out through the nose.It can also cause pain in the upper jaw, gums, and teeth as the sinus lies in close proximity with upper jaw teeth. So my suggestion is to once get a sinus x-ray done to confirm a sinus infection.If the sinus infection is ruled out, you advised another course of antibiotics like Augmentin and along with it, anti-inflammatory painkiller like Advil advised. Decongestant nasal spray like Oxymetazoline and saline nasal irrigation advised. Do steam inhalation.Hope I have answered your query.

I heard gargle with saltwater helps too.","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..If you have a tooth infection and there is pain then probably infection has deepened to the level of nerves leading t nerve inflammation and pain..Yes you can take Keflex but in place of Aspirin Ibuprofen will be better.Keflex will help in reducing infection while Ibuprofen is a painkiller..Warm saline gargles will not cure the infection so getting the tooth treated is a must.So my suggestion is to consult an Oral Physician and first get an x ray of the tooth done..If the nerves are also infected then better to get Root Canal Treatment of the tooth done..Hope this helps..Regards."},{"Patient":"my husband has had a cold for a few days...coughing, head and chest congestion, no fever.

He rinsed with salt water a couple hours ago but it hasn't helped. He has an appointment for a teeth cleaning tomorrow (a normal 6-month check up.) He doesn't usually have gum problems. Do you think it's related to the cold/virus? Is there anything else he can do to relieve the irritation?","Doctor":"Hello,Yes, it is probably related to the cold only. As the infection will subside the gums will also get better. For now to relieve the symptoms he can start applying Lidocaine gel over the gums to relieve the pain and discomfort.Do cool compresses over the gums to reduce inflammation and bleeding. He can also do warm saline gargles and antiseptic mouthwash gargles. Take soft meals and avoid spicy and hard foods. He should brush with a soft toothbrush to avoid injury to the gums.

However, it can be due to the side effect of the medication, but to be on a safer side, you should immediately consult an emergency room and get yourself examined.You should get your blood pressure and ECG checked.

I just looked in the mirror and seen a hard white bump behind the extraction site. My gum is a little sore in the area and a little discomfort in my jaw around the area. Is it something to worry? Or something that will go away?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Health Care Magic, I have gone through your query and I can understand your concern regarding the whitish bump at the extraction site.Extraction site usually takes a days to a week to subside the discomforts of extraction with 3 or 4 weeks to completely heal the socket. After the Extraction of the Tooth is done, A clot is formed at the extraction site which plugs the socket. The outer surface of the socket clot plug sometimes due to food substances and unhygienic environment does change into whitish colored bump as you said. However, it should be properly cleaned with Normal Saline Gargles and Mouth Washes in order to prevent the dry socket condition. Looking at your case history, i would suggest you to maintain the hygiene of oral cavity positively with Normal Saline Mouth Rinses and Taking Proper Medicines Prescribed by the dentist. Taking extra care not to chew from that side as the food when entrapped in the aocket can also be source of infection. Though it is only 12hrs, so mild pain and soreness of jaw is obvious. But if the pain starts to increase in coming days upto 3rd day, You should have an appointment with the dentist in order to treat the dry socket Condition.But i think Maintaining good oral health and proper medication with mouth rinses at this point will not lead to that condition and Try NOT to dislodge the clot with your hand or toothpick. I hope this was helpful.Thanks and RegardsDr Himayun Mir"},{"Patient":"what would cause a cluster of cavities in a month?  I had my teeth cleaned a month ago and nothing was evident at all.

Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Health Care Magic, I have gone through your query and I can understand your concern. Dental caries is a microbial disease (microorganisms) which desteoys the hard structure of tooth. The Various factors that may help the microbial attack are: Food mostly CarbsNumber of Microorganisms itselfPersonal Immune/ Defence ResponseTime. Though some people have genetic predisposition for caries but other than that Any condition that may encourage the above factors will also increase the chances of Caries.Now as you suggested, You are a Diabetic Patient. In Diabetes the Recovery Time/Repair of Body from any insult/microbial attack/injury is hampered and also it increases the number of Microorganisms in the mouth. Thus Diabetics have a more predisposition for Caries as well.Moreover the Poor Oral Hygiene as seen with many Diabetic patients can also relate to it.I would suggest you to have a visit to your dentist, if you haven’t had them filled all. Moreover, if i were your dentist, i would have advised you to increase your fibrous foods intake, Proper And Regular Cleaning of teeth.I would also advise you to Brush n Floss regularly and positively.

Do not worry as the viral infection generally resolves once the virus completes its cycle in human body.

White patches at the back of throat and very bad smell from breath or Halitosis, if not due to infection can be due to Tonsil stones or Tonsilloliths.

If you have a toothache and the tooth is decayed then the  pain is due to nerve exposure causing nerve irritation and pain. The skin like bump between the tooth if it is extending from the gum then it can be a gingival polyp or a gum polyp. But in case if it is appearing to be coming out from the inside of tooth then it can be a pulp polyp. A clinical examination has to be done to rule out what exactly it is. In case if tooth is decayed then first of all an x ray has to be done. If tooth is in a condition to be saved then root canal treatment will be done after removing the polyp.

As you have already suggested that you have shown allergic reactions to Motrin in the past which is also a NSAID(Ibuprofin). The mouth ulceration in the floor of your mouth is most likely caused as an allergic reaction to the NSAID ointment you rubbed on your hand.

As you mentioned that you have changed to a new Natural Toothpaste, It might be the case that some ingredient might have act as an irritant for causing the inflammation of gums. The Sore lesions on lips can also relate to it. I would suggest you to quit the use of that very toothpaste and see if the symptoms are relieved. If not I would advice you to have a visit to your nearest dentist for examination and ruling out other causes. Use Mouth Washes for Oral rinsing in order to subdue the inflammation of gums and local anesthetic agents on the oral sores to relieve the pain.

Well, as it is 4 days, some throbbing and slight pain is not abnormal. As the tooth was already infected, therefore it can take a bit longer to heal completely. Do not worry as you do not have pain so some throbbing is not abnormal and will get better in another 2-3 days.

If after dental filling there is pain then it can be due to any filled tooth also that might have nerve exposed. This can be a cause of severe pain. Yes, it is true that nerve pricking or injury can also cause pain and numbness but to me the pain look more due to any tooth that has got nerve exposed during filling. If you are allergic to Ibuprofen you can consult an Emergency room and get a script of narcotic painkillers like Tramadol and can also take other NSAID's like Ketorolac. Also get an X-ray of your filled teeth done to see if there is nerve exposure. Hope this helps. Regards. Dr. Honey Arora, Dentist"},{"Patient":"Hello I have a terrible toothache. Its the bottom four teeth in the middle. They seem a little loose when I touch them and they are sensitive. I have noticed over the past two days that it hurts the worst at the base of the tooth. And there seems to be some swelling on the left side of my gums at the bottom. I plan on going to the dentist Tuesday. Until then I'm using Advil for the pain. Is there an dental antibiotic I can buy that's not over the counter?","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for the query. Well it looks like you have deep gum Infection and as the teeth are loose also it looks like there is loss of attachment of the teeth to the underlying gums leading to periodontitis. So, my suggestion is to consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated. An X-ray should be done for further confirmation. Antibiotics for such infection is Metronidazole, Ornidazole etc and that you can buy only after prescription. For now you can apply antiseptic ointment like Chlorhexidine oral paste and do warm saline gargles. Apply Lidocaine gel to reduce pain. Do warm saline gargles. Hope this helps. Regards.

I had this for several days now and am calling my dentist tomorrow to see if i can get amoxicillin again, i am ok with this or in a death situation?  please","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for the query It looks like an obstructed duct of submandibular salivary gland that is present under the jaw. Swelling under the jaw that increases just after eating is clear indication of obstructed duct as when there is obstruction in the duct of the salivary gland due to formation of crystalline stones known as  Sialolithiasis from the minerals present in saliva the duct is blocked. When saliva flow increases suddenly when we start eating and it cannot flow into the mouth there is back flow of saliva into the gland and it swells. As the salivation gradually reduced and also some saliva seeps through narrow spaces left in the ducts there is reduced swelling. You should consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated and he can do a thorough clinical evaluation, although as you are pregnant x rays cannot be taken. If it is suspected to be due to stone formation you can be advised to suck tart candies as at times the stones can flush out with heavy saliva flow. Superficial stones can however be pushed manually towards the duct orifice and can be removed. Deeper stones needs surgical removal and for this it will be better till you deliver the baby.

Shall I be worried or any immediate medical intervention required?? How much time it will take to heal??","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for the query. White patches inside mouth near wisdom tooth area that are not scrapable and is probably due to biting of the area can be due to Frictional Keratosis that is a harmless overproduction of keratin layer over the mucosa as a protective phenomena to prevent damage to mucosa with the friction and chemicals. Other cause can be leukoplakia, that is also over production of Keratin but there is also disturbance in cells known as cell dysplasia. I would suggest you to consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated and a clinical evaluation and investigations like Biopsy can be done for diagnosis. In case if it is due to Frictional Keratosis it will get resolved on its own once the tobacco intake is stopped. In case of leukoplakia you can be advised Multivitamins and anti oxidants like Lycopene for atleast 2 to 3 months. It also gets resolved if the causative factor that is the biting is resolved It can be done by extraction of wisdom teeth. Hope this helps.

Thanks for the query Yes, you have taken a lot of painkillers and if it has been taken within a single night then it can be an overdose [ please mention the doses]. If you have already started having symptoms of overdose then it should be an alarming sign. You should immediately consult an Emergency room and get yourself checked. The vitals needs to be monitored, the doses that you have taken will be checked and in case if the doses are too heavily taken then you needs to be admitted and proper management should be done to excrete the drugs out out the body using i.v lines and injectables.

The bumps or sores inside mouth can also be due to viral infection causing cold sores as in few cases cold sores can appear inside mouth too. Also the sores can be canker sores. So my suggestion to you is to consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated. An oral swab culture can be done if the infection is suspected and then treatment can be planned accordingly. In case if it is due to viral infection only then you can be advised anti-viral medication like Acyclovir, Valacyclovir etc. Topical antiviral gels like Valtrex can be advised. In case if it is due to canker sores then doing warm saline gargles and applying antiseptic oral gels like those containing Chlorohexidine can help. Doing antiseptic mouthwash gargles is also helpful. Take Vitamin B complex daily till they heal. Hope this helps Regards, Take Care!

He was to replace a front tooth that had died over a period of years. Unfortunately he injured the nerves in the area during his procedure. I have suffered for 10 yrs. with many symptoms of nerve damage including burning, fullness & heavy pressure in the area, a feeling of heaviness & burning & swelling of my tongue which at times makes it hard to pronounce words. There is so much more. I have seen many dentists, physicians, neurologists & a neurosurgeon. The only thing offered to me has been medication. I am 84 yrs old, very active, walk & exercise 3 or more times a week and sing with an international chorus of women. Yes, my singing has definitely been compromised by the pain & discomfort. I have been on Neurontin for approximately 2yrs and can only tolerate 700mg daily because of the effects it has on my focus & balance. The relief is minimal. Can you offer me any hope for relief? The only other medication I am on is Synthroid 0.1mg.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Healthcaremagic.com. I had gone through your question I can understand your concern. The symptoms rated to your concern seems to be because of permanent nerve damage. If it is 10years old there is no chances of recovery any more. What you need to do is, reduce the injury related to it. As there is no sensations, chances of the injury because of heat and chemicals are more. As you are not able to appreciate the proper stimulus you are unknowingly injuring hour tongue. You need to keep following things in mind. Take foods and drinks which are too hot and too cold. Clean your mouth before going to bed. Use no or small amount of drinks during late night hours. Keep a self routine check up of your mouth.   You can also use  local anesthetic agents for pain relief. I hope your question is answered, you can write to us further if you feel any further assistance is required.

Doxycycline 100 mg is appropriate in case of gum infection and yes, you can take twice on the first day and then once daily.

Thanks for the query Augmentin is an antibiotic and many a times taking antibiotics can cause yeast overgrowth due to reduced resistance to infection as the antibiotics can kill the good bacteria along with the bad ones. This can cause overgrowth of opportunistic organisms like yeast. So it is better to get a prescription of anti-fungal medications after getting a proper prescription from the Physician. You should also eat more of probiotics like Yogurt and garlic. Hope this helps Regards"},{"Patient":"I m having mouth problems. Just got wisdom teeth taken out like a month ago .

Pain is due to incomplete root canal treated tooth only as there can be re-infection in the root canal treated tooth causing pain. It is causing radiating pain in jaw and ear.

It might be discharging or if not you can take a sterile needle to prick it so as to relieve the pressure within the tooth. This will also lower the intensity of Pain. The purulus suggests that your tooth is infected and most probably there is periapical lesion as well which will be seen via X-Ray. Yea you can take the medicine as the same has no affinity with the drugs you mentioned. Your Tooth might need a Root Canal in this Case as the infection can only subside for some days or week by medicine and it(pain) will recur. You might be needing an X-Ray of the involved tooth to see the extension of infection, so the dentist can see whether the tooth really can be saved with root canal or should be extracted.

It truly feels like there is something wrong with the joints in the back of my jaw that opens and closes my mouth. I have no trouble opening my mouth, just can’t close it enough to bite. Since the ct scan shows no fracture or dislocation could this problem be caused from swelling and will go away in a few days?","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..Difficulty in opening and closing the mouth after injury to the chin when there is no fracture or dislocation can be ruled out is most probably due to swelling of the soft tissues along with stiffness of the muscles..So my suggestion is to consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated..You can be advised anti inflammatory painkillers and muscle relaxants for relief..Also take soft diet and more of semi-solid foods for avoiding straining of the jaw and soft tissues of cheek..Do alternate warm and cool compresses for relief..Hope this helps..Regards."},{"Patient":"I Swallowed The Fluid In my Abscess In my Sleep..

Can you suggest a website that people actually write their experiences with methadone on???","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..Yes, Methadone can be a cause for decaying of teeth but as an indirect effect..This is because Methadone can cause dry mouth leading to reduced saliva production.As saliva plays an important role in continuous cleaning of teeth therefore in absence of optimum amounts of saliva there can be increased decaying of teeth due to reduced flushing debris from the teeth..Waiting for a week under antibiotic cover is fine and you need not to worry about it but you should get the cause ruled out  and work on it..If it is due to dry mouth then chew sugarfree chewing gums..-Drink plenty of water.-Avoid regular mouthwash and use specialized mouthwash that are formulated for dry mouth patients like Biotene..-You can also instil artificial saliva drops..-Suck tart candies as it also stimulates saliva flow..If does not improve consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated..Hope this helps..Regards."},{"Patient":"I was on the antibiotic Cipro for 10 days due to an infection in the root of my tooth.

Is it OK to try another OTC longer day treatment?","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..It is commonly observed that antibiotic intake especially for long durations can cause oral and vaginal yeast infections or thrush..If after taking a single done of Monistat you still have infection left then yes you need to go for further dose of anti fungal medication but only after consulting a local Physician..Secondly if you still continue to take antibiotics then it can cause recurring yeast infections or prolonged duration of infection..Already ten days of antibiotic intake  for tooth infection is appropriate and now you should proceed for treatment of the tooth as only antibiotics can give you temporary relief and infection can proliferate once the antibiotic intake is stopped..So my suggestion is to consult your dentist and get evaluated and the tooth should be treated with root canal treatment for complete resolution of infection.Hope this helps..Regards."},{"Patient":"I got new upper dentûres early Nov. now  my jaw is in so much pain especially in the joint and my temples.

As per your query you had cough and upper toothache which seems you have sinus infection and had abscess in your tooth region and pus from that abscess find no way to escape and it starts spreading in facial spaces and leads to facial space infection.

Numbness last from 30 minutes to I think early this morning was 2 hours (I was groggy at 3:30am).  I am thinking that potentially it might be from green pecans?

Then, patches of small spots and a couple of blood spots appeared on the inside of my upper and lower lip area.  I also noticed a small white area forming on my gum line.  At first, I thought this may be \\"Hand Foot Mouth,\\" but I have no spots forming on the outside of my mouth, hands, or feet.  Prior to this, I have been having some issues with bleeding and sensitive gums as well.  I did switch to brushing with a homemade chemical free toothpaste, which seemed to help, but ran out and have returned to the general Colgate.

Have taken 1/2 of pill, as directed, with little relief. Was instructed to take 1 full pill if not enough relief, but am wondering if I can take a 400 mg tablet of ibuprofen (prescribed to my 14-year old son for orthodontic relief, which he no longer needs). I suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and get excellent relief from naproxen sodium, however have not been taking often as I have learned there is moderate interaction with my blood pressure med (lisinopril-hctz 20-12.5 M). Perhaps it is best I just take a full pill of the hydrocodone/acetaminophen as prescribed? TYIA.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for the query..If you are not relieved with half a pill of hydrocondone acetaminophen combination then you can very much take a full pill as the dose is within the safe range..One thing that I would like to tell you is that pain after wisdom tooth extraction is a common finding, you need not to worry, the pain will gradually subside as the healing will proceed.So if there is tolerable range of pain then you need not to worry and just relax.However you can take Ibuprofen but the combination you are taking is competent and even stronger, so better continue with the same..You can also apply Lidocaine gel over the extraction socket to reduce pain..You can also do cool compresses over the cheek..Hope this helps..Regards.."},{"Patient":"I had about 20 extractions and dentures put in about 6 months ago and never really got comfortable with them and the adhesive.

I went to the doctor and he said it was neurological so I went to the emergency room and get MRI and am awaitiny appointment with him. Have you ever heard of anything like this?","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..Well, if you have a habit of grinding teeth then the denture will unfortunately not set well causing difficulty in adaptation of the dentures..It can continuously dislodge he denture and making it difficult for you to wear them and use efficiently..However the denture will not cause any peeling of skin inside body or the other symptoms of string wrapped around the head..Yes, you are advised correctly that the symptoms can be neurological and even the grinding of teeth can be related to it..So my suggestion is to get your MRI evaluated..Also for teeth grinding habit you can do meditation and reduce stress..Also consult a Prosthodontist for manipulation of your denture..Hope this helps..Regards."},{"Patient":"Had an abscess under my tooth.

My nephew who is about 14 just lost an adult tooth while eating. It doesn't seem to have a root at all and it didn't hurt. He is a HEAVY soda drinker and has pretty rotten teeth. Can this be repaired?Should we put the tooth in milk? Would this help if there's not even any root attached?","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..If the adult tooth or the permanent tooth is broken but there are no roots attached then probably the roots are still present attached to the jaw.No, there is no point of keeping just the crown of the tooth in milk as it cannot be re-implanted..So my suggestion is to first of all consult a Dentist and get evaluated.An x ray can be done of the region to check if the roots are present or not.If the roots are present then they can be removed and bridge can be placed..Another option of replacement can be implant..Hope this helps..Regards."},{"Patient":"I had three teeth extracted on thursday. they have since healed up nicely but since friday evening I have had a constant, horrible headache (moving my head, bending over, etc... is excruciating).

I had gone through your question I can understand your concern about your tooth related infection. As per your history it seems to me you have 3rd molar infection which I can understand is because of pericoronitis of the related tooth. As you know 3rd molars are not functionally important you need to get your tooth extracted. Because of the recurrent infection it can involve the upper part of throat, ear and limit your mouth opening. Antibiotics can provide you relief only for some days and you will get another reinfection and this vicious cycle will continue. For pain relief you can take medication like Ibuprofen if you have no problem with it. Or you can take broad spectrum antibiotics but the only solution is extraction.

During our conversation about my current health and meds I told my dentist I had been diagnosed with osteoporosis.  He cautioned me that I should not take certain osteoporosis drugs because of the possibility of severe jaw and dental problems.  I am confused what I should do.  I researched taking Reclast because of the once a year convenience.  I must have the wisdom teeth out should I wait a several months or even longer before taking any osteoporosis meds?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Healthcaremagic.com.  I had gone through your question I can understand your. Reclast is a bisphosphinate group of drugs called zaldoranic acid. A combination of old age (above 50) and the Reclast drug can lead a disease called Bisphosphinate associated necrosis of Jaw. Which is highly bone infectious disease and can be fetal too. Actually this drug decreases blood flow to the jaw bones, so if any trauma happens to the bone it will not heal easily. If wound will remain there, as in your case tooth socket and will not heal. It is vulnerable to infection and necrosis of bone. Therefore, can be dangerous. So it is recommended that you must stop or complete your treatment of osteoporosis first then go for extraction.

I have no nerves and the teeth are just eroding away. Several have the gums grown over them.

If not, any ideas why I have formed a painful indentation in my gums?","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..A painful indentation on the gum can be due to an ulcer formation over the gum or it can also be due to injury or tear over the gum with hard foods..It does not look like to be due to the gum graft, rather can be due to infection..So first of all get it clinically checked so that the cause can be ruled out and treated accordingly..For now to relieve pain and discomfort you can apply Lidocaine gel over it and avoid eating hard foods..Start doing warm saline gargles as it will help in reducing inflammation and pain..You can also take Ibuprofen if pain in continuous..Hope this helps..Regards."},{"Patient":"J had gastric bypass surgery 8 weeks ago and 3 wisdom teeth surgically removed 4 days ago. Today I have been very nauseated (I had been doing much better with this) and tired, I thought that was because I started back to work yesterday but am only doing 4 hour shifts right now.

I was only able to tolerate about 12 oz of water, 6 oz of yogurt, 1/4 cup mashed potatoes, 1/2 cup ground beef with gravy, and 4 low fat cheese crackers all day.

What can I do about it? Is it because of weak muscles? Can this be fixed?","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to Healthcaremagic.com,   There are many reasons that during sleep mouth opens. 1) There may be the blockage in nasal passage because of recent cold or sinusitis. 2)  Second thing is obesity, if you are little over weighted. 3) Improper sleep, upside or downside facing during sleep. 4) Maloculusion, upper and lower jaws does not fit properly.

The larger one is sore, but I don't see how this could be from a bite.

Because it is above the gumline, it isn't really in a place that would be bitten.  Is there any danger to just leaving them?","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query. Well, you should see a specialist to address the issue in the near future. While it very well could be a normal finding, it is difficult to say anything without more information, and especially an examination and possible biopsy. I would like to know, if you use or abuse any substances such as alcohol or tobacco, have been exposed to human papillomavirus, the medical history of your family, and whether or not there is a family history of rare disorders or head and neck cancer). Also it is important to know that the mucosal tags are painful, growing, bleeding, changing colour.If the answer are no then nothing to worry about it..Whaetever your answers to those questions are, you should be seen by a physician who can look at and feel the lesion to see if there is anything more ominous present. Some cancers will begin with small skin growths similar to what you are describing. It is also common to have small papillomas or other benign swellings of the oral mucosa. The best way to know for sure and to avoid something serious is to see a physician soon.Hope this helps..Regards.."},{"Patient":"pain in right side just belove the ribs, and shortness of breath Hi I have been having a little pain in my right side in 2 weeks time.

I plan to go back to my ENT, however I am fearful no one will figure this out","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..Well, thick saliva and dry burning mouth are all clearly pointing towards a condition known as Xerostomia or Dry Mouth..If the Lymph node is swollen the cause needs to be ruled out..Also the adjacent salivary gland should be re-scanned..For now you can take supportive treatment to reduce the symptoms like chew sugar free chewing gum.Use mouth lubricant like oral gel..You can suck ice pops to reduce inflammation and burning..You can do Lidocaine mouth gargles..Hope this helps..Regards.."},{"Patient":"My husband redid kitchen floor and put several coats of sealant on.We did not sleep in the house the first night.Returned the second night and since then have noticed my glands sore, keep wanting to swallow and burning sensation on tip of tongue.We have tried to keep house ventilated with several fans going now into the 6th day.Is this a reaction to the sealant fumes still hovering in the house?","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..Well, yes certain chemicals can cause irritation when they are exposed to oral cavity accidentally..It can cause irritation of the mucosal surfaces causing pain, soreness and inflammation..So it is better for him to stay away from exposure for another 3-4 days at least and take anti inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen for relief..Doing warm saline gargles can also help..Do cool compresses over the swollen glands from.outside of swelling visible..Do cool compresses over the tongue tip..Hope this helps..Regards.."},{"Patient":"I am taking zithromax and prednisone as I just had a tooth extracted and a bone graph yesterday.

I also seen my gastro doctor and he cant explain the problem.What else can it be ?","Doctor":"Hi..Can understand your concern..Sticky substance forming in mouth can be related to salivary glands and at times the watery content of saliva may decrease leading towards dry mouth and it might be causing more accumulation of Mucous content of saliva leading to sticky substance..So it is better to consult an Oral Physician or an Oral Surgeon and get evaluated..A thorough examination can help in narrowing down the cause and then it an effective treatment can be done..For now you can chew sugar free chewing gum and suck lemon drops to stimulate saliva flow to see if it help..Drink plenty of water..Hope this helps..Regards.."},{"Patient":"Hello, I recently ordered a night guard for grinding my teeth from my dentist.

A while back, a tiny hole appeared right below it between my gum and lip, some infection leaked out, it hurt this terrible burning pain, and the next day the pain was gone, but the hole was/is HUGE.Now remember, i have bad teeth, i need them all pulled, but i am absolutely HORRIFIED of dentists. Anyway, its been bothering me all day, abd tonight i found a brand new hole right next to the older one...its still small, but im now bearing the horrible burning..almost like its stretching. Please tell me what these are, if they can be treated and how, and that im not going to die.","Doctor":"Hello,As you have an abscess since long it has led to breaking of the abscess on the surface of the gum leading to formation of a draining sinus. So my advice to you is to consult a dentist and get an x-ray done. The x-ray will help in ruling out the exact condition of tooth and severity of infection. If tooth is still in position to be saved then root canal treatment should be initiated but if the tooth has a poor prognosis now get it removed for permanent resolution. For now apply Lidocaine gel over the painful area and along with it take a course of antibiotics and painkillers. Do warm saline gargles.Hope I have answered your query.

Drilling was quick but due to gum bleeding and saliva duct, dentist and assistant took nearly an hour to fill the cavity.  After multiple attempts, dentist cauterized the gum to stop the bleeding.  Filling finally held.  Now after a week to heal, the gum does not appear to be growing back, and in fact, has a large enough gap that I can feel the root of the molar with my tongue.  Is this permanent or do I need to give it time to close around the tooth?","Doctor":"Hello,Well, first of all get an x-ray of the tooth done to check the depth of decay and whether the tooth is in a position to be saved or not. If at all the tooth can be saved then it should be treated with root canal treatment followed by a script of antibiotics and painkillers.After that at least after 15 to 20 days post root canal treatment the tooth should be properly prepared for capping and should be capped for proper coverage and strength of tooth. But, first of all get an x-ray done and send it to me for further guidance.Hope I have answered your query.

I have tried to wear the denture for 2 days but can not endure. My mouth and throat continues to be sore. What can be causing the pain?","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..It is very clear that your depth of the denture is the cause of sore throat as the plate of the denture must be touching deep behind the soft palate over the throat.as the denture is new there must be some sharp areas over the tissue side of the denture that is causing the mouth mucosa to get injured and making it sore..Nothing to worry as both these problems can be very much resolved by adjusting the denture.You should consult your dentist again and he can trim the excess length of the denture so that it does not go beyond the  post palatal seal area that is just behind the junction of hard and soft palate.Also he can smoothen the sharp areas over the denture so that it does not hurt the mucosa..Once the adjustments are done you can continue wearing the denture..For now if you can see any ulcerated areas over the mucosa inside mouth you can apply pain relieving gels like Oragel.Regards."},{"Patient":"I had a broken tooth they had to do a root canal on.

My current dentist is stating we need to have him placed under anesthesia and have all 4 cleaned and filled or capped.  I am wondering if this is necessary.  my son has a neurological issue of he doesn't feel pain like most children.  So I have several concerns, 1) Is this worth it for temporary teeth, what are my other options 2) placing him under anesthesia seems drastic.  I live in a small town in Louisiana and not really confident with the dentist.  We have already had issues in the passed with surgery with ENT and how he was handled.  He was held down and \\"man handled\\" to give IV an medication before surgery.  Multiple bruises and trauma of which all could have been avoided is they had pre medicated him  for anxiety.","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for trusting us.I can understand your concern but would like to tell you that your son is just 3 years old and his milk teeth will still last for about 3 years and for this he needs to have them in healthy state.If they are infected or decayed, they should be treated.You are being advised anaesthesia due to his neurological problem only as if the treatment is attempted in local anaesthesia then probably he will not be able to co-operate and can cause him injuries as well treatment cannot be successfully completed.You should however consult a hospital care and he should be anaesthetised only under proper medical supervision of an Anaesthetist and then only the dentist should perform dental treatment..Giving anaesthesia is for his safe and easy treatment only so do not worry about it but his teeth should be treated as long standing untreated dental infections can cause space infection which can be fatal....Hope this helps..Regards."},{"Patient":"I had two root canals August 2016.

Common causes include dental infection, abscess, TMJ problem, sinusitis, migraine headache, sinusitis, herpes zoster or nerve problems such as trigerminal neuralgia. Type of pain, its intensity, duration, onset, aggravating and relieving factors may define the problem. A dull, throbbing pain on one side of your face generally occurs secondary to dental infection. Other pain types such as sharp electric current like pain define nerve problem, headaches feel like a stabbing sensation or can throb and ache. TMJ problem may present with pain and tenderness around joint area, face, neck, ear and on chewing or opening and closing mouth.Because there are many causes of facial pain, it is recommended that you talk to your dentist in detail about the type of your pain symptoms so that he/she can come to a definite diagnosis. Also do not forget to mention that your pain symptoms were relieved by taking amoxiclav which indicates that you had some sort of dental infection.Hope this answer is helpful.

Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..The medication that you are taking are not seen to cause staining of teeth rather it can be due to causes like roughness of teeth with age, improper brushing technique, using mouthwash can also at times cause staining and the most common is poor oral hygiene maintenance..However if you are taking any iron supplements then it can cause staining of teeth..Excess intake of tea and coffee, smoking etc can cause staining of teeth..You should first of all learn a proper brushing technique from your dentist and go for regular dental cleaning that is every 6 months...Use a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water to gargle..Eat more of hard fruits as they have cleaning action on teeth and along with it drink plenty of water..Hope this helps..Regards.."},{"Patient":"I have been struggling with failed root canal for 3 years. I had a root canal 8 years ago that failed then discovered it 3 years ago at that time the endodontist told me 5 files had been left in my canal. He did a retreat then I had root canal surgery and another tooth needed a root canal .the.following year I have another root canal on the complete other s idea of mouth meanwhile my health has been declined drastically I feel tired all the time body aches chills fatigue. This past October I notice a small pimple on the gum line under the tooth that had the root canal surgery. .I let it go until I could not get our of bed so in January I had to have the toothed extract and have another root canal on a new tooth lowered back moler.I have not been able to get well the tooth is still hurting lymph notes swollen been on ciprfloxacin since dec .still sick do they switch me to cipro.no luck jaw hurts pain in ear so bad..help in can t take anymore","Doctor":"Greetings from healthcare magic members,I have understood the reason of your worry and concern. Teeth when infected can cause lymph nodes to swell which is a body defense mechanism to combat against various pathogenic organisms. Root canal therapy is performed when the central tissue (pulp) of tooth gets infected. The most common reasons for infection are deep cavities, poor oral hygiene, cracked tooth, failed or leaky restorations/fillings. If the infection is left untreated, it can cause gum boil or pus formation and if severe can lead to other symptoms such as fever, intense pain and abscess formation over the entire affected area.It is unfortunate that you had history of multiple root canal failures which could be because of incomplete eradication of infection by your dentist, incomplete visits or non compliance at your side,  anatomical reasons or re-infection due to improper oral hygiene. Whatever the reasons were, It is now recommended that you maintain proper oral hygiene. Brush your teeth after every meal and don’t forget about flossing to clean the interdental areas which are inaccessible. Take out time to visit a good dentist and get your complete and thorough dental checkups done. Medications like antibiotics will help in solving the problem temporarily but it will not eradicate the root problem. Hence, i would recommend you to visit your dentist as soon as possible.Hope this answer is helpful. In case of any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask meBest Regards,Dr. Khoja"},{"Patient":"Hi... I've got toothache and I've tried using clove oil, mouthwash, and garlic but nothing helped me ease the pain... I still hve 10 hours more before my appointment to the dentist. Any idea what to do? Last thing I took was rapidus. (Took it right before I type his message) please help","Doctor":"Greetings from Healthcare magic members,I can understand your concern regarding toothache. Most of the time toothache occur from inflammation of pulp tissue called \\"pulpitis\\" (which is central part of tooth containing blood vessels and nerves). This is primarily caused by tooth decay, trauma and infection.There could be other reasons of pain as well which include gum disease, cracked teeth, poorly placed fillings or crowns, failing or leaking restorations etc. So, proper treatment has to be undertaken after detailed clinical and radiographic examination of the affected tooth or teeth. For temporary relief, over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil) or Diclofenac potassium (Rapidus) may be used. Also, avoid hot or cold foods and chewing from the affected side because this may make the pain worse.Hope this answer is helpful.

Can you give me a suggestion?","Doctor":"Greetings from Healthcare magic members,Dear Doctor, I have understood your query. It is very important to first confirm the diagnosis of trigerminal neuralgia as many other medical and dental conditions have similar presentation of pain. Improper diagnosis may lead to patient dis-satisfaction and withdrawal.Once you come to definite diagnosis, then comes the treatment choices.There are a number of medications that control the pain of trigerminal neuralgia.The most commonly prescribed first line drug used is carbamazapine (Tegretol) which is an anticonvulsant. If its not effective then other choices of medications could be phenytoin (Dilantin), gabapentin (Neurontin), oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) topiramate (Topamax), lamotrigine (Lamictal) and valproic acid (Depakene). Start with the lowest dose and then increase gradually until the symptoms of pain resolved. In some patients,  muscle relaxant such as baclofen (Lioresal) can be given  in combination with an anticonvulsant for adequate management of pain. While in others, opioids drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone or morphine is prescribed for very short period of time depending on the severity of pain. However, all these drugs are not without adverse side effects so prompt use in advisable. Handling these patient is bit difficult for general dentist, so if you have doubts, then you can refer your patient to either a neurologist or maxillofacial surgeon who have expertise in handling nerve disorders.Hope this answer is helpful.

Lyme, Leukemia, Tooth issue or just bad luck!!!","Doctor":"Greetings from healthcare magic members,Viewing your query, i can understand your reason of worry and bothersome. Since you have suffered from painful symptoms following root canal treatment, you are relating your pain to dental treatment. However, with such presentations as your case, i think that the cause of your painful symptoms could be multifactorial. There is a possibility of having nerve disorder called \\"Trigerminal neuralgia\\" (TN). It is a painful disorder of fifth cranial nerve that causes episodes of sudden sharp,piercing or electric current like pain on entire half of the face and may cause pain in teeth, joints and surrounding muscles. The pain usually last for two minutes or less and in most cases affect one side of the face. The pain often is triggered facial movements like talking, eating, smiling, chewing, brushing the teeth, shaving or touching the face.Dental procedures do not cause TN. The development of TN in association with dental procedures usually occurs because patients with trigeminal neuralgia often go to a dentist when they have toothaches, which often are caused initially by TN and not the dental maneuvers. It can also occur after viral infection (herpes virus etc) with fever, chills and blisters in mouth.However, before coming to any definitive diagnosis it is important to rule out other medical and dental conditions that cause similar symptoms.1. First rule out the dental cause: For that, i would suggest you to get your  x-ray done to look for any signs of infection remaining.2. Any areas of painful facial blisters – can be herpes  or shingles: Facial pain can last for weeks after the blisters heal, especially in cases of shingles.3. Any other systemic medical condition such as multiple sclerosisIf regular painkillers such as paracetamol/panadol is not relieving your painful episodes, you probably suffering from TN or other similar nerve problems. I recommend you to follow the aforementioned points and consult your general physician for further investigation. Hope this answers your question. If you have any further query then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions.Best regards"},{"Patient":"I went to the doctor with sores in my mouth and I also have chills and a fever for 3 days.

I'd then get a full set of dentures, also through the state. Four weeks ago,  I had the top teeth extracted which went in a line from my left canine, my front teeth, and then ended with the tooth just behind my right canine.

Is this sort of painful twinging normal?","Doctor":"Hi Thank you for your query on Health Care MagicI understood your concern. Since you already discussed the options with your dentist and had chosen the removal of all the teeth, you will wear new dentures and that may be the better option since your teeth as said is cavitated much. High sugary diet,sticky sugar foods,uncontrolled diabetes, poor oral hygiene etc. causes cavities on teeth. Controlling these factors can prevent cavities.Once cavitated, if mild, the teeth can be treated by normal restoration. If it reaches pulp, RCT. If severe or grossly decayed, then extraction is the choice followed by prosthodontics (implants or normal complete dentures)Also clinical check up by your dentist showed no infection, so need to worry, pain subsides gradually. It may take time since many teeth are extracted and the soft tissues got irritated.Take an X-ray of the extracted site where you feel pain and get confirmed if there is any real cause for pain.Even if there is any very small harm to sinus wall,it will heal up. Dont worry.

Its been swollen and bloody for days. The bone underneath protrudes there due to having removable braces during my youth which rubbed the gum so the bone protrudes. Because of this the sore is extra painful and uncomfortable.  What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..A painful swollen and bloody abscess seems to be most probably due to either deep Infection in gum or it can be due to tooth decay if at all you have a decayed tooth in that area..The protruding bone seems to be due to bony torus formation that is an overgrowth of the jaw bone.If you have the abscess/ulcer over the mucosa that is present over the bony overgrowth then it can be probably an certain caused due to continuous trauma to the mucosa..So my suggestion is to get examined by a Dentist.If needed x rays will be taken for finding out the exact cause for the abscess as well as bony overgrowth..Treatment will be dependent on the final diagnosis..For now Gargle with antiseptic mouthwash and also do warm saline gargles..If it is painful then applying Lignocaine gel can help..Hope your query is resolved..Regards."},{"Patient":"I got my bottom right wisdom tooth out on Thursday ( its now Wednesday morning) and I had almost no pain for the last few days, however I started experiencing sharp pain in my upper right jaw and slightly in the bottom.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..Well, pain in Upper jaw after extraction of the lower right wisdom tooth is not due to wisdom tooth extraction..If it would be due to wisdom tooth extraction that is commonly due to Dry Socket formation then the pain must be in lower jaw..Pain in upper jaw can be due to any deeply decayed molar tooth, cracked or fractured tooth while at times sinus infection can also be a cause..So my suggestion is to consult a Dentist and get evaluated and an x-ray will help in ruling out the exact cause of pain and treatment can then it be done to relieve you..As of now you can take higher painkillers like Tramadol or Ketorolac for relief from severe acute pain..Hope this information helps..Regards.."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am having cavities on my left corner tooth and was suggested by doctor on ph as I am travelling to remote area to take Moxikind CV 625 & ericoflam but the pain didn't reduce so he suggested me to take T.

You can continue taking Combiflam to reduce pain but it will give you only temporary relief.Once you can consult your Dentist you can get an x ray of the tooth done and if the tooth is in a condition to be saved then Root Canal Treatment can be done..In case of gross decay extraction of tooth is advisable..Both the treatments with be followed by antibiotics and painkillers..As of now along with taking antibiotics and painkillers you can also apply clove oil over the tooth as it has sedative action and helps in pain relief..Biting over a clove or a garlic can also help in relieving pain..Hope this information helps..Regards.."},{"Patient":"I had a root canal re-treatment on 7 Feb on a lower bottom molar on the right side of my mouth. Following the procedure I experienced basically no pain for the first 6 days and ate everything but attempted to chew on the left side. On 13 Feb while traveling out of town, I felt severe pain in my right upper jaw joint when opening my mouth to eat. I returned to the dentist as a walk-in on 22 Feb and saw another dentist who took x-rays and examined my mouth. He determined there was no infection or fracture but assumed I had strained a jaw muscle. I instructed me to eat soft foods, take Motrin and muscle relaxers to treat the problem. It is now 24 Feb and the pain still exists and I don t know what to do. The main problem is experiencing pain in the upper part of my right jaw joint area. Can you please tell me what I can do to relieve the pain?

Could the ibuprofen & amoxicillin be the cause of the spike.","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..Well, Amoxicillin is not seen to raise blood pressure however NSAID's can at times cause a spike in blood pressure..Also one thing that you need to keep in mind is that blood pressure can be raised  if there is any uncomfortable condition of the body that brings body under stress and dental pain can be a cause..So my suggestion is to continue taking Dialtizem till the blood pressure comes to normal and then continue with Losartan under supervision of your Cardiologist..Also if you have toothache caused by tooth abscess, you should consult a Dentist and get evaluated and it will be better to get the tooth treated with either Root Canal Treatment or extraction depending on condition of the tooth..But let your blood pressure gets in limits first..Hope this information helps..Regards.."},{"Patient":"I have a bad wisdom tooth ache.

I started having pain in that tooth before the feeling came back.  I contacted my dentist and was seen.  He then performed an x ray, it revealed nothing.  He prescribed Norco 5mg.  It helped for a very short time.  Now I am experiencing severe tooth sensitivity as well as severe jaw and ear pain.","Doctor":"Hi,As per your complain slight sensitivity of tooth after a dental filling is not abnormal finding and can resolve in 2 to 3 days. But in your case it seems that it is not just sensitivity but considerable pain that is also radiating to Ear and jaw and it is a clear I education of nerve exposure that needs Root Canal. Treatment of tooth and not just filling will work. At times in acute condition the x ray is not diagnostic and clinical symptoms has to be taken into consideration for diagnosis.If I would be your treating dentist I would first of all remove the filling under local anesthesia and start Root Canal treatment to reduce pain and discomfort. It will be followed by a course of antibiotics and painkillers. After completion of root canal treatment, tooth will be capped to provide strength to it. So better consult an Endodontist and get evaluated so that he can treat you accordingly.Hope this information helps.

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concern..As per your complain it seems that if the swelling in jaw can be possibly due to grinding of teeth but some other causes can be a :1. A dental abscess in which there is pus formation below the root tips of a deeply infected tooth leading to pain and swelling as well as pain and swelling can increase on lying down due to increase in blood flow on upper body and face which can increase the hydrostatic pressure..2. Other reason can be some pathology related to the Submandibular Salivary Gland on that side which is one of the major salivary gland..I would advise you to get a full mouth x ray that is an Orthopantomogram [OPG] done.Also MRI of the salivary gland has to be done..Complete blood count [CBC]..All this has to be done under advise of an ORAL PATHOLOGIST and proper treatment can be planned according to the diagnosis..As of now you can take anti inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen to relieve pain.Do cool compresses over the swelling..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora.."},{"Patient":"we were desperately trying to find out the cause of these symptoms, if you could help us please!

Following the procedure I had dull pain in my jaw that radiated to the lymph node behind my ear all the way to my inner ear.  The pain increased throughout the day causing a dull headache.  Treatment with a Z Pack did nothing to improve the symptoms.  I went back to have another cavity filled this past Monday and was told I had a high spot on the filling.  It was ground down, and he moved on.  2 days later and I have had no improvement in symptoms, and I still feel like my bite is off.

My dentist agreed to see me but says I will have to go see endo anyways.  I am confused about the cause of this pain -- is it from an offset bite, is it new TMJ symptoms (never had before), or can the nerve actually be dying and in need of a root canal even without prior symptoms or sensitivity?

Basically I have no ability to chew or open my mouth, brushing my teeth requires holding open with my fingers. It s extremely painful and I am losing my battle of hiding this condition from the people around me. I have been to several doctors and not one will help me because there is no cure. There are three surgeons in the US that treat this condition but it requires complete removal of jaw joints and lower jaw bone. Disfigurement and the lost of teeth is the future with the disease. The pain is so bad that I have to be on a pain patch but it does not touch the sharp and nauseous pain I have all the time. Who can I go to for help? I am fighting to not give up but I can t find anyone that will provide medical support while I prepare for the loss of my jaw. My family Dr provides the patch but I fear that this too will be another turn away because she can t just give me a patch without some type of treatment. I have seen dentists, oral surgeons, dental college here...not one has the medical field on replacing or repairing the jaw joints. I have 3 abcesses in the jaw bone at this time and one has broken through to leak infection into my mouth. This may be fixed by an endo Dr but he will not touch the other 2 abcesses, doesn t touch jaw bone disease. If you have any suggestions on where I can find help besides Europe, then please share. I can t be the only person with this disease and I can t believe that others have no doctor to turn to for medical care. We have great insurance but regardless of where I go, no doctor can provide the help needed to allow me some comfort for this horrible problem. History- car accident, shattered face. Broken jaws in 14 places and jaw joints were sheared upon impact. I had jaw bone surgery to repair breaks. Jaw joint surgery to remove worthless discs and remove broken bones out of the joints. 20 years later brain surgery to remove ex-large brain tumor. Numerous teeth shattered, lots of fake ones now. Sinus surgery to repair damage and gangrene infections that set in after accident. Was told that left sinuses will never drain to nose again unless I approved a hole placed in roof of mouth. Declined because I have no interest in blowing my nose through my mouth, now I just don t have a working nose on the left side. It is completely impossible to sneeze. Fun stuff. So at this point I am clueless on what options are available. No one wants a patient with a disease that has no cure. I will be on some kind of medicine for life. If I could get help with this, I would be able to have a somewhat normal existence until a dr who specializes in this particular problem is found. My problem is where are these doctors that help the facial bones? I can find a knee Dr all day long, but anything above the neck that isn t the brain...good luck on finding anyone.

I have an appointment in 8 days to see my dentist, what is the safest option for the infection to not spread... Root Canal or an Extraction? Or can the abscess be removed without a root canal performed?Can tooth abscess cause cancer?Ive just recently got done months of dental work, yet their flaring up again.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. When a tooth is decayed or infected, the pus, fluid and gas inside causes pressure over the tooth to get out. When there is not enough space given by tooth such as hole over the top of the tooth, the pus accumulates in the gum around the tooth causing swelling which is known as abscess. If you want the infection not to spread for another 8 days, you should avoid any heat application or hot water gargles over the area. In addition, as soon as you eat something, you should gargle forcefully to prevent impaction of food in the area. You can also brush twice a day and use mouthwash for antibacterial activity in the oral cavity. Root canal is the treatment that eradicates the infection of the tooth while saving the tooth for function. Extraction is removal of tooth along with infection. If the tooth has enough sound structure that can help in chewing and other functions in future, the tooth should be saved by the root canal treatment. If the tooth has lost much of its sound structure, you should go for extraction. You can depend on the dentist's judgement regarding root canal or extraction as clinical examination of the teeth is necessary for that decision. Unfortunately, if abscess is due to infection in the tooth, it cannot be removed without treating the tooth with root canal treatment or extraction as tooth is the source of infection and without its treatment infection will persist. Tooth abscess is a presentation of the infection. It is not likely that it can turn into a cancerous growth. However, treatment of the infection is necessary.I hope this information helps you.

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated as my teeth deserve a lot of forgotten TLC.ThanksKel","Doctor":"Hi..Can understand your concern..As per your complain maintaining a healthy oral cavity needs a regular care and cleanliness..The best way to maintain healthy teeth is to brush your teeth with a proper brushing technique twice a day..It should be followed by flossing after brushing to remove deposits or debris from accumulating in between the teeth and causing decay..You should also gargle with antiseptic mouthwash twice a day especially after meals..You should also eat more of chewable hard foods like carrot, apples etc as it has cleaning action on teeth..As far as charcoal  treatment and fluoride treatment is concerned they are not necessary to be done and are needed only if you want teeth whitening..You can also go for teeth bleaching or using whitening strips but to go for all the treatments is not necessary..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"I have a cut where my gum and cheek meets on my bottom jaw on both the right and left side, how did this happen?

I can barely even open my mouth too to eat.","Doctor":"Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns..As per your complain cut on the area of the gum in the area where the gum meets the cheek can either be due to traumatic injury caused by eating something hard while can also be due to eruption of apthous ulcers..I would suggest you to consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation will be done..As of now you can apply numbing gel containing Lignocaine over the cuts to relieve pain and ease in eating..You can also gargle with numbing mouthwash..Take anti inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen..Take vitamin B complex supplements..Suck ice pops to relieve inflammation..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards.Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"I had 10 teeth pulled from the top last week for dentures but I haven't been able to wear them without them just killing me-there are developed 2 little sharp hard points up on the gun not where he pulled the teeth.

Do you have any suggestions on what these areas might be and how I could get rid of them?","Doctor":"Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..As per your complain sharp points on the jaw where teeth are not present that are very painful during placing denture are due to formation of bony spicules and are formed due to left over sharp areas over the bone after removal or loss of teeth and they appear as sharp elevations over the top of the jawbone and when the denture is placed the gums gets impinged or rubbed between 2 hard surfaces that is the bony spicule and the denture plate..It cannot be treated with mouthwash or any medication and it has to be removed by trimming the bony spicules by a small surgical procedure known as Alveoloplasty..Once the bone gets smooth then wearing the denture will not be painful..As of now you should apply numbing gel containing Lignocaine over the painful areas to relieve pain..Hope this helps..Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I really don t feel good.

I am undergoing the orthodontic treatment that may be the cause but it was my problem since long ago.What should i do to get rid of gangivitis and bleeding gums .","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Orthodontic treatment undergoing patients usually are not able to clean the margin where the teeth meet gums and this leads to accumulation of plaque and debris leading to gingivitis and bleeding gums as you suggested.I would advise you to use specialized toothbrush that are made for patients undergoing orthodontic treatment which will make it easier for you to clean the gum margins. In addition, you can add mouthwash to your oral hygiene practice. Brushing twice a day will help to keep better oral hygiene.In addition, as long as you are having braces, I would recommend scaling sessions with the dentist or dental hygienist every 3 months which will help in reduction of plaque accumulation and gingivitis. After the treatment is over, you can go for scaling every 6 months or on yearly basis.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic. Take care.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"Hi I had a lower back molar extracted on Monday it did take a long time and the pain got worse over the days. I have been taking antibiotics since Wednesday and treated for dry socket. Have been taken dihydrocodiene for the pain but I have a lump on my jaw bone about 3 inches from the extraction. I had pain swallowing and a swollen tongue and cheek for days. What would the lump be? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. If the lump is where you got the extraction, there might be two possibilities.Firstly, it might be a hematoma from the anesthetic injection that was given to you. If that is the case, then the lump will dissolve itself in a few days and no treatment is necessary except ice compressions.The other possibility could be a left infected root piece that was not removed during extraction, or presence of a cyst or granuloma which was the reason for the tooth extraction but is left behind. I would advise you to visit your dentist and get an x-ray of the extraction site. If the root piece, cyst or granuloma would be present, it will be seen on the x-ray and treatment can be planned to remove it. In addition, you can also get a follow up from the dentist regarding the healing process of the extraction socket. Continue the antibiotic and painkiller to keep infection and pain in control. If few days has passed since the extraction, you can do warm salt water gargles to make healing process faster and keep the extraction site clean of debris and infection.I hope this information helps you.

Does anyone know what this is??","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern. As per your query you have symptoms of  hard white lump on the gums which seems to be because of tooth infection which which is resulting in abscess and pus formation. Need not to worry. I would suggest you to consult oral surgeon for proper diagnosis. You should get RCT done to drain present infection. Gargle with Listerine mouth wash. Take ibuprofen and acetaminophen for pain. Maintain oral hygiene by brushing and flossing. If it is due to calculus deposition then you should go for cleaning and scaling of particular quadrant as well.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been suffering from gum irritation for 3 days.

Then I did lukewarm salt-water mouth rinsing several times. Today, the condition is little better than yesterday with less pain. But not completely cured. Could you tell me what this could mean?","Doctor":"Hi Dear, Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern. As per your query you have symptoms of irritation on the gums which is because of inflammation of gums due to a condition called gingivitis/ Peritonitis and major cause of it is every time the cusp comes out of gingival tissue you will start experiencing these symptoms. I would suggest you not to panic about it. You should start  antiseptic mouthwash such as Listerine. You should take a combination of Ibuprofen and Diclofenac. Maintain proper oral hygiene. Don't touch gum area repeatedly as it will spread infection. Visit periodontist once and go for complete examination and  scaling and root cleaning in particular quadrant. Your symptoms will resolve soon. Do warm saline gargles as well. Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"I have a sore on my gums the occasionally swells with blood and puss.  It is above the farthest molar on the left side.  Above that where the gum and the cheek meet there seems to be a solid mass that is white underneath the skin.  My neck and back have been stiff and sore with a lump underneath the muscle just where my neck meets the shoulder.  Something does not seem right.  I went to the ER a month ago and was diagnosed as having a salivary gland stone.  I went to an ENT who did a procedure with wires to open up the gland, but there was no stone.  The mass that I was trying to explain is still there.  Is this very serious?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. The swelling you are describing can be a result of abscess formed due to infection of the lat molar tooth. As it is on the gum just above the tooth, this can be the possibility. In that case, if you go to the dentist, he/she can examine your oral cavity for such infectious tooth and can drain the abscess and treat the tooth with root canal treatment or extract it.Other possibility can be presence of cyst or tumor. In that case, the swelling or part of it needs to be excised and sent to the laboratory for the diagnosis of the tumor or cyst. This process is called biopsy. It also evaluates whether the cells of the swelling are harmless (benign) or cancerous (malignant). You should consult an oral & maxillofacial surgeon for such procedure. Treatment can be advised after the results of biopsy come.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

I am sorry for the agony you have been through regarding the dentures, but I am very sure that the eye, nose and ear infections you are suffering from are not due to ill fitting dentures. Dentures are just prostheses that sit on the edentulous (without teeth) ridge and aid in esthetics, chewing and speech. If they are not cleaned properly and wore, they may cause infections of the oral cavity. However, other infections are not caused by the denture.I would advise you to visit an ENT and eye specialist for the infections you are suffering from. In addition, you should visit a Prosthodontist, a specialist in making dentures, to get a consultation and see if the current dentures can be modified and made to fit better.I hope this information helps you.

As your tooth is cracked, any pressure or touch on the tooth might be eliciting severe pain in the tooth. Extraction of the tooth will give you permanent relief from the pain.However, as you have to wait for the appointment of the dentist, you need to take painkillers.  ibuprofen may not work as efficiently in your pain and you do not need to go for oxycodone. I would advise you to take Ketorolac 10 mg (Ketorol DT) which is dissolved in water and is drank. It gives long lasting relief and starts acting faster than Ibuprofen. You can take it up to three times a day.Alternatively, you can take combination of Nimesulide and Serratiopeptidase (SN-15) if you can get it over the counter. This medicine works really well in tooth related pain. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

As your tooth is dead, it has not created an infection and abscess which is draining pus. Tingling feeling and dizziness are usually not related with the tooth pain. However, if you are experiencing severe pain from the tooth, it may be the case.I would recommend you to visit a dentist to get the treatment of the infected tooth. You might have to get root canal treatment or extraction of the tooth depending on the extent of the infection and destruction of the tooth.However, first I would advise you to visit a physician for tingling and dizziness you are experiencing as such problem might create complications during treatment of the infected tooth.If you are in severe pain right now, you can take Ibuprofen 400 mg or Ketorolac 10 mg up to three times a day.I hope this information helps you.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I can understand your concern. The medicines you have been prescribed are just painkillers and they are not antibiotics so that you cannot miss a dose. As you have taken one dose now and feel better at bedtime, avoid taking an extra dose in just 2 hours. Sometimes, the effects may last till morning and you may not need to take 3 doses. Maintain the dose of amoxicillin. In addition, you can take either Paracetamol or Ponstan as they are same group of medicines with same mechanism of action for pain relief so you do need to combine both.If you are in pain while you wake up or if the pain wakes you up in the middle of the night, you can take the medicine. There is some evidence that PPIs increase the risk of infection disease. I hope this information helps you. I wish the answer solves your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Viraj Ravin Shah"},{"Patient":"My Mother recently had a tooth pulled, and two root canals.

She has been on Bactrim for 5 days and the glands are still swollen one side and below her chin. She says she has no pain in the glands or difficulty in swallowing. Any other ideas as to what may be causing the glands to swell. She is also tired, and nauseated from the antibiotics. ??????","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Teeth extractions and root canal treatments do not have any causative factor in development of throat infection. In addition, the throat problems and swelling have started after a few weeks of completing dental treatments. As you are suggesting that your mother has a bad episode of cold and sinusitis, it is just a coincidence that the throat infection and sinusitis have started after completion of dental treatment. If she is suffering from infection in tonsils (Tonsillitis), then having swollen lymph nodes in the neck can be observed.Antibiotics can cause the nausea and vomiting as side effects. I would suggest you to visit an ENT specialist for examination of your mother's throat and further investigations. Treatment can be started after the examination and investigations.

My left upper and lower teeth started to hurt yesterday and I was disturbed from sleep because of the pain. So I decided to brush my teeth but it sometimes bleed and I don t know what to do to improve my current status","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Not brushing teeth can cause decay in teeth along with deteriorating health of gums by plaque and calculus (tartar) accumulation.As your sleep was disturbed, it is a typical symptom of development of acute irreversible pulpitis due to decay of a particular tooth that pains. It might be present in both upper and lower tooth or one tooth may cause referred pain in the other arch. When we sleep, blood supply in the head region increases causing shooting pain in the teeth that are affected by decay and pulpitis.I advise you to visit a dentist for clinical evaluation of your oral cavity. You may need to go for root canal treatment of the decayed tooth or extraction depending on the extent of the decay. You should also go for ultrasonic scaling at the dentist's which is mechanical cleaning of the plaque and calculus accumulated over the gum margins. It will give you relief in bleeding gums.In addition, you should start toothbrushing twice a day, use of mouthwash, floss and gum paint.I hope this information helps you.

The gap happened 4 years back when one of the tooth was removed for applying braces. I have removed the braces now and stil lthe gap is not closed and creates pain often.Please advice how to eliminate this pain","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Did you the entire tooth removed after the tooth extraction was performed? Sometimes while extraction, the tooth breaks living the tip of the root inside the bone which may get infected and may cause pain later. It might also be the cause that the gap between the teeth is not closed as the remaining root might be interfering with the movement of the adjacent teeth to fill the gap. A dentist can diagnose such problem by taking an x-ray of the extraction site. If such root is present, its extraction under local anesthesia is advised.Alternatively, there might be one non-vital tooth present adjacent to the gap which may cause the pain. The pain might be felt in the gap as referred pain. Sometimes orthodontic treatment make the vital tooth nonvital by applying immense pressure on the tooth. In that case, tooth appears normal on the outside while carrying infection inside. A dentist can identify such tooth by performing electric pulp test. If such tooth is present, then its root canal treatment is necessary to eliminate the pain and save the tooth.I would recommend you to visit a dentist for physical examination of the painful area, x-ray of the extraction site and performing EPT (Electric Pulp Test) for the adjacent teeth to the extraction site.If you are in pain, you can take Acetaminophen 500 mg or Ibuprofen 400 mg or Ketorolac 10 mg up to three times a day.I hope this information helps you.

Thanks for help in advance.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. The first possibility from your description of the swelling and location seems to be presence of apthous ulcer or canker sore. However, these ulcers are very painful and you are not having much pain which negates the possibility.Secondly, the location you have described has a minor sublingual salivary gland. If this gland or duct passing saliva is traumatized due to some reason, it can develop a swelling. This swelling usually hurts while eating and otherwise does not hurt.Thirdly, it could be a cyst developed in the area. Cysts are fluid filled cavities that are lined by the epithelium or a small lining of cells. Cysts are painless unless infected. However, it is very difficult reach a diagnosis until the swelling is examined. I would advise you to visit a dentist for the examination of the swelling regarding its texture, exact location, symptoms, color and size. You might have to go for blood test and biopsy.

I went to the dentist because I thought I may have an abscess tooth (tenderness, tooth felt loose and a small swollen vein coming from the tooth). After an x-ray, they determined the upper front tooth looked healthy, but my teeth needed a deep cleaning. I was given a full pan x-ray and a deep cleaning at my next visit. I was informed I needed one back tooth pulled and my wisdom teeth extracted. Otherwise, they saw no problems. Three weeks later, the upper front tooth is still bothering me .... same symptoms only not as uncomfortable as it was before the cleaning. What could the problem be?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It seems that the investigations and treatment procedure your dentist has followed is correct as the x-ray showed no pathology with the tooth and the deep cleaning has made you feel somewhat less uncomfortable. What you have is periodontitis or inflammation of the tissues surrounding the tooth including gums etc. Periodontitis or Pyorrhea is a kind of problem that only dentist cannot solve it for you. It requires equal efforts from the patient at home. I would advise you to start using a mouthwash that contains Chlorhexidine (Chlohex). You can take about 15 ml of this liquid and should squish it around mouth undiluted for about a minute and then spit. No food or drinks should be taken for 30 minutes after its use and do not use it immediately after toothbrushing.In addition, you can use gum paint (Gumex). It is a bottle containing oil like liquid. You should take about 2-3 drops of it and should massage your gums in the circular motion in the area that is bothering you. This should be done for 10 minutes every day. You should also brush twice a day, floss every night and should gargle after each meal. Visit your dentist after 21 days of the initial appointment for follow up cleaning. Gum diseases take time to heal but proper care at dentist's office and at home can surely provide good results.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

It has decayed to where half the tooth is damaged/chipped. My question is I have gained a lot of weight even though I work out and track calories and have had lots of light headedness. Could these symptoms be connected with the tooth?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Tooth decay is never associated with weight changes and lightheadedness. Tooth decay can be associated with food impaction in the tooth, sensitivity to hot and cold food, pain during chewing, at night or all the time and referred pain can be felt in ear or temple. Other than these, other symptoms are not associated with the decayed tooth and should be checked by a physician for other diagnosis related to hormonal system and blood pressure. I would recommend to consult a physician before tooth extraction as lightheadedness due to blood pressure changes can cause complications during extraction and hormonal issues such as thyroid and diabetes should also be cleared or kept under control with medications, if present, before extraction. If the tooth causes pain by the time other issues are solved, you can take Ibuprofen 400 mg or Ketorolac 10 mg up to thrice a day for pain relief.

Any cause for concern?","Doctor":"Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand..As per your complain pain in jaw on the side where you have got dental treatment done can be due to pain originating from the tooth that is worked on and the pain can radiate to the entire jaw on the same side..While pain in neck on moving it side to side can be probably due to stiffening of muscles and also swollen lymph nodes under the jawline that can be a cause for neck pain..If the nerve is hit then in mild injuries the nerve recovers rapidly and the symptoms resolves and as you already have milder symptoms, nothing is there to worry..Nothing to worry as the pain is mid and will resolve gradually..As of now you can anti inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen and also muscle relaxant like Chlorzoxasone..Do cool compresses..In case if there is no improvement or the symptoms worsen consult your dentist and get clinically evaluated..You can also discuss in detail with me by going to my profile and ask me a direct question for detailed discussion and advise..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards.Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"I went to the er 2 days ago for a swollen jaw due to a tooth that needs to be pulled they gave me pain killers and penicillin I'm on day two of the penicillin and the pain is near none the swelling gone down some but I did notice when I went into the bathroom pushing on my gum some yellow fluid and blood come out it did not hurt but is it something that I need to rush into a dentist right away or can I finish up my penicillin before getting it pulled?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As you are having an infected tooth, you are having pus accumulation known as abscess in the gum related to that particular tooth. If you will press that swelling, only blood and pus is going to come out as swelling is made up of that only (blood and pus) because of the infection draining from the tooth. You can finish the antibiotic course and do not need to rush to the dentist right away. However, as the source of infection is tooth, the swelling and pain will not completely and permanently resolve until the tooth that is the source of infection is removed. Thus, you do need to visit the dentist for the treatment of tooth either by root canal treatment or by extraction of that tooth depending on the spread of infection.I hope this information helps you.

WHAT MAY HAVE CAUSED THIS?","Doctor":"Brief answer:Gingivitis or Periodontitis.Hi..Can understand your concern..As per your complain it seems you have gingivitis that is infection and inflammation of gums or Periodontitis that is inflammation and infection when involves deeper tissues like underlying bone.In case of gingivitis there is inflammation of gums causing swelling, redness and bleeding from gums.At times when any one area of gums gets more inflammation bleeding can initiate from it.Or different areas may be inflamed and any region can bleed at any point of time.It can occur commonly in case of poor oral hygiene leading to deposits over the teeth which creates a constant source of infection leading to gum problems.There can be other underlying medical conditions which can cause gum bleeding are Diabetes, Pregnancy.Oral contraceptives intake can also cause gum bleeding in women.If the gum infection is long standing and ignored can lead to bacterial multiplication in the pockets which are formed between the gums on one side and jaw bone on other leading to damage to the bone and further infection goes deeper with bleeding and loosening of teeth..I would suggest you to see a dentist soon and get evaluated for the cause of bleeding and treatment can be based on the diagnosis.In case of gingivitis scaling followed by gum paint can be helpful.Hope your query is solved..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"Well, when I was younger I had a pointy tooth and my old dentist said it would be like that forever.

The tooth next to it is stained by the gum and the cap tooth, you can see the grown tooth up by the gum and now there's a gap from flossing. What do you recommend doing?","Doctor":"Hi.Welcome to HCM..As per your complain it seems that you have partially erupted tooth if the tooth is completely formed and is present under the gums then the probability is that the tooth is impacted..Gap does not occur due to flossing but can be due to improper alignment of tooth or decay..If the tooth is not completely erupted then the first thing that you should do is to consult an Orthodontist, get proper x-rays done and then he can remove the probable obstruction that has caused resistance in tooth eruption followed by putting braces that will help in pulling the tooth outwards and make it to get  erupted in proper alignment..It will also help in closing the gaps if any present..Along with it if your teeth are stained then a proper scaling of the teeth should be done for keeping the mouth and teeth infection free and will help in easy and comfortable orthodontic treatment..Hope this helps..Regards.."},{"Patient":"Had routine \\"old\\" cavities replaced in late April.

This week my gum is sore, tooth is sore, cheek is swollen and slightly bruised and I woke up with a small white head on a bubble atop the affected tooth","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome To Healthcare Magic.I had gone through your question and understand it.Sore of gums and tooth can occur due to many reasons such as use of certain medications, poor nutrition, presence of bacteria /virus, use of citrus food and cheek biting. As you are saying you had gone through the treatment of cavities, so soreness can occur due to allergic reaction to medication which was used in the treatment of your cavity. Your cheek has become bruised might be because of  cheek -biting.If I would be your treating doctor, I would definitely advise you the following things which are very helpful to relieve from sore gums.1) Avoid hot beverages and food as well as salty, spicy and citrus food.2) Use pain relievers like ibuprofen (if no allergy) 600 mg, at the interval of  7-8 hours 3 times in a day for  3 to 5 days.3) Gargle with cold water and suck ice cubes.4) Drink more water and rinse with salt water.5) Use a topical corticosteroid preparation such as Triamcinolone dental paste, which protects the sore inside the lip and on the gums.I wish this information will resolve your query and other questions are also welcome.Wish you good health.Take Care, Thank YouFrom:- Dr. Nupur Shah"},{"Patient":"hi, my name is debra .i went to the dentist a week ago and find a dark spot on the upper roof of my mouth. can this be due tomedication that i am on or something i need to be concern .at the time i was on two blood pressure medicine and one has a fluid pill with it.

It's super painful. I'm very worried its something major as due to how bad my teeth were before the surgery. I'm in extreme pain in that area. Yes I'm smoker I'm only 31 years old","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As you have got the extractions couple of weeks ago, there are chances that what you are observing as black spots, might bebjust healing wounds or the stains on gum due to pigmetation of nicotine from yoursmoking habit. They might always be there due to your habit and you might have noticed them now.However, have you smoked in a week after extraction? You must be advised by your doctor to refrain from smoking for 7 days after extraction. Thus, if you have smoked in first 7 days or spitted or did gargles within 24 hours of extraction, chances are there that you have developed dry socket, infection in the extraction socket due to compromised blood supply to the extracted area.I would advise you to take Amoxicillin 500 mg + Clavulanic acid 125 mg (Augmentin 625) twice a day for five days along with Metronidazole 400 mg (Metrogyl) thrice a day for 5 days. Make sure to take vitamin supplements and antacids with this course. Refrain from smoking until you heal from the dry socket.

It reoccurs about every 3 to 4 weeks since I had a root canal on the molar two years ago. I also have a sore throat , sore neck and jaw pain. Please help find an answer for me. My dentist had no idea what is going on.","Doctor":"Hello,It seems that the root canal treatment you have had about two years ago is left incomplete by the dentist or you have got recurrent infection in that. If your dentist had taken an x-ray of the area, diagnosis could be confirmed. The molar teeth of lower jaw usually have two roots and three canals. Even if half or one canal is left untreated, the bacterial load increases in that area and re-current infection may occur. Due to the infection, the area fills with pus. The pus gets no outlet to drain so it creates a hole (sinus) in the gum and as the pressure relieves, the sinus disappears until the next episode of increased pressure from pus. Jaw pain is due to this infection only.Now, to treat this infection, you should visit a root canal specialist (Endodontist) and go for re-root canal treatment. In case, the tooth will have poor prognosis after treatment, the Endodontist will advise you to go for extraction of the specific molar and replacement of the tooth by artificial means.However, the sore throat and sore neck are not related to tooth infection. You might have tonsillitis which is just a co-incidence. You can take Azithromycin (Azee) 500 mg once a day for 3 days and the infection of throat will resolve. Do warm salt water gargles for faster relief.I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

There is some tooth left with each so I \\"build\\" my own as needed with dentak. in the last few months I have noticed more & more black on more teeth especially my front teeth.

Antibiotics can take a longer time to resolve infection and swelling and you consult the dentist so that he can take an x Ray and if tooth can be saved he initiate a Root Canal Treatment under local anaesthesia . For now main proper oral hygiene , take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain and do warm saline rinses .

He might be suffering from GERD, causes include smoking, alcohol, obesity and spicy food. You can make many lifestyle changes to help treat your symptoms. Avoid foods that cause problems for you. Over-the-counter and prescription drugs can treat GERD. They work more slowly than antacids but give you longer relief. PPI and H2 blockers will be helpful. Blood in the spit may be due to smoking which causes irritation in the throat which may be responsible. Avoid smoking. It is always to get yourself examined so i advice you to consult physician.

I would suggest you to consult dentist for proper examination .Dentist may pull out the filling and refill it by applying liner or base under the filling,he/she extract the tooth in case or irreversible damage or graft can be given in case of gum recession.For now what you can do is take painkillers like ibuprofen or declofenac and apply anti sensitivity tooth paste like thermoseal for 10 mins on affected tooth then rinse it.

As per your query you have symptoms of severe tooth ache along with symptoms of systemic infection which is due to badly carious tooth and formation of abscess in that area due to which infection is spreading from one area to other by facial spaces giving generalized symptoms. I would suggest you to visit dentist once as emergency dental visit and get IOPA( X-RAY) done to check extent of infection as chances of bone involvement is there. Go for root canal treatment of badly carious teeth and then capping of that teeth. If teeth are nonrestorable go for extraction of them. Maintain hygiene of oral cavity. Take proper course of Ibuprofen and Diclofenac and do warm saline rinses. Lip numbness can occur due to vitamin deficiency , neuropathy , bell's palsy and tooth infection.Hope your concern has been resolved.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have got diabetes and just developed a problematic gum disease that is due to my blood sugar, because my tooth hygiene has been very good all my life.

I am worried because others have told me ill need to have an pop. thanks","Doctor":"hiiunderstabfing cincernAs per your query you have small whole on the upper gum when diagnosed with periodontitis . Well the symptoms you mention in query are probably due to gingivitis , periodontal pocket formation   or periodontitis . Gingivitis sometimes create hole in gums . Well gingivitis can occur due to many reasons like food entrapment in sulcus , plaque formation and most common poor oral hygiene . If there is hole in your gums you should consult dentist without any delay , because if gingivitis is left untreated then it will lead to another serious condition known as periodontitis . Doctor may perform oral prophylaxis ( scaling and curettage )and may prescribe antibiotic course . For now do warm saline rinses , maintain proper oral hygiene and antiseptic mouthwash rinses ( listerine ) .

He was given a repeat prescription which he did not get filled as he thought his tooth was better, but now it has flared up again and it is the week end. I was prescribed cephalexin 500 20 three times a day last year and have a full packet unopened left from a repeat prescription. Can he take these until he can get his repeat prescription filled? Is there a difference? We live out of town and it will save a trip to a chemist which opens on weekends. I don t think his does! Thank you for your response. Nancy Fermoyle","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concern...Yes amoxicillin 500mg could be substituted by cephalexin 500 mg to treat a tooth abscess. Cephalaxin needs to be used twice a day for 3-5 days only. However according to my opinion amoxicillin has better results than cephalaxin in treating tooth infection or abscess. But you could take cephalaxin if not allergic to it & prescription for amoxicillin is not available at this moment.Also i would suggest you to consult a dental surgeon. Only antibiotic course would not be enough to treat a tooth abcess. A root canal treatment or extraction of tooth may be required. Dental infections tends to reoccur after stoppage of antibiotics. Also long term usage of antibiotics is not advised to treat dental infection.Therefore you should make a dental appointment & could take antibiotics till your appointment. Intake of analgesic like paracetamol/ Ibuprofen is also advised in case of pain & swelling.Refer to your dentistHope this information helps"},{"Patient":"I am going to the dentist to have my last molar, #31, I think.

When the dentist was drilling the left incisor, I did not feel any pain. The dentist then took the X-ray and said I would need a root canal treatment as he spotted this tooth has died out and a shadow on the right bottom.  He then drilled a little hole (here it hurt a little) at the back of the incisor and put some chemical (arsenic-free pulp devitalization) into the hole and asked me to go back in a few days for the canal root treatment. I went back to him after a few days as the appointment was set, but I was so anxious that I was undecisive about the treatment. That incisor hurt once around 20 months ago, at that time another dentist took an X-ray and gave me some medicine and said “this tooth would only need root canal treatment if it hurts again.” So now it does not hurt for 20 months. I am not sure if it is really necessary to have the root canal treatment. Because  this tooth is just fixed and looks ok now. After the root canal treatment the tooth would become so brittle that it would need a crown.  I told the dentist I want to have a bit consideration.  Now the dentist has cleared the chemicals he put in my tooth last time and fixed the little hole he drilled. Soon I started another worry as I read. I am worry if the chemical may leak without a complete root canal treatment and cause huge harm to my health in the future? I also consult another dentist for this matter, she said my tooth was not that serious to the extend that would require a root canal treatment yet.I don't know what to do.Here the X-rays are attached . I Would be very grateful for any of your experts’ insights and advice.","Doctor":"Hi Dear ,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern. As per your query you are wondering if there is alternative for root canal treatment. I would suggest you to get root canal treatment done as the access is already open .

I got the first partial at age 46 because I never got my lower 2nd molars and the first ones basically wore out.  Where the 2nd molars would have been is where there is bone structure under the skin that causes sores under the dentures.

I would suggest you to first of all consult an Endodontist or an Oral Physician and get a full mouth x ray done to check for teeth as well as jaw joint..In case if there is any abnormality detected it will be treated accordingly..In case if still nothing is found you can consult a Neurophysician and get evaluated and an MRI can help in ruling out for nerve disorders and treated accordingly..As of now if pain is severe you can take Tramadol and fr moderate pain you can take Ibuprofen.Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards.Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"Please help me.
