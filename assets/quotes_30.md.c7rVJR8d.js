The foci of the ellipse are located on the x-axis. The distance from the center to each focus is c where c^2 = a^2 - b^2. For the given ellipse, a^2 = 12 and b^2 = 4, so c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{12 - 4} = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}. Therefore, the coordinates of the foci are (±2sqrt{2},0).Since the hyperbola frac{x^2}{m}-y^2=1 is supposed to have the same foci as the ellipse, the distance from the center to each focus for the hyperbola, which is also represented by c, must also be 2sqrt{2}. For the standard equation of a hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, the relationship between the distance to the focus c, a, and b is given by c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Here, we assume that a^2 = m and since the hyperbola shares the foci with the ellipse, c^2 = (2sqrt{2})^2 = 8. Therefore, we get:m + b^2 = c^2Since for the hyperbola b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = m - 8, substitute this into the above equation to get:m + (m - 8) = 8Solving this, we have:2m - 8 = 82m = 16m = 8This is incorrect because it implies b^2 = 0, which is not possible. We must have made a mistake with the relationship of a^2, b^2, and c^2. Since for hyperbola c^2 = a^2 + b^2 and a^2 = m, we correctly have:m + b^2 = 8b^2 = 8 - mTherefore:m = 8 - 1m = 7Hence, the equation of the hyperbola with the same foci as the ellipse is:boxed{frac{x^2}{7} - y^2 = 1}"},{"problem":"In the book \\"Zhou Bi Suan Jing,\\" there is a problem as follows: Starting from the Winter Solstice, the lengths of the shadows on the days of the following twelve solar terms - Minor Cold, Major Cold, the Beginning of Spring, Rain Water, the Waking of Insects, the Spring Equinox, Pure Brightness, Grain Rain, the Beginning of Summer, Minor Fullness, and Grain in Ear - form an arithmetic progression.

We are given that the sum of the lengths of shadows on the Winter Solstice, the Beginning of Spring, and the Spring Equinox is 31.5 feet. These correspond to a_1, a_4, and a_7 in our sequence. Therefore, we can write the equation:[a_1 + a_4 + a_7 = 31.5]Given that a_4 = a_1 + 3d and a_7 = a_1 + 6d, we substitute these into our equation to get:[a_1 + (a_1 + 3d) + (a_1 + 6d) = 31.5]Simplifying, we have:[3a_1 + 9d = 31.5]2. We are also given that the sum of the lengths of shadows on the first nine solar terms is 85.5 feet. The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_n = frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d). For n=9, we have:[S_9 = 9a_1 + 36d = 85.5]3. Now, we have a system of two equations:[3a_1 + 9d = 31.5][9a_1 + 36d = 85.5]Solving this system, we first multiply the first equation by 4 to align the d coefficients:[12a_1 + 36d = 126]Subtracting the second equation from this result gives us:[12a_1 + 36d - (9a_1 + 36d) = 126 - 85.5][3a_1 = 40.5][a_1 = 13.5]Substituting a_1 = 13.5 into the first equation:[3(13.5) + 9d = 31.5][40.5 + 9d = 31.5][9d = -9][d = -1]4.

Composite ( n ):   If ( n ) is composite and odd with a prime divisor ( p ), then ( x^2 equiv y^2 pmod{n} ) with ( x notequiv pm y ) is possible. This implies:   [   x - y = p quad text{and} quad x + y = frac{n}{p}   ]   Solving these, we get:   [   x = frac{p + frac{n}{p}}{2} quad text{and} quad y = frac{frac{n}{p} - p}{2}   ]   This results in two additional equal squares, reducing the number of distinct squares modulo ( n ) to at most ( frac{n-1}{2} ), which contradicts ( A geq frac{n+1}{2} ). Hence, ( n ) must be prime.5. Prime ( n ):   For prime ( n ), we cannot have all ( pm ) to be ( + ) or all to be ( - ) because the right-hand side would attain just ( frac{n+1}{2} < n ) different values.6. Summing the Conditions:   Summing ( a_{k+1} equiv a_k^2 pm 1 pmod{n} ) over all ( k ), let ( B ) be the sum of the ( pm 1 )'s. Since the ( a_k )'s permute ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ), we have:   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i equiv frac{n(n+1)}{2} pmod{n}   ]   and   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 equiv frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} pmod{n}   ]   Therefore,   [   3n(n+1) equiv n(n+1)(2n+1) + 6B pmod{n}   ]   This implies ( n ) must divide ( 6B ). For prime ( n geq 5 ), this forces ( B = 0 ), which is impossible since ( B ) must be odd.7. Checking ( n = 3 ):   For ( n = 3 ), we check the permutation ( (1, 2, 3) ):   [   a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3   ]   We need:   [   1^2 - 2 pm 1 equiv 0 pmod{3}, quad 2^2 - 3 pm 1 equiv 0 pmod{3}, quad 3^2 - 1 pm 1 equiv 0 pmod{3}   ]   These conditions are satisfied, so ( n = 3 ) is a solution.The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 3 } )."},{"problem":"33 cdot 18 If sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}} is a positive integer.

What is a + b + c + d?","solution":"1. We start with the given equation (6y^2 = 2x^3 + 3x^2 + x). We need to transform this equation into the form (y_1^2 = x_1^3 - 36x_1) using the linear transformations (x_1 = ax + b) and (y_1 = cy + d).2. First, let's rewrite the given equation in a factored form:   [   6y^2 = 2x^3 + 3x^2 + x = x(2x^2 + 3x + 1)   ]   Notice that (2x^2 + 3x + 1) can be factored as:   [   2x^2 + 3x + 1 = (2x + 1)(x + 1)   ]   Therefore, the equation becomes:   [   6y^2 = x(2x + 1)(x + 1)   ]3. Now, we need to find the appropriate linear transformations for (x) and (y) such that the transformed equation matches (y_1^2 = x_1^3 - 36x_1). Let's start by considering the transformation for (x):   [   x_1 = ax + b   ]   To simplify the equation, we choose (a = 12) and (b = 6), so:   [   x_1 = 12x + 6   ]4.

Thus, the equation of the parabola is y^{2}=8x.(2) Method 1: Let A(x_{1},y_{1}) and B(x_{2},y_{2}). Then we have x_{1}+x_{2}=2 and y_{1}+y_{2}=-2.  As A and B are on the parabola, we also have:begin{cases}y_{1}^{2} = 8x_{1} y_{2}^{2} = 8x_{2}end{cases}Subtracting these two equations, we get:frac{y_{1}^{2}-y_{2}^{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}} = 8frac{x_{1}-x_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}} = frac{8}{y_{1}+y_{2}}= frac{8}{-2}=-4Thus, the slope of line AB is -4. The equation of line AB passing through point P(1,-1) with slope -4 is y=-4(x-1)-1, which simplifies to:boxed{4x+y-3=0}Method 2: Since line AB has a slope, let's take the equation of line AB to be y=k(x-1)-1. For points A(x_{1},y_{1}) and B(x_{2},y_{2}) on this line and the parabola, we get the system:begin{cases}y^{2}=8x y=k(x-1)-1end{cases}Eliminating x, we obtain ky^{2}-8y-8k-8=0. The discriminant of this quadratic equation in y is Delta = 32(k+frac{1}{2})^{2}+56 > 0, thus ensuring the existence of two solutions for y. We also have y_{1}+y_{2}= frac{8}{k}. Since y_{1}+y_{2}=-2, it follows that frac{8}{k}=-2 and thus k=-4.Therefore, the equation of line AB is again y=-4(x-1)-1, which simplifies to:boxed{4x+y-3=0}"},{"problem":"7.

Since ( n ) must be a positive integer, ( frac{3^p - p}{p + 1} ) must also be an integer. This implies that ( 3^p - p ) must be divisible by ( p + 1 ).3. We will test small prime values of ( p ) to find possible solutions.   - For ( p = 2 ):     [ 3^2 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 ]     [ n = frac{7}{2 + 1} = frac{7}{3} ]     Since ( frac{7}{3} ) is not an integer, ( p = 2 ) does not work.   - For ( p = 3 ):     [ 3^3 - 3 = 27 - 3 = 24 ]     [ n = frac{24}{3 + 1} = frac{24}{4} = 6 ]     Since ( 6 ) is an integer, ( (n, p) = (6, 3) ) is a solution.   - For ( p = 5 ):     [ 3^5 - 5 = 243 - 5 = 238 ]     [ n = frac{238}{5 + 1} = frac{238}{6} ]     Since ( frac{238}{6} ) is not an integer, ( p = 5 ) does not work.   - For ( p = 7 ):     [ 3^7 - 7 = 2187 - 7 = 2180 ]     [ n = frac{2180}{7 + 1} = frac{2180}{8} = 272.5 ]     Since ( 272.5 ) is not an integer, ( p = 7 ) does not work.4.

Fix integers n geq k geq 2. We call a collection of integral valued coins n-diverse if no value occurs in it more than n times. Given such a collection, a number S is n-reachable if that collection contains n coins whose sum of values equals S. Find the least positive integer D such that for any n-diverse collection of D coins there are at least k numbers that are n-reachable.Bulgaria, Alexandar Ivanov","solution":"Solution. The required number is D=n+k-1. We first show that n+k-2 coins are not enough. Indeed, if a collection consists of n coins of value 1 and k-2(<n) coins of value 2 , then all n-reachable numbers have the form x+2 y=n+y (since x+y=n ), where y in{0,1, ldots, k-2}. Thus, there are only k-1 such numbers.To prove that the number D=n+k-1 suffices, we make use of the following lemma. In the sequel, we denote a coin and its value by the same letter.Lemma. In any n-diverse collection of D coins one may find D-n disjoint pairs, each consisting of two coins of distinct values.Proof. Enumerate the coins c_{1} leq c_{2} leq cdots leq c_{D} in a non-decreasing order according to their values. Then the desired pairs are left(c_{1}, c_{n+1}right),left(c_{2}, c_{n+2}right), ldots,left(c_{D-n}, c_{D}right) : they are clearly disjoint, and the equality c_{i}=c_{n+i} would yield c_{i}=c_{i+1}=cdots=c_{i+n} which contradicts n-diversity of the collection.Now, given any n-diverse collection of D=n+k-1 coins, apply the lemma to find pairs left(a_{1}, b_{1}right),left(a_{2}, b_{2}right), ldots,left(a_{k-1}, b_{k-1}right); the coins in each pair are listed so that a_{i}<b_{i} for every i=1,2, ldots, k-1. Let c_{1}, ldots, c_{n-k+1} be the other coins in the collection.Set S=c_{1}+c_{2}+cdots+c_{n-k+1}. Then each of the k sumsS_{m}=S+sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{i}+sum_{i=m+1}^{k-1} b_{i}, quad m=0,1, ldots, k-1is clearly n-reachable. Moreover, the inequalities imposed on the pairs yield S_{0}<S_{1}<cdots< S_{k-1}, so we have found k distinct n-reachable numbers, as required.Remark. One may notice that the ideas in the solution above are close to those used in the classical proof of the celebrated Erdős-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem."},{"problem":"32nd Putnam 1971 Problem B2 Let X be the set of all reals except 0 and 1.

Your goal is to finish a round with all of the lamps switched on.Determine for which n you can achieve this goal.","solution":"To determine for which positive integers ( n ) it is possible to achieve the goal of having all lamps switched on after a series of rounds, we need to analyze the switching process in detail.1. Base Cases:   - For ( n = 1 ):     - In the first round, we press the only switch, turning the lamp on. Thus, it is possible to achieve the goal.   - For ( n = 2 ):     - In the first round, we press one switch, turning one lamp on.     - In the second round, we press both switches, changing the state of both lamps. This will result in one lamp being on and the other being off, or both being off again.

General Case Analysis:   - We index the lamps ( 1, 2, dots, n ).   - Consider the following \\"standard process\\":     - In round ( k ), we switch ( k ) lamps. If ( k ) is odd, we switch lamps ( 2, dots, k+1 ). If ( k ) is even, we switch lamps ( 1, dots, k ).     - The effect of round ( 2k-1 ) and round ( 2k ) combined is equivalent to switching just lamp ( 1 ).3. Even ( n ):   - If ( n = 2m ) is even, we choose an even integer ( k ) such that ( m leq 2k leq n ). This is possible whenever ( n geq 4 ).   - We switch the lamps according to the standard process, except that in round ( m ), we switch only the lamps that are not switched in the standard process.     - If ( m ) is odd, we switch lamps ( 1, m+2, m+3, dots, 2m ).     - If ( m ) is even, we switch lamps ( m+1, m+2, dots, 2m ).   - After ( 2k ) rounds, the standard process will end with all lamps being off, but our modified process will be equivalent to all lamps being switched once more, thus all on.4. Odd ( n ):   - If ( n = 4m + 1 ):     - We switch lamps according to the standard process, except that in round ( n ), we switch all lamps ( 1, dots, n ).     - After round ( 4m ), all lamps will be off. Therefore, after round ( n ), all lamps are on.   - If ( n = 4m + 3 ):     - We choose an odd integer ( k ) such that ( 2m + 2 leq 2k leq n ). This is possible whenever ( n geq 7 ).     - We switch the lamps according to the standard process, except that in round ( 2m + 1 ), we switch lamps ( 2m + 3, dots, 4m + 3 ).     - After ( 2k ) rounds, the standard process will end with only lamp ( 1 ) on.

Prove Concyclicity:   - By Brahmagupta's Theorem, the perpendiculars from P to the sides of the cyclic quadrilateral ABCD are concurrent at the orthocenter of the quadrilateral.   - Since AC perp BD, P is the orthocenter of the quadrilateral ABCD.   - The projections W, X, Y, Z of P on AB, BC, CD, DA respectively form a rectangle because P is the orthocenter.   - The midpoints E, F, G, H of the sides AB, BC, CD, DA respectively form another rectangle because the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral bisect each other.   - Since E, F, G, H form a rectangle and W, X, Y, Z form a rectangle, and both rectangles share the same center (the midpoint of P), they are concyclic.3. Angle Chasing:   - angle EWG = 90^circ because W is the foot of the perpendicular from P to AB and E is the midpoint of AB.   - Similarly, angle FXH = 90^circ, angle GYF = 90^circ, and angle HZP = 90^circ.   - Therefore, E, F, G, H, W, X, Y, Z lie on the same circle.Thus, E, F, G, H, W, X, Y, Z are concyclic.

Using Pythagoras Theorem:   - Let O be the center of Omega and R be its radius.   - The distance d between O and P is given.   - Drop perpendiculars from O to AC and BD at points S and T respectively.   - Since OSPT is a rectangle, OS = OT = R.   - By Pythagoras' theorem in triangle OSP and triangle OTP, we have:     [     OP^2 = OS^2 + SP^2 = R^2 + d^2     ]   - Therefore, the radius of the circle in part (a) is:     [     text{Radius} = frac{1}{2} sqrt{AC^2 + BD^2} = frac{1}{2} sqrt{2R^2 - d^2}     ]The final answer is boxed{frac{sqrt{2R^2 - d^2}}{2}}"},{"problem":"Given that the function f(x) = log_{sin 1}(x^2 - 6x + 5) is a decreasing function on the interval (a, +infty), find the range of values for the real number a.","solution":"To determine the range of a, we first need to ascertain the domain of f(x) where sin 1 is the base of the logarithm. It is known that the argument of a logarithm must be positive, thus we require:x^2 - 6x + 5 > 0.This inequality can be factored into:(x - 5)(x - 1) > 0.Solving this inequality tells us that x must be either greater than 5 or less than 1 for the function to be defined. Thus, the domain of f(x) is (1, +infty) cup (-infty, 5).Now let t = x^2 - 6x + 5. Since t is a quadratic function with a positive leading coefficient, it opens upwards and has its minimum at the vertex (3, -4). Hence, t is increasing on the interval (3, +infty) and in particular on (5, +infty), a subset of the function's domain.We also know that 0 < sin 1 < 1. Thus, a logarithm with base sin 1 is a decreasing function because as the argument of the logarithm becomes larger, the value of the logarithm itself gets smaller due to the base being between 0 and 1. As a result, f(x) = log_{sin 1}(t) is decreasing when t is increasing within the allowed domain.Since we determined that t is increasing on (5, +infty) and this will cause f(x) to decrease on this interval, for f(x) to be a decreasing function as indicated in the problem, we conclude that a must be at least 5. Beyond x = 5, the quadratic t increases, ensuring f(x) decreases due to the nature of the logarithm with a base less than 1.Therefore, the range of values for a so that f(x) is decreasing on (a, +infty) is:a geq 5.So, the range for a is boxed{[5, +infty)}."},{"problem":"2.

[5] Pentagon A B C D E is circumscribed around a circle. The angles at its vertices A, C and E are 100^{circ}. Find the angle A C E.","solution":"Answer: 40^{circ}. It is not hard to understand that such a pentagon exists.Solution 1. The lines connecting the vertices with the center O of the inscribed circle omega are the angle bisectors of the pentagon. Therefore, angle O A E=angle O E A=50^{circ}, angle A O E=80^{circ}. Let omega touch the sides B C and A E at points K and M respectively. Then angle O C K=50^{circ}, and the right triangles O M A, O K C and O M E are equal by the leg and the opposite angle. Thus, O A=O C=O E, i.e., points A, C and E lie on a circle with center O. Therefore, angle A C E=frac{1}{2} angle A O E=40^{circ}. Solution 2. Since the angles A, C, E are equal, all tangents to the circle from these vertices are equal. Since the tangents from vertex B are also equal, triangle A B C is isosceles, and triangle C D E is also (analogously).

Maximum 15 points. A school economics teacher believes it is extremely important to know the basics of both microeconomics and macroeconomics. Therefore, for his subject, he has introduced the following final grading system. First, the student's study of the basics of microeconomics ( O_{text {micro }} ) is assessed out of 5 points, and then the basics of macroeconomics ( O_{text {macro }} ) are assessed out of 5 points. The final grade in economics is formed as the minimum value of two quantities: 0.25 * O_{text {micro }}+0.75 * O_{text {macro }} and 0.75 * O_{text {micro }}+0.25 * O_{text {macro }} (the final value is rounded to the nearest integer according to the rules of mathematical rounding). Student Ivanov seriously approached the planning of time for studying each school subject and decided that he would spend no more than 4.6 time units on studying economics. However, studying the basics of one area of economics is more difficult for Ivanov than the other. Thus, each unit of time spent on studying macroeconomics increases his final score (in points) in this area by exactly 1.5 points, while the same unit of time invested in preparing for microeconomics increases the final score in this area by 2.5 points.(a) What is the maximum grade that student Ivanov can get in economics?(b) Explain why the final grade in economics reflects the teacher's opinion that it is extremely important to know both microeconomics and macroeconomics. Will this always be the case with such a grading system?","solution":"# Solution:(a) If the minimum value of the two is determined by the expression 0.75 * O_{text {мИкро }} + 0.25 * O_{text {мАкро }}, i.e., O_{text {мИкро }}O_{text {мАкро }}, then it is more advantageous for Ivanov to spend an additional unit of time studying macroeconomics.Thus, to achieve the highest grade, Ivanov should not spend time studying only one area of economics. How should he correctly allocate his time? As long as the expressions 0.25 * O_{text {мИкро }} + 0.75 * O_{text {мАкро }} and 0.75 * O_{text {мИкро }} + 0.25 * O_{text {мАкро }} are not equal, as shown above, it will always be more advantageous to switch to studying one of the areas, increasing the resulting grade. Therefore, the maximum final grade can only be achieved if the time is allocated such that 0.25 * O_{text {мИкро }} + 0.75 * O_{text {мАкро }} = 0.75 * O_{text {мИкро }} + 0.25 * O_{text {мАкро }}. From this, O_{text {мИкро }} = O_{text {мАкро }}. To achieve this, with the full use of the time resource, it is necessary to spend 5 / 8 of the total time on studying macroeconomics, and the rest on studying microeconomics. Then the calculated final grade in economics will be O_{text {мИкро }} = O_{text {мАкро }} = 3 * 2.5 * 4.6 / 8 = 4.3125, and after mathematical rounding, it will be 4 points.It should be noted that since the grade was rounded down, Ivanov can achieve a grade of 4 without using the entire planned time resource of 4.6 time units, and can spend the remaining time on another activity.(b) Using this formula, it turns out that the student will know both microeconomics and macroeconomics. However, if the coefficients for the grades for knowledge of microeconomics and/or macroeconomics, and the coefficients of the labor intensity of studying both areas of economics were different, it could result in a boundary solution where the student would spend time preparing only for one area of economics (for example, if the labor intensity ratio was 1: 5 with the given formula for the final grade).## Grading Scheme:(a) Total 10 points:- 5 points for a complete justification that the solution will be internal (that O_{text {мИкро }} = O_{text {мАкро }});- 5 points for finding the maximum grade.(b) Total 5 points:- 2 points for explaining the internal solution;- 3 points for explaining the possibility of a boundary solution."},{"problem":"Given that tan theta=2, find the value of the following expressions:[(1) frac {sin (pi-theta)+cos (theta-pi)}{sin (theta+pi)+cos (theta+pi)};][(2) sin 2theta.]","solution":"First, let's recall some trigonometric identities:[sin(A-B)=sin A cos B - cos A sin B][cos(A-B)=cos A cos B + sin A sin B][sin(A+B)=sin A cos B + cos A sin B][cos(A+B)=cos A cos B - sin A sin B][sin 2A = frac{2 tan A}{1 + tan^2 A}]Now, let's solve the given expressions step by step:(1) frac {sin (pi-theta)+cos (theta-pi)}{sin (theta+pi)+cos (theta+pi)}Using the identities sin(pi-theta)=sin theta, cos(theta-pi)=-cos theta, sin(theta+pi)=-sin theta, and cos(theta+pi)=-cos theta, we have:=frac {sin theta - cos theta}{-sin theta - cos theta}Now, divide both the numerator and denominator by cos theta:= frac{frac{sin theta}{cos theta} - 1}{-frac{sin theta}{cos theta} - 1}Recall that frac{sin theta}{cos theta} = tan theta and tan theta=2:= frac{2 - 1}{-(2) - 1}= frac{1}{-3}= -frac{1}{3} quad boxed{-frac{1}{3}}(2) sin 2thetaUsing the identity sin 2theta = frac{2 tan theta}{1 + tan^2 theta} and tan theta=2:= frac{2 (2)}{1 + 2^2}= frac{4}{1 + 4}= frac{4}{5} quad boxed{frac{4}{5}}"},{"problem":"## Task B-1.2.Ivo, Alen, Vanja, Marko, and Saša are chefs in a hotel.

Find the ratio of the areas of ABCD and A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}D_{1}, given that AD=24, BC=10.","solution":"Answer: frac{289}{338} or frac{1}{2}.Solution. Draw a line through the center of the circle O perpendicular to the bases of the trapezoid. Let it intersect A D and B C at points N and M respectively. Since a diameter perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord, B M=M C=5, A N=N D=12. By the Pythagorean theorem from triangles O N D and O M C, we find that O N=sqrt{O D^{2}-D N^{2}}=5, O M=sqrt{O C^{2}-M C^{2}}=12. There are two cases.1) Point O does not lie on the segment M N. Then the height of the trapezoid is M N=O M-O N=7. Let H be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from vertex B to the base A D. Since the trapezoid inscribed in a circle is isosceles, D H=frac{A D+B C}{2}=17. Then B D=sqrt{D H^{2}+B H^{2}}=sqrt{338}=13 sqrt{2}. The area of any quadrilateral is half the product of the diagonals multiplied by the sine of the angle between them. Since the diagonals of the rectangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1} are parallel to the diagonals of the trapezoid A B C D, the angle between them is equal to the angle between the diagonals of the trapezoid. Let this angle be psi. Moreover, the diagonals of the rectangle inscribed in a circle are its diameters, so A_{1} C_{1}=B_{1} D_{1}=26. Then S_{A B C D}=frac{1}{2} A C cdot B D sin psi=169 sin psi ; S_{A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}}=frac{1}{2} A_{1} C_{1} cdot B_{1} D_{1} sin psi= frac{1}{2} cdot 26 cdot 26 sin psi=338 sin psi. Therefore, the ratio of the areas is frac{169 sin psi}{338 sin psi}=frac{1}{2}.2) Point O lies on the segment M N. Then M N=O N+O M=17. Similarly to the first case, we find that D H=17, B D=sqrt{D H^{2}+B H^{2}}=17 sqrt{2}, S_{A B C D}=frac{1}{2} A C cdot B D sin varphi=289 sin varphi ; S_{A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}}=frac{1}{2} A_{1} C_{1}.

Counting Mountain Terms:   We need to count the number of mountain terms for each possible sequence and then sum these counts over all possible sequences.4.

Setting up the equation: Given that f(x_{1})=g(x_{2}), we introduce a new variable t such that f(x_{1})=g(x_{2})=t > 0. This implies:   - For f(x_{1})=e^{x_{1}}, we have e^{x_{1}}=t, which leads to x_{1}=ln t.   - For g(x_{2})=2sqrt{x_{2}}, we have 2sqrt{x_{2}}=t, which gives x_{2}=left(frac{t}{2}right)^2=frac{t^2}{4}.2.

Setting the derivative to zero: To find the minimum value of h(t), we set h'(t)=0:   [frac{t^2-2}{2t}=0 implies t^2=2 implies t=sqrt{2}.]5. Analyzing the behavior of h(t):   - For 0  sqrt{2}, h'(t) > 0, indicating that h(t) is increasing in this interval.6. Finding the minimum value of h(t): Since h(t) decreases before t=sqrt{2} and increases after, t=sqrt{2} is the point where h(t) achieves its minimum value.

In this case, n = 5 and k = 2. Therefore, the total ways to pick a and b is P(5, 2) = frac{5!}{3!} = 5 times 4 = 20.However, we must consider that if we swap a and b for the same pair, the slope of the line will remain the same, as -frac{a}{b} is equivalent to -frac{b}{a} for any non-zero a and b. There are two such pairs in the set that will lead to the same slope when swapped: (1, 3) and (3, 9), as well as (3, 1) and (9, 3). This means the slopes for the two pairs of lines resulting from flipping a and b will be identical.Hence, we must subtract these two redundant pairings from the total.

After rotating point A counterclockwise 90^{circ} around the origin, we obtain point B with coordinates (-t^2, t).② The equation of line OB is derived from the slope formula, which gives us y = -frac{1}{t}x.

The distance from point D(frac{1}{2},0) to line AC is maximized when DF is perpendicular to AC, which occurs when the angle between line AC and the x-axis is 45^{circ}.

What is the minimum number of weighings required to determine which coin is the fake using a balance scale?","solution":"Divide the coins into groups of 4, 4, and 5. Let's denote these groups as a, b, c. First, place a and b on the scale. If the scale balances, we can assume that a is the lighter. In this case, the counterfeit coin is either in a and is lighter, or in b and is heavier.In this scenario, assign a number to each coin in the groups. For the second weighing, compare the group consisting of a_{1}, a_{2}, b_{1} with the group consisting of a_{3}, a_{4}, c_{1}. If the scale balances, then the counterfeit coin is among b_{2}, b_{3}, b_{4}. Weigh b_{2} and b_{3}. The heavier one is the counterfeit, and if they balance, then the third one is the counterfeit.If the first group is lighter in the second weighing, then the counterfeit coin is among a_{1} and a_{2}. If the first group is heavier, then the counterfeit coin is among a_{3}, a_{4}, b_{1}. (Since if the counterfeit is in group a, it must be lighter, and if in group b, it must be heavier.) In both cases, weigh the two a coins. The lighter one is the counterfeit, and if they balance, the remaining suspicious coin from b is the counterfeit.If the counterfeit coin is in c based on the first weighing, then for the second weighing, place two coins from c on one side of the scale and one coin from c plus one genuine coin on the other side. If the scale balances, then for the third weighing, compare one of the remaining coins from c with a genuine coin. If they balance, the other coin is the counterfeit; otherwise, we can determine whether the counterfeit coin is lighter or heavier than the genuine coin.If the side with the genuine coin is heavier in the second weighing, then the counterfeit coin on that side is heavier, and the coins on the other side are lighter than the genuine coin, if not genuine. Thus, weighing the two remaining suspicious coins will again reveal which coin is counterfeit and whether it is heavier or lighter than the genuine coin.Three weighings are therefore always sufficient to find the counterfeit coin. Two weighings are not sufficient because with the first weighing, we can only divide the coins into at most three groups, so it is always possible that a group of at least four coins will only be known to contain the counterfeit coin, which could be lighter than the genuine coins. In this case, even with the help of genuine coins, the counterfeit coin cannot be found, only by chance, because we can only distinguish between three groups, and at least two coins will remain in one of these groups."},{"problem":"7.

Each child has a hat of a unique color, and each pair of children is connected by a ribbon of a unique color that is different from the colors of the hats of the children it connects.1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have ( n ) children, each with a hat of a unique color.   - Each pair of children is connected by a ribbon of a unique color.   - The color of the ribbon is different from the colors of the hats of the children it connects.2. Graph Representation:   - Represent each child as a vertex in a graph.   - Each edge (ribbon) between two vertices (children) has a unique color.   - The graph is a complete graph ( K_n ) with ( n ) vertices.3. Coloring Constraints:   - Each vertex (child) has a unique color (hat).   - Each edge (ribbon) has a unique color different from the colors of the vertices it connects.4. Minimum Number of Colors:   - For ( n ) vertices, we need ( n ) colors for the hats.   - For the edges, we need to ensure that no two edges incident to the same vertex share the same color, and the color of the edge is different from the color of the vertex.5. Case Analysis:   - Odd ( n ):      - If ( n ) is odd, we can use a method similar to the one referenced in the problem. Each vertex (child) can be assigned a unique color, and the edges can be colored such that no two edges incident to the same vertex share the same color.   - Even ( n ):     - If ( n ) is even, we can color every hat with the ( n )-th color. Consider a regular ((n-1))-gon and the center of the circle circumscribed around that polygon. Let these ( n ) points represent each child. The vertices of the polygon are ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{n-1} ) and the center is ( O ).

Draw a line through the center of the circle O perpendicular to the bases of the trapezoid. Let it intersect A D and B C at points N and M respectively. Since a diameter perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord, B M=M C=8, A N=N D=15. By the Pythagorean theorem from triangles O N D and O M C, we find that O N=sqrt{O D^{2}-D N^{2}}=8, O M=sqrt{O C^{2}-M C^{2}}=15. There are two cases.1) Point O does not lie on the segment M N. Then the height of the trapezoid is M N=O M-O N=7. Let H be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from vertex C to the base A D. Since the trapezoid inscribed in a circle is isosceles, A H=frac{A D+B C}{2}=23. Then A C=sqrt{A H^{2}+C H^{2}}=sqrt{578}=17 sqrt{2}. The area of any quadrilateral is half the product of the diagonals multiplied by the sine of the angle between them. Since the diagonals of the rectangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1} are perpendicular to the diagonals of the trapezoid A B C D, the angle between them is equal to the angle between the diagonals of the trapezoid. Let this angle be psi. Moreover, the diagonals of the rectangle inscribed in a circle are its diameters, so A_{1} C_{1}=B_{1} D_{1}=34. Then S_{A B C D}=frac{1}{2} A C cdot B D sin psi=289 sin psi ; S_{A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}}=frac{1}{2} A_{1} C_{1} cdot B_{1} D_{1} sin psi= frac{1}{2} cdot 34 cdot 34 sin psi=578 sin psi. Therefore, the ratio of the areas is frac{289 sin psi}{578 sin psi}=frac{1}{2}.2) Point O lies on the segment M N. Then M N=O N+O M=23.

More precisely, it expands into an integer-coefficient polynomial symmetric in the omega^{j} (for the r residues j(bmod r) ), and also symmetric in the z^{k} (for the p residues k(bmod p) ). So by the fundamental theorem of symmetric sums, it can be written as an integer-coefficient polynomial in the symmetric sums of the omega^{j} together with the symmetric sums of the z^{k}.

But D is also a difference of integers, hence an integer itself. The only way frac{D}{z-1} can be an algebraic integer is if p mid D (Why?), so it simply remains to compute the remainder when the integer prod_{a, b, c}left(omega^{a}+1^{b}+1^{c}right) is divided by p, which is quite easy.Alternatively (as some contestants/teams found), we can get rid of omega first (rather than z as in the previous solution), so (up to sign) we want to evaluate prod_{b, c}left(1+left(z^{b}+z^{c}right)^{r}right)(bmod p). But we have a polynomial identity prod_{b, c}left(1+left(T^{b}+T^{c}right)^{r}right) in Phi_{p}(T) cdot mathbb{Z}[x]+M for some constant integer M, where Phi_{p}(T)=T^{p-1}+cdots+T+1 denotes the p th cyclotomic polynomial. But note that Phi_{p}(z)=0 is congruent to Phi_{p}(1)=p modulo p, soprod_{b, c}left(1+left(z^{b}+z^{c}right)^{r}right)-prod_{b, c}left(1+left(1^{b}+1^{c}right)^{r}right)is an integer divisible by p. The rest is easy.Remark. Without using the Frobenius map, this second solution gives another proof that prodleft(omega^{a}+right. z^{b_{1}}+cdots+z^{b_{m}} ) is an integer congruent to something like m^{r}+1 modulo p (as long as p is odd, etc.). Can you reconcile this difference (e.g. is the use of Frobenius in the first solution equivalent to a step of the second solution)?Remark. The central idea behind the second solution is that if f(z) is an integer for some polynomial f in mathbb{Z}[x], then it's congruent to (the integer) f(1) modulo p. Can you generalize this, say when z is not necessarily a root of unity?"},{"problem":"3.

Let p+1=2 x^{2} and p^{2}+1=2 y^{2}, then 2left(y^{2}-x^{2}right)=p(p-1). Therefore, either y-x or y+x is divisible by p. From the inequality xy-x geqslant p and, thus, 2(y-x)(y+x) geqslant 2 p^{2}>p(p-1), which is impossible. Therefore, y+x is divisible by p. Note that frac{y^{2}}{x^{2}}=frac{p^{2}+1}{p+1}>frac{p^{2}-1}{p+1}=p-1. Then if p geqslant 11, y^{2}>12 x^{2}, hence y>3 x and, thus, 2(y-x)>y+x geqslant p.

On each side, we write the sum of the numbers on its endpoints. For which n{} is it possible that the numbers on the sides form a permutation of 1, 2, 3,ldots , n?[i]From the folklore[/i]","solution":"1. Case 1: ( n ) is odd   Suppose the sides have (sigma(1), sigma(2), dots, sigma(n)) written on them, starting from some vertex. Let (a) be the number at the first vertex. Then, the numbers at the vertices can be written as follows:   - First vertex: (a)   - Second vertex: (sigma(1) - a)   - Third vertex: (sigma(2) - (sigma(1) - a) = sigma(2) - sigma(1) + a)   - Fourth vertex: (sigma(3) - (sigma(2) - sigma(1) + a) = sigma(3) - sigma(2) + sigma(1) - a)   - Continue this pattern until the (n)-th vertex.   When we return to the first vertex, we must have:   [   a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) + (-1)^n a   ]   Since (n) is odd, ((-1)^n = -1), so we get:   [   a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) - a   ]   This simplifies to:   [   2a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1)   ]   Thus, (a) can be determined as:   [   a = frac{1}{2} left( sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) right)   ]   Therefore, for any permutation (sigma), we can always find a suitable (a), and hence it is possible for all odd (n).2. Case 2: ( n ) is even   When (n) is even, we obtain a similar system, but now the (a)s cancel out. We have:   [   a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) + (-1)^n a   ]   Since (n) is even, ((-1)^n = 1), so we get:   [   a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) + a   ]   This simplifies to:   [   0 = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1)   ]   Therefore, we must have:   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} (-1)^i sigma(i) = 0   ]   Working modulo 2, this implies that (n equiv 0 pmod{4}). Hence, (n) must be a multiple of 4.   For (n equiv 0 pmod{4}), we can construct a solution by setting:   [   sigma(4k+1) = 4k+3, quad sigma(4k+2) = 4k+4, quad sigma(4k+3) = 4k+2, quad sigma(4k+4) = 4k+1   ]   for all (0 leq k < n/4), and choose (a = 0) in the above system.

Therefore,frac{A Y}{Y B}=2 cdot frac{P Y}{Y B}=2 cdot frac{M X}{X B}=2 cdot frac{L Q}{L B}=frac{C L}{L B}From this, it follows that triangles Y B L and A B C are similar.

We obtain c+b^{2}+z=z^{2} c b, or c=frac{h^{2}+2}{2^{2} b-1}.(i) If z=1, then c=frac{h^{2}+1}{b-1}=b+1+frac{2}{b-1}, so b=2 or b=3.

From the system of equationsbegin{cases}y=kx+m frac{x^{2}}{4}+ frac{y^{2}}{3}=1end{cases}we obtain (3+4k^{2})x^2+8mkx+4(m^{2}-3)=0.The discriminant must be positive, i.e., Delta = 64m^{2}k^{2}-16(3+4k^{2})(m^{2}-3) > 0, which simplifies to 3+4k^{2} > m^{2}.Thus, x_{1}+x_{2}=-frac{8mk}{3+4k^{2}} and x_{1}x_{2}=frac{4(m^{2}-3)}{3+4k^{2}}.Also, y_{1}y_{2}=(kx_{1}+m)(kx_{2}+m)=k^{2}x_{1}x_{2}+mk(x_{1}+x_{2})+m^{2}=frac{3(m^{2}-4k^{2})}{3+4k^{2}}.Since the circle with AB as its diameter passes through the right vertex D(2,0) of the ellipse, we have k_{AD} cdot k_{BD}=-1, i.e., frac{y_1}{x_1-2} cdot frac{y_2}{x_2-2}=-1.This implies y_{1}y_{2}+x_{1}x_{2}-2(x_{1}+x_{2})+4=0, which can be written as frac{3(m^{2}-4k^{2})}{3+4k^{2}}+ frac{4(m^{2}-3)}{3+4k^{2}}+ frac{16mk}{3+4k^{2}}+4=0.Simplifying this, we get 7m^{2}+16mk+4k^{2}=0. Solving for m, we find m_{1}=-2k and m_{2}=-frac{2k}{7}.When m=-2k, the line l is given by y=k(x-2), but this contradicts the fact that l passes through a fixed point.When m=-frac{2k}{7}, the line l is given by y=k(x- frac{2}{7}), and so l passes through the fixed point (frac{2}{7},0).In conclusion, the line l passes through the fixed point boxed{(frac{2}{7},0)}."},{"problem":"begin{array}{l}text { 3.

Such assumptions, complementing the relationships stated in the text, can indeed facilitate the solution of many problems. However, such a solution is only complete if we show that our additional assumption does not contradict the original relationships.Both the author of the first quote and numerous other contestants implicitly assumed that the boys were also somehow put in order, and, for example, all of Ági's dance partners danced with Anikó, and one more, similarly, all of Anikó's dance partners danced with Zsuzsa, and one more. This assumption is not impossible, but quite unlikely; conversely, it is also not impossible that Ági and Anikó had no common dance partners.A similar assumption is the following: \\"those who did not dance with Márta could not have danced with any girl.\\" Many papers, although their answer was correct, were based on such an assumption that is not exactly wrong, but uncertain.

Collinearity and Symmetry:   - angle ZTP = 180^circ - angle ZPT - angle PZT = A.   - This implies that Z, T, D are collinear, where D is the foot of the perpendicular from T to BC.7.

The yarn wound around a cube rotating about one of its axes (Fig. 41) will remain only on those edges that do not have common points with the axis of rotation; the yarn will cover half of each face of the cube, i.e., half of the cube's surface.Now, let's rotate the cube sequentially around each of the four axes, each time winding yarn of a different color.Thus, when rotating around the axis A C^{prime}, we will use yarn of color a (black); when rotating around the axis D B^{prime}, we will use yarn of color b (red); when rotating around the axis B D^{prime}, we will use yarn of color c (yellow); and finally, when rotating around the axis C A^{prime}, we will use yarn of color d (blue).The cube will be colored as shown in Fig. 42, where each face is divided into four triangles; the letters placed in the corresponding triangles denote the colors of the yarn covering that triangle.It is easy to notice that:1^{circ} six shades will appear on the surface of the cube, i.e., as many as there are combinations of four elements taken two at a time, namely: a b, a c, a d, b c, b d, and c d;2^{circ} each face will have four different shades;3^{circ} the surface of the cube will be covered by two layers of yarn;4^{circ} opposite faces of the cube will be colored in the same shades, arranged in reverse cyclic order.*) See, for example, I.

So:   [   frac{n}{2} = q^b k^2 implies n+1 = v^2 = p^a m^2 + 2   ]   for some positive integer ( v ). Considering the equation modulo 4 gives a contradiction.4. Odd ( n ):   If ( n ) is odd, ( n-1 ) is even. We get:   [   n-1 = 2^p (2^{p+1} - 1)   ]   for some positive integer ( p ) such that ( 2^{p+1} - 1 ) is a prime number. If ( p geq 2 ), we have:   [   n equiv 1 pmod{4} implies frac{n(n+1)}{2} equiv 1 pmod{2}   ]   So:   [   frac{n(n+1)}{2} = q^b ell^2   ]   for some prime ( q ) and positive integers ( b, ell ) with ( q, b equiv 1 pmod{4} ).5. Contradiction:   We have:   [   (2^p (2^{p+1} - 1) + 1)(2^{p-1} (2^{p+1} - 1) + 1) = q^b ell^2   ]   So there exists ( epsilon in {0, 1} ) such that:   [   2^{p-epsilon} (2^{p+1} - 1) + 1 = v^2   ]   for some positive integer ( v ). Thus:   [   2^{p-epsilon} (2^{p+1} - 1) = (v-1)(v+1)   ]   Since ( 2^{p+1} - 1 ) is a prime number, ( 2(2^{p+1} - 1) ) divides one of ( v-1 ) or ( v+1 ). So:   [   v geq 2(2^{p+1} - 1) + 1   ]   We easily arrive at a contradiction from:   [   2^p (2^{p+1} - 1) + 1 geq v^2 geq (2(2^{p+1} - 1) + 1)^2   ]   when ( p geq 2 ).6.

Find m+n.[b]Note:[/b] In a rooted tree, the subtree of v consists of its indirect or direct descendants (including v itself).[i]Proposed by Yang Liu[/i]","solution":"1. Base Case:   - If there is only one vertex (the root), the expected size of the subtree is 1. This is trivially true since the subtree of the root is the root itself.2. Inductive Hypothesis:   - Assume that for a tree with ( n ) vertices, the expected size of the subtree of a randomly chosen vertex is ( E[n] = sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{i} ).3. Inductive Step:   - Consider adding the ((n+1))-th vertex to the tree. This vertex is added as a child to one of the existing ( n ) vertices, chosen uniformly at random.   - The expected size of the subtree of the new vertex is 1 (since it has no children initially).   - For any existing vertex ( v ), if the new vertex is added as a child of ( v ), the size of the subtree of ( v ) increases by 1. The probability of choosing any specific vertex ( v ) to add the new vertex is ( frac{1}{n} ).4. Expected Size Calculation:   - Let ( E[n] ) be the expected size of the subtree of a randomly chosen vertex in a tree with ( n ) vertices.   - When the ((n+1))-th vertex is added, the expected size of the subtree of a randomly chosen vertex becomes:     [     E[n+1] = frac{1}{n+1} left( E[n] + 1 right) + frac{n}{n+1} E[n]     ]   - Simplifying this, we get:     [     E[n+1] = frac{1}{n+1} left( E[n] + 1 right) + frac{n}{n+1} E[n] = E[n] + frac{1}{n+1}     ]5.

Harmonic Sum Calculation:   - The sum of the first 10 terms of the harmonic series is:     [     sum_{i=1}^{10} frac{1}{i} = 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{7} + frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{9} + frac{1}{10}     ]   - This sum can be computed as:     [     sum_{i=1}^{10} frac{1}{i} = frac{7381}{2520}     ]7.

The two solutions are frac{8 pm sqrt{64-4 cdot frac{63}{4}}}{2}, or frac{9}{2} and frac{7}{2}.Since a>b, it also follows that y>z, so y=frac{9}{2} and z=frac{7}{2}.

Case 1: ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are both even   Suppose ( a_1 = 2^x ) and ( a_2 = 2^y ). Then:   [   a_3 = a_1 + a_2 = 2^x + 2^y   ]   Without loss of generality, assume ( x geq y ). Then:   [   a_3 = 2^y (2^{x-y} + 1)   ]   For ( a_3 ) to be a prime power, ( 2^{x-y} + 1 ) must be a power of 2. However, the only power of 2 that is one more than another power of 2 is 2 itself (i.e., ( 2^1 + 1 = 3 )). This implies ( x = y + 1 ), and:   [   a_3 = 3 cdot 2^y   ]   Since ( a_3 ) must be a prime power, this is a contradiction because ( 3 cdot 2^y ) is not a power of a single prime.2. Case 2: ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are both odd   Suppose ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are both odd prime powers. Then:   [   a_3 = a_1 + a_2   ]   Since the sum of two odd numbers is even, ( a_3 ) must be even. Let ( a_3 = 2^z ). Then:   [   a_4 = a_2 + a_3 = a_2 + 2^z   ]   Since ( a_2 ) is odd and ( 2^z ) is even, ( a_4 ) is odd. Continuing this pattern, we find that:   [   a_6 = 3a_1 + 5a_2   ]   Since ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are both odd, ( 3a_1 + 5a_2 ) is also odd, which contradicts the requirement that ( a_6 ) be a prime power.3. Case 3: ( a_1 ) is even and ( a_2 ) is odd   Suppose ( a_1 = 2^x ) and ( a_2 ) is an odd prime power. Then:   [   a_3 = a_1 + a_2 = 2^x + a_2   ]   Since ( a_2 ) is odd, ( a_3 ) is odd. Continuing this pattern, we find that:   [   a_7 = 5a_1 + 8a_2   ]   Since ( 5 ) and ( a_2 ) are both odd, ( 5a_1 + 8a_2 ) must be even. However, for ( a_7 ) to be a prime power, it must be a power of 2, which contradicts the requirement that ( a_7 ) be a prime power.4. Case 4: ( a_1 ) is odd and ( a_2 ) is even   Suppose ( a_1 ) is an odd prime power and ( a_2 = 2^y ). Then:   [   a_3 = a_1 + a_2   ]   Since ( a_1 ) is odd and ( a_2 ) is even, ( a_3 ) is odd. Continuing this pattern, we find that:   [   a_6 = 3a_1 + 5a_2   ]   Since ( a_1 ) is odd and ( a_2 ) is even, ( 3a_1 + 5a_2 ) must be odd, which contradicts the requirement that ( a_6 ) be a prime power.Since all four cases lead to contradictions when ( n geq 8 ), we conclude that the largest possible ( n ) is 7.The final answer is ( boxed{7} )."},{"problem":"3.

Find the value of the real number m.","solution":"Given the circle equation x^2+y^2+x-6y+m=0 and the line equation x+2y-3=0, they intersect at points P and Q. Since the circle with diameter PQ passes through the origin, the center of this circle is the midpoint of PQ, which lies on the line x+2y-3=0. The center of the circle given by x^2+y^2+x-6y+m=0 can be found by completing the square, which gives us the center at (-frac{1}{2}, 3). Since this center must lie on the line x+2y-3=0, substituting (-frac{1}{2}, 3) into the line equation gives us a true statement, indicating that the center of the circle with diameter PQ also lies on this line.The circle with diameter PQ passing through the origin implies that the origin is equidistant from points P and Q, which further implies that the origin lies on the perpendicular bisector of PQ. Since the center of the circle is also on this line, and given that the center is (-frac{1}{2}, 3), we can conclude that the circle's equation is in the form of (x+frac{1}{2})^2 + (y-3)^2 = r^2, where r is the radius of the circle.Substituting the origin (0,0) into this equation to find r^2 gives us frac{1}{4} + 9 = r^2, which simplifies to r^2 = frac{37}{4}. Therefore, the equation of the circle becomes x^2+y^2+x-6y+frac{37}{4}=0. Comparing this with the given circle equation x^2+y^2+x-6y+m=0, we find that m = frac{37}{4}.However, the provided solution states that m=3.

For a finite graph, the following operation can be performed: choose any cycle of length 4, select any edge in this cycle, and remove it from the graph. For a fixed integer n(n geqslant 4), if the complete graph with n vertices is repeatedly subjected to the above operation, find the minimum number of edges in the resulting graph q.","solution":"3. The minimum value is n.If a graph can be obtained from a complete graph of n vertices through operations, then this graph is called \\"permissible\\"; if any two points in a graph are connected by a path, then this graph is called \\"connected\\"; if the vertices of a graph can be divided into two sets V_{1} and V_{2}, such that each edge is between a vertex in V_{1} and a vertex in V_{2}, then this graph is called \\"bipartite\\".Assume that operations are performed on graph G, which contains a cycle of length 4, A B C D. Deleting edge A B, the new graph obtained is denoted as H, then:(1) If G is connected, then H is also connected;(2) If G is not bipartite, then H is also not bipartite.In fact, for conclusion (1), assume that there is a path I connecting points X, Y in graph G. If I does not include the deleted edge A B, then X and Y are still connected by path I in H. If I includes A B, then in H, the path connecting X and Y can be obtained by replacing A B with the three edges A D, D C, C B. Therefore, H is also connected.For conclusion (2), consider its contrapositive. If graph H is bipartite, i.e., its vertices can be divided into two sets V_{1} and V_{2}, such that each edge is between a vertex in V_{1} and a vertex in V_{2}. Since B C, C D, D A are edges in H, then A, C belong to one of the sets V_{1} or V_{2}, and B, D belong to the other set. In graph G, if the vertices are divided into the same two sets V_{1} and V_{2} as in H, then edge A B satisfies being between a vertex in V_{1} and a vertex in V_{2}. Therefore, graph G is also bipartite.Since the complete graph K_{n} is connected and K_{n} is not bipartite (because it contains a triangle), any permissible graph H is connected and not bipartite. In particular, H contains a cycle, because a graph without a cycle is bipartite.It is easy to see that a permissible graph has at least n edges.On the one hand, a connected graph with n vertices has at least n-1 edges. On the other hand, a connected graph with n vertices and only n-1 edges is a tree, and a tree does not contain a cycle. Therefore, the minimum number of edges is n.Below, we prove that when n geqslant 4, starting from the complete graph K_{n}, a graph with exactly n edges can be obtained through operations. Consider a graph with n vertices (n geqslant 4), with vertices A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{n-3}, X, Y, Z, where Z is connected to each other vertex by an edge, and X and Y are connected by an edge.

Two acceptable arrangements are considered to be indistinguishable if one can be obtained from the other by rotating the nonagon in the plane.  Find the number of distinguishable acceptable arrangements.","solution":"First, we determine which possible combinations of digits 1 through 9 will yield sums that are multiples of 3. It is simplest to do this by looking at each of the digits bmod{3}.We see that the numbers 1, 4, and 7 are congruent to 1 pmod{3}, that the numbers 2, 5, and 8 are congruent to 2 pmod{3}, and that the numbers 3, 6, and 9 are congruent to 0 pmod{3}. In order for a sum of three of these numbers to be a multiple of three, the mod 3 sum must be congruent to 0. Quick inspection reveals that the only possible combinations are 0+0+0, 1+1+1, 2+2+2, and 0+1+2. However, every set of three consecutive vertices must sum to a multiple of three, so using any of 0+0+0, 1+1+1, or 2+2+2 would cause an adjacent sum to include exactly 2 digits with the same bmod{3} value, and this is an unacceptable arrangement. Thus the only possible groupings are composed of three digits congruent to three different bmod{3} values. We see also that there are two possible arrangements for these trios on the nonagon: a digit congruent to 1 pmod{3} can be located counterclockwise of a digit congruent to 0 and clockwise of a digit congruent to 2 pmod{3}, or the reverse can be true. We set the first digit as 3 avoid overcounting rotations, so we have one option as a choice for the first digit.  The other two 0 pmod{3} numbers can be arranged in 2!=2 ways.  The three 1 pmod{3} and three 2 pmod{3} can both be arranged in 3!=6 ways.

Using the addition formulas for hyperbolic functions:   [   sinh(a) + cosh(a) = e^a, quad sinh(b) + cosh(b) = e^b   ]   Thus, the equation becomes:   [   e^a cdot e^b = e^{a+b} = 1   ]5.

Since a^{3} equiv-1(bmod a+1), we have frac{a^{3}}{c} equiv -1(bmod a+1), i.e. frac{a^{3}}{c}=e(a+1)-1 for some e in mathbb{N}. It follows that a^{3}= (d(a+1)+1)(e(a+1)-1), which after expending and canceling a+1 yields a^{2}-a+1=d e(a+1)+(e-d).

Both rhombuses and rectangles have parallel sides. Therefore, this property does not distinguish between the two.- Option B: Diagonals bisect each other. This is also a common property of both rhombuses and rectangles. Thus, it cannot be the distinguishing property.- Option D: Adjacent angles are supplementary. This is a characteristic of rectangles. However, in rhombuses, while adjacent angles can be supplementary, this is not a defining property as it depends on the specific angles of the rhombus. Therefore, this option does not exclusively apply to rhombuses over rectangles.- Option C: Diagonals are perpendicular to each other. This is a unique property of rhombuses that rectangles do not share. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal but not necessarily perpendicular.

The turtle begins in a corner square of the grid and enters each square exactly once, ending in the square where she started. In terms of n, what is the largest positive integer k such that there must be a row or column that the turtle has entered at least k distinct times?","solution":"We shall prove that the answer is 2 n+2. Number the rows in increasing order, from top to bottom, and number the columns from left to right. By symmetry, we may (and shall) assume that the turtle starts in the top right corner square.First we shall prove that some row or column must be entered at least 2 n+2 times. Let m=4 n+2. First note that each time the turtle moves, she enters either a row or a column. Let r_{i} denote the number of times the turtle enters row i, and let c_{i} be similarly defined for column i. Since the turtle moves m^{2} times,r_{1}+r_{2}+cdots+r_{m}+c_{1}+c_{2}+cdots+c_{m}=m^{2}Now note that each time the turtle enters column 1, the next column she enters must be column 2. Therefore c_{1} is equal to the number of times the turtle enters column 2 from column 1. Furthermore, the turtle must enter column 2 from column 3 at least once, which implies that c_{2}>c_{1}. Therefore since the 2 m terms r_{i} and c_{i} are not all equal, one must be strictly greater than m^{2} /(2 m)=2 n+1 and therefore at least 2 n+2.Now we construct an example to show that it is possible that no row or column is entered more than 2 n+2 times. Partition the square grid into four (2 n+1) times(2 n+1) quadrants A, B, C, and D, containing the upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right corners, respectively. The turtle begins at the top right corner square of B, moves one square down, and then moves left through the whole second row of B. She then moves one square down and moves right through the whole third row of B. She continues in this pattern, moving through each remaining row of B in succession and moving one square down when each row is completed. Since 2 n+1 is odd, the turtle ends at the bottom right corner of B. She then moves one square down into D and through each column of D in turn, moving one square to the left when each column is completed. She ends at the lower left corner of D and moves left into C and through the rows of C, moving one square up when each row is completed, ending in the upper left corner of C. She then enters A and moves through the columns of A, moving one square right when each column is completed. This takes her to the upper right corner of A, whereupon she enters B and moves right through the top row of B, which returns her to her starting point. Each row passing through A and B is entered at most 2 n+1 times in A and once in B, and thus at most 2 n+2 times in total. Similarly, each row and column in the grid is entered at most 2 n+2 times by this path.

Therefore, the line passes through the fixed point (3, 1), so the correct choice is boxed{C}.  Transforming the equation of the line into the form k(x-3)=y-1 holds for any k in mathbb{R}, thus we have begin{cases} x-3=0  y-1=0 end{cases}, from which we solve for the coordinates of the fixed point.

Analyzing ( sigma(d) ):   Note that ( sigma(d) ) is odd precisely when ( d ) is a power of 2 times an odd square. Since ( d ) divides ( 6^{1999} ), this is equivalent to saying ( nu_3(d) ) is even. Therefore, we have ( (-1)^{sigma(d)} = (-1)^{nu_3(d) + 1} ).3. Rewriting the Sum ( S ):   Let ( S ) be the sum in question.

Summing Over ( n ):   We now sum over ( n ):   [   sum_{n=0}^{1999} (-1)^{n+1} left(2^{k-1}(3^n - 1) + nu_3((2^k)!)right).   ]   This simplifies to:   [   2^{k-1} sum_{n=0}^{1999} (-1)^{n+1} (3^n - 1).   ]6. Using the Geometric Series Formula:   The sum of the geometric series is:   [   sum_{n=0}^{1999} (-1)^{n+1} 3^n = frac{3(1 - (-3)^{2000})}{1 - (-3)} = frac{3^{2000} - 1}{4}.   ]   Therefore, the sum becomes:   [   2^{k-1} cdot frac{3^{2000} - 1}{4} = 2^k cdot frac{3^{2000} - 1}{8}.   ]7.

The largest number of vertices that can be painted red is frac{n+1}{2}. If we paint frac{n+1}{2} consecutive vertices of an n-gon, the condition of the problem is satisfied. Now, suppose we paint at least frac{n+1}{2}+1 vertices. Let the vertices of the n-gon be labeled consecutively with natural numbers from 1 to 2k+1=n. Thus, at least k+2 vertices are red. Consider the pairs of vertices (1, k+1), (2, k+2), (3, k+3), ldots, (k, 2k), (k+1, 2k+1), which represent some of the longest diagonals of the n-gon. Since there are exactly k+1 such pairs and they cover all vertices, there is at least one pair in which both vertices are red. We can assume this pair is (1, k+1), otherwise, we would just renumber the vertices. Since at least k of the remaining vertices are red, and the vertices numbered 2, 3, ldots, k are only k-1 in number, at least one of the vertices numbered k+2, k+3, ldots, 2k+1 is red. Let this vertex be k+m, where 2 leq m leq k+1. The vertex k+m lies on the same side of the line determined by vertices 1 and k+1 as the center of the n-gon. From this, it follows that the center of the n-gon lies inside the triangle with vertices 1, k+1, k+m, since the segment with endpoints 1, k+1 is one of the longest diagonals of the n-gon. But the vertices 1, k+1, k+m are all red, so the center of the n-gon also lies inside the polygon determined by the red vertices."},{"problem":"Find the x-coordinate of point M on the parabola {y^2 = 4x} such that the distance between point M and the focus F of the parabola is |MF| = 4.","solution":"[Analysis]Utilizing the definition of a parabola is the most fundamental method to solve parabolic problems.

Let l be some line, alpha a plane perpendicular to l and intersecting it at point O, and omega a circle with center O and radius 1, lying in alpha. Construct 1008 red spheres of the same radius r<1 with distinct centers R_{1}, R_{2}, ldots, R_{1008}, lying on omega.Let G_{1}, G_{2}, ldots, G_{1008} be distinct points on l, at distances d_{1}, d_{2}, ldots, d_{1008} from O. Then the distance between G_{i} and any point R_{j} is sqrt{1+d_{i}^{2}}. Therefore, if we construct a green sphere with center G_{i} and radius sqrt{1+d_{i}^{2}}-r, it will touch all the red spheres.

The first guests in the queue receive increasingly larger pieces of the pie because the remaining part of the pie is large at the initial stages of division.

Suppose the mass of the remaining part of the pie when it was the (n-1)-th guest's turn is m kg. Then the (n-1)-th guest received frac{n-1}{100} cdot m kg, and the remaining part of the pie became m - frac{n-1}{100} cdot m kg, which simplifies to frac{101-n}{100} cdot m kg. Therefore, the n-th guest received frac{101-n}{100} cdot m cdot frac{n}{100} = frac{n(101-n)}{10000} cdot m kg. The difference between the pieces received by the n-th and (n-1)-th guests is frac{n(101-n)}{10000} cdot m - frac{n-1}{100} cdot m = frac{-n^2 + n + 100}{10000} cdot m.

If the scales balance, the counterfeit coin is in the group of 26 coins. Thus, it is sufficient to learn how to solve the problem: to identify the counterfeit coin from a group of 27 coins using three weighings (the problem of identifying the counterfeit coin from a group of 26 coins can be reduced to this problem, for example, by adding one more arbitrary coin from the remaining 54 to the group of 26).For the second weighing, we will divide the group of 27 coins into three groups of 9 coins each. By placing groups of 9 coins on both sides of the scales, we will find the group of 9 coins that contains the counterfeit coin.By dividing the group of 9 coins, one of which is counterfeit, into three groups of 3 coins each, we will identify the group of 3 coins containing the counterfeit coin with the third weighing.Finally, using the same method, we will find the counterfeit coin with the fourth weighing.b) Let ( k ) be a natural number satisfying the inequalities ( 3^{k-1} < n leq 3^k ).

Map divisors to points in a 3D coordinate system:   Each divisor (2^a cdot 3^b cdot 167^c) can be mapped to a point ((a, b, c)) in a 3D coordinate system. The set of all such points forms a (200 times 100 times 100) parallelepiped.4. Apply the pigeonhole principle:   Suppose we have a subset (S) of (T) such that no element in (S) divides any other element in (S). If (S) has more than (101^2) elements, then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two elements in (S) with the same ((b, c)) coordinates.

This ensures that no element in (S) divides any other element in (S).Therefore, the largest possible number of elements in a subset (S) of (T) such that no element in (S) divides any other element in (S) is (101^2).The final answer is (boxed{101^2})"},{"problem":"If sin frac{theta}{2} - 2 cos frac{theta}{2} = 0, find the value of tan theta.","solution":"Given that sin frac{theta}{2} - 2 cos frac{theta}{2} = 0, we can express tan frac{theta}{2} as frac{sin frac{theta}{2}}{cos frac{theta}{2}}, which simplifies to 2.Now, to find tan theta, we can use the double angle identity for tangent:tan theta = frac{2tan frac{theta}{2}}{1 - tan^2 frac{theta}{2}}Substituting tan frac{theta}{2} = 2 into this equation, we obtain:tan theta = frac{2 times 2}{1 - 2^2} = frac{4}{1 - 4} = -frac{4}{3}Therefore, the value of tan theta is boxed{-frac{4}{3}}."},{"problem":"The complex solutions of the equation x^2 = -4 are ( )A: ±2B: 2iC: -2iD: ±2i","solution":"Let x = a + bi, where a, b in mathbb{R}.

Conclusion:   - Since ( x_1 ) appears in at least 5 sums, and we have 7 sums in total, there must be at least one sum that does not include ( x_1 ).   - Suppose ( x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 0 ). Given ( x_3 = x_4 ), we have:     [     x_2 + x_3 + x_3 = 0 implies x_2 + 2x_3 = 0 implies x_2 = -2x_3     ]   - Since ( x_2 = x_3 ), we get:     [     x_3 = 0 implies x_2 = 0     ]   - Therefore, ( x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = x_5 = 0 ).   - Finally, from any of the initial sums involving ( x_1 ), we get ( x_1 = 0 ).Thus, ( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = x_5 = 0 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 7 } )."},{"problem":"3 cdot 9 The common solutions of the equations y=(x+1)^{2} and x y+y=1 are(A) 3 pairs of real numbers.(B) 4 pairs of real numbers.(C) 4 pairs of imaginary numbers.(D) 2 pairs of real numbers, 2 pairs of imaginary numbers.(E) 1 pair of real numbers, 2 pairs of imaginary numbers.(6th American High School Mathematics Examination, 1955)","solution":"[Solution] Given x y+y=1, we have y=frac{1}{x+1},thusbegin{array}{c}frac{1}{x+1}=(x+1)^{2} .

Consider all sequences (e_1,e_2,...,e_N) with each e_i equal to 1 or -1. Per move one can choose any five consecutive terms and change their signs. Two sequences are said to be similar if one of them can be transformed into the other in finitely many moves. Find the maximum number of pairwise non-similar sequences of length N.","solution":"1. Define the problem and the transformation:   We are given a sequence ( (e_1, e_2, ldots, e_N) ) where each ( e_i ) is either ( 1 ) or ( -1 ). We can choose any five consecutive terms and change their signs in one move. Two sequences are similar if one can be transformed into the other through a finite number of such moves. We need to find the maximum number of pairwise non-similar sequences of length ( N ).2. Define a \\"good\\" sequence:   A sequence ( e = (e_1, e_2, ldots, e_N) ) is called \\"good\\" if ( e_5 = e_6 = ldots = e_N = 1 ). The goal is to show that any sequence can be transformed into a good sequence and that each sequence has a unique similar good sequence.3. Transform any sequence into a good sequence:   We can transform any sequence ( e = (e_1, e_2, ldots, e_N) ) into a good sequence by repeatedly choosing appropriate 5-tuples and changing their signs. This process will eventually make ( e_5 = e_6 = ldots = e_N = 1 ).4. Uniqueness of the good sequence:   Suppose there are two similar good sequences. This means there exists a sequence of moves that transforms one good sequence into the other. We need to show that this transformation is unique.5. Order of moves is not important:   The order of moves does not affect the final result. Let ( d_i ) be the number of moves that change the 5-tuple ( (e_{i-4}, ldots, e_i) ) for ( 5 leq i leq N ). We have ( d_1 = d_2 = d_3 = d_4 = d_{N+1} = d_{N+2} = d_{N+3} = d_{N+4} = 0 ).6. Effect of transformations:   After all transformations, ( e_i ) will be changed to ( e_i cdot (-1)^{d_i + d_{i+1} + d_{i+2} + d_{i+3} + d_{i+4}} ). Since both sequences are good, ( d_i + d_{i+1} + d_{i+2} + d_{i+3} + d_{i+4} ) must be even for ( 5 leq i leq N ).7. Modulo 2 equivalence:   This implies ( d_i equiv d_{i+5} pmod{2} ). Given ( d_N = d_{N-1} = d_{N-2} = d_{N-3} = d_{N-4} = 0 pmod{2} ), it follows that ( d_i ) is even for all ( i ). Therefore, every element was changed an even number of times, resulting in the same sequence.8. Count of pairwise non-similar sequences:   The number of pairwise non-similar sequences of length ( N ) is the number of pairwise different good sequences of length ( N ). Since a good sequence is determined by the first four elements ( (e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4) ), there are ( 2^4 = 16 ) such sequences.The final answer is ( boxed{16} )"},{"problem":"If the sum of the odd binomial coefficients in the expansion of (2-x)^n is 8192, then the term with the largest coefficient in the expansion is.","solution":"From 2^{n-1} = 8192, we get n=14.

Since these three terms must add up to the desired expressions, we get the conditionsbegin{aligned}f+a & =1 b+c & =2 d+e & =5end{aligned}Furthermore, we want equality to hold for certain x, y, and z. So the systembegin{aligned}& x y=a frac{1}{x}=b frac{1}{y} & y z=c frac{1}{y}=d frac{1}{z} & z x=e frac{1}{z}=f frac{1}{x}end{aligned}must have a solution for some x, y, and z. From the first equation, it follows that frac{x}{y}=frac{a}{b}. But using the last two equations, we can also write this asfrac{x}{y}=frac{z x}{y z}=frac{f / x}{c / y}=frac{f y}{c x}This means that frac{f}{c}=frac{x^{2}}{y^{2}}=frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}, or a^{2} / f=b^{2} / c. Similarly, we have c^{2} / b=d^{2} / e and e^{2} / d=f^{2} / a. Together with f+a=1, b+c=2, and d+e=5, we now have six equations in six variables. Although it is not easy to solve this system, it greatly simplifies the search because it is now easy to check if a, b, c, d, e, f satisfy the conditions.

Partitioning the set: Let ( k ) be the number of fixed points of ( f ). The fixed points form a subset ( A subseteq {1, 2, ldots, n} ) with ( |A| = k ).4. Counting fixed points: The number of ways to choose ( k ) fixed points from ( n ) elements is given by ( binom{n}{k} ).5. Mapping non-fixed points: The remaining ( n - k ) elements must map to one of the ( k ) fixed points. Each of these ( n - k ) elements has ( k ) choices.6. Total number of functions: Therefore, the total number of idempotent functions is given by:   [   sum_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} k^{n-k}   ]The final answer is ( boxed{ sum_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} k^{n-k} } )"},{"problem":"Consider a sequence {a_n} with the sum of the first n terms denoted as S_n, where a_1=1 and a_{n+1}=2S_n+1 for n geq 1. 1.

Multi-digit numbers cannot start with zero.","solution":"Answer: 12345 or 21436.Solution. Note that 157605=3 cdot 5 cdot 7 cdot 19 cdot 79. To start, we need to understand which combinations of prime factors correspond to the sums of two-digit numbers. The sum of two-digit numbers cannot exceed 99+99=198, and 79 cdot 3 is already greater than 200, so one of the brackets must be 79. How can the remaining factors be distributed? 79(19.5)(3.7); 79(19.7)(3.5); 79(3.19)(5.7); 79(19)(3 cdot 5 cdot 7). There are no other cases because in them, a factor greater than 198 is obtained.Thus, we get the triplets of numbers (79 ; 95 ; 21),(79 ; 133 ; 15),(79 ; 57 ; 35),(79 ; 19 ; 105). Now, note the following: (overline{x y}+overline{y z})=10 x+y+10 y+z=10(x+y)+(y+z), and the sums of the digits cannot exceed 9+9=18. For example, if (overline{x y}+overline{y z})=79, then this means that x+y=7, y+z=9. If (overline{x y}+overline{y z})=133, then either x+y=13, y+z=3, or x+y=12, y+z=13. If (overline{x y}+overline{y z})=15, then either x+y=1, y+z=5, or x+y=0, y+z=15. For instance, we will focus on the set of numbers (7,9),(12,13),(1,5), where the numbers represent possible sums of adjacent digits overline{a b c d e}.However, if we take the number overline{a b c d e}, it will have only 4 possible pairs of adjacent digits, so the set can have no more than 4 different values.

Moreover, these pairs of numbers need to be arranged so that the values \\"fit together,\\" that is, like this: (3,5),(5,7),(7,9). Therefore, for overline{a b c d e}, the following will be true: a+b=3, b+c=5, c+d=7, d+e=9. This system has only 4 solutions, corresponding to the 5-digit sequences 12345,21436,30527,03254, the last of which is not suitable because it starts with zero, and the second to last - because for this sequence overline{b c}=05."},{"problem":"Given that the three sides of a triangle are 8, 10, and x, the range of possible values for x is ______.","solution":"To find the range of possible values for x in a triangle with sides of lengths 8, 10, and x, we apply the triangle inequality theorem.

Choosing Numbers:   To maximize the product of three numbers, they should be as close to each other as possible.

From the identity given in the problem, it follows that the sought polynomial P(x)=P_{n}(x) (where n is the degree of the polynomial) is divisible by x, i.e., P_{n}(x)=x P_{n-1}(x), where P_{n-1}(x) is some new polynomial of degree n-1. Therefore,P(x-1)=(x-1) P_{n-1}(x-1)and, hence,x(x-1) P_{n-1}(x-1)=x P(x-1)=(x-26) P(x),which implies that P(x) is also divisible by x-1, i.e., P_{n}(x)=x(x-1) P_{n-2}(x) (since P_{n-1}(x)=(x-1) P_{n-2}(x) is divisible by x-1). In this case, P(x-1)=(x-1)(x-2) P_{n-2}(x-1), and we obtain:x(x-1)(x-2) P_{n-2}(x-1)==(x-26) P_{n}(x)=(x-26) x(x-1) P_{n-2}(x),- from which it follows that P_{n}(x) is also divisible by x-2 (i.e., P_{n-2}(x) is divisible by x-2), and, therefore, P_{n}(x)=x(x-1)(x-2) P_{n-3}(x). Substituting this value of P(x) into the original relation, we similarly verify that P(x) is also divisible by x-3, i.e., P_{n}(x)= =x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) P_{n-3}(x), and so on.Continuing in this manner, we eventually arrive at the following form of the polynomial P(x):P(x)=P_{n}(x)=x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) ldots(x-25) P_{n-26}(x) .Substituting this expression for P(x) into the given identity, we get:begin{aligned}& x(x-1)(x-2) ldots(x-26) P_{n-26}(x-1)= &=(x-26) x(x-1) ldots(x-25) P_{n-26}(x),end{aligned}from which it follows that for the polynomial P_{n-26}(x) equiv Q(x) of degree n-26Q(x-1) equiv Q(x)It is clear that if Q(x)=Q_{0}(x)=c is a polynomial of degree zero (a constant!), then the relation (*) holds; we will show that it holds only in this case.

Since O - the center of the circumscribed circle - lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment AB, point D also lies on this perpendicular bisector.

Thus, the four vertices on the surface of the sphere form the top face, parallel to it. The top square is inscribed in the circle k cut by the plane from the sphere, and the center K of this circle and the top face coincide. Drawing lines parallel to the edges through K-mathrm{n}, we get an axis of the cube's face, and on the other hand, rotating around this, the circle k shifts itself, so the hemisphere also shifts, which is why the center of the base of the cube coincides with the center O of the hemisphere.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_4335c7e43e99dfb4d0b4g-1.jpg?height=380&width=547&top_left_y=431&top_left_x=778)Figure 1Based on this, our computational task is to express k and the radius r of the circle circumscribed around the base square - half the diagonal of the base square - in terms of the given radius R of the hemisphere.Let one vertex of the base be A, and the endpoint of the edge starting from it on the surface of the hemisphere be A^{prime}.

Based on this observation, one way to perform the construction after the auxiliary construction is: On the circular base of the hemisphere, draw a circle of radius r around O, inscribe a square in it, erect perpendicular lines from its vertices to the base, and these will intersect the other four vertices of the cube from the surface of the hemisphere.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_4335c7e43e99dfb4d0b4g-1.jpg?height=260&width=272&top_left_y=1439&top_left_x=688)Remarks. 1.

To find its maximum value in the interval [1,3], we consider its behavior. The function is monotonically decreasing on [1,sqrt{3}] and monotonically increasing on [sqrt{3},3]. This is because the derivative of y with respect to x changes sign at x = sqrt{3}, indicating a minimum point there. To find the maximum value, we evaluate y at the endpoints of the interval [1,3]. At x = 1, y = 1 + frac{3}{1} = 4, and at x = 3, y = 3 + frac{3}{3} = 4. Thus, the maximum value of y = x + frac{3}{x} in the interval is 4.Since a must be greater than the maximum value of y for the given condition to hold, we have a > 4. This implies that a > 4 is a necessary condition for p.

Therefore, we can write the vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} in component form:- overrightarrow{a} = -(2overrightarrow{e_1} + overrightarrow{e_2}) = -2(1, 0) - (0, 1) = (-2, -1).- overrightarrow{b} = overrightarrow{e_1} - lambda overrightarrow{e_2} = (1, 0) - lambda(0, 1) = (1, -lambda).(1) If overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b}, then there exists a scalar k such that overrightarrow{a} = koverrightarrow{b}. This means that each corresponding component of the vectors must be proportional, so we have:-2 = k cdot 1 quad text{and} quad -1 = k cdot (-lambda).Solving the first equation gives k = -2. Substituting k into the second equation yields -1 = -2 cdot (-lambda) Rightarrow lambda = frac{1}{2}. However, we need lambda to be negative since the second component of overrightarrow{a} is negative. Thus, lambda = -frac{1}{2}. So, we have: boxed{lambda = -frac{1}{2}}. (2) If overrightarrow{a} perp overrightarrow{b}, then their dot product equals zero. Thus, we compute the dot product of the vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}:overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = (-2) cdot 1 + (-1) cdot (-lambda) = -2 + lambda = 0.Solving for lambda gives lambda = 2. Hence, we have: boxed{lambda = 2}.

Therefore, we can write 3a_5 = 15, and solving for a_5 gives us a_5=5.Now, to find the sum of the first 9 terms, S_9, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:S_n = frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}In this case, we need to determine a_1 and a_9. To find a_1, we can use the fact that a_5 = 5 and the common difference between terms, d, is:d = a_5 - a_4 = a_4 - a_3Since a_5 = 5, we can set up the following system of equations:begin{cases}a_4 = a_3 + da_5 = a_4 + dend{cases}Combining these two equations, we obtain:a_5 = a_3 + 2dGiven a_5 = 5, we can write a_3 = 5 - 2d and a_7 = 5 + 2d. From the original problem, we have a_3 + a_5 + a_7 = 15. Substitute 5-2d for a_3 and 5+2d for a_7, we get:(5-2d) + 5 + (5+2d) = 15Solving this equation for d, we obtain d = 1. Consequently, a_1 = a_3 - 2d = 5 - 2(1) = 3 and a_9 = a_5 + 4d = 5 + 4(1) = 9.Finally, apply the sum formula for an arithmetic series:S_9 = frac{9(a_1 + a_9)}{2} = frac{9(3+9)}{2} = boxed{45}"},{"problem":"4.

The required max a=665. First, we prove: a leqslant 665. Clearly, the 999-element subset X_{0}={999,1000,1001, cdots, 1997 mid does not contain x, y in X_{0} such that x cdot 1997, which is greater than the largest element in X_{0}, holds. Thus, a cannot be any of the numbers 999,1000,1001, cdots, 1997.Next, we prove that a neq 666,667,668, cdots, 997,998.

It has already been proven that no non-multiples of any element in X_{0} are in X_{0}, and 666+i<999(i=0,1,2, cdots, 332), so no multiples of any element in X_{0} can be 666+i(i=0,1, cdots, 332). Thus, the multiples (excluding itself) of any other elements in B_{i} are not in B_{i}. Therefore, there do not exist two elements in B_{i} such that x<y, x mid y, and B_{i} (i=0,1, cdots, 332) includes 666, 667, cdots, 998. Hence, a neq 666,667, cdots, 998, so a leqslant 665.Next, we prove that 665 is attainable.
