So I tried to continue shopping & got water (I m abnormally thirsty) to drink, couldn t bear drinking because I started to get super weak, my face felt hot & flushed. My heart was throbbing so hard I could feel it in my neck & face (cheeks); even my arms became so very week I couldn t hold on to the shopping cart. The Manager & Pharmacist assisted me & wanted to call Paramedics, but I needed to get home to my daughters, so they wheeled me to my car. Now, upon arriving home I needed help once again & I went to bed....Woke-up this A.M. & still in great discomfort & very weak I tried to cook brunch for my girls but kept burning the food (I d like to think that this is rare for me)! After my attempt I had great sharp pains in my back & gut & then had diarrhea (just a little bit) & it was pink mucus & further into it, it had gotten a bit brighter & a little more red in color, no odor.....I was so weak & panting & my lower back was screaming in pain & my pelvic & lower right abdomen aches!

Infection of gut might have caused abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dehydration. Sometimes this pain can radiate to the back and upper thighs.I suggest you get a stool exam done for microscopy and culture to rule out infection. Mean while I suggest you take Tab Buscopan twice daily after food. Drink adequate water. Take fluid diet for the next few days. Rest as much as possible.If stool exam shows infection, get in touch with your GP for a prescription of appropriate antibiotics or antiparasitic medications.Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi I am 16 years old an am going to be 17 in 10 days and live in the state of colorado i have twisted vertebrae in my back and have constant back pain, also i have problems eating and sleeping, I was curious to know if i could get a medical marijuana license for these issues, marijuana seems to be the only thing that helps me, im just not sure if i would be able to get it for these issues.

Thank you for your query. I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.•     Well, such cramps and pain is nonspecific sign and it is hard to identify just one possible cause, but there are disorders which are more frequent than other and mostly include benign issues. However, some more serious should always be ruled out. These common include trapped wind (flatulence), pain or discomfort after eating (indigestion) or constipation. These can be treated with changed dietary and lifetime habits and rarely require some more specific treatment. In every case you need to watch your diet: You need to avoid fried food, carbonated drinks, coffee, alcohol and spicy food. You should eat more milk products, vegetables and boiled food. If there is no improvement on this or serious symptoms occur such as blood in stool, weight loss or complete constipation with abdominal distension, then you need to see doctor as soon as possible. Otherwise, you can do tests if necessary that include abdominal CT scan and colonoscopy.I hope I have answered you query.

I had this for well over a year.  What is the next step?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.As per your description, you have mild arthritic changes in your hips producing the symptomatology. The initial measures for hip arthritis is always conservative by the following means-* ACTIVITY MODIFICATION -It is important to maintain as much activity and joint motion as possible, but impact activities will aggravate arthritis. Running and jumping will often accelerate cartilage loss from the joint. The key is to focus on low impact activities, such as swimming or cycling. These are the best forms of exercise with arthritic hips as they do not require significant weight bearing across the hip joints.* WEIGHT LOSS -  Significant weight loss for obese patients can make a dramatic difference in the pain arising from arthritic joints.* NON STEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDs) - This family of medications includes aspirin, ibuprofen, naprosyn, and other non-narcotic medications to decrease pain and inflammation.* GLUCOSAMINE / CHONDROITIN SULFATE - There is compelling evidence that it is relatively safe and works by decreasing pain & inflammation in the joint thereby reducing the need for regular painkiller usage.* HIP INJECTIONS -  Injection therapies do not \\"cure\\" the underlying problems of arthritis, but can be useful for short term relief (potentially for a few months).Hopefully, your symptoms should improve with the above measures.Hope this information is helpful. Good day"},{"Patient":"Hi..I have had issues with my low back for years but nothing severe. If i turn in my stomach when sleeping i would wake up with severe pain and almost unable to roll over. Once I rolled over it would be ok. Sometimes if i bend down it would feel like I was going to be stuck there. I have exercised and tried to be active to help with this. I have been doing core exercise plus strength training and cardio. I went to a chiropractor about a month ago for my shoulder. I told him about the shoulder issues i have had for about 3 years and that I was having migraines and visual disturbances and also mentioned my low back problems. He did X-rays and told me my low back was \\"as close to going out as possible\\" but he could fix it. I was going for about 3 weeks when I told him I felt my low back was worse than when i came there and I came for my shoulder. He didn't say anything just asked if I was stretching. I then suddenly went to the mall and was walking and I felt my back getting very bad like it was going to go out , I had been walking for a few hours, so i decided to leave when i went to sit in my car the pain was so severe when i sat down it was like having labor pain in my low back. After a few minutes it got better and I rested but this continued for a few days with numbness in  my legs and feet.  I told the  chiropractor and he said to get an MRI so i did. the impression is Minor Foraminal disk bulging at L3-4 and L4-5 with mild facet arthritis . There is mild left subarticular recess narrowing at L4-5. I just want to know if i should go see a dr that specializes in spinal issues and I want to continue to exercise but i dont know if I need to do anything about this.I am afraid to go back to the chiropractor because it seems like what he was doing triggered this and he will want to keep doing it, Is this something serious that needs attention? The pain was bad and I still have tingling and numbness the pain is better than it was a week ago but things dont feel the way they should.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.Based on the description and your symptoms, you are suffering with Lumbar disc disease along with radiculopathy (compression of the nerve by the protruding intervertebral disc producing tingling & numbness sensations in the legs).The initial management of this problem is always conservative by the following means -- Usually 1-2 days of bed rest will calm severe back pain. Do not stay off your feet for longer, though.- Maintain optimum body weight,if you are obese- Avoid lifting heavy weights as it imparts more strain on your back- Change your daily activities so that you avoid movements that can cause further pain, especially bending forward and lifting  as it will worsen the disc protrusion. if you want to bend forwards, do it with your hips and knees flexed.- Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles- Intermittent pelvic traction might be helpful to cause a regression of the protruded disc- After the initial pain has subsided, remedial exercises to strengthen the spine are very important to restore normal spinal movements and muscle strength. The main aim of exercise is to encourage mobility, reduce muscle spasm, prevent further deterioration in the muscles and speed recovery.- Use analgesics like advil or aleve and muscle relaxants to relieve pain and muscle spasm, as needed. Vitamin B12 supplements & Pregabalin may be helpful in controlling the neuropathic pain.If your fail to improve with the above measures, an Epidural steroid injection may provide good symptom relief for a few months. There is good evidence that epidural injections can be successful in 60-70% of patients who have not been helped by 6 weeks or more of conservative management ( nonsurgical care).Hope this information is helpful.

X-ray of the abdomen in standing position. This is the cheapest and simplest test to see for intestinal obstruction. Ultrasonography and CT scan of the abdomen to confirm.Routine tests of blood and urine. Enteroclysis if obstruction is suspected,Diagnostic Laparoscopy: this helps in diagnosis ans well as therapeutically. One can cut the bands / release the adhesions.Take a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole for 5 days, is there is a response, nothing to worry. - Maintain healthy food habits, avoid too much fibrous foods as they can cause repeated sub-acute intestinal obstructions.If no relief further investigations and treatment will be required."},{"Patient":"2 years ago I strained my back.

In order that I can better understand what is going on can you please show me how these three systems are interconnected.","Doctor":"HI,Thanks for writing in.To understand the origin of back pain and its connections, you have to know a little about the structures present.The lower back spine is known as lumbar and sacral spine and the coccyx or tail bone. The lumbar spine consists of 5 small bones aligned on top of each other and are separated by small discs which are made of soft material. The sacrum consists of 5 small segments.  There are no discs between the sacral segments and they are fused with each other.Nerves come out from the spinal cord through small holes between the small bones. these holes are known as foramen. When the disc between two bones degenerated (L4 and L 5 in you), the 5th nerve is compressed at the foramen and there is nerve root compression.This nerve root compression gives rise to lower back pain and excretory problems.

I m an 18 year old female, about 145lbs, 5 6. My right side is hurting and I feel nauseous. It s more of the right side of my back and side.

Could this be something serious or will it be gone by tomorrow?","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for your query. Read your history and understood it. The pain in the right side more of the back and right side can be due to following reasons::Impacted stone in the right upper ureter.Retrocecal meaning behind the cecum Appendicitis. This can be serious as the pain in the said area does not give classical signs and symptoms of a particular disease. High degree of suspicion only helps.I would advice you to go for the blood and urine test- RBS in urine will favor more for ureteric stone. Ultrasonography will see for both the problems, but CT scan will be more specific as it can diagnosed the suspected disease and rule out or diagnose any other problem. This may not go by tomorrow, get investigated , get a confirmed diagnosis as the treatment of both the problems is different and specific."},{"Patient":"Hi I have RA and back problems , my pain gets about 10times worse in the winter time , so when it starts to get cold I need pain meds , where can I go ,, I went to the spine center last year but when the weather got warm and I didn t need the pills anymore they were not happy with me ,, told them I would come back when winter came back around ,, they had me on 30mg of outcomes 3times a day","Doctor":"Hi, it appears that you have minimal invasion of the disease R.A. it is more in winter.

The car accident wasn't THAT bad(i assume because I was walking that same day) but I did get a big bruise on the right side of my hip were the car hit me and a couple of scraps on my left side. Around two months later after the accident I had a physical check up and when the doctor told me to bend over to check my spine I remembered it was kinda painful then she said my spine didn't look straight in the same area where it hurts when I bend over, so that's when my mom told her about the car accident, then the doctor sent me to get x-rays but some stuff happened right after the x-rays and never found it if there was anything wrong.but just like I stated earlier, my back has really been acting up you could say,i started waking up with back pain, bothers me to sit down without back support, the pain to bend over got abit worse sometimes I need to hold on to something to stand up straight again, can't lift heavy objects anymore,discomfort to stand for long periods of time which maybe me miss a couple of days and didn't let me preform my duties to my full abilities.So what I wanna know is, does it sound like a new different problem with my back or could it be due to the car accident and never finding out if there was something wrong and has gotten worse over time.?Also should I visit a doctor or wait and see if it gets better.?","Doctor":"HIThank for asking to HCMAs you stated here that the x- ray report is normal I guess that you might have taken all the analgesic or pain killer, If I would be a your doctor then I would definitely suggest you MRI to rule out any other possibility, mean while I would try some physiotherapy so I say you why do not you follow this advise see if you can get some relief, hope this will be nice for  you have nice day."},{"Patient":"I had substantial bruising on both shoulders and my lower back and thighs when I fell down a full flight if stairs with a fright hand extra turn at top about 3 years ago at a friends house one night in pitch black.

It is worrisome to know that all the tests you mentioned have been normal viz- EGD, Colonoscopy, abd US, Cardiac stress test, liver function test, and bloodwork has all been normal- blood work once normal has not much important if done again. The pain is persistent in a lady of 80 years in spite of the negative tests. When the increasing factors are food and standing up, the most probable causes can be ::Intestinal obstruction- this can be missed by many tests. Needs to be done by a simple X-ray in the standing position- shows gas / fluid levels. This is possible only if done in a standing position. CT scan can not be done in standing position- it is always done in lying down position so can miss. Another problem can be a sealed perforation- again very difficult to find on any tests.

A repeat MRI scan is always helpful in assessing the present condition of your disc disease. The general management guidelines for a lumbar disc disease is as follows -- Maintain optimum body weight,if you are obese- Avoid lifting heavy weights as it imparts more strain on your back- Avoid excessive forward bending activities as it will worsen the disc protrusion. if you want to bend forwards, do it with your hips and knees flexed.- Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles- Intermittent pelvic traction might be helpful to cause a regression of the protruded disc- Physiotherapy is needed to strengthen your back muscles. Physiotherapy has to be done only after the acute pain has subsided.- Use analgesics like advil or aleve and muscle relaxants as needed. Vitamin B12 supplements & Pregabalin may be helpful.

I was using pain killers heavily for a year prior for a back injury I sustained at work. After getting off of the pain killers I began having brief attacks of aphasia which originally I thought was a stroke. I would feel a shooting pain up the left side of my neck followed by the inability to speak for 10-30 seconds. This has happened three times in the past two years. Each time I went for an MRI and nothing was found. When I got off of the pain killers my left nostril became completely blocked. This has gotten better with time but still comes and goes. I also have back and neck pain on my left side, this is something that I've had since I was in high school but attributed it to working out. My neck cracks continuously, but only on the left side never the right. I also have swollen lymphs on my left side. I spoke with a neurologist who seemed to think this was all caused by atypical migraines. After trying many different migraine medications and therapies I have found no luck. Are there any type of lymphatic disorders or any other disorders that effect only one side of the body. I got a cold a couple days ago and the left side of my throat is even more swollen. I have seen different doctors, taken many blood tests, had MRIs and even CTs of my sinus cavity all have come up negative.","Doctor":"i everything is normal it is allergyas allergies can cause off and on problems lke blockage and pnd causing lymph node enlargementsthis have been developed by pain killers and other medicinesget allergy doctor consultation who cabn find the cause may be polns drugs and foods to find he cause and treat according to allergy guidelines"},{"Patient":"I have a left side back pain, having trouble sitting straight, also having problem with eating and if I touch below my rib cage in the front and the back pain seem to be at the same point.

The rules of the Surgical fields have to followed strictly to avoid such complications. Since you had an appendicular abscess you should have got operated after a few weeks from now on- but unfortunately for you there is a similar problem. Only CT scan of the abdomen can tell us whether there is a recurrence of Appendicitis or something else. It is OK, we have to face the problem. I would advise you the following:Get admitted, get started on intravenous fluids and antibiotics and supportive medicines . Get he blood counts ans all necessary tests. CT scan to confirm. Surgeon would assess the possibility to operate or wait for 6 more weeks depending upon your response to conservative management. This does not look to be associated with female related .

With the history of a hiatal hernia, I would presume your symptoms to be due to an associated GERD. If I were your doctor,I would suggest the following for your to get a symptomatic relief :1) Elevate the head end of the bed with two blocks on each side, so that the regurgitation does not occur while lying down, and the contents of esophagus and stomach flow down with gravity.2) Some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food including any alcoholic beverages.3) Regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness.4) Prescription for a prokinetic agent and a proton pump inhibitor (which you already are on) for symptomatic relief and to have a control on the acid production and facilitate movement of gastric contents downwards.5) In case of no relief, an elective surgery for the hiatal hernia might relieve your symptoms, and so you might have to consult a gastro enterologist for the same.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

I have severe back and neck problems, have for close to a decade. My entire spine and neck is very sore, nerve problems and no doubt my spine would be out in lots of places. A few weeks ago i started getting pains in my throat, like pain coming from the top of my chest just below my collar bones and traveling up my two neck two arteries. It isn't constant, but is there daily and comes and goes. It's in direct line with where the worst part of my back is, just below my collarbone line. That level is where my back is just beyond sore, words can't describe how bad it gets and i know my spine is out of place badly there. Now at the front at the exact same level is where i'm getting the pains from that are shooting into my throat. I know that pains like that can be heart related, but i feel fine apart from my back pain, my heart feels okay. I'm just wondering can severe back pain and having a spine out of place cause such problems like this at the front. It just feels very tight and i get shooting pains going into my throat, but there's no real trouble breathing, just the usual tightness i feel with my spine being out and being very painful. If i honestly thought it was my heart and i had no trouble at all with back or neck pain, i'd be at the hospital right now. I just honestly don't feel it's my heart and i know how ridiculous my back feels right now with the pain im in. I'm only 35, so i don't think it's a heart attack or stroke or anything and i have no tingling or numbness or anything in my arms/hands.

The pain you are having in front and at the back are two separate pains. If I was your treating physician i will do the following:1. Take detailed assessment of your mood and anxiety. Sometimes such pains are associated with depression and anxiety disorder. Treating depression/anxiety improves the outcome of pain as well. 2. Get your x-ray spine done. 3. Examine the throat and chest for any abnormality.4. Get an ECG done.5.

I feel as if I am not urinating as much as usual, I am having trouble starting a stream and I feel as if I do not empty my bladder fully some times.

The best and easiest way to come off opioids is to gradually decrease the dosage before ultimately stopping completely. During this process you may suffer from mild withdrawal symptoms like aches and pains, loose motions, running nose etc which can be managed with over the counter medicines. This will certainly be milder than the withdrawal from abrupt stopping of the drug. For osteopenia, you will need calcium supplements and other medicines, depending on the cause of bone loss, like abnormal vitamin D levels etc. Hope this helps you.

These symptoms are part of lumbar disc degeneration with PIVD where the nerves get compressed by the protruded disc.There are several treatment modalities with medicines, physiotherapy and with injections in the back called epidural injections and root/facet blocks.If you don’t get better with these treatment ,I suggest you undergo surgery, by which the nerves are decompressed by removing the protruded disc (discectomy), which would significantly improve your symptomsI do hope that you have found something helpful and informative and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have degenerative disk disease, torn disk at l4-l5, central canal stenosis at L5-S1 with schmorls node, moderate facet arthropathy and stress fractures. I have been told by a specialist that surgery in my condition can only cure eventual nerve-related pain or pressure in my legs, but that no surgery would be effective on my crushing lower back pain. I have tried tramadol, ibuprofen, gabapentin, amytriptyline, and lidoderm patches as well as over the counter products. So far the things that work best are lidoderm patches, heating pad, and menthol pain relief gel. My question is are there any other prescription medications that I could try? All of the things that help reduce my pain cannot be worn while attempting to work and I must remain stationary or resting. I have filed for disability due to the pain that I have had since 2006 that at times leaves me unable to walk more than 10 feet at a time. If the disability falls through then I need to find a way to return to work but there is not much potential in that considering my current pain levels. The specialist also said that steroid shots (epidural) were 50/50 and carried risky side-effects. What options do pain clinics have in this situation? Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.It seems from the description that you are concerned much about your back pain. Any Analgesic medication taken over prolonged periods tend to produce certain adverse reactions in the body, out of which, Renal damage (kidney problems) is concerning.So, I suggest you to go for RADIO FREQUENCY ABLATION which is quite helpful in alleviating the pain in chronic lower back disorders. The degree of pain relief varies, depending on the cause and location of the pain. Pain relief from RFA can last from six to 12 months and in some cases, relief can last for years. More than 70% of patients treated with RFA experience pain relief.   So, its worth a try. Hope this information is helpful.

I was just wondering how long it could take for my injury to heal while I am on the ice 5 days a week (I can only miss 1 or 2 ice times)? My trainer also told me that I may have snapping hip syndrome because when I stand up after sitting for a period of time, I sometimes need to use extra force to stretch my leg as it feels like it won't straighten near the groin. Is it possible this is just because of my hip flexor injury?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.It seems from the description that you have sustained Groin strain. You need to rest the part and allow it to heal. An MRI scan of the involved area is necessary to know the severity of soft tissue damage.The treatment of Groin strain involves* REST - It is important to rest following the injury to allowed the injured muscle to properly heal.* STRETCHING - Gentle stretching is helpful, but it should not be painful.* ICE PACKING - Apply ice to the injured area in the acute phase (first 48 hours after injury), and then after activities. Ice will help calm the inflammatory response and stimulate blood flow to the area.* MOIST HEAT APPLICATION - Before activities, gentle heating can help loosen the muscle. Apply a heat pack to the groin prior to stretching or exercising. As a general rule of thumb, remember to heat before an activity and ice afterwards* ANTIINFLAMMATORY MEDICATION - Oral anti-inflammatory medications (such as Ibuprofen, Aleve, or Motrin) can help relieve symptoms of pain and also calm the inflammation.* PHYSICAL THERAPY - may speed up the recovery process. Therapeutic modalities such as Ultrasound, Massaging and specific exercises will be helpful.Hope this information is helpful.

The body produces endorphins during aerobic exercise. Infact any activity that gets your blood pumping for a sustained period will release pain relieving endorphins into your system.- Eat foods rich in resveratrol : Scientists have shown  that foods high in resveratrol will slow down disc degradation. Resveratrol is found in red grapes, cranberries, and blueberries.- Eat cookies : Research shows that eating sweet foods like cookies, chocolate or ice cream, helps reduce the sensation of pain. Or just bake the cookies. Enjoying a smell that is both sweet and pleasant has been shown to reduce the perception of pain.- Feel the heat :Applying some form of heat (a hot water bottle, electric heating pad) can go a long way in easing your pain. Benefits of heat are twofold: itincreases the flow of healing oxygen and nutrients to the damaged area, and it suppresses pain signals being sent to your brain.- Cool it with ice : Back pain almost always comes with some level of inflammation, and ice is the best natural way to reduce it. Ice also helps by acting as a local anesthetic, and by slowing the nerve impulses, which in turn interrupts the pain-spasm reactions between the nerves in the affected area.- Enjoy the outdoors :Researchers found that Vitamin D helps relieve pain by aiding in the absorption of calcium, which is needed for bone growth and repair. Other research shows vitamin D may directly help soothe pain. About 15 minutes of sun exposure on your face and hands a day is enough to get your daily dose of D.- Meditate twice daily :Easy to learn and immediate results make this one of my favorite paths to natural pain relief. Meditation can also help reduce thedepression, anxiety, stress and sleeping problems that often accompany chronic pain.- Get enough restorative sleep :Getting enough sleep is critical to managing the pain and healing, so it’s important to employ a variety of sleep aids to help you get a healthy amount of sleep.Hope this information is helpful.

I couldn't afford that, so Dr. wrote last script and told me find another Dr. I asked for my records, and picked them up a week later, read them when I got home and couldn't believe what I was reading. Not only did my Doctor charge for anesthesia that I never received but also other items Dr. wrote down, but most devasting was Dr. wrote in last few months on my reports that I was psychosocial, that I had psychological issues, etc...and when Dr. wrote about meds. I was taking during first few months he wrote Aberrant to Opioids - NONE.  Everything seemed to change in his monthly reports after he found out about the Ins. Co. not covering injections. I had an appointment with a new Pain Management Dr. yesterday and as he read my reports that I brought, the only thing he asked me was - am I suicidal? I almost laughed but just said absolutely not. He then told me I would have to bring in a note from a psychiatrist stating I was not suicidal and then proceeded to have his assistant show me the back room where they did procedures including back injections. I thought this must be a bad joke. The room was filthy, dirty, papers all over the place, floors horrible, and table that we are supposed to lay on again filthy. Instead of the paper you pull off for the next pt., it was a dirty light blanket. I just waited while copies were made of my records and Dr. said he would get back injections covered from my Ins. Co.. I just said ok.,took my records and left. After what my former Pain Management Dr. wrote about me, I don't think any respectable Doctor is going to not only take me seriously, but take me on as a patient. Can anyone help me. Should I make an appointment with a Doctor and just not bring my records or what? I'm at a loss, but this Dr. has defamed me, wrote false accusations about me and these are really bad for a new Dr. to just ignore. I think I should speak to my lawyer as this Doctor has ruined my credibility, and hurt my reputation by libel and slander. Would any Doctor out there reading this treat me? I don't think so. Any response would be appreciated.

I initially experienced it when I slept in a bed away from home so assumed it was just the bed. However, since then, the symptoms have continued, initially fairly constant so took Advil and applied heat....with some relief. However, the discomfort does not feel like the typical muscle spasms I have experienced in the past.  At times, it seems more pronounced on the left side.  At times, it disappears all together.  But it recurs at nite after I have bee sleeping for a few hours and it is difficult to find a comfortable position.  Abdominal discomfort accompanies it at times as does a boating feeling. I also feel more tired than usual.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCMBased on the description of symptoms, I think it is Postural backpain owing to the odd position adopted while sleeping.Any muscle in the body will tend to go into spasm (tightness) if it is held in one particular position for a given period of time. So, I suggest you to avoid sleeping positions which produces pain. As you rightly said, hot shower always helps as the heat produces relaxation in the muscles.If your pain is intolerable, use oral muscle relaxants and massage painkiller creams over the affected regions.An MRI scan may be needed to rule out any underlying pathology that is producing pain.I do hope that you have found something helpful and informative and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care."},{"Patient":"I started having extreme left lower back pain yesterday morning to the point that I could almost not walk.

Started vomiting about 4-5 hrs after getting home. Continued vomiting until she went to ER sunday. Saturday night her abdomen was normal.

Any ideas????","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query. Read the history about your Mother and understood it. The cause of sudden mottling on the stomach after the drain is removed after modified Whipple's surgery can be due to following reasons:-Commonest reason is some sort of allergy, for which a detailed history is need. -There might have been leakage of pancreatic enzymes, which can cause this. -The spread of infection in the subcutaneous planes can also cause this.  If the vomiting is persistent, if the other signs or symptoms develop like continuation of vomiting, distension of abdomen, constipation or obstipation, fever an so on, she needs to be admitted; Nasogastric tube passed and kept on intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Blood and urine investigations will be done.

I am a make up of many cultures. and tat","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.Your problem in the left leg is no way related to your Hip replacement surgery of the right hip.As per the description, all your symptoms suggest a degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with compression of the neural elements.The conservative management of degenerative disc disease is as follows -* avoid lifting heavy weights as it imparts more strain on your back* avoid forward bending activities as it will worsen the disc protrusion* Use a lumbosacral back support to augment your spinal muscles* Intermittent pelvic traction to cause a regression of disc* Maintain optimum body weight,if you are obese* Physiotherapy to strengthen your back muscles. Physiotherapy has to be done only after the acute pain has subsided.* Judicious use of analgesics and muscle relaxants.If all these measures fail to provide you relief, then surgical decompression may be an option.Hope this information is helpful.

My recovery had gone well over the past 2 months and I had finally got back to normal, until having intercourse, and now I am having abdominal pain deep in my belly.  Is there a chance that having intercourse a few months after having this type of surgery could have damaged the site that was re-sectioned or caused another blockage?","Doctor":"Intercourse requires intense activity from your body. The rectus muscles in front of the abdomen need to work strongly which may raise the intra-abdominal pressure. I do not think that the reanastomosis i,e. the joined portion after sectioning, might have been damaged, neither do I think that there is another blockage. Rather, I would say that the healing of the portion is not complete and it would take quite some time to be as strong as the normal portion of intestine. The intense activity of the intercourse was till now undealt with for the reanastomosed site and the increased abdominal pressure has therefore caused the pain.

How long does it take to lose all of the swelling and for that abdominis rectus to heal?","Doctor":"The swelling that you are talking about, seems to be a ganglion which occurs when some fibres of the muscles get torn by accident or due to some other cause. These torn muscle fibres curl up together and form such a structure. If that is the case, although the pain would gradually subside, the swelling might still be there. What it actually is, can be commented upon only after proper examination.

In patients with CP, spine as well as hip problems are common. We have seen pain being there for long time before its source is found. Hip joint stiffness as well as spontaneous dislocation without trauma are common findings in CP. There is a possibility of urinary infection separate from this pain. She will need clinical evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon or pediatrician to find out the exact nature of the problem. Xray of the pelvis and hips and tests on the urine can be ordered based on the exam.Best wishes for speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"I have been having attacks after eating in my middle back.

So a detailed examination and appropriate investigations are necessary to establish a diagnosis of infection.Regarding Plantar fascitis - use of soft heeled foot wear, self massaging the involved area, reducing the body weight & use of analgesic antiinflammatory medications will help. Intractable pain due to plantar fascitis can be effectively dealt with a local steroid injection at times.Hope this information is helpful.

Also, the right side of my stomach feels harder than the left side.","Doctor":"Based on your description, you seem to be suffering from gastritis. If that is the case, you would need to take omeprazole capsule once daily before breakfast for one and a half months. You also need to take small but frequent meals. However, the final diagnosis can be made only after proper examination and I strongly insist that you visit a doctor and get yourself examined.The low grade on and off fever needs to be investigated and is probably unrelated to your abdominal pain. You would need to get it investigated to rule out conditions like tuberculosis which could be a possible cause."},{"Patient":"Several years ago I had back spinal surgery and have numbness in my lower left leg and foot ever since.  Lately, it is progressively more painful.  Lots of tineling in my foot and tightness at my ankle.  It is more painful at nighttime.  Presently, I take Neurontin but is there anything else I can do to ease the uncomfortable feeling 24/7.  Thank You.","Doctor":"HiThank you for your question.From the symptoms you have described you may be developing adjacent segment disease or scar tissue leading to stenosis at the same level. Let's see what these two things are.Adjacent segment disease means increased movement at the vertebrae above and below the level where you had surgery several years ago. This movement or even the growth of scar tissue can lead to stenosis (second diagnosis) which in simple terms is narrowing of the spinal canal that pinches the nerves. I would suggest obtaining a fresh MRI of lumbar spine with and without contrast.Please continue taking neurontin if it helps. Image guided nerve blocks can help this type of neurological pain which will first need MRI for evaluation. Lyrica (pregabalin) is another medication which is helpful but consult a doctor before starting it. Steroids like medrol dose pack can help acute exacerbation of pain. I hope one of these options work for you but if nothing works satisfactorily you may need to see a spine surgeon who handles revision spine cases.Wish you the best and please let me know if I can be of further assistance."},{"Patient":"Hi My name is Jane, I had a lumbar fracture 2wks ago, ER doctor said it is a stable fracture.

The ovaries are responsible for maintaining the hormonal balance of your body. Needless to say that this hormonal balance has been disrupted. This loss of hormonal support is responsible for your weight gain after the surgery. However, for weight gain to occur, the total amount of energy taken in as food needs to be more than the total amount of energy expenditure. So, on one hand, you need to cut down on the amount of food you take in, and on the other, you need to increase your exercise and work output.The tic in the stomach that you are talking about, is probably simple bowel movement or peristaltic movement and you need not be concerned about it.

It should not be used for more than a week or two as it may worsen the condition with prolonged usage.Medicines: Analgesic are needed in the acute phase. Muscle relaxants are essential for relieving muscle spasms once the acute pain subsides. Neurotropic vitamins like METHYLCOBALAMINE (activated Vit B12) or PREGABALIN will help in alleviating the neuropathic pain.Cervical traction: may enlarge the disc space, permitting the prolapse to subside. Intermittent cervical traction for not more than 30 minutes at a time.

The urinary tract extends from the kidneys in the upper posterior abdomen, through the ureters, into the bladder and out through the urethra. What you are talking about is the urethra only. But the infection could extend into all these parts, especially the bladder, and could indeed be the source of your lower abdominal pain.

I was supermom caring for three children, active PTA member and pillar of the community. When my kids were 6,9, and 12 it was imperative that I go back to work. I continued all of my activities ,raising my children relatively alone, working six days a week, and had some back pain which I attributed to lifting. and I ignored it. In 2004, my children were grown, I moved to NJ to be with my now husband. I was working full time and I began to have several serious sciatica attacks. When it became so disabling and painful I saw a spine specialist followed by a spine surgeon. In 2005 I had a fusion which cured the sciatica, however, I still had lower back pain. About three months after the surgery, I fell apart. Diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia my world began to crumble. I had a laminectomy and several steroid injections, epidurals and a neuro stimulator. One year after the stimulator it was removed as it did not work anymore.(removed in Sept. 2011. Since then I cannot stand for more than 5-10 minutes without severe lower back pain, I cannot exert my body for more than 5-10 minutes and I only have relief if I am in bed(most of the time). Unfortunately, to add to my issues, I have been diagnosed with CVID(Common variable Immuno Deficiency for the past two years making it necessary to have IV gamma every four weeks. It is believed that a possible cause was from treatment of severe asthma with heavy steroids. I also have recently been diagnosed with COPD. My rheumatologist has tried three IV treatments to relieve some of the RA pain but unfortunately I suffered anaphalaxis each time. Obviously, I was fortunate to be in the hospital and I came back!(LOL) no too funny. I was treated for several years with morphine time release drugs for my back pain as well as a nerve dissection in my wrist. That being said, I just became so fed up with myself and doctors, that I did not see my spine doctor for seven months(I had been seeing him monthly). My rheumatologist insisted I see my spine doc to try to determine where some of the pain is actually coming from. Finally, I had an MRI last week and saw doctor today. I have the report and disc, and my doc feels I should not have any future surgery, so he will try to give me some nerve blocks while anesthisized in a surgery center. After reading the report, I think I have more bulges, herniations and other issues going on in my back then there are disc!(LOL). I live in NJ, am a 66 year old female, married for the past eight years(2nd marriage) and very lucky to have a great husband who has been doing all of my duties. He retired last year and I would so love to becoming his real partner to share a somewhat healthy lifestyle with.Sorry I have been so wordy, but I felt that I had to describe whatever I was able to. My question is.....finally...... can you help. I read today about endoscopic treatment and it sounded awesome. Not sure if that was the term but I am sure you know what I mean. Thank you so very much for taking the time to read my lengthy letter. Sincerely, Marsha Gonzalez  email-   YYYY@YYYY  phone # 1-917-715-1325 I have noticed that many of the doctors available now are not spine specialists and that is only the type of specialist I would like to hear from. I will be willing to pay for the service but only if I am assured the answer will come from said specialist. Thank you again","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.From your description , I assume that you are concerned more with your back pain (though you have many other health issues).An Endoscopic surgery in the form of discectomy is helpful in cases where there is severe leg pain (shooting pain down the leg along with tingling or numbness). There is no surgery which will provide relief for exclusive back pain.You can go for RADIO FREQUENCY ABLATION, which is said to provide good pain relief in low back ache. The pain relief can last between 6 months to 2 years (maximum) depending upon the case.Hope this information is helpful. Good day"},{"Patient":"My L4/L5 are tore, took 2 years to fine this out. Was giving shots in my back when I was asleep but at that time no one knew the cause of my back pain, had a knee replaced and back started hurting after and 3 years on the knee that still hurts. Dr wants to put stimulation device in my spin to brain     but no other treatment has been offer, I was told with the right treatment it could self heal, shots I took was before I knew what I had.

Thank you charla any help please","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.Based on the description, I assume that you could be suffering from Lumbar disc disease along with degenerative changes in the spine causing you back pain.If you are exclusively having backpain without pain in the leg (shooting pain with tingling & numbness), then there is no surgical management. An aggressive physiotherapy for strengthening the paravertebral muscles is necessary. Also you can try RADIO FREQUENCY ABLATION , which is said to provide good pain relief in low back ache cases.Hope this information is helpful.

However, you do seem to be in a lot of pain. Therefore, I suggest paracetamol and ibuprofen for this. Rest your back if the pain is severe when you move.

The pain at the bottom center of the rib cage on the left side could be due to a renal infection or a stone if the pain does not seem to be muscular in nature.

I need to inform you that she was playing softball all weekend and at app. 4 p.m yesterday got hit by a pitch in that same area. She had nonpain last night , but about 2 hrs. ago started complaining of the pain. Upon examination I discovered a good sized bruise just to the left of her pain area ( between left love handle and belly button. Could these be related?She is not nauseated or vomiting, just sharp pains, especially when she moves. Her pain tolerance is pretty high.","Doctor":"I think that your findings are directly related to the abdominal pain that you are talking about. The ball hitting her lower left abdomen has bruised the outer part, but has also strained the muscles lying underneath. As a result, the muscles of that region of the abdominal wall are probably going into spasm from time to time and hence causing the pain. In such a case, no nausea or vomiting is likely to be present as in her case.You may give her hot compress over the area and also some muscle relaxant tablet like myospaz forte twice a day for around three days and see if she gets relieved.However, I would insist on getting her examined by a doctor and if required get an ultrasound of the abdomen done to be sure that nothing else is wrong."},{"Patient":"hi I am 43 yrs old and 155 lbs I am so tired everyday I get home from work I have to lay down.

A physical examination is necessary to find out the exact cause.

During the speculum examination, it is natural for the muscles of the area to get strained and hence localised muscle spasm is a possible cause of the pain that you are talking about.Another probability is that the ovarian hyperstimulation that is required for such a procedure might be a possible cause of such a pain.

You are suffering from what we call the industrial back ache. The first step is to ensure that you maintain an appropriate posture while working on the computer. Take frequent stretch breaks and drink lots of water. Discontinue using pillow while sleeping straight. Do not lift heavy objects, especially after bending down.

Read it and understood the problem of the Doctors treating you and of yours. From the clinical history your problem looks to an appendicitis with complication of an appendicular mass or abscess. The symptoms fit very well. A cautious surgeon would always wait till the signs and symptoms are settled as surgery at such a time is difficult, dangerous, and too messy and can cause more complications. This may be the reason for not operating upon you at the moment. The best course of action is as follows:First of all to get a CT scan of the abdomen to determine the exact pathology you have. Secondly, o continue the treatment of antibiotics, probiotic, metronidazole, symptomatic and supportive if it is solving the problems. It take about 1 to 3 weeks for the problem to get settled.Thirdly , a definite surgery can be planned after 6 weeks, as by this time the lump is resolved and you can be operated with least possible complications. Fourthly- you may need an urgent surgery if there is an abscess which is not resolving by the medical management.So please discuss this with the General Surgeon who is treating you and your work will be done appropriately.IF He is not listening , you can always take a second opinion and shift to another hospital.

Your description of the pain suggests to me that you should be assessed by a doctor and a more detailed history taken. There is a possibility this may be a pulled muscle in your chest but you didn't get any relief from Aleve.

A child of nine and half usually do not get muscle cramps, so there has to a definite reason for the pain after workout.You have given a history of hernia, but not mentioned whether it is operated or not. This can be a reason for the pain in abdomen and vomiting. If the hernia is not operated, your son might be getting obstruction in the hernia that is causing the pain. Another reason can be a testicular torsion, as this can easily happen when a child has a congenital hernia. There can be another reason of having either the intra-abdominal lymph nodes or something like appendicitis that has got reactivated and causing the symptoms. I would suggest you the following as your son is just nine and half years old::First of all get an opinion of the Pediatric Surgeon ASAP.Get blood and urine.Ultrasonography and color doppler of the scrotum and abdomen..A clinical examination and its correlation with the complaints can give a diagnosis.

Sometimes if bacteria enter the operated area and the medicines are not strong enough to fight them, the bacteria start multiplying and enter the blood stream. This will cause fever and fatigue as explained by you.Right now you need to get the pus from the back swelling cultured and evaluated for sensitivity towards any particular antibiotics,. This report can be read by your doctor and then they will prescribe required antibiotics. An anti fever and pain killer medication can be taken for the fever and pain.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have a lot of back pain and was prescribed Cyclobenzaprine.

A spermatocele is a swelling of the duct of testis and contains watery fluid containing sperms. The pathology report that mentioned that the growth is benign, will also have details of what it could really be. It could be a hydrocele which is accumulation of fluids around a testicle due to certain portions of a duct not closing (which is an embryonic structure that otherwise closes and gets cut off). Hydroceles are fairly common but not generally painful. It could be other things like epididymoorchitis or certain other painful conditions like torsion of testis but it is really hard to comment without looking at the pathology report and without examining."},{"Patient":"Hi,  I have rosacia and my dr had me take tetracycline for 2 months.

Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve — which branches from your lower back through your hips and buttocks and down each leg. Typically, sciatica affects only one side of your body. Although the pain associated with sciatica can be severe, most cases resolve with just conservative treatments in a few weeks.MRI is needed to establish the cause of sciatica, so that appropriate treatment can be prescribed. Sciatica do respond well to bed rest and analgesics (pain killer) and is right mode of treatment. The definitive treatment depends upon the cause of sciatica. I would suggest you to consult an orthopediac surgeon who may order MRI to determine cause of sciatica (level and degree in case of disc herniation) and may suggest other mode of treatment. After initial few days of bed rest, you needs physiotherapy (exercises).Hope this will helps you. Feel free to ask me if you have any further queries. Wish you good health.

This has been going on for 4 days now and it seems even worse today.  it hurts when he tries to take in a deep breath or sneezes etc.  today he is running a fever and is having even more stiffness and pain.  he took the mobic last night and again this morning.  he says his jaws Could this be pleurasy?  Would that have shown on an xray?  Should he go back to the ER tonight?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for using healthcare magicIt is unlikely that muscle related pain would cause a fever, there may be a slight increase in warmth in the muscles affected but it should not cause a fever.This makes it less likely to be only muscle strain or trauma.Pleurisy is inflammation of the lining (pleura ) of the lung, it would present on pain that is worse on taking a deep breath. There are different causes such as trauma, infection, pulmonary embolism, caused by a side effect of medication, due to autoimmune disease, heart disease, pneumonia.The changes on xray would depend on the cause of the pleurisy.In light of his fever and the fact that the pain is not relieved by his medication , you should consider going back to a doctor for reassessment.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I have a very painful pain right in the middle of my abdomen.

Here hyperacidity causes the acid to regurgitate into the lower part of esophagus leading to the pain that you are talking about. It may be caused due to stress or prolonged gap between meals.

A recent MRI suggests a compression fracture in L5. It's been suggested that I may have Osteoporosis. There is no family history of this. I am 54 years old and had a hysterectomy in 2002. I've had chronic sinus allergies and have taken Rhinocort or some form of corticosteroid for over 20 years. I started using Vivelle Dot last October. Is it possible that the bone problems I am experiencing are related to the medications I'm taking? Also what are the non-surgical treatments for this back pain.

Chronic pain, no sleep and no exercise!!","Doctor":"Hello friend,Osteoporosis and compression fracture are common in people with poor Calcium  content or Vit. D. Try to improve your calcium intake and expose to sun more than your usual exposures. Your back ache may be associated with your psychological conflicts which remain unresolved. Your sleeplessness and the poor spirits show that. You can analyse them and share them with an expert Homoeopathic physician. Homoeopathy considers the mind and body as equally important both in health and in sickness.I cannot say that the drugs you are taking are harmless. Therefore try to avoid all the chemical drugs and improve your nutritional status. Your diagnosis is not to encourage you to abstain from exercises or to remain confined to your room. You should not lose your heart. Try to be positive. Homoeopathy is a safe and simple method of treatment for rapid and permanent cure for your problems. 54 years is not an age for retiring. Your genetic traits, which made you sick prematurely,  will be studied by an expert Homoeopathic physician and he will prescribe for YOU your genetic constitutional remedy.Keep your spirits high. Be positive.With best wishes, Dr. C. J. Varghese"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I've been experiencing lower back pain in a morning when I get out of bed.

These are aimed to either coinfrim or rule out acute PID or determine another cause.If acute PID is the cause, then your doctor might decide to hospitalize you depending on the gravity for IV antibiotics or simply provide you with oral antibiotics for home-use, this in combination with appropriate antiinflammatory medication.

The Ophthalmologist put me on 800mg of acyclovir for a maintenance dose now.  I am having abdominal pain and blood in my stools now.  I have had outbreaks if not on acyclovir.  Not sure what to do.  I have not had a shingles shot.","Doctor":"Acyclovir is known to cause abdominal pains. Talk to your doctor about modification of the dose or for addition of certain anti-hyperacidity medicines like pantoprazole. However, it is unlikely to cause the bloody stools. Rather it is more likely that you have got a bacterial infection along. The infection needs to be treated with antibiotics. Please get a stool routine microscopy test done and visit your doctor with the report. Based on that he will be able to administer proper antibiotics which are essential in such a case. Take Oral rehydration solution (ORS) to avoid dehydration.The episode is unlikely to be related to shingles."},{"Patient":"My doctor just put me on Proair HFA  a couple days ago and I started having severe pain from my lower back down to the bottoms of my feet.

Your opinion would be appreciated. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM.Thank you for your query.I have gone through your query, and would like to start of by speaking about your SPD (symphysis pubis dysfunction). The only reason why most women are diagnosed with SPD during pregnancy is because the pelvis is directly involved with birth.But SPD can present in women who are not pregnant as well, this is mainly because SPD involves a misalignment of the pelvis, due to which it can put pressure on surrounding structures, especially the spinal cord, which is very sensitive and can easily result in pain (even severe at times).I highly doubt this could be related to cancer. But for your satisfaction, why don't you go ahead with an ultrasound of the pelvis and abdomen and a transvaginal ultrasound (TVS), which will help in superficial suspicion of any such abnormalities. You can also follow this up with an x-ray of the lumbar spine and pelvis, which will ensure that the position of your pelvis is what is causing your presentation.Do not worry, I can understand your anxiety, but once SPD is confirmed as the cause, wearing lumbar and pelvic support belts will surely help you, along with some help from a physiotherapist.

In July 2004, i had a work related injury where i went air born off a flight of stairs! To which it caused me to come crashing down on the stairs, hitting my back in two(2) places before coming too a stop! I landed on the 3rd stair 1st,  hitting my right butt check(2-3inches from my tail bone)damaging my S.nerve, which my upper body flung right back causing me to take another stair right under my right shoulder blade! I didnt break one bone, i was just badly bruised so i thought and so did my employer! I was put on modified hours until there was medical proof that something was diffently wrong in my lower/upper back! I had a MRI in March 2005 then i seen a Neuro surguan on May11 2005, for him too tell me that i need surgury&his reasoning for do it!! So i sat their by myself for a few minutes too take this all in and i had too make a big dession at that time all by myself  it was hard to do! But i ended up signing the papers to go ahead & proceed with the surgury, when i asked the doctor when l would be going to have surgury he said maybe in two months or so as he could not give me a date at the time of my appointment!! I then STOOD UP said thank you too the Doctor and that i will see him when the day comes for me to have surgury or before if need be!! The Doctor said yes to my last comment that is when i knew my appointment was done so i WALKED OUT of his office&went home. I stopped work fully on May 13 2005, by my family Doctor until i had my surgury on my back, I woke up on May 27 shortly after 7a.m.but how my body was feeling at the time!my mind then told me that i was still sleeping&that i was just dreaming!!!!YA RIGHT, i was DREAMING!!!!As they say,\\"DREAMS DO COME TRUE\\", l woke up fully when i went too roll over in my bed and only my upper body from the waist up seemed to beable too move or have any feeling it!! I layed myself back down on to my back and pulled the blankets off myself,with my left hand side being on the edge of the bed(me being LH)i quitley i hit myself in my left leg and felt nothing! Now l am fully awake&starting too get alittle scared, i would like too say that i am sorry for what l am about to say too you, as l get alittle bit embrassed talking about it!! Well here l go i layed back down &put my hand into my p.j.bottoms to grab my privates felt nothing, i also grab a handful of hair&pulled up and felt nothing except for my hair against the palm of my hand from holding on to my privates at the time!!! Then i took one of my hands(can\\"t remember at his time which one i used)! I was able to get my hand partly under one of my butt cheeks to discover by feeling my p.j.\\"S(with my hand)they were wet, i pinched myself& felt nothing!! I then pulled myself up on the bed to put me into a sitting position on the bed, and i as was doing this my pj bottoms just happened to came off in the prossess of me trying too sit up on the bed!! Now that l am sitting up l reached forward to grab my pajamies,Before i was able to look at my pj\\"s fully, i was 50% sure that the wetness that i felt the 1st time with my hand is that i had a accident in my sleep(I PISSED MYSELF)!! Oh boy was i right about that but to my surprise i had also lost control of my bowels through-out the night as well!!!! I was going to get out of bed to clean myself up&the bed but my legs would not swing out of the bed, i would have to lift my legs out of the bed myself if i wanted to get up and out of the bed! I started to scream,cry&yell for help! l was taken to the hospitial where i had my C4 and C6 both removed &replaced with surgical metal and their is a small hole in my thoraic spine from T5-T11.i was walking after the surgury 2005 up until recently.At this time i am unable to walk without using any assitance to get around,i am not able to walk up or down stairs,i can not stand still without losing my balance,trouble lifting my legs/feet up high enough to get into/out of the tub or when i am trying to walk!!

On May 15th 2013 i had a Dr.\\"s appointment to which i WALKED into on my own 2 feet with no one help from no one or any kind of walking aid!!!! Besides being a normal monthly Doctor's app.i felt normal as usual, except i knew that i had a nasel infection the week before, i called to ask for something to be called in for me to the pharmacy(a antibiotic)and l also told him that my lower back& my S-nerve were causing me alot of pain when i try too walk or try and do a flight of stairs!!!! In order for me to go up a flight of stairs(hand free)&the safest is on my hand&knees(can't raise my legs/ feet that high enough) or weight bare on it at all even using the handrail  to try and get up very PAINFUL for me too do!!!

Read your history and understood your problem.The most probable reason for such of pain in left side of abdomen which gets intensified while passing urine and relieved by urine flow can be :Diverticulum of the urinary bladder.Reflux of the urine from the bladder to the left lower ureter.Stone in the left ureter.This can be easily diagnosed by:Routine blood and urine work-up.Ultrasonography of the abdomen and cysto-urethroscopy helps for the diagnosis. Muctirating cystourethrogram under Fluoroscope again can be of a help to see for the dynamics of urination and any anatomical defect. The treatment will depend upon the findings on investigations , which may be a surgical intervention.Wishing you all the best for early diagnosis and proper treatment ."},{"Patient":"I have a history of back problems and reoccurring.

The swelling is somewhat painful and Dead Sea salt baths or a heating pad help, but I'm worried because both sides still feel firm. I cannot get to a doctor for 48 hours because of the storm- what do I do, what foods are safe to consume, and is there anything else I can try OTC?","Doctor":"It is not clear from the details whether the swelling is a localised one or is it abdominal distention due to bloating. To me, it seems more like the latter as you mention irregular bowel habits. There is no restriction about the food intake but it is preferrable to avoid junk food. Try taking a high fibre diet as well as fibre supplements like isabgol alongside your dinner. Alternatively you may also use lactulose syrup 2 teaspoonfuls once or twice and day and see if you get relief. I would still insist that you remain in follow up of a doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi, 4 years ago I had a saddle PE, been on warfarin and tow bp meds since then. About 2 months ago I was working pretty hard when the back of my neck all of a sudden felt like it was on fire as was the back of my head.My neck stayed tight and swollen up unitl 4 days ago when abuot 4 am I felt things move in my neck and it was like I could feel warmer water going through my whole body, I esp noticed it in my legs.I have been myself since then, but during that time I lost days, could not articulate well and at times could not, had to get wifes help to attach pictures to a email, and ive been a part time computer repair person.Every time I wanted to put somehitng in microwave I tried the cabinet next to it. The neck pain and the odd feeling in the back of my head was worse then the pain in my lower calf that ended with me going 4 days in a Denver cicu, on hep, the lovinox then rat poison. My last trip to the hospital cost me 98k out of pocket, I made it though this and seem ok, but im so so worried. I have blown veins in my legs, cold feet all the time, my dad stroked out at 53, im 45. Ive lived life at 110mph all the time, never stop.Now my neck is not swollen or tight since the feeling of ??? moving. Just like my PE, the day after it happened my calf was normal, but they did find little clots in the ultrasound. Luckly I can actually throw up lung material, about 3 years after my PE it took a lot but I coughed up what looked like a white thing and the only pic that matched on the web was a bronch cast???? But after that deal I could breath as good as before.Now its just random lil clots I pass and my lungs get ride of them, but this last deal with the burning up the back of my neck and head on fore has me very concerned, I was not myself for over six weeks.I know I should of went to the ER but cant afford another 100k or more bill.now my neck is back to normal, it cracks and grinds in my ears when I move it, I used to support 75 pound sheets of material with my head while moving them when I was building new homes. But mainly Im concerned about the last deal with my neck/head that took six weeks to seem to get back to normalThanks for any input you might have, I got to my GP in 8 days, he says I cant make clots on warrarin???Help!  Thanks, Mark B","Doctor":"With  warfarin  there  can  be  no  clots.  Your  neck  episode  may  be  due  to  spondylitis  which  is  curable.  Just  do  neck  movement  exercises in  all directions  for  10 minutes  to  initiate  muscles.  Gradually  do  isometric  neck exercises  in  which  you hold  the  movement  of  neck  by  your  hands  putting  a  resistance  in  all  directions  .

Lower back pain can arise due to a lot of causes and we need to find out the cause before instituting appropriate treatment.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, after a personal physical examination of your abdomen, I would have advised you not to eat anything from outside as intestinal infections could creep in , and also the intestinal mucosa might be hyper sensitive to some of the constituents of the outside food causing such symptoms of yours for such a long period. Apart from this,  I would also advise you for a routine stool test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive. In addition, I would advise you for an ultrasound of whole abdomen to rule out any intra abdominal pathology and deal with it accordingly. Till the tests were done,  I would advise you for an anti spasmodic along with a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I m 5 9 115 lbs so when i push or feel my belly i feel a very firm ball or coil. Another factor is due to me having M.S. I also have chronic urinary tract infections and currently have one.

Read your history about tampon and MS and the problems now you are suffering from.If the tampon is sterile, it may not cause a big problem. This might have caused a minor infection. The smell in fact can be due to infection, and you already have been under tablet Cipro. This should take care of both the infections.I would advise further :Get an infection by a Gynecologist done for an internal examination, send the swab from vagina for gram staining and culture and sensitivity. Add on metronidazole and probiotis as they help to heal the vaginits and urinary tract too. The cause of distension and pain in the left lower abdomen can be due to :PID.Salpingitis orTO mass.

For hemochromatosis I had 8 times bloodletting within 3,5 months. It wasn't nice, I didn't feel great. Than I started with erytrocytafereses, a double doses in one time, a week later my terrible back pain suffering started. this was early july 2012. in september an Xray showed an inflammation of my right sacra-ilium. the MRI confirmed the inflammation. I was on naxopren 500mg 2 times a day since july 2012 and also 4 times paracetamol 1000mg. HLA b27 pos. two weeks before the backpain started I had a slip-up twice with my right leg. and it did hurt. years ago I had dislocated sacro joints, my physiotherapist did fix that each time. this time when the hurting started I couldn't lift up my leg, couldn't lay down or sit. My osteopath did help me en located the joint and some thoracle vertebras. but the pain remained. My reumatologist gave me Arcoxia but I did feel much sicker with these medicine,  back on naxopren and than she gave me fenylbutazon, but that was even harder than the arcoxia. so in january I was allowed to start with Simponi, 1 doses each month. because of the monthly afereses I have to take the Simponi right after that. the combination is very hard. I also get paronychia on both hands, it hurts very much, my nails do come of, headache, nauseous, I had a terrifying heartstop at night and also spontaneous tinnitus after the second injection. I really don't want to take this medicine again, in those two months the pain still stayed the same. So, as for what they say about Bechterew, keep on moving, don't lay down, is not for me, each and every step is so hurtful and when I lay down the pain is reducing. and my back is less hurting. I don't wake up at night from pain. Since the bloodletting I do have a good night rest (I didn't have a good sleep since about 13 years), but unfortunately still tired through the day. 4 weeks ago I decided to take out the Mirena device, (this was my third, so I have had Mirena devices for 14 years now) I feel like another woman. I have more endurance, sometimes less tired, my skin is better, but the pain is still here. But my back is more flexible, i can reach the floor and i can walk straight up, so I do think this is great. My theory is that the Mirena causes a sterile inflammation in the uterus and this can get my immuunsystem on the run. but now I ask you, can you think with me? what can i do now. Next week I have to go to my reumatologist. I wish there was someone who has the brains for the 3 illnesses together. so what is the best treatment for me, thinking of the combinations of the illnesses. Is there a specialist who has the knowlegde of those 3 illnesses. I hope to hear from you. thank you in advance. Dorine","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us.

The not -so -severe pain in abdomen, feeling of incomplete evacuation and the need to go for bathroom again and again indicates that you are suffering from a sort of Entero-colitis.This may also give rise to nausea and should be investigated properly. I would advise blood, urine and stool tests, Ultrasonography and Colonoscopy. This will help in a diagnosis. CT scan of the abdomen may be done to confirm the clinical and pathological examinations. A course of antibiotic and metronidazole should help in a normal way."},{"Patient":"I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and was born with scoliosis.

All pains have been coming and going.  At times I find the pains are completely gone.  Physical exertion does not seem to have any effect or increase pain.  In some cases it has made the pain ease.  I find it bothers me the most when I'm relaxing or lying down.  I have been visiting the chiropractor for the last 2 weeks to relieve back pain which for all visits, except the last has relieved the pain completely for at least a day, which leads me to believe that it could be simply a pinched nerve or misaligned rib.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query. From description it seems to be due to pinched nerve or muscle spasm. Physiotherapy in form of neck and back exercises will be helpful in your case. Doing hot fomatation and applying muscle relaxant gel will be helpful to reduce the pain and spasm. If chest and arm pain associated with sweating and restlessness, get it evaluated to rule out any cardiac cause. Hope this will helps you.

But, you have L5-S1 disc extrusion with migration and compression of nerve root which is significant. If you dont have any radicular symptoms (pain from back going down upto toes), then only conservative management is advisable as follows : - Rest with analgesics / muscle relaxants - Methylcobalamine preparations - avoiding bending & jerky movements ( riding a two wheeler ) -  avoid lifting heavy weights - intermittant pelvic traction - using lumbar back support during prolonged sitting. If all the measures fail to provide relief and you have severe radicular symtoms, then surgical intervention may be needed. Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I was rear ended.

(kidney, ureter, bladder and appendix etc.,) 2) If USG is normal, straight away do MRI Lumbar spines with Lumbo Sacral joint. This will reveal any spinal pathology. 3) Routine blood test for WBC, DC, ESR, HB, MX, HIV, sugar, Urea and Creatinine, along with ECG, BP and Lipid profile if indicated.

The fact that the discomfort on the right mid abdominal wall occurs when you move in a certain way, laugh suggests that you have  due to some reason strained your abdominal wall muscles on the right side. It could have happened while lifting something heavy, or even while just stretching your body. With rest and not straining your abdominal wall muscles, like doing any exercise, lifting something heavy, laughing hard, and the such, the muscles will get rest and in a week to ten days or so you should be relieved of this pain.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.The intensity of your pain specially with a history of gall stone disease in the past calls for an urgent ultrasound of abdomen to rule out any stone in the common bile duct. Also the state of pancreas would have to be assessed specially if you consume alcoholic beverages. If I were your doctor, I would have preferred first a physical examination of your abdomen, followed by an ultrasound of abdomen, and blood tests like complete blood count, a serum amylase, a serum lipase, and a liver function test. Also I would suggest you not to eat from outside if you do. Till then I would advise you for a proton pump inhibitor along with a probitic, and an anti spasmodic drug for a symptomatic relief. Further management would depend on the reports of investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.With a history of diverticulosis and the present abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, I would presume it to be an attack of diverticulitis (bacterial infection of the diverticula) and start a bland diet regimen, a broad spectrum antibiotic along with an anearobic coverage, an anti inflammatory and a proton pump inhibitor with a probiotic. This might take a few days for your symptoms to improve, and a close watch on the symptoms with physical findings on examination of the abdomen would be required. In case there was no relief or if the symptoms increase in intensity, I would advise you to report to an ER of the nearest hospital for a possible admission and putting you on nil orally, and IV antibiotics and other related drugs. Further management would depend on the type of response obtained on the above regimen.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Its fine when I sit but when I walk or lay it begins to cause discomfort.

I want to ask that is taking pain killers safe in the long run?? During my periods i usually lose my apetitte and energy.","Doctor":"This is common in females. These symptoms happen due to hormonal changes. There is no harm in taking pain medicine for short period. Pain killers for weeks to months is not advisable. I would suggest to consult a gynecologist and rule out any serious issues related to uterus such as uterine fibroid or endometriosis. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi,Three days ago I had severe back pain while I was sitting on the floor for long time (usually I don’t sit on the floor), I tried to get up to the sofa and sat there and I started feeling heavy giddiness and I thought I should go to the outside to take some fresh air and when I walked I passed out for may be 1 or two mins.After that I had problem in my lower back and was not able to bend, when on bed I was not able to move my body for turning at the sides.Second day it improved and third day it improved even further but still I am not able to bend enough to tie my shoes.Also I am feeling light headed since this incident, which I am more worried about.I checked by BP yesterday and it was 144/89.I have taken appointment  with doctor which is after one week, but I am wondering it should be OK to wait this long.","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM. Back muscle sprain is the most common reason for back pain. However heavy giddiness and passed out is little concerning. please consult a physician and get thorough check up. You may wait for a week provided you are feeling better and dont get similar episodes in coming days. I would suggest although you are getting better but still visit the doctor. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi. My 6-year old daughter was crouching when a playmate pushed her hard, so my daughter fell on her lower back, hitting a concrete block in the process. When she got home, a bruise in the affected area is already visible. She said it hurts so much then she told me that she feels like vomiting. And vomit she did. It happened 2 times, with an interval of about 10 minutes. I'm keeping an eye on her, see if there's going to be another vomiting episode. I'm worried that maybe, she had a very serious fall. Thank you for your help, Aileen Roque","Doctor":"thanks for writing to us. I would suggest to consult ER. please rule out any abdominal injury? where is the bruise? is it in the lateral flanks? Back injury usually does not cause vomiting. Check her pulse and blood pressure. Keep a close watch and if still feeling nauseated with increased heart rate then get her to ER as quickly.

BUT IT,S A LITTLE CURVE ON MY BACK BONE FROM DOWNWARDS.SO,  IT WILL  CORRECT LIKE A ORIGINAL SHAPE..?? SIR OR IT,S A SERIOUS PROBLEM","Doctor":"Thanks for writing to us. I understand that you have been told about scoliosis. It could be simple scoliosis due to muscle spasm or real scoliosis curve where you have rotated vertebrae. If its a small curve then nothing to worry. Regular back muscle stretching and exercise will help. However if you have persistent significant back pain then I would suggest to get MRI spine to know more about the disc condition and facet arthritis. If its due to muscle spasm then it will be back to normal spine however if it is real scoliosis curve then it will remain like that or may worsen a little more with increasing age.

I have many problems with my lower back, herniated discs, degeneration, fibromyalgia etc. Had a new mri and not sure what it all means. *Sterile reactive bony end-plate changes*Neutral foraman and lateral recesses with abutment of the descending s 1 nerve roots bilaterally. *concentric protrusion with annular rentNo idea what all this means","Doctor":"Thanks for writing to us. Degenerative changes means age related wear and tear in the spine. End plate changes means body's response to the wear and tear by forming new bone such as osteophytes and sclerotic end plates. Also the spine ligaments gets hypertrophied which further compromise the space for the nerves. Concentric protrusion is type of disc prolapse and annular tear means tear in the outer covering of the disc and this is always painful. With this finding, we treat patient with medicine and physiotherapy.

Not sure what I can take to help the pain or what it is causing it","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Noted the history and understood your concerns.Pain in abdomen n the top for the last few weeks along with pain radiating to the back can be due to the following reasons:Gastric ulcer on the posterior wall.Pancreatitis.Or rarely the lymph node mass or some problem in any of the retro-peritoneal structures of abdomen.I would advise you the following in such a situation:Get the clinical evaluation by a Gastroenterologist.Upper GI Endoscopy to rule out gastric and acidity related problems.CT can of the abdomen to see for the pancreas and other structures.Relevant tests of blood, urine and stool.Get started on appropriate medications as advised. PPI like Pantoprazole, antispasmodics and painkillers as needed.

This might have caused the blockage of the another tube.The polycystic ovaries do not cause blockage of the tubes.Tuberculosis may be the cause of pain in abdomen.I would advise first to get a proper diagnosis of the causes of all the symptoms by proper investigations and treatment.I would advise the following in such a patient:Blood, urine , stool tests.Gold Quantiferon test for TBCT scan of the abdomen.Evaluate for the cause, get a treatment first on the medical basis and once the problem is solved her remaining ovary and tube can be saved.Now-a-days the treatment of tuberculosis is ambulatory, meaning there is no need for admission. Once the medical therapy is completed and the patient recovered we can always go inside the abdomen and do a small surgery to open up the blocked tube.This can very well be tried as just removing the other tube and ovary your granddaughter will never be able to have natural pregnancy. Please discuss this with your Gastroenterologist and Gynecologist. This has to be a multi-disciplinary approach as it is related to life of a patient. You will certainly get the best results in a way I explained."},{"Patient":"I have been previously diagnosed with DJD, IVDS, Sciatica in left lower extremity.

Was vomiting and could not lay still.  They did labs and found my white cell count up. Did a CT scan with contrast to check for kidney stones but was OK. Did see that my bowels were compacted. They had to give me percacet for pain several times and fenergan for nausea cause I continued to vomit.  Decided I was constipated and told me to go home and take an enema and drink Magnesium citrate and if not better in 12 hrs come back.  Before I got to the store to buy the meds, I was in so much pain I had to go back to the ER.  They had already ran a bag of IV fluids but I was dehydrated after that and I had to have more pain meds, this time morphine.  They did a vaginal ultrasound to check ovaries and they said left was OK and couldn't find the right one.  I am 52 and had a hysterectomy about 20 yrs ago. Not sure if they took that ovary or not.  I also had a rectal prolapse surgery about 15 yrs ago and they removed 18 inches of my colon because it was twisted.  I have Crest Syndrome and am on medication for that.  The pain subsided enough for me to go home and I did the enema and drank the Mag citrate.  Didn't get much results.  Sunday morning around 5 am I did have a runny stool and quite a bit of it.  The pain seemed better but not completely gone.  I had Tylenol 3 with codeine and took that Sat nite and Sun nite for pain.

There is a possibility of complications with pregnancy which could definitely affect your marriage and married life in the future. In case of abdominal tuberculosis, fibrosis and adhesions could occur which could entangle the fallopian tubes and thereby creating problems with subsequent pregnancy.

Anyway, about a month ago I noticed a quater sized bruise a little to the right side of my right dimple, it wasn't really painfull or anything that I noticed, it eventually went away, but over the past few weeks I have noticed a knot under the surface that has shown up in the same area, it only hurts a little if I hit it or lay on it, what could this be and any suggestions on ways to treat it or get it to go away? Oh, and I am a dancer, and I do roll on a hard surface over this area quite a bit, not sure if that makes any difference or not. However, the more I roll on it or anything, It swells quite a bit and gets really hot to the touch.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome at HCM. It will be my pleasure to help you. The dimples which are present at your lower back are just the normal land mark of our joint which is known as sacro iliac joint-  This is present in normal person. The knot which is present near by this looks to be a inflammaed connective tissue & at this stage better termed as FIBROSITIS.In your case this may be due to your dance & rolling habit.Most probably this had lead to injury at this area which had healed with fibrous tissue. You should not bother about this & should consult to a orthopedic doctor for this. Your doctor may give you a good anti inflammatory analgesic & may use a local steroid injection to give you relief. Hope this will help you Wish you a happy & healthy life."},{"Patient":"Hi! I'm a healthy female 15 year old and i was wondering if it's normal for me to be experiencing extreme pain in my lower back? Based on my observations, there is a small lump about 3\\" in diameter on the area where i feel extreme shooting pains. Could it simply be because of carrying heavy nap sacks to school or the long hours of sitting at a ninety degree position? If so, could this lead to anything dangerous?

After severe low right abnormal and low right back pain, I have been diagnosed with ovarian cysts.  I had an ultrasound and MRI to confirm.  During the MRI, they also detected gallstones.  I am 48 years old, physically fit, I'm 5' 1\\" and weigh about 105  pounds.  After the tests, I had a physical exam with a Gyne and was told the pain was caused from my right ovary attaching itself to my body as well as my colon and I would need surgery.  Is there any other possibilities and how probable is this?  My regular Doc retired and it's very difficult to find a Doc that will really take the time to hear me, as they are all trying to keep their 15 minute appointment to less than 15 minutes.  I  really would like to know where to go to find out why I am having such pain in my lower right back.","Doctor":"It depends on how big are the ovarian cyst - bigger the cysts > 4cm usually - if not treated with surgical removal there is complication of cyst getting twisted / rupture inside - which is considered as acute emergency Site of pain in lower part of abdomen is due to findings of ovarian cyst on MRI as gall stone pain is more so in upper part of tummy. Following any abdominal operation - chances of adhesions will increase & that is what has probably happened having said that adhesions can't be diagnosed 100% by clinical examination as best way to diagnose & treat adhesions ( adhesiolysis ) is by laparoscopy Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi 37 yr old husband admitted for acute renal failure, presented with severe back pain complaining of pain radiating to abdomen and down to testicles.

I am very aware of the shape of my back and this can prevent me from wearing certain clothes and feeling confident as some people at school can point it out. I also have a very achey back which sometimes hurts so much-sometimes when I bend my back can feel like it's locking and standing back up is nearly impossible. Sometimes a heat pack works but I am quite scared about my future!","Doctor":"Hi, Scoliosis is an abnormal curve of the spine or back bone. In most cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown [ idiopathic ]. There are several types of scoliosis based on the cause and age when the curve develops. It is more common in girls than boys. It can be seen at any age, but it is most common in those over 10 years of age. Depending on the severity of the curve and the risk for it getting worse, scoliosis can be treated with observation, bracing or surgery."},{"Patient":"I am waiting for my insurance to be active before I can get an MRI that has been recommended but a possibility is that I have a bulging disc & was wondering if this could cause severe rib pain? I've been in pain everyday since about December and it is getting worse now with sharp pains in ribs. Guess I just want to know if it would only be the disc causing everything or if I might have to be concerned with more. Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi, Based from the information provided it seems like the \\"DISK PROLAPSE\\" MRI is needed to check the space between two spines and any prolapse of disk can be detected. Now their is the narrow passage from which nerves passes in and out of the spinal cord, and the bones knows as spine are supported by spongy matter known as DISKS, now the prolapse of such disk will decrease the space for the nerve exiting out and in turn will compress nerve, such compression is cause of the pain you are suffering from and the nerve will case pain sensation where it passes to supply the part of body such as ribs. So yes the sharp rib pain is from the compression of the nerves due to \\"DISK PROLAPSE/ bulging\\" Hope it clears the understanding of the process.

The stools is small, but there is a lot of creamy coloured froth. I'm 30 yr old male, no previous medical history of note. Any advice?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query. Read your history and understood your problems.You have small stools with creamy colored froth. You also have mild pain in abdomen. The pain intensifies when you try at the toilet. Such an history is seen in patients suffering from Colitis. This may be more due to amoebic colitis as it gives mild pain which increases on passing stool, has creamy froth. There can be a super-added bacterial infection too. I would advise you the following:First of all take a course of an antibiotic and Metronidazole in appropriate dosage under a Doctor's prescription; take probiotics and multivitamins for full 5 day course. See the results. If the problem is settled nothing more needs to be done except to take care to have home-made fresh food and sterilized water - boiled for 20 minutes and cooled .If the problem persists I would advise you to undergo tests of blood- routine and sugar, urine and stool tests, an ultrasonography and colonoscopy.

From description it seems he might be suffering from siatica. Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve — which branches from your lower back through  hips and buttocks and down each leg. Although the pain associated with sciatica can be severe, most cases resolve with just conservative treatments in a few weeks. MRI is needed to establish the cause of sciatica, so that appropriate treatment can be prescribed. Sciatica do respond well to bed rest and analgesics (pain killer) and is right mode of treatment. The definitive treatment depends upon the cause of sciatica. I would suggest him to consult an orthopediac surgeon who may order MRI to determine cause of sciatica (level and degree in case of disc herniation) and may suggest other mode of treatment. After initial few days of bed rest, he needs physiotherapy (exercises). Hope this helps you. Wishing you good health... Regards. Dr Saurabh Gupta.

In this situation we need to see the site of impact of your lower back area for any local swelling, change in skin colour, any bruising. If all of this is present then it is only a localised injury of your back muscles. Also since the pain is radiating into your leg the chances of back muscles spasms and inflammation are more. Chances of damage to your kidney are less but if you really want to be sure of it then an ultrasonography of whole abdomen will help you in doing that as it shows kidneys clearly. If the pain is due to previous reason of muscle injury(soft tissue injury) then localised hot water fomentation & rest should help you. Or you can take the help of your orthopedic specialist in this case.

During the week she has experienced purpura spots and ematomas for the first days (now disappearing), then intermittent swallowing of joints on a daily basis, ankles first, then wrists, then feet, then knees, then ankles again. The urine analisis which we do every morning are fine, but today she complained about abdominal pain in the right side identifiable just under the liver region (which we have been told may be dangerous hence the urine analisis). She has good appetite and no signs of vomiting or stomac pain. Should we take her again to hospital and see a paediatrician or should we just wait? Regards.","Doctor":"HSP or Henoch–Schönlein purpura is characterised by palpable purpura (small hemorrhages), often with joint and abdominal pain and also with kidney involvement, for which there may be a loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine which usually goes unnoticed. So, the pain that you are talking about is just a part of the spectrum and pain killers may be provide relief in such pains. I would not be concerned if the abdominal pain is not too severe or if the kidney symptoms are not present but it would be best if you keep your treating physician informed. Most probably she would smoothly recover within a week or so from the onset."},{"Patient":"During spots day, when I was walking down the slippery stairs, I fell down for about a few stairs, landing on my upper back and injuring my right forearm.

It usually results into disc degeneration with facet joint arthritis. Back muscle stretching and exercise helps to improve the back muscle tone and subsequently gives more support to spine. Lumbar roll is to give support to lower back.

Apparently it is too much to just be a nose bleed and I'm worried about her! She contacted me about an hour earlier to this saying that her stomach was hurting and now she is feeling weak, unable to concentrate and tired! Is there any possible causes for this and what can we do??Thank youAn,mon","Doctor":"There are two broad possibilities to consider. She might have elevated blood pressure which might have caused the bleeding. Her blood pressure needs to be checked immediately. The second probability is gastritis and a gastric ulcer. It could also be that she has developed a gastric ulcer which has bled. This also goes directly with her pain in the stomach as well as her weakness. Whatever be the case, ask her to go to a hospital emergency immediately. Be sure to ask her to take somebody along."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have a back pain since 4 days.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From your history, it seems that the swelling could be due to a hematoma formation (collection of blood in the subcutaneous tissue) post surgery, and the bruise could be due to the hematoma itself.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Your symptoms of abdominal pain and straining for passing stool points to a chronic inflammation/infection of your intestines. Most of the intestinal infections do come from  food eaten from outside under unhygienic conditions. Therefore, you have to avoid taking food from outside if you do. Also avoid spicy, oily food, and include enough roughage and liquids in your diet. I would rather go for a stool test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive.The extra skin what you have felt could be an external skin tag, which occurs if anytime you had fissure in ano due to chronic constipation and straining. This could be known only by a physical examination and so I would advise you to take appointment with a general surgeon who could do that to diagnose the condition and then manage it appropriately.

I had an MRI yesterday and went to the Dr today and was told that my nerve is entangled in scar tissue . He basically said he could not do anything for me other than an implanted stimulator. Is there any other alternatives for this severe pain? I am only 34 years old and I can t be in this pain an function. I don t want to take a lot of drugs either.","Doctor":"hi why there should be back pain after surgery and why there should be a need of epidural injection after surgery i advice you to take another opinion of spine surgeon . thankyou"},{"Patient":"I am experiencing pain in the middle right side of my back, when I breathe or move it worsens, but the pain is constant and very strong. It is from quite close to the spine across and above under my ribs and on inhalation is much worse. I have to breathe shallow. I wondered if it was a liver pain. I have asthma , but it is not an asthma pain and I tried a ventolin to see if it helped, which it didn t. Last year I was admitted to hospital with suspected ulcers after an episode of severe chest pain, but it is not the same either.","Doctor":"Hi,   Based on the description the signs & symptoms more closely resemble the \\"KIDNEY STONE\\"*(1) No this is not a liver pain(2) your are correct its not the asthma related pain.Kidney stone passing though the ureter (tube that connects the kidney to bladder here urine is collected) may cause pain. In such condition drinking good amount of water will help to flush the stone and decrease the pain but it may take some time , mean while over the counter pain killer can used to relive the pain if can't be tolerated. ADVICE: CONSULT - urologist / any physician.Here is what they tend to do in most of the case.1) Will do physical examination2) do ULTRASOUND of kidney3) will do some blood test and urine test4) May require other procedure like CT scan.5) TREATMENT : mostly drink lot of water and try to wait till the stone passes, and the strong pain killer to get relief mostly over the counter medication will not help much in such a strong pain as you describe, and from such medication you need the prescription.Hope it helps."},{"Patient":"Hi. I am 60 years old. I was prescribed Tramadol for chronic back pain . I will admit I was abusing it as I was taking far more than the 50mg every 6-8 hours, as prescribed. I drive a lot in my job, and started having problems focusing while driving, the most serious problem was that I was seeing double at long distances, which was frightening to say the least. Thinking that vision problems might be related to a pre- stroke condition, I just recently went to my doctor to have this checked out. Everything appears to be fine. I did not discuss my over use of the Tramadol with my doctor. However I was reading that one of the side effects with Tramadol is muscle constriction. Could it be possible that the Tramadol was effecting the muscles around my eyes, causing them not to focus or work in conjunction with each other, therefore causing the double vision??","Doctor":"overdosing any medicine can cause numerous side effects- and diplopia is also often reported-so stop it and take no pain relievers for few days,instead apply local muscle relaxant creams,gels, do hot fomentation,wear lumbar belt while driving,mild back exercises to prevent stifness"},{"Patient":"what causes server pain in the upper back between the shoulder blades & in the upper left arm and what is the best cure for this problem?","Doctor":"thanks for choosing health care magic.First of all if you need to get your self examined for blood pressure and heart related things by your doctor.First take care of this.Other causes could be some muscular pain or acid problem .Apply some local analgesic over it in any case it is not going cause any more problem.Take some analgesics but do not forget to see your doctor."},{"Patient":"I have a stabbing and throbbing pain that appeared 2 days ago in the mid left side of my back.

I can t actually walk with the pain and it feels like whenever I actively apply any pressure or squeeze the muscles in the area especially when walking,the pain gets really bad.","Doctor":"Hello!

CAUSE FOR MALE 1) It seems like the pain is from the fibrosis (condition that occurs after the operation and the healing happens with fibrous tissue, which are tough and elastic, so due to deep breathing it may cause some stretch and that is translated as pain) can use the over the counter pain reliever. 2) Kidney stone passing though the ureter (tube that connects the kidney to bladder here urine is collected) may cause pain. In such condition drinking good amount of water will help to flush the stone and decrease the pain but it may take some time , mean while over the counter pain killer can used to relive the pain if can't be tolerated) ( * (3) If your are female - other additional possibility is the pelvic inflammatory diseases can be one of the other cause , where an infection of the fallopian tube or any other part of reproductive track may be  involved and for you need to take medical attention if possible) As you don't have insurance and you did filled for bankruptcy  the conservative management mention above  1 & 2 will only choice remaining .

Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would do a personal physical examination of your abdomen to rule out an inguinal hernia.

I worked as a jail for over 7 years. Due to the everyday pain I went into a different career, but the pain is getting worse. I had an MRI done and the doctor told me that my last lumbar doesn t sit on the lower one correctly, but he didn t go any further with it and just gave me pain meds and muscle relaxers when I had a flare up.

The symptoms get aggravated during walking & bending forward. CT & MRI scan will help to confirm the diagnosis . Jody, though possible, the pain you are experiencing now may not be directly due to the injury you experienced 3 years back. Most common cause of sciatica  is slipped disc. Bed rest may help but will not cure the condition. Therapeutic benefit of drugs like Aceclofenac & Cortisone to relieve the pain & inflamation are limited because of their side effects as they need to be used for a prolonged period. Stretching exercises to relax the muscle spasms are very effective."},{"Patient":"Hi I am 35 years old, female and have PCOS .

If you would have precised the exact location of the pain or where it pains most ( like the pain is retrosternal) it will orient us better into determining the origin of the pain. If the pain is more on the ribs, then it might be acute costochondritis or angina pectoris. Normally before performing an X-ray, doctor had to examine you physically and locate the area where the pain is most intense either by properly interviewing you and/or examining you before requesting for X-rays or laboratory tests, as this would have oriented the exams asked. I suggest you still get back to the hospital and get examined properly. As if any of the above mentioned conditions are responsible appropriate treatment will be required. If acute PUD or GERD or Gastritis then proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole or h2 inhibitors such as ranidine and/or associated to antacids to treat the affection will be required. Running a test to determine the presence of H. pylori will also be important to determine infectious cause of the gastritis.

I visited 3 different doctors all them said it s stress and tension but sometimes the pain is so terrible it makes me cry, but also sometimes its gone for hours... it s really normal or do I have a real problem? maybe it s not connect it to abortion, maybe it s something else?","Doctor":"Hi there, Sorry to hear that you are in a lot of pain. I don't think the neck and back pain are connected to the abortion . Also, you have visited 3 different doctors; who have evaluated and examined you. So, please be reassured. It is quite possible that it is related to posture or it could also be an orthopedic complaint. Try the following measures; and still if you feel there is no improvement, visit an orthopedician and get yourself evaluated. 1. Apply a thin film of volini gel on the affected area. 20 minutes later apply hot fomentation/ heat application. This might bring you some relief. 2. Drink about 8-10 glasses of warm water a day. 3. Maintain good posture. 4. Sleep in a proper position. Invest in a good pillow, like' Tempur' etc . While sleeping , if you lie on your side, keep your hips and knees flexed and place a pillow between your thighs and knees. If you normally lie on your back, place a pillow under your knees. 5. Sign up for yoga classes if you have a good yoga instructor in your area. Deep breathing and Relaxation techniques will also help. 6.

Thanks for using this forum on HCM. The pain radiating from your spine towards your leg can be due to various reasons. This could include trauma to the spinal vertebrae or spinal column leading to disc herniation causing compression of the nerve.  Other reason can be muscle  strain involving the muscles supporting the spinal vertebrae. Firstly you should consider getting an MRI scan done for your spinal vertebrae after full assessment by your doctor to rule out the above conditions.

Usually when haematoma resolves, it changes its color from green to black and disappears. Sometimes if there is some haematoma in deeper layers of tissues, then it might take time to resolve. Since Xray didn't show any fracture, pain has decreased and you are able to do routine day-to-day activities, there is nothing to worry. But one month is quite long time for a haematoma to resolve. So, its better to do an ultrasound and confirm whether the blood collection is still there. If it is there then surgically removing the collection or just aspirating it by wide-bore needle will help in relieving your symptoms.

Itis therefore interesting to do an ESR frist. A very high ESR or erythrocyte sedimentation rate could suggest further investigations for spinal TB. Then blood calcium levels, alkaline phosphatase. Elevated values for these enzymes indicate a bone tumour. An abdominal ultrasound and CT scan and a chest X ray could be important in ruling out any existent or spread tumour. I suggest a consultation with an internist first or a neurosurgeon for further investigations, Thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD."},{"Patient":"I fell 7 or 8 feet from a horse last saturday, landed flat on my back, except for a piece of frozen manure,knocked the wind out for a few moments but just seemed stiff, now have jabbing pain in lower back, when my wife touches close to lower spine have stabbing pain shooting downwards, seems lower than ribs but is starting to get worse can hardly get up and down when laying, seems to get worse the longer I stand or sit straight,","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM, It seems that you might be having fracture of tail bone giving rise to severe pain while sitting straight or pain while get up while lying.

It is for sure that the slight thickening of the wall of the fundus of the stomach can not cause pain in the upper abdomen right of the center at the rib.I would advise you to consult a General Surgeon for an actual Physical examination to exclude or diagnose the cause of pain like costo-chondritis. muscle spasm, epigastric small hernia as all these things are not diagnosed on CT scan at all.The thickening of the fundus of uterus may not be a cancer- the cause being by this time the pains come at other spots the secondaries can be seen on any CT scan oft the abdomen."},{"Patient":"Just fell off my big horse landed flat on my back and back of my head. helmet took entire weight of head, head feels great, lower back is very painful with muscle spasms. got up after 7-10 minutes, all okay, walked back to barn myself, all okay. took two alleve and wondering what to do next. back spasms very bad, but I think it s really only muscle spasms. walking okay except as involves back muscles for balance. warm, wet heat? ice pack? alternating? just happened 20 minutes ago.","Doctor":"You had a fall rom horse on your back and have pain and spasm on back.

A course of muscle relaxants with NSAID's along with interferential therapy (physiotherapic modality) will help to relieve your pain. Avoid using pillows. Hot pack at painful site might decrease pain temporarily. Avoiding doing any strenuous activities which hurts your neck or shoulder. Discuss with your doctor. He will examine you clinically and might order for an Xray of your neck to see whether you have developed any spondylosis of cervical spine. Once the pain settles down, you can start exercises to strengthen your neck muscles.

Back injury may cause significant trauma to muscle although the bones are intact. Sometimes the muscle ache may be annoying for months. Try using back belt and consider doing physical therapy in addition to medicine. Avoid prolong sitting, heavy lifting and bending through your back. Sometimes back muscle stretching also helps. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My MRI report shows some anterior endplate spurring. They maintain relatively normal height. The discs are desiccated. There is retrolisthesis of C6 on C7. There are posterior disc bulges at the C4, C5, and C6 levels mildly compressing the thecal sac but not the cord. The nerve roots are unremarkable. Impression: Degenerative disc space narrowing with degenerative retrolisthesis of C6 on C7 and small disc bulges at the C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7 levels. I use heat to relieve the pain and it will last a few hours. My doctor would give me an anti-inflammatory drug, but I d like to do it without those kinds of medication if possible. Would keeping my neck at rest with cold packs (or heat ) for a week or two help the healing? (I did that with a heel spur -stayed off my foot for two weeks and used ice and it completely healed my bone spur.) Didn t know if it was better to keep using my neck to prevent stiffness or if I might cause more damage by using it. I do stretch every morning (to be able to function during the day.) Also in the lumbar area my report was : The vertebral bodies mainain normal height. There is grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 with midl anterolisthesis of L3 on L4. The conus terminates at T12-L1 and is unremarkable. The disc are desiccated and there is moderate disc space narrowing at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels. There is a broad base disc bulge at the L3-L4 level. This with the mild anterolisthesis of L3 on L4 is causing mild spinal stenosis along with some ligamentum flavum hypertrophy . The anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 is causing mild to moderate spinal stenosis along with associated ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. The neural foraminal fat on the left is compromised at the L4-L5 level secondary to the anterolisthesis. What exercises would be recommended and what would be contraindicated? Again, heat has helped and stretching helps immensely. I just need to know what I would need to avoid to prevent a worsening of the degeneration and what I should be doing to strengthen my back. Thanks","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM. You have cervical and lumbar spine problems. These are age related changes in the spine. There always two concern- one local neck /back pain due to disc and facet joint degeneration and arm / leg pain due to nerve pinching. Treatement depends upon your symptoms. We can not reverse the changes or we can not stop the progress however we can definitely delay the progression. I would suggest to continue the neck and back muscle stretching and exercise to strengthen the muscles around your spine. You need to work on your neck / back/ abdominal / gluteal  muscles and hamstrings. Consult a physical therapist to strengthen those muscles. Avoid weight lifting as it increases the intradiscal pressure and not good for already damaged discs. Thanks."},{"Patient":"63 year old patient complaining of fatigue and shortness of breath, upper back pain and cough that has become productive the last 2 days. a chest Xray revealed pneumonia . rbc count is decrease, hemoglobin: decrease, wbc: normal, ESR: increased. Serum IgG is increased and both IgM and IgA are decreased. what is likely the diagnosis?","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the question, The symptoms are very compatible with pneumonia. Shortness of breath, raised ESR and chest X ray findings. Hope an appropriate antibiotherapy has been prescribed. How ever, the low Hemoglobin levels have to be investigated. Low hemoglobin levels could be caused by the infection, but if very low, other causes should be considered. Other tests could be quite helpful in doing this assessment. Serum IgG is an indication that the infection is chronic, But IgG measurements are however very non specific and we cannot be conclusive. Knowing exactly for how long she has been coughing is too important. A chronic cough might warrant sputum exams and a tuberculin skin test to be be done to exclude pulmonary tuberculosis. The back pain might require a spinal x ray, ESR, alkaline phosphatse levels, Complete blood count, serum electrolytes to exclude any bone malignancy. I suggest visiting an internist with these ideas in mind could help min a proper reevaluation and management of your patient.

From the description, the pain sounds as though a peritoneal irritation pain which will occur if any of the organs covered with peritoneum is inflamed. Appendicitis a common cause of pain in the right side of the abdomen that has to be ruled out. It is associated with fever, pain in the right side of the abdomen when both the right and left side of the abdomen are compressed. Another possible diagnosis since you mentioned about pink stools ( blood stained?) could be an infection of the gut. However, the possibility of having a urinary infection can not be ruled out since urinary infections can cause irritation of the gut especially when it is cause by the bacteria E. coli. However, you need to see your Doctor for an appropriate evaluation and tests such as stool analysis, urine analysis, WIDAL and an ultrasound as deem necessary by your doctor after the examination.

You have to take proper medications for AS to avoid the progression of the disease. Seems you are only taking NSAID's for AS. Discuss with your doctor regarding starting you on DMARD's like Sulfasalazine. Sometimes acute flare-ups need steroids with/ without dose modification of DMARD's. You have to take medications for AS regularly as advised for life long to control the disease progression. Physiotherapy is very important to keep your back flexible. Taking NSAID's for long term might cause gastritis and renal impairment. Take them as per your doctor's advice. Wish you a good health.

The loss of bladder control is also indicative of spinal cord involvement in the injury. The late involvement of bladder suggests that it might have happened due to nerve compression due to edema or hemorrhage rather than nerve injury and timely treatment can reverse the neural problems you are facing. You need to have an MRI scan of your spinal cord to exactly know the site of lesion and the extent of nerve involvement. Based on the report and after detailed examination your Orthopaedician will give you the proper treatment. Earlier the treatment, better is the restoration of neural functions. Till then do not move and lie straight on a hard bed without pillow. I hope this is helpful to you. You can consult me again directly through my profile.

Frequent urination makes the possibility of kidney infection (pyelonephritis) or kidney stone more likely ( but no fever also reduces the chances of it being a kidney infection). Urine analysis and kidney ultrasound would have to be done to either confirm or rule out the kidney origin of the pain. For PID, clinical evaluation by a gynobs will be aimed at finding out if they are any active vaginal infections, STDs etc. Pelvic ultrasound will also be useful. We would not ignore the fact that the pain could be of GIT origin (notably infections) or lombosacral spondylosis. Pain could be managed with pain killers and antispasmodic medications. If infection is confirmed appropriate antibiotics should be administered. Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Good Day Sir, I am 25 yrs old.

When you say your pain is usually at night, is it because you sleep on your back and thus apply pressure on your lower back and/or left leg (mainly till your mid-thigh) ? Does the pain start from her lower back and go down till mid-thigh? If yes, this could most probably be her Sciatic nerve being irritated and is also called Sciatica. Let me list few of the most common causes of sciatica: -Degenerative disc disease: The disc's in every human being undergo a degenerative process with age, and is considered to be normal. When these disc's undergo degeneration they tend to irritate the nerve root present in the lower back, which can result in sciatica. -Sacro-iliac join dysfunction: the lowest end of your spine consists of fused bones called the Sacrum. This bone articulates with the iliac bone (one of the three bones forming your pelvis), thus this joint is called the sacro-iliac joint. Any irritation of this joint can also cause the same pain that would be typical for sciatica. -Piriformis syndrome: There is a muscle present in the buttock region called the Piriformis muscle. The sciatic nerve passes under this muscle, and any irritation of this muscle can also lead the sciatica. -Herniated disc: The Lumbar part of your disc can develop a hernia which is when the inner core of the disc leaks out or herniates. This protrusion can irritate the nerve roots, also resulting in sciatica. --Isthmic spondylolisthesis: In this condition a small fracture allows one vertebral body to slip forward on another. Due to this the sciatic nerve can get pinched and cause the pain. -Lumbar spinal stenosis: Stenosis (narrowing) of the spinal canal can cause the sciatic nerve to get pinched and cause this pain Other causes can be: muscle strain, spinal tumors, pregnancy, scar tissue, infection, direct injury, etc. Please consult your doctor on the same and try to find the cause in order to properly manage the sciatica as different cause require different management techniques. I hope I have succeeded in answering your questions, you could write back to us anytime for further clarifications. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I have had multiple disc sugerys.

Back pain can occur after delivery due to laxity in the muscles and ligament. And it usually gets relieved by 3 months with toning up the muscles. But ur history of fall and a spinal tap points to something different. Does ur MRI states only fracture or anything else also. Fracture can be due to fall or rarely a stress fracture of sacrum. The exact localisation is important to tell the cause and plan treatment accordingly. I would recommend u to see your doctor(spine Surgeon) who will examine you, see ur scans; and will then be able to advise u appropriately. Arrange for an appointment at the earliest. U can contact me in case u need any further details. Bye"},{"Patient":"Hello.doctor My daughter 10 yr is suffering from irregular abdomen pain and nausea with acidity since 5 dys. I hv been trying normaxin. Appetite loss also. Rantac etc off and on but no help. I started ornof 200 ( 1/2 tab) bd tody with cyclopam 1/2 tab sos as she needs antibiotics . is it ok and when do i expect her to get better?","Doctor":"Hi! Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would advise you not to give her any food (including fast fried and spicy food) from outside, as intestinal infections could creep in from such kind of food, and in few the intestinal mucosa might be too sensitive to some of the components of these food. Next I would advise for a routine stool test for her for ova and cyst, a urine test both routine/microscopic and culture/sensitivity as many a times there could be a silent UTI in children with vague symptoms. If any of these come out to be positive, this has to be treated properly. In your daughter's case, you have already started the antibiotic, so continue it for at least five days. However, if there is no relief, then you must show her to a pediatrician in your area along with a possible ultrasound abdomen if advised.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

Understood your history. This is definitely suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease and the cause may be anything ranging from a ruptured ovarian follicle to any inflammatory process. This can cause the severe pain die to irritation it causes to the very sensitive peritoneum.Since your pain has reduced no need to worry much. The extreme bloating with gas bubbles is reactionary to any inflammation in the abdomen / pelvis. The bleeding could also be reactionary or a normal period. Take the medicines as advised, take full bed rest, drink plenty of oral fluids. stop solid food for a day or two and you may be fine. IF there is not much relief, you can then go for further tests for a proper diagnosis and treatment ."},{"Patient":"Hi,i recently bought a trampoline and and only used it for about 10 minutes and the next morning withi woke up with bad lower back pain which subsided about 2 days late. I then used the trampolin again for about 10 minutes and woke the next morning with severe lower back pain which lasted 5 days. Is there any reason for this?","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for asking the question. There are a few things that i would have liked to know more. What is your age and sex. Your occupation means more of sitting or physical work. The pain you developed is most probably due to the muscle sprain. It can occur with sudden non accustomed physical activity, which your back muscles are non used to. For this you need to strengthen your abdominal and back muscles once your present pain gets better. Other remote possibilities can be a degenerated disc, or a spondylolysis, depending on your age. If your pain comes back, it is advisable to visit your doctor, who will then order an x ray/MRI and will be able to tell you more details. You can contact me again if you still have some queries.

Both x rays and painkillers could be harmful in pregnancy so you need to confirm the test before going for the same. In case if it is positive and you still want to continue it there investigation like MRI and few blood test like cbc, esr, sr calcium, sr vit d, to rule out sinificant causes of back which could affect you in the pregnancy. if your pregnancy test is negative then you  can go through all investigations as adviced by your orthopedic doctor before planning a pregnancy"},{"Patient":"Hello Sir I have low back pain and an MRI was taken, the results are as below There is centro - right paracentral protrusion of the L5-S1 disc intending the right Traversing S1 nerve root There is mild postero central protrusion of the L4-5 disc indenting the thecal sac How do I go about this, the pain is terrible and cannot sit for more than 25 min, please help","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for writing to us. I understand you have back pain . You are suffering from Prolapsed intervertebral disc ( PIVD) where the nerves get compressed by the protruded disc. There are several treatment modalities with medicines, physiotherapy and with injections in the back called epidural injections and root/facet blocks. If you dont get better with these treatment , surgery is the option, by which the nerves are decompressed by removing the protruded disc (discectomy), which would significantly improve your symptoms. So I suggest discuss these with your orthopaedician. Wishing you good health... Regards. Dr Saurabh Gupta."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m a 22 year old female. I m having some back pain that started a little over a week ago. At first I thought it was a knot in my muscle, then it didn t go away. I ve been taking 4 ibeproferin every six hours and still the pain wont go away. It was really bad when I woke up this morning and could barely get up. I woke up several times coughing and that caused and even more sharp pain. I looked up on Web MD and put my symptoms in and it pointed most likely to pulmonary embolism . I m scared.","Doctor":"Hello, in this question you have not mentioned which area of your back is hurting, is it upper or lower back. PE can mimic back ache (in the upper part of spine), but the pain is more on the front than on the back, there is cough with sputum and often blood can also accompany. The embolus usually arises from the lower limb vessels and after a period of immobilization or major surgery. also your age dosent fit into the risk factors for PE. But other than that there are several other causes of back ache with cough.  you should consult a doctor and get your tests done.

The bump on the lower rib is suggestive of a hematoma formation in the area which might have developed after a soft tissue injury or a fractured rib in the area.

Usually the pathology originates in the spine most likely disc disease or some other cause which is putting pressure on the nerve and causing the abnormal sensations on that particular area of nerve distribution. the area involved in your case is S1 dermatome. Some times loss of sensation in perenial area can occur. Better consult a orthopedic doctor and get a MRI of the lumbo-sacral spine. take care."},{"Patient":"Hi. I have major pain in my upper back and neck area also having a major headache . Also pain radiates to my left shoulder and arm . When I lay down its worse and I get pain in my chest left side. Also my left front side of my neck if I touch it, it feels sharp pain. And lastly for a little over a week now my throat has been sore and hard to swallow at night","Doctor":"Hi. You have not mentioned your age. Your upper back and neck pain could be acute or chronic. If it acute could be from a muscular strain of the upper back and neck muscles. If its chronic could be from the cervical spine like cervical spondylosis or a disc pathology. Sore throat and difficulty in swallowing could be due to a upper throat infection and rarely due to various conditions of the food pipe. I would suggest you to see a ENT specialist regarding this. For your neck problem do take care of your neck posture specially while sleeping and some anti-inflammatory drugs with muscle relaxants if u are not allergic to it. Once relieved of your neck pain you can perform some neck and upper back exercises which will help strengthen your neck muscles. Do drink lot of water.

You have a pain that has developed after cough of 3 weeks duration. The pain after such an attack in the groin, feeling like pulling down can be due to development of a hernia or enlargement of the preexisting hernia. I would advise you to get the abdomen examined by a General Surgeon to rule out or  confirm the diagnosis and get operated if this is a hernia after the coughing has completely settled. In the meantime continue the medicines for your respiratory problems, take steam inhalations, multivitamins, get investigated for routine so that a fitness is achieved for anesthesia and surgery."},{"Patient":"My dad has been suffering from back pain since last 1 year. we went in for an MRI scan before 6 mths and result shows Diffuse posterior disc osteophyte complex at C4-C5,C5-C6 & C6-C7 levels with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy causing narrowing of spinal canal without significant nerve root/cord compression.

He is taking pain killers and went for physiotherapy also. what is the risk factor for this surgeory?","Doctor":"Thanks for the query. Back pain may be due to disc degeneration. Where is the location? Also its important to know the level of the painful disc. You can not go on fusing the spine without knowing the exact pain source. Also he is long standing diabetic and it can cause this pain. Initially try to control pain  with medicine  (Antiinflammatory, muscle relaxants and if required pregabalin) and physiotherapy modalities such as IFT, manual therapy. I doubt about the need for the fusion surgery. I would suggest to get him examined by a spine specialist. Also sometimes if we can pinpoint the pain generator then we can give him local injection blocks. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, my father is in his 70 s and is quite an active man in general.

The only change that can help you is do hot fermentation instead of Ice fermentation. Do not wear weight till the pain subsides.

If everything is fine then you could visit a physiotherapist and do some back muscle strengthening exercises.He will also be able to guide you as to the proper posture to be adopted while lifting heavy stuff.

Presence of cough along with painful testicles suggest the diagnosis. You should consult with internal medicine specialist and should go for thorough check up. You should also go for ultrasound imaging of scrotum & urine routine & microscopy examination. Although these infections are viral in origin, yet you should take antibiotics for prevention of secondary bacterial infection. You should also take cough suppressants, analgesics. You should perform gargles three times in a day with lukewarm water & pinch of salt. You should wear loose pants.

He was a very gentle and always took the time to explain things to me fully that I could understand what was going on with my spine. I started seeing him in 1999 when I was 19 yrs old. He then booked me to have a 3 level fusion, internal fixtation, decompression and a bone graft in early 2003. I ended up pregnant so resheduled my surgery for a later date. But then I became aware that he moved his practice to Ohio :( . Since then I have not been able to find a back specialist that is willing to take the time he did to figure out what was wrong with my spine. I have seen over 9 drs and he was far the best I had ever seen. Now when I go see a dr and explain to them what Dr. Orr had explained to me about my back they look at me like I have no clue and that I am just making things up. I actually had one dr call me dillusional, which was very frustrating for myself and family. Dr. douglas Orr told me that I have DDD, herniated discs, spondylosis with spondylolisthesis grade 2 with definite narrowing of the lumbar spine. He also went on to explain to me, that when I feel on my spine in 1997, I sent my immune system to my 4th lumbar vertebrea, and as he called it, my 4th lumbar wasnt hooked up to my immune system so the computer in my body didnt reconize my 4th lumbar and started attacked it thinking it was something foriegn in my body and now it is dissolving. But when I tell that to any new doctors, not specialist as I cant even get an appt to see one, they all look at me funny. So nothing has been done on my spine since I have seen Dr. Orr. I have had a few xrays, and mri s over the last few yrs but nothing ever comes from it. My back has been getting worse over the years as I get several bulging discs a yr, to the point where my lower back swells right up, looks bruised and has red looking pin marks all over, broken blood vessels, to the point where I cant even move. And that just happens if I twist the wrong way, bend the wrong way or even get out of bed the wrong way. It has became very stressfull and depressing.
