So, personally, I think your older GP is correct. However, to be fair, loss of oxygen intake capacity due to lung disease also causes the haemoglobin to rise. Peripheral neuropathy does not play a role in it. The ideal way I would suggest is to test iron and vitamin B 12 levels.  If these levels are high then the injection of iron and vitamin B 12 can be stopped. Monitor haemoglobin monthly thereafter. If it remains high then the lungs are the trigger.

I am a 25-year-old female from the Caribbean islands, and will be 26 in Sept. I am 5 5 tall, and weighed 138 lbs at my last weigh-in. I haver never had any significant medical issues in the past known to me. The one thing sticks out, though, is that for most of my life, I always seemed to have a cold. I was later diagnosed with Chronic Coryza by a doctor / herbalist, who also discovered my nasal polyps. I have had them for a few years now. The one in my left nostril is larger than the one in my right. I had been advised by him to apply Lugol s Iodine directly onto the polyp by using a cotton swab, and it has reduced them significantly. He also advised me to reduce or stop eating dairy. Alas, I am a hardened dairolholic, so that is still a definite work-in-progress for me. When I left my country to attend university, I forgot to bring the iodine with me, so naturally, the polyps have reappeared. In addition to my blockage issue, I have been having what seems to be gastrointestinal and heartburn / acid indigestion issues lately. This is probably because for years I have been skipping breakfast and now it has finally come back to haunt me. I suspect I may have an ulcer-ridden stomach, but I never actually checked it out. So, in addition to my respiratory issue, I now feel as if this excess gas is preventing me from eating properly. In the past year, small amounts of food or liquid would make me burp insanely loud. Even just a few sips of water alone. And now, for the past week, I have not been able to eat in large amounts as I usually would. I have had a constant feeling of gas in my throat and stomach, and in some cases, a burning sensation in my stomach. I constantly have to pat myself on the back just to get some of the gas out. It s almost as if I have to struggle to eat. I used to be able to eat 4 slices of bread at mornings, but that has now been reduced to 2 or sometimes one. And now, I feel I may be at risk for dehydration, because I am not drinking the required amount of water, which is really essential especially in this Texas summer heat. With so many issues, it may be hard to pinpoint what my real issue may be. Alas, I am hoping someone can help. Thanks in advance.

I only smoked when I was a teenager occasionally and as a an adult, I would only smoke when I drank (which now I do not smoke at all). I drink occasionally on the weekends but not much. My father had a history of heart disease, emphysema and diabetes. He had his first heart attack in his mid-30s and had a triple bypass in 1983. At age 72, he passed away due to a massive heart attack he suffered as a result of the stress of having surgery to remove colon cancer. Over the past year or so I have been experiencing chest pains almost every day either at rest or after some activity. Sometimes when I am leaning over, I can get the pain in the center of my chest which can feel almost like muscle pain. Sometimes I experience the chest pains with a feeling of shortness of breath yet when I take a deep inhalation, it seems as though my breathing can be restored to normal. Sometimes with the chest pains I also experience some upper back pain across my shoulders. My neck, jaw and arms never really hurt or go numb. Oftentimes, I can feel my heart racing or feeling as though it is going to pound out of my chest. I have had numerous EKGs done all of which have come back normal. I went to the ER in February of 2009 and was admitted due to chest pains. Upon arrival at the ER, I had bloodwork done including my cardiac enzymes tested (which were all normal), an EKG done which was normal, BP (usually maintains at 112/80), pulse and heart rate were all normal. They kept me overnight so I could have a stress done. I completed that the next morning. The stress test I had was where they took pictures of my blood flow while at rest, then they shot me with some dye, then I ran on the treadmill and then more pictures were taken after that. The results were that I had a heart of a 28 year old, and I was in the top 90% of women my age. Then that afternoon, I had an endoscopy done to rule/out any gastro problems. That, too, was normal. I was seen by a cardiologist while an inpatient and he told me that everything was normal and it is very unusual of a woman my age, even with a family history, to have heart problems. It definitely was not a heart attack nor did he feel it was heart-related. Then I had an abdominal ultrasound completed outpatient which was normal as well as which was normal. I also wore a heart monitor for 30 days which allowed me to record all of my episodes. Upon review of that monitor, they told me I had sinus arrhythmia and tachycardia but there was nothing for me to do about it because it was nothing to worry about. My cholesterol is 195 and I can t remember my exact LDL or HDL but I believe the good cholesterol level was 5 points lower than it should be and the bad was good. My triglycerides were over 300 but at my last blood check they came down to a bit below 200. I am still working on lowering those. I know I do not always eat right nor do I exercise very often. I have cut back on fatty, greasy foods and am losing weight little by little. I continue to have these pains either at rest or after exerting myself. Sometimes I take Prilosec and the pain goes away. I mentally make the pain and heart pounding worse because I start to think there is something wrong with me that my PCP and the tests missed. (My PCP is my cousin who is very familiar with my family history and I truly believe he is doing everything possible to find an answer. Yet he keeps telling me that he is 99.9% sure it is NOT my heart. The only other thing he could do is a catheterization. He doesn t want to do it because there is a 1% risk that something could actually go wrong and cause me a real problem. He did say if I had the catheterization, it would completely give me a 100% answer. I actually gave myself such bad anxiety this past weekend that I actually started believing that I am dying or will die soon. These episodes and symptoms are driving me crazy! I want to hope that it is all just stress or something else. I ve been crazily reading things where they say sometimes people can sense doom or feel anxiety right before something bad like a heart attack or death happens. Please! Any help or answer you could give me to lead me in the right direction to solving my problem would be GREATLY appreciated.

Through this communication I would like to bring your kind attention, our most serious problem about my Father (Age 80+), who is suffering from COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). My Father had already gone by thorough medical check-up & he is all right in other health aspects. The problem is COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), which is perfectly diagnosed & we have all the reports in hand. Now a days my father is living in North part of India (Kotdwara - Uttarakhand State), Near Haridwar/Dehradun. We are looking for the best possible Hospital/Doctor (Pulmonologist) to treat COPD problem of my Father, somewhere in North part of India (Preferably in Delhi, Meerut, Chandigarh, Dehradun, Bijnore), since he can not travel long distance due to his bad health. Also the transportation infrastructure has been affected badly in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi….. Therefore, please let us know your valuable suggestion, in order to provide the best possible treatment to my Father. By considering his age (80+), we prefer to give him treatment without going for any serious surgery. His physical appearance is also too weak. If you are aware about the above, please provide us detailed information about the Hospitals/Doctors including perfect address/location, name of the doctors, telephone number, e-mail etc. Your Favorable answer will be highly appreciated Thanks & Best Regards Bharat Singh Rawat Kotdwara (Near Haridwar/Dehradun Garhwal) District : Pauri Garhwal State : Uttarakhand India Tel.

I have no energy to do basic stuff like my house work and I am afraid to drive for falling asleep. I have Asthma as well, but none of the treatments for the Asthma is working or has ever worked for me. To make matters worse I have problems breathing all the time, and constant pain in my chest on the left side, fluttering from time to time, stomach bloated. My cardiologist insist that it is not my heart that is causing these problems. When I go to places like Walmart I can no longer walk around the store I must ride one of the scooters. He insist it is the Fibromyalgia causing these problems or the Asthma. Yet the ashtma medication does not healp. He also think it maybe the Acid reflex, so I see a Castro fir that. I don t want to wait until things get worse and then I find out later that maybe my heart problems were more serious than he or I thought and not treated earlier on. I had a aunt that had heart problems and it was not treated in a timely manner and she passed away. Also have a good friend that has the same problems and her first doctor failed to treat her problems and her second doctor jumped right on it, right away and was so upset that her problem was not addressed earlier.

Usually cause for this anxiety, stress, drugs, caffeine, structural heart disease, thyroid, smoking and sometimes without any detectable cause called as idiopathic.   I guess you undergone echo and it's normal.    Along, with vpc you can have other arrhythmias like psvt or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and then Normalizes. Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope and other symptoms.     So we need to evaluate for the cause. Usually ecg is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality so you will need 24 hour holter monitoring if symptoms are occurring in daily basis. So visit nearby cardiologist for this investigation.    Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard.

Visit ER, get all the tests done(CBC, X-Ray chest, Imaging tests) to rule out COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, pleurisy, pneumonia, bronchitis or tuberculosis). When Asthma gets complicated, it presents as COPD. Get evaluated & treated at the earliest. In the meantime, avoid addictions if any, continue to take the medications prescribed, stay away from stress/anxiety, try staying in the fresh air, avoid staying in air pollution.

Have a cabin in woods about 31/2 hours from my home.  Went up last year and stayed  2 months...(Feb. and March).  There was plenty of mouse poop also because I hadn't been there for 2 years.  Three months ago I had blood work done by my rheumatologist (treats my Sjogrens disorder and my osteoarthritis).  She found markers in blood work so she referred me to an oncologist who ordered a PET scan.  Scan came back negative for cancer but showed abscess in right back lobe of right lung.  Referred to lung surgeon who sent me to a radiologist who did a needle biopsy of abscess...again negative for cancer.  They think I had some kind of infectious disease.  Went today an had a CT.

We arrived on Friday evening. I felt fine all day Saturday and Sunday. After going in to bed on Sunday night I was restless and had a hard time sleeping. I started shivering and had chills. I think I started to scare myself and started having some anxiety which was making me feel like I wasn t breathing right - though I know I wasn t really breathless, didn t have shortness of breath nor was my heart rate irregular. I ended up taking my temperature at it was just under 100 degrees (normal for me is in the 97-low 98 degrees). I could tell my temperature rose a bit more as I got really warm then sweaty. I felt very dehydrated and kept drinking a lot of fluids. I was somewhat dizzy and felt a slighly nauseated. I couldn t sleep for most of the night. I took some ibuprofin and finally dosed off around 4 in the morning. I woke up around 6/7 am and didn t feel any better. My fever had come back (still low grade) and then I had a headache and body aches. I did start having some chest tightness and aches in my chest area too - similar to when my asthma acts up. As the morning went on I felt a little bit better but still had a headache, body aches and low grade fever. We left the area around noon and went back home (which is close to sea level). I felt much better still had some of the symptoms. My fever rose to almost 101 during the night (last night) but dropped after taking ibuprofin this morning. I still have had a slight headache but it and the aches have improved. Temperature hasn t risen since the night again. Question - does this sound more like a flu or virus or could it have been altitude sickness? or something else?

He s been on antibiotics all 4 times, struggles to recover until his antibiotics are nearly gone, finally feels better for a few days and then gets it again. We are wondering if it is valley fever. Can that come with congestion/sinus symptoms? He s been diagnosed with sinus infections each time, but develops not only significant congestion/sinus symtpoms, but also chest pain, horrible coughing, fatigue, sore throat, and is miserable. He has faithfully taken not only strong antibiotics, but prescription strength cough syrup/decongestant, Flonase nasal spray, Zyrtec once a day, and breathing treatments up to 4 times a day, along with vitamin C and lots of fluids. He is otherwise very healthy, but his doctor is concerned that perhaps it is not really sinus infections he has had. I cannot find on the internet where there is a connection between congestion/sinus symptoms and Valley Fever - curious about that as others have asked if he has been tested for it. We live in Phoenix. As a young child he had repeated ear infections, but 4 years ago at age 10 he had his tonsils and adenoids removed, tubes in his ears, and a major sinus surgery. He has been very healthy ever since until now. Any ideas? Thank you verey much!","Doctor":"Hi, There are overlapping symptoms of recurrent sinus infections which can be a part of valley fever (fungal infection with coccidioidomycosis affecting lungs) or not.

I was concerned about the chest pain and its size so i went to a clinic. i thought it was a spider bite. he said it clearly wasn t so gave me an ointment for acne. he told me the sore had absolutely nothing to do with my chest pain. I took the ointment for 3 weeks and the chest pain and sore grew. By then i knew it was causing me pain the got more severe. I went to the hospital 3 weeks later and he also told my it wasn t causing chest pain. he gave me a antibiotic for infection and when i was a week into the bottle a pain ripped through my chest which didn t last just one second, but about 3 or 4. When it happened i thought i was having a heart attack. i went home and lanced it myself, which they didn t offer to do. it grew outward in a circle and was slightly smaller than a quarter. not far above the skin, it grew deep into my cheek. it took a week to fight the infection out. the pain subsided from a 8 and some intense 10 to about a 3 with occasional 10 stabbings. its comes and goes throughout the day. I didn t get blood test for the sore from either doctor. now the sore is gone but over the past 2 years ive been to the doctor for my chest pain and they have taken blood samples related to checking my heart. i havent told them about that infection because those first 2 doctors said the sore wasn t causing the pain, but how would they know since they never took a blood test. i know it caused the pain then and the aftermath now. Should i tell the heart doctor about the infection? Will he shrug me off like the other 2? and is it possible the infection is still there or gone but damaged something? what was the infection?","Doctor":"Hi, As per my surgical experience, the long-term back healed facial lesion is not going to bother the chest now.

I have had to start taking paracetamol again this week as feel weak, wobbly and feel as if I am going backwards again instead of improving. I am 45 years old. Non-smoker.This is the 3rd time I have had pneumonia in 18 years. I am reasonably fit and healthy, and I don t suffer from colds normally, but whenever I come down with something, I seem to suffer with it. How long does it take to get back to normal? Are the trachea symptoms part of the initial pneumonia symptoms or would I need to see the GP again. I am feeling extremely fed up of generally feeling unwell. I am taking a tonic (Metatone) and drinking and eating healthily. Basically, is it normal to feel this unwell for so long.","Doctor":"Hi, Yes, it might be that after the pneumonia the recovery time lasts up to one week however I recommend you to do a chest CT to see if the pneumonia has gone completely.

I was told I had heart disease that was similar to an 80 year old. I also had diabetes. I had just left the Marine Corps Reserve a year earlier. I joined the Marines at age of 17. I received a number of vaccinations in boot camp, one of which was the smallpox vaccine. When I left boot camp for R and R, I went home where joined in a game of pick up football. I began to have tightness in my chest and I was short of breath. I used to believe my problem developed from some sort of virus I got from the air-jet vaccination gun the service used, but now after speaking to one doctor by chance. Now I believe my problems were from the smallpox vaccination. I have been fighting an up hill battle with the Veterans Administration on compensation and treatment for the past 30 plus years, because of the lack of help from the medical field. I need to fine evidence and were to fined it. Who know more about what adverse effects smallpox vaccines cause and who can help me with my case. Thank you, Michael Morin","Doctor":"Hi, Yes, research studies do show that few people do get heart problems after taking small pox vaccination. Few deaths have also been reported. Presently if you have tightness in the chest associated with breathlessness it could be angina. As such angina is not a disease but is caused by low oxygen in the blood reaching the heart. However, angina can be indicative of some serious developing coronary artery disease. You can take sublingual Nitrogycerine when you feel tightness in the chest after consultation with your treating doctor. Do not neglect yourself, visit a cardiologist, get physically examined & get all screening tests done to rule out any CAD. The tests will include CBC, Urinalysis, lipid function tests, X-ray, ECG, Echocardiography, Stress tests & CT or MRI if required. Get treated. In the meantime, stop addictions if any, avoid taking red meat, oily-spicy food. Take low carbohydrate, boiled home made food, fruits & veggies. Hope I have answered your query.

He had a PET scan of the tumor and all of his other major organs. He also had a biopsy of the tumor. The biopsy showed that the 4 cm tumor is malignant (squamous). The tumor is located in the back lower part of his lung. The cancer is only in the lung tumor. He went to an Oncologist in Philadelphia (where he lives) today for a consultation. The Doctor said that a few things were not an option because of the IPF, including surgery and CyberKnife. The doctor said that CyberKnife was too risky because the lung moves at all times and the radiation could hit the fibrosis areas and cause damage. The Doctor recommended Chemo and has scheduled a 5 hour in-office treatment for next week. He said that if the tumor shrinks enough in a month, he would try to treat it with radiation. Otherwise, he would continue Chemo treatments for 6 months total. I don t like the idea of Chemo treatments for the next 6 months. I have a few questions: 1) Why is the doctor concerned about damaging the fibrosis areas of the lung with the CyberKnife radiation, but not with traditional radiation in a month? 2) Is chemo a good idea for an 80 year old man? 3) I read on-line that Georgetown University hospital has done a few thousand of the CyberKnife treatments on lung tumors, sometimes with other complications involved such as pluracy. Should we send his records to Georgetown U Hospital to get a second opinion and see if the doctors there think that the CyberKnife treatment can work?

I took a phazyme about 20 minues ago.  and I took 2 ibuprofen abou 15 minutes ago.  no change","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. By your history and description, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more likely. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause chest pain, bloating, nausea, burping, central burning epigastric pain etc. Don't take ibuprofen as it can worsen GERD.. Follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination on empty stomach twice daily. 2. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. 5. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have answered your query.

Recommended exercise. Last night had same problem. I am thinking it is anxiety attack. Is there a test to determine that.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Yes, troponin I blood test is the answer of your question. Troponin I rises in heart attack. So if your chest pain is due to heart diseases then troponin I will be high. But if it is due to anxiety then troponin I will be normal. So get done troponin I test at the time of chest pain. In my opinion, your chest pain is mostly due to stress and anxiety because your all cardiac reports are normal. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs (propranolol and flunarizine combination) too. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You are having chronic cough (cough for more than 2 weeks). So we should definitely rule out lung diseases like lung infection, bronchitis and asthma. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest X-ray and PFT. Chest X-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis and asthma. You may need antibiotic, inhaled bronchodilators (Formoterol or Salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (Budesonide or Fluticasone) based on the above reports. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

They took samples & she will get results in about 5 days. It was implied that it was asthma though she has not had a complete set of PFTs nor a methacholine test. This is a very conscientious adult who has eaten correctly, walked 4-6 miles daily, serious tennis player who never gets sick and yet has this recurring problem since the first of this year. She is a breast cancer survivor of 10+ yrs. We are both frustrated by the swift diagnosis of first COPD & now asthma with minimal testing by two different doctors. Her PCP is also not satisfied. Can asthma really been this persistent coming out of the blue?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Yes, asthma can be seen in adult life. It is known as adult onset asthma. It behaves similarly to COPD. And your are right, diagnosis of asthma or COPD should only be based on PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). So in my opinion, you should insist for PFT.  If PFT is showing obstructive defect with bronchodilator reversibility then it is asthma.  But if PFT is showing obstructive defect without reversibility then it is COPD.

Sometimes, the shortness of breath can last up to 2 weeks. Actually, I am not sure if its shortness of breath but it feels like i have to work to breath or that the air is warm. It s hard to explain. The heart palpitations started about 4 years ago and come about twice a month. I was a smoker for 6 years but stopped about 2 years ago at age 28. Once i quit, i started to use e-cigs for 1 year and eventually stopped smoking e-cigs and have been on nicotine gum ever since. I am 30, not in bad shape, i am muscular. No one would describe me as fat. I was scared I was going to have a heart attack and the doctor checked my heart but said there was nothing wrong with it. He did an ultrasound and made me ride a bike. Could it be nicotine causing my palpitations and shortness of breath? My dad has cardiomyopathy and recently had to have surgery. When i went to the doctor he said i did not have it. So i have narrowed it down to nicotine. It s scary to be honest. It should be noted that i was diagnosed with sleep apnea at 22. I snore alot while sleeping and always have. Sometimes, even while awake, i notice that i have been holding my breath.

She has been diagnosed in the past with a fib and paracaditis and more recently the last time we went to the hospital they said she had gerd? Oh and no she has not eaten any corn. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. In my opinion, you should definitely take her to emergency room. She is having history of heart diseases. So we should definitely evaluate her chest tightness and pressure. So take her to emergency room and get done blood pressure monitoring, ECG, 2D echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes uncontrolled GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) can also cause similar symptoms. So give her Pantoprazole and Levosulpiride combination on empty stomach twice daily. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. Don't worry, she will be alright with all these. Hope I have answered your query.

While, the pain could be related to a muscle spasm, due to a wrong position during bending down. I would recommend taking ibuprofen for the pain and having some rest. If the problem persists, I recommend going to the ER for a physical exam and some tests: - a cervical spine X ray study- a Doppler ultrasound of the cervical arteries (to exclude possible dissection)- a resting ECG. Hope to have been helpful!Wishing all the best, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I am a 32 y/o non-smoker who has a persistent dry cough - from the chest- for 4 months after having the flu. I tried antibiotics, steroids and Asmanex HFA inhaler. My chest and sinus X-ray images are clear. Will CT scan to detect a possible cancer be a good idea now? If not, what are the possible diagnosis?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Yes, CT thorax should be done for chronic persistent cough. Possibility of cancer is very less at your age of 32 years. But CT can identify mediastinal Lymphadenopathy, small infective foci as a cause for your cough. If CT is normal then get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis. Bronchitis is common after viral upper respiratory tract infection like flu. PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with long acting inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. First of all no need to worry for heart diseases because your ekg and enzymes are normal. Since you are having history of aneurysm, better to get done CT angiography of neck to rule out ascending aorta aneurysm. If this is also normal then possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more likely. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs (propranolol and flunarizine combination) too. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need ultra long acting inhaled bronchodilators (indacaterol and glycopyronium).

Along with this, also avoid heavy meals at night, go for walking after meals, avoid junk food, avoid stress and tension, keep 2-3 pillows under head while sleeping.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Chest tightness, chest pain, breathing difficulty etc are commonly seen with heart and lung diseases. So in my opinion, you should immediately consult doctor and get done : 1. Ecg, 2d echo and stress test to rule out heart diseases. 2. Chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out lung diseases. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart and lung diseases. Sometimes undiagnosed stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these but first rule out heart and lung diseases. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hi um.

Anything I can do, to stop this fluttering/ Thank you","Doctor":"Hi ThereYour heart is controlled by a natural pacemaker (the sinus node), which is located in the right atrium. It sends out electrical signals to both the right and left atria. Those signals tell the top of the heart how and when to contract.When you have AFL (Atrial Flutter), the sinus node sends out the electrical signal but part of the signal travels along a pathway in a circular motion or circuit around the right atrium, in a continuous loop. This makes the atria contract rapidly, which causes the atria to beat faster than the ventricles. A normal heart bate is 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). People with AFL have hearts that beat at 250 to 300 bpm.CAUSES:Decreased blood flow to the heart (ischemia) due to coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, or a blood clot. High blood pressure (hypertension) Disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)Now regarding the treatment part we have 2 options either to control the rate with meds and if meds fails to control the palpitations adequately then other option is to go for ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL stuudy and finally CATHETER ABLATION of the focus.Good Luck"},{"Patient":"I had fairly severe asthma as a child and a youth.

Normally our lungs are in upright position (standing) or in lying down position (supine). But when our lungs are placed in upside down position, blood supply of lungs suddenly increases and this gives symptoms of breathing difficulty, pain and burning sensations. If this position is for short time like for few seconds, these symptoms won't appear. But if upside down position is for longer duration like 10 minutes in your case, these symptoms appear.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You might be having worsening of asthma. Wheezing can be absent in worsening of underlying asthma but your all other symptoms are suggestive of worsening more. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will tell you about severity of asthma and treatment is based on severity only. You may need long acting inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Another possibility is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). This can also cause chest tightness, breathing difficulty, burning etc. So take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination on empty stomach twice daily. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food.

I tried to take apple cider vinegar for indigestion and its not working or I have not taken long enough. Right in the middle of my chest every once in a while I will have a funny sensation not painful but wierd. I just start thinking heart attack, but I think it is indegestion.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Prilosec is having pantoprazole. It is antacid in nature. Since your symptoms (central chest discomfort) appeared after stopping prilosec, possibility of GERD is more likely. No need to worry for heart attack. GERD is gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause central chest discomfort. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in GERD. 1. Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination on empty stomach twice daily. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Go for walking after meals. 4. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. By your history and description, you are mostly suffering from bronchitis. Best treatment of bronchitis is inhaled treatment. Oral steroids (prednisone tablet) should be started only if patient is not improving on inhaled treatment. In my opinion, you should definitely consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). This will definitely improve your wheezing.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Foracort is having formoterol and budesonide. It is commonly used for allergic asthma. It actually controls the asthma and related lung symptoms. So when you suddenly stop it, your asthma becomes uncontrolled and started showing symptoms. Ideally, you should not stop it suddenly. You need to gradually taper it down to prevent symptoms. Sudden stoppage of foracort won't cause any adverse impact. You should restart Foracort 200. Continue it for 3 months. If symptoms are controlled then taper down to Foracort 100.

It is normal except .5K less RBC and Lymphocytes increased by 1. Blood was only for 2-3 days (Noticed 4-5 times). Doc (ENT) said its may be because of some injury because of violent coughing. I took Pulmonary test too which shows everything normal. His diagnosis was that i have bronchitis and because of that I have cough. After one month he prescribed the tablet for bronchial asthama and specific medicine for cough ie rotacaps- Levolin for one week followed by another rotacap seroflow (250MG) . I was filling better except nose used to get blocked in between. Then all of a sudden, i again started sneezing (End of 5th week) and nose secretion begin again (Its was think and sticky). Again visited the doctor. he doubted some infection in the sinuses. Asked to go for a CT scan of PNS for Allergic Fungul Sinusitis. Scan shows that Maxillary Sinuses are filled with fluid. Scan shows that its quite significant. Doc mentioned that we haven t addressed Sinuses problem so far and because of that it kept growing in the sinus (told in simple language-- may be some other reason in medical terms).

No, you should not take Viagra now. Viagra is having Sildenafil. It is potent vasodilator. It can reduce blood pressure and cause heart damage. So better not to take Viagra now.  Your breathlessness is not permanent. It is fluctuating. And most common cause for this is stress and anxiety. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs like Propranolol or Flunarizine combination too.

I was feeling really run down for a few weeks and then I had a flu (proper flu). Was hoping that would be the end of it, but two weeks after the bout of flu I still feel really exhausted - so haven t been back to the gym.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Upper respiratory tract viral infection (flu) can cause bronchitis (inflammation of airways) and pneumonia (lung infection). And these can cause hemoptysis (blood in sputum). So get done chest X-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest X-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. You may need antibiotic and inhaled bronchodilators based on the reports. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You are worsening on Ventorlin. Ventorlin is a short acting inhaled bronchodilator, so it's action stays for only 2-3 hours. You were also not given mucolytic and expectorant drug along with inhaler. So your secretions are not coming out and you become more symptomatic. So in my opinion you should start 1. Ultra long acting inhaled bronchodilators (Indacaterol and Glycopyrronium). 2. N acetyl cystine (NAC) along with inhaler. NAC is pulmonary anti -oxidant, mucolytic, expectorant and anti inflammatory drug. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I was trying to sleep but couldn t because I felt like I was having a heart attack. I drank some maylox and shrugged it off as Acid Reflux. Which admittedly I do have. The following day I was at work when I started feeling that heart-attack type acid reflux again. I tried to ignore it. I got some antacids and went about my business. But about twenty minutes the pain became so bad I couldn t think. I started shaking and felt dizzy and I almost passed out from the pain in my chest. It was under my rib cage on the right side, which made me think gallbladder. I continued to work until I couldn t do anything but cry because of the pain. And then I went to the ER, convinced I was either having a gallbladder attack, the worst case of Acid Reflux in the history of time, or a heart attack. Because by then the pain had moved from under my rib to the middle of my chest. It felt like there was an Anaconda in my chest, squeezing my heart to death. I had never in my life felt anything like that before. Anyway, by the time I made it to the hospital, an hour had passed since my pain had begun. And by the time a doctor had seen me, my pain had nearly stopped completely. I actually felt really dumb because I felt like it was just acid reflux. But the ER doctor said it sounded like a gallstone attack and she ordered blood and urine tests. My tests came back okay (except saying I was little anemic) and she sent me home with a referral to a doctor. The next day I went to the doctor and he ordered me to get an ultrasound on my gallbladder and liver. (He was concerned when I told him both my parents died of primary liver cancer.) I m waiting to find a place to do an ultrasound that bills as a clinic instead of a hospital for insurance purposes. Anyway, that day my chest felt okay. My back was really sore (on the left side) and I couldn t turn my neck without feeling intense pain, but my chest itself felt fine. Which brings me to today. I have been having chest pains all day today. And all I had for breakfast was raisin bran cereal and fat-free milk. They told me to eat a low-fat diet so I have been. And here I am convinced my heart is bad. It feels like a tiny corner of my heart on the left side of my chest is being pinched. My entire chest area aches. I ve had acid reflux before. I have it bad. And I have never felt this way before. The doctor told me it s related to the gallstone issue, but the pain isn t coming from my right side. So is this a normal feeling?

ICS are far better than oral steroids because they ICS are devoid of any side effects and there is no withdrawal after ICS. You will also need N acetyl cystine (NAC).

High ESR with a persistent cough is commonly seen in lung infection like pneumonia, tuberculosis or bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done a clinical examination of the respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).

It started with a sudden chest pain and cold sweat along with light headedness while I was driving. I pulled over for few moments and continued and had the same feeling maybe 15 minutes later... that is how it started 20 plus years ago. I went to the doctor next day, blood work was done, then stress test for heart issues. Micro valve prolapse was the diagnosis. I started having cronic fatigue, was diagnosed with anxiety attacks, then I started getting heart burns, was diagnosed with GERD. Fatigue continues to this day, Drs said it could be depression, was treated for that. Was treated for gastritis, was told the pain on the chest could be arteritis on chest joints! Everytime I get tested something else seems to come out, about a year ago I was told my Tyroid is slow and now I am on medication for that, 2 years ago I had yet another stress test and catherization done and was told one of the arteries was about 65% blocked, was put on few different medications. I had a follow up tress test done about 3 months ago and was told by my doctor that it has gotten worse so they may have to put a stent to open the blockage. Also on every follow up test that was done for other diagnosis they all came back negative, including mitro valve prolapse. My complaint about fatigue never got better, maybe even worse now since I also am loosing strength and muscle that maybe due to age. One thing I like to add is since these problems started I have had issues with bowle movement and gas. Also I was diagnosed with low blood sugar level at one point too.

It was always a dry cough, never coughed up any mucus, and I never had a runny/stuffy nose. It felt like just a bad tickle in my throat that wouldn t go away. It was worse at night, and I would cough so hard that my whole body ached and my diaphragm was tender to the touch. It felt like it was slowly, very slowly going away, and about 3 weeks into it, I got a bad cold on top of it. Now, I would wake up in the morning coughing up phlegm and then at night it was back to the dry tickle cough with no phlegm. The cold went away after about 2 weeks, and I still have the dry ticklish cough at night. It s not terribly bad, but it is still there. I never feel out of breath, I am not (and never have been) a smoker, I have never had a fever with this cough, and I feel mostly fine except for this lingering cough. My husband also got the cough at the same time (and we both got it from our toddler). My husband and toddler have gotten over it. Yesterday, I started with another symptom (that I think is related to all this coughing)... Every so often through out the day when I inhale deeply, I can feel almost a buzzing or small vibrating on the right side of my sternum near the bottom ribs.

In addition, he has shortness of breathe somewhat controlled with inhalers. Recently he has developed lower leg, ankle and foot swelling and has been given water pills for that. He has an awful cough and can not lay flat at night. He tires very easly and needs to rest during his daily higene routine.

I recently have these chest pains, when I get up in the mornings(about 3 weeks). I remember the day it started very well. I had come home after working for 13 hours, and ate a plate full of rice and went to sleep. The next morning, I woke up feeling pain under my chest. I thought it was due to the mosquito vaporizer that I leave switched on while I sleep, therefore I switched it off, for a couple of days. It did not work, the pains were still coming. So I tried decreasing food consumption at night, and that seem to do the trick(For instance at night I use to eat a taco and one big plate of rice). However, you should also know that a few months back I switched to eating oily foods for lunch(like tacos) from rice(with vegetables). I also used to get chest pains as a kid(but it stopped and it was random. Say 2-3 times per year), but not so severe as this(my current ones last for 2-3 hours or more and it hurts while eating. It is happens everyday too.). But when I went to the doctor back then when I was a kid, he used to say that it is because I eat too frequently. I also got an ECG back then, and it was normal. Now,I plan to get an ECG, switch to rice for lunch and turn off the vaporizer at night. (Note: I do not exercise at all, my work involves coding infront of a computer for about 9 hours and then I come straight home and stay on the laptop(3 hours) before going to sleep, however I do have this obitrek machine that I rarely use. {My mum thinks I have got gastritis, but what does she know. She does not like it when I eat food from the shop instead of her homemade rice}). Thanks for reading.

It started out with a very sharp interior chest wall pain that at very first I thought was a strong case of heartburn, after a couple of days I started noticing that the pain would feel so bad I would actually contract my hands into a backwards position as if I had cerebrial palsey for about 10 seconds which seemed like a reaction to the pain or maybe it made the pain not as bad, I could not really tell why I was doing it. Now 5 months later I am almost to the point of being bed ridden some days. My whole body aches extremely bad, I will have very odd muscle lock ups, Mostly in my leg muscles, twitching, and I contract my feet sometimes now as well as my hands. I still have the chest wall pain from time to time, and Feel like somedays I will die the pain is so bad. I lay in bed for hours sometimes screaming. I have seen 5 different doctors since this all has started. Family Doctor, Nuerologist, general surgeon, 2 different rhuemotoligists and I have gotten nowhere. They have done every blood test imaginable. The only test that shows up out of whack is my ANA. It is 1:640. Although that is positive, I have a normal sed rate, RNP Antibodies, SM Antibodies, histone is normall, I have been tested for Sjogrens, Hoshimotos Thyroiditis, Hep C and all came back either normal or negative, I have no inflamation, And my CBC was normal as well. I have had laproscopic gallbladder surgery on sep-30th and that did nothing for me. They have also tested my thyroid an my TCH was .27 which is a little low, however my T3 and T4 were normall they said, my Vitamin D was also normal. At this point my doctors are questioning the validity of my pain, and while they question it my pain gets worse and worse by the week. I have felt pain in my life, I am sure everybody has. This is a 10 on a 10 scale and it is not like anything I have ever felt before, not only is it painful, but I am weak, and I am getting to a nonfunctional state quickly.

My right arm is a little weak too.","Doctor":"Hello,Sudden onset of left-sided chest pain at midnight should always be evaluated for heart diseases.

My PFT shows 26% lung capacity and my carbon dioxide/oxygen exchange last year was 51%, this year 41%.  My doctor expects a continuing degradation and under pressure admitted that I have probably 4 years left.  Should I obtain a second opinion?  What are my chances of obtaining a lung transplant?  Should I even bother to pursue this option?","Doctor":"Hello,Yes, you should definitely think about lung transplant. In fact, it is the only option of treatment for end-stage Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It is a chronic progressive lung disease. No treatment is available to halt the progression of the disease. Lung transplant is the only hope. So better to consult a transplant surgeon and discuss it.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I WAS RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH PLEURISY AND TOOK THE MEDICATION BUT THERE WAS NO RESULT. WHAT OTHER THINGS COULD BE GOING ON?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should definitely rule out heart and lung diseases for your symptoms because your symptoms are not improving with pleurisy treatment. So consult doctor and get done ecg and 2d echo to rule out heart diseases. Get done chest x ray to rule out lung infection and pleural effusion. If all these are normal then no need to worry for major heart and lung diseases. Sometimes simple musculoskeletal pain can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid movements causing pain. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest. Take simple painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs like ibuprofen and thiocolchicoside.

It's as though I'm losing fat from around my ribs/ sternum but nowhere else, and not losing weight.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.

Even when I am asleep my nose starts to bleed and I wake up due to the blood running down my mouth. Is this pneumonia?!

Recurrent nose bleeding with coughing are commonly seen with sinusitis. So better to consult ENT doctor and get done clinical examination and CT scan of paranasal sinuses (PNS).

First of all no need to worry for major heart and lung diseases because your all reports are normal. Sometimes undiagnosed stress and anxiety can cause similar symptoms like palpitations, breathlessness, gaseous bloating etc. So in my opinion, you should definitely consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too.

Bradycardia can be worsened by smoking and this can lead to death. So better not to take smoking any more.

Cannabis is centrally acting (acts on brain) abusive substance.It causes depression of brain centers including respiratory center.Respiratory is main part who regulates breathing.

For the diagnosis, you need to do ECG at the time of palpitation & tachycardia. If the duration of palpitations are short enough to reach a nearby hospital, we put a 24hr ECG monitoring (Holter Monitor). You also need to do a 2D Echo & thyroid function test to see for any associated abnormality if any.Also your bp is slightly higher. You should monitor it & it may require medication if it continues to be high. Till than decrease the salt intake.ThanksTake care"},{"Patient":"I am 36 years old I have chest pain with dry cough and fever.

After a sinus infection in Feb and again in May, had difficulty breathing. Both times dr thought pneumonia, but xrays were clear. The first time, I was off work two weeks and eventually the shortness of breath went away. This time, it persists. I have psoriatic arthritis boarding on lupus so Doc though might be related to that and scheduled apt with pulmonary medicine, but they can t get me in till July 21st. Ended up in er yesterday, thought was having heart attack, as heart was beating hard, couldn t breathe, tingling down the arms, but heart is fine. Today I had CTScan of lungs to check for possible PE, but can was good. My o2 sats have remained good throughout at 98-99. I get the numbness down the arms, pain in shoulders (right is worse and got shot in it), can t lay on by back cause arms go numb, sometimes feel like fire ants are biting me. Oh, and I sound like I have laryngitis...have since this started. Based on an xray back in Oct 2013, I have DDD with narrowing of C6-C7. It s my understanding that the nerves from that area go to the lung area and throat. Since pulmonary keeps coming up negative, is it possible it s actually related to the spine instead, and I should have that checked out further?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. No, I don't think your breathing difficulty is cervical spine related. Diaphragm is strongest respiratory muscle. It helps majorly in breathing. It is supplied by phrenic nerve ( C3-C4 nerve roots). So any pathology at C6-C7 level won't cause any abnormality in phrenic nerve functions.Since all your reports including CT thorax are normal and you are maintaining oxygen saturation (98-99%),no need to worry much for your breathing difficulty.Possibility of stress and anxiety related breathing difficulty is more likely. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Later that month, my gallbladder was removed, but my symptoms have remained. In February 2009 I underwent an Endoscopic Ultrasound, which revealed that I was born with a Pancreatic Divisem. Doctors ruled out that this was the cause of the symptoms due to the fact that my amylase and lipase levels are normal. To date doctors have been able to rule out the following as possible causes: GERD/Bile Reflux Esophageal Spasms Gallbladder Stones/ Dysfunction Pancreatic Dysfunction Cardiac Related Problems (Angina, Coronary Spasms, Pereicarditis, etc). Hiatal Hernia Achalasia Celiac Disease Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction Thyroid Condition Cancer Gastroparesis Since my symptoms started in May of 2008 I have been to the ER almost 10 times and  have had multiple blood draws for  (among others)  amylase/lipase, sprue panel, thyroid levels as well as CBC rate and hepatitis  and a H. Pylori stool sample. I have also had the following tests all which turned up negative: 07-08-08 Gallbladder Ultrasound 07-23-08  Endoscopy 07-28-08 EKG Stress Test/Pulmonary SVC 09-12-08 Barium Swallow 09-17-08 Hida Scan 09-26-08 Gallbladder Surgery 01-09-09 Chest MRI 01-19-09 EGD with MRCP 02-02-09  EGD with Ultrasound 02-06-09 Barium Meal (Gastric Emptying Study) 02-12-09 Small Bowel Follow-Through 02-17-09 EGD with Bravo Placement 06-15-09 Colonoscopy 03-16-10 EGD with Sprue Biopsy On May 19th 2008 my wife and I took a day trip to Tijuana, Mexico while on vacation in San Diego, CA.  Before crossing back over to the US, I stopped ate at taco stand close to the boarder eating two chicken tacos and two pork tacos along with two bottled Cokes. There were no immediate negative effects, but 24 hours later I was having signs of  food poisoning in the form of severe cramps, dehydration, nausea and diherria.  After a visit to the doctor's office I was given some anti-biotics and felt better generally except for a persistent gnawing at the top of my stomach. Another trip back to the doctor and I was diagnosed with gastritis, tested for H. Pylori and parasites and given a prescription for  general Protonix and anti-parasitic medicine. After a few weeks I began to feel better generally and went for a run. This proved to be a mistake because after the run the gnawing sensation returned. I went to the doctor again and this time was checked for gallstones through an ultrasound which came up negative. I was told to continue taking the Protonix and limit my diet to things containing low fat and low acid. That same day I began having severe chest pain, but being only 28 and in good condition assumed that it was nothing serious and after calling the doctor was told that it was most likely acid reflux or esophageal spasms. After a few more weeks of pain and no results from the Protonix I decided to switch to another general practitioner and was able to get in to see a GI specialist. After a barrage of tests ordered by both physicians in late September I had gallbladder surgery. When my symptoms didn't clear up after a few months I was subjected to more testing and tried various drugs to combat smooth and then skeletal muscle tension including nitro glycerin. My GI doctor has ruled out the need for an ERCP, claiming that because my amylase and lipase levels are steady and the risks for the test are too high. The doctor also claimed that I most likely had 'Heightened Viscera Noceception' (which from what I can tell, means absolutely nothing) and that I should get onto an SSRI to correct the problem. This idea was fast-tracked following an emotional breakdown after the death of my brother.  I was put on Paxil and Ativan for anxiety and told by my newly prescribed psychiatrist that my pain could be a constant series of anxiety attacks. I was on  these medications for eight months and even at maximum dosage  both saw no  significant improvement. In January 2010 I received the results of a blood draw from a third-party 200 Food Panel testing for  IgG. The test indicated that I had an alarmingly high intolerance for wheat, gluten and yeast. To confirm the results I saw a local allergist  who performed 50 panel skin prick test. This test came up negative along with subsequent blood-work and a biopsy taken from another EGD. I am currently looking into the viability of IgG food allergy testing and have been on a gluten-free diet for 2-weeks (with no results), with plans to remain on the diet for a least 8 weeks.

A reduced MVV implies that there is a limitation on your respiratory system. That could be in the lungs or outside of the lungs.

In that region there are also structures called lymph nodes, which are collections of white blood cells that are part of our immune system. Hilar fullness can be caused by enlargement of any of the structures in the hilum. Most commonly this is due to enlargement of the lymph nodes by infections. Unfortunately often the exact cause is not evident on a chest x-ray and thus a CT scan of the chest may be required to better assess the hilar fullness.

Lymphoma itself can certainly cause this, but even minor infections can do this as well. Aspiration of saliva that occurs during a seizure can cause inflammation of segments of the lung as well. The location of the opacities is sometimes helpful in differentiating. Also, their course over time can also be another factor to help differentiate causes. If it is lymphoma, it will not get better on its own and will need further treatment that can be discussed with the Oncologist. If it is an infection, it may improve or resolve.

I am trying to loose weight and be healthier and decided to climb 5 flights of stairs to the floor I work on. When I reached my floor I had short breath and coughed enough to cause gaging and slight vomiting. Why did that happen?","Doctor":"Acute bronchitis can cause significant respiratory symptoms including severe coughing. Exertion such as climbing the stairs stimulates your respiration, and this can cause your irritated airways to induce severe coughing. Severe coughing increases the pressures in your abdomen because of contraction of your respiratory muscles, and this can lead to vomiting. Keep in mind however that if you have significant shortness of breath, you should have a chest x-ray done to make sure you don't have pneumonia, which can be a complication of bronchitis. I hope this provides an explanation to your question."},{"Patient":"I am a white married 68 year old male. I haven t smoked since 1980. In June of this year I came down with pneumonia. 3 X-rays and 2 CT scans since I have a nodule in my upper portion of my left lung. They did biopsy on my lymph nodes and they came back negative. The nodule biopsy came back as a typical cells. now they want to do another CT scan with needle biopsy to get more information and next step would be take half the lung out to remove nodule. I am active and feel fine. My question is this, cant they just monitor the area instead of all these probes?","Doctor":"Diagnosing a pulmonary nodule can be a tricky feat. The best approach is to determine the likelihood of the nodule being cancerous or malignant. Having a smoking history is of course the strongest risk factor for cancer. The presence of atypical cells is also concerning for the possibility of cancer, although this by itself is not diagnostic. At this point, you can decide between removal of the nodule versus very close monitoring of the nodule with serial CT scans. Removal of the nodule may involve removing an entire lobe or just a segment, depending on the size of it. Monitoring with CT scans is an option, but you should talk to your doctor more about the characteristics of the nodule. There may be other factors that made your doctor feel that leaving the nodule there is risky. To summarize, both serial CT scans and removal of the nodule are options. Which one you choose should be based on the characteristics of the nodule, your risk factors, and the changes of the nodules on serial CT scans. I hope this provides some clarity to your situation."},{"Patient":"HI,I have recently had a malignant melenoma removed, sentinal biopsy is all clear, negative and wider incision negative, but about 6 weeks after I have had a kind of weird chest infection which wont seem to go away with very bad caugh although it has eased since, but I am also getting pain in my arm pits on and off especially when I stress out , could this be because of some lymphoma under the arms from the removal. Ken","Doctor":"Sorry to hear about your recent health worries. It sounds like you have some kind of respiratory infection, and this can cause enlargement of the lymph nodes near the arm pit (the axillary region). This is probably more likely than a new cancer or lymphoma causing enlargement of these lymph nodes.
