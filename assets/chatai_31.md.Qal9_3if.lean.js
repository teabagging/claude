There was chest discomfort; I was sweating and my pulse was going down. I almost felt like a heart attack, but, after a few minutes everything was normal. The next day I went to my GP to check and in ECG he found that I had irregular heartbeats. He referred me to a cardiologist, but I cannot see him due to lack of appointment. Meanwhile, I had palpitations and so I went to emergency. There they took many ECGs, blood tests, chest x-ray, etc., and according to them, everything was normal except my heartbeat, which was a bit higher around 110. So, they gave me beta blocker of 1.5 mg. I went to see my GP again and this time my heartbeat was irregular. I decided to visit a private cardiologist. He took ECG and echocardiography and found nothing wrong except little high BP. I took my reports to my GP and he took my ECG again. My heartbeat was irregular from time to time. I feel current or shock in my heart and different parts of the body. I am confused and do not know what to make of it. I am anxious sometimes and wake up with a racing heart. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen all your details. Revert with the details to a cardiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, This is for my husband. On Saturday, he had a master health check-up and a few values are not good. I would like to hear your opinion on those. He is 35 years old. His weight is 71.9 kg and height is 168 cm. The abnormal values are as follows: 1) Serum globulin 4.2 gm/dl - High (normal range 2-3.5). 2) T4 - 11.46 ug/ml - High (normal 4.6 - 10.5) whereas T3 and TSH are normal. 3) Vitamin D - 9.65 (low). 4) Serum HDL 34.9 (low) other triglycerides and LDL values are normal. 5) Vitamin B12 - 144 (low) (normal 180-914). Also, I attached his ECG where it was mentioned unconfirmed report. Please check and let me know the outcome of the report. He is an athlete who is active in a cycling race, running and swimming. But, he was out of the sport for one year and hence gained weight around 75 kg from 68 kg. Now, again he reduced 4 kg in the last three months. But he is following bad diet plans such as paleo one week, intermittent for the next week, proper balanced normal food for one week. Hence, I am really worried about his health.","Doctor":"Hi. I feel his low vitamin B12 levels may be linked to his paleo diet, which can be deficient in legumes, nuts (which are beneficial for the heart). He need not be so fastidious about the diet, I feel and vitamin B12 can be got from dairy products, eggs, fish, and chicken. His low Vitmain D levels are almost very prevalent in Indians, and basically this can be rectified by more outdoor activity, and if need 60,000 units of D-rise once per week for six weeks. His HDL levels are low and although his LDL (bad cholesterol levels) are also low, I would recommend daily exercise (half an hour daily) to boost HDL levels. His isolated High T4 levels, mean you need to check for a thyroid goiter and possibly do a thyroid scan, but it could also be linked to high globulin levels. Isolated high globulins need work up too, possibly disorders of immunity or rare disease like multiple myeloma (possibly consult a hematologist). I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 18 years old and studying for my final exams. My problem is exam phobia.

Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I completely understand that you feel concerned about your performance during exams. It might be due to the experience of failure in an exam or due to any negative experience related to your academics or school. Psychological assessment by a psychologist is needed to confirm the diagnosis and investigation related to anxiety during other social or performance is required. You need to go to a psychologist for complete psychological assessment. Then, you need counseling or psychotherapy sessions to overcome your phobia and anxiety related to exams.

I am on birth control and using the Nexplanon bar inserted into the arm postpartum. My issue is that I have started bleeding now. I am not breastfeeding and there is no milk production any longer. Is it possible to have your period soon after giving birth and while on birth control?","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, after childbirth, there is bleeding in the form of lochia (normal uterus discharge after delivery), which is normal and usually lasts three weeks where the endometrium is shed Also, breastfeeding promotes early involution of the uterus. So, it is advisable to continue breastfeeding for at least six months. In your case, you have stopped breastfeeding and introduced Nexplanon, a progesterone insert, which has a life of three years. For information, every progesterone based insert takes two to three months to adjust to the cycle and during that period spotting in the form of intermenstrual bleeding is common. It is advisable to practice barrier contraception for at least three months till the periods are completely stopped after the insertion of Nexplanon.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

If you feel you can cope up with it, please speak to your local physician or diabetologist. They would make a chart depending on your daily sugar levels, as to how much units of insulin would you require. Also, they would educate you regarding rotation of sites, for taking the insulin injections, how and when to take them.

I previously asked a query in icliniq and was attended by a doctor who advised as follows. Since all your reports are normal except for very mild anemia and a mild increase of WBC count, then the cause of your lower back pain that extends to your hip, thigh, and knees could be either sciatica or lumbar disc prolapse. This should be diagnosed by a CT scan of lumbar vertebra. You also need an x-ray of your hip joint to exclude osteoarthritis. For the anemia, you should take iron and folic acid supplements for a month. Last month I had pain in my legs, thighs, lower knees and in my back. I met an orthopaedician and find nothing wrong with the knee joint, PBH and lumbar spine. My USG abdomen and pelvis are also clear. Now my blood pressure remains high. I am feeling pain in my back, thighs, and legs below my knees. And I am feeling very weak. As per my last report, my WBC is high and hemoglobin is low (report attached).

After revising your x-rays (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it seems that you have degenerative changes in your knee joint and in your spines with diminished disc space between lumbar vertebra number 5 and spinal vertebra number 1. These degenerative changes actually indicated the presence of osteoarthritis which is a chronic progressive disease of joints. Treatment aims at stopping the progress and managing the symptoms, it should include analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroids, physiotherapy that should include stretching to improve flexibility and mobility of joints and excercising as well. As for your blood pressure, you should start a strict salt-free diet and monitor your blood pressure for 10 days, if still high then you will need an antihypertensive medication."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have got problems with four different teeth.

I get spells of lightheadedness, dizziness and sometimes, feeling nauseous. I am a university student and have got exams coming up. However, these are not causing me significant stress and my BP has not shot up this much before. I get fevers on and off and take Paracetamol for them. Just before this started, I was feeling extremely depressed and took eight 25 mg Phenergan tablets with two Co-dydramol tablets (500 mg/10 mg).

I have gone through all the reports of your father (attachment removed to protect patient identity). He has got a triple vessel disease and all the three major coronary arteries are critically blocked. The main problem before giving a suggestion is that you have not enclosed the report of his 2D echo and left ventricle ejection fraction is to be known before giving a valid suggestion. So, kindly enclose a copy of 2D echo of your father. As of now, I would suggest you to go for MICAS. MICS CABG (coronary artery bypass graft) or MICAS stands for minimally invasive coronary artery surgery. It is a relatively new and advanced technique of heart surgery by performing coronary bypass for coronary artery disease. In this technique the heart is approached through the side of the left chest through a small 4 cm incision. This cut is placed just under the nipple. The chest is entered between the ribs without cutting any bones and by splitting the muscle. Similar to a regular heart surgery, the operation is performed using all arteries or a combination of arteries and veins removed from the leg. The vessel from the leg in these operations is also removed endoscopically without cutting the skin over the leg. Highly advanced instrumentation and advanced techniques allow for the operation to be performed very safely. MICS CABG has several advantages over the traditional technique.  The best part is that all the blocks irrespective of their location in the heart can be bypassed in a safe and predictable manner. I think MICAS is a very safe option for him and much better than open heart surgery.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures.

Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning.

Last year, I had a cyst on my ovary and I had to undergo an operation to remove it. The doctors ended up removing both my ovaries. I was told to take Microgynon to balance my hormones. I have been very forgetful with my intake of the tablet for the whole year and have not been consistent. Now recently, as usual, I forgot to take tablets for a few days and started bleeding. I was worried it could be something more serious, but doctors told me that it was fine and it was because of the missed tablets. I have gained weight and my stomach appears bloated. At one point I was convinced that I was pregnant as I felt weird movements. The doctors did a scan and there was nothing wrong. I also went through a phase of fatigue. I sometimes get pain in my lower abdomen. I went to another doctor for advice as my cyst was never tested for cancer. He told me to go for thyroid, menopause and cholesterol test. I have not done them yet. They said that it may be the symptoms of menopause. I just wanted to enquire about my health, whether if this is really a menopause and the further steps to be taken. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, it is right. You can have these symptoms if you are going through a menopause. As both your ovaries are removed, you are going to end up in menopause. This is called surgical menopause. To decrease the symptoms of menopause your doctor prescribed you Microgynon (combination of Ethinylestradiol and Levonorgestrel). This is called hormone replacement therapy. Because of the absence of both the ovaries, the hormones are not produced in your body. Hence, it is replaced from outside in the form of tablets. Since you are not taking it on time, you are experiencing these symptoms. Thyroid problem and cholesterol levels are the other correlated problems that can be associated, so your doctor has asked you to do these tests. So remove your confusion. If both the ovaries are removed, then you cannot be pregnant.

Left ventricular hypertrophy is because of hypertension, however, ECG is just a baseline test of cardiology. The tightness of chest associated with sweating can be stable angina. Stable angina is chest pain or discomfort that most often occurs with activity or emotional stress. The most common cause of angina is coronary artery disease. I would suggest you two baseline test of cardiology. 2D echo and treadmill test are used to rule out the cardiac cause of chest pain. If there is ischemia to cardiac muscles, then it will be reflected in it. My advice is to get a 2D echo and TMT. Follow up with the reports.

I found out that I was pregnant about four weeks back. I had an ultrasound scan vaginally two days back, and the doctor did not find a fetus. She just found that I was five weeks and one day pregnant and not six weeks as we had thought. She has ordered an HCG test, and I have to go back to her next week. I am very much worried. I cannot even sleep. How normal is that the doctor does not see the embryo in the first five or six weeks? I love my baby already, and I cannot think of a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Currently, I am taking prenatal vitamins.","Doctor":"Hi. If she found that you are five plus one weeks pregnant, then that means she has found the gestational sac with some fetal tissue but no cardiac activity. I have to see the sonography report to comment on it. Usually, around four to five weeks, the fetal poles can be viewed. And around six weeks cardiac activity can be appreciated in the sonography. If not, then it can be a delayed pregnancy or there may be a decreased growth of the baby. There is nothing to worry about a delayed pregnancy. But, if there is a decrease in the growth of the baby, then it is a matter of concern. But you have to wait for a few weeks for confirmation. If the baby increases in size around six plus one weeks, then the baby is growing well, and there is no decreased growth. You do not have any choice other than to take medicines and wait for the next scan.

The stools used to be dark or red in color. It was difficult to pass unless I pushed extremely hard due to very dense or heavy stool. I had constipation almost daily for a few months leading up to seeing blood in the stool. Since I was very busy, I stupidly thought it was not a very big deal. I went to my local ER and answered all their questions to the best of my ability. I am 27 years old, nearly always tired even after a full night's sleep. I have body pain and the pain intensity is about 6 out of 10. The pain or discomfort is mostly in my lower left front side abdominal area, between the upper pelvis and bottom of the rib cage. It is extremely uncomfortable, but not really to the touch. I feel the organs inside are enlarged in the area of pain. The ER checked for anal issues and they did not seem to find anything, but they were very vague. They ordered an abdominal CT scan with contrast. The ER doctor told me that the CT scan showed nothing and I was frankly astonished. The ER doctor seemed reluctant to go into any sort of detail and seemed to be focused on getting me discharged as quickly as she could. I work with people almost every day and because of this, I do my absolute best not be a nuisance or a problematic patient. The ER doctor told me that I need to see a gastro doctor. My BP was 155/101 mmHg at the time of release. I really could not believe what was happening at this stage. I had a very kind and friendly nurse who came to remove my IV. I asked her what she thought this could be since the ER doctor did not indicate any possible diagnosi. Based on my charts or intake, she thought it could possibly be Crohn's disease. I was given my discharge papers very quickly. I was prescribed no medicine and told that my blood and urine tests were fine. I was not given a copy of the CT scan. I got home around in the night and promptly went to bed. I woke up the following morning feeling about more than two times worse than the prior day and reviewed my discharge papers. They were incredibly vague, included no test results, and a two-sentence note from the ER doctor that said I need to see a gastro doctor to get an endoscopy and a colonoscopy as soon as possible. Considering the vagueness of my discharge papers and how bad my experience in the ER was, I decided to see my GP. After telling my GP about my symptoms and my ER experience he was very concerned. I gave his assistant my release papers from the ER to try and help them figure out what was going on and they agreed that my ER experience was not satisfactory, to say the least. My GP was sent the CT scan copy from the ER. The GP told me that, it showed swollen lymph nodes throughout my intestines although he did not show me or release to me the imaging results. My GP was very reassuring and told me that the lymph nodes can get swollen one by one and it sets of a kind of chain reaction over time. They took blood and ordered a breath test for H. pylori and a test for Epstein-Barr. He asked what they prescribed me in the ER and when I told him nothing he was more shocked than I was and indicated that their conduct was unacceptable. The following day, I was told that the normal Epstein-Barr levels were 0-18 and mine was at 337. As of this moment, I am still waiting for the H. pylori test results. I honestly feel dead. I cannot function, and my left side pain is increasing steadily. My GP told me that the endoscopy and colonoscopy are both basically unnecessary and that I needed to change my diet to five to six small meals per day along with lean proteins and carbohydrates. GP prescribed me a seven day dose of Valtrex 500 mg three times a day for one day. The previous day the GP prescribed a seven day dose of Cipro 500 mg twice a day and a three day dose of Flagyl 500 mg thrice a day. I was told that he would call me as soon as he got the H. pylori test results, but I still have not heard from him. At this point, I feel lost and I am practically on my knees begging for any sort of help. I am trying to stay positive and strong but this is worse than anything I have ever endured. I am hesitant to annoy my GP and am scarred from my last visit to the ER. This is the first time I have ever consulted anyone online, so I apologize if this is either too vague, or too in depth, but I am desperate for answers. I also take Diazepam 5 mg thrice a day for anxiety, 2 mg Suboxone maintenance once a day and Vyvanse 40 mg once a day for adult ADD. Any help will be truly and greatly appreciated. Should I call my GP? Or should I go to another ER? I do not know if I am being paranoid or if I should be as concerned as I am now. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi.

It resulted from a shoulder stabilization 12 months earlier. I have had two surgeries for this. One to take the biopsies which diagnosed the infection and another to remove the sutures and clean out the shoulder joint. My surgeon chose to retain the three anchors against the wish of my infectious disease doctor. I have been on Penicillin for three months and my shoulder pain shows no signs of improvement. My CRP remains high, although it has been slowly coming down. The results have been 34, 30, 30 and 21. When I was first diagnosed I was told that the infection responds well to treatment, I would have a six week course of oral antibiotics and surgery, and then I would be fine. Now, three months got over and every time I see the infectious disease doctor and I just get told my CRP is not good enough and I was put on more antibiotics. I saw my surgeon again recently and he has finally accepted that the P. acnes is the cause of my pain and was not a contaminant. He is now saying that the anchors will most likely need to be removed if a prolonged course of antibiotics do not work. This is a major surgery as he will need to grind away the bone, because the anchors are tight. I will then need a bone graft as a big chunk of my glenoid will be gone. I really do not want more surgery as I have already had four in the past 18 months. I am wondering the likelihood of curing the infection with antibiotics. How long would antibiotic therapy typically be tried? And if it appears that the antibiotics are not working, then what are the implications of not having surgery or antibiotics and instead living with the infection? Other than continued shoulder pain, what are the consequences if we did not treat it? I am thinking it might just resolve on its own with time.","Doctor":"Hi.

Also in my lower back, I have been feeling a constant tremor that changes with position. When I lay down, I can still feel that tremor in my back. Sometimes, it feels as though my body jerks rapidly. If I close my eye, it gets even worst. It feels as though everything is wobbling. I was referred to a neurologist, but it has been extremely difficult to get in contact. I have been to an ENT specialist, who said my ears are fine. He then referred me to an ear, nose and throat institution and they said that I have vestibular migraines. But, I am not sure if it is this as I rarely get headaches. The ENT had no clue as to the back and leg issues and said that if I have migraines that it would not cause those other sensations. Everything started after having a jolt feeling in my chest and in the mid upper section. Doctors said it was bronchospasm. They gave me an inhaler, which never helped for really bad cough that I was having. And, I was also told that I have acid reflux as I was having extreme abdominal pain. I might also have a stomach ulcer and for which I am waiting for an appointment.","Doctor":"Hi.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it.

It all started 4 years ago when I woke up with my right eye blood shot. I was not hit or I do not recall any type of injury that caused this. My eye doctor sent me to a specialist. They could not see inside the eye for the blood. I left with eye drops for inflammation and for light sensitivity. About 10 days after I woke up with the bloodshot eyes, my eye pressure was really bad. The specialist had to go in surgically to remove the pressure. All went well and things seem to get better except for my eye would never clear up from being blood shot. About 1.5 months later, I got what I thought was a cold. After fighting it with over-the-counter stuff, I went to a local clinic to get some antibiotics. A month later, I got a cortisone shot and more antibiotics and that did it. I got well for the rest of that year. I continued to use the eye drops, but could not get rid of the bloodshot eye. A year later I got sick with a cold again, and this time, at the same clinic, they gave me a cortisone shot right away with the antibiotics. This did the trick again for another year. Now, when I get the cold, my sinuses go crazy with running nose and bad eye watering. I lost the vision in my right eye when I woke up that morning that started all of this. The right eye was a lazy eye all my life, so at best, I had 20/300 eye sight, legally blind. I had a little peripheral vision at best. Now also, when I get a cold and my sinuses are going crazy. My good eye is very sensitive to the light. As the cold seems to happen more and more, my eyelid has dropped and looks like it is almost closed like it did when I was a kid. I have been fighting this sinus thing now. I hate taking antihistamine and over-the-counter stuff to combat this. I have been to an allergy specialist and I was borderline allergic to a couple of things, but was not allergic to anything in particular. I had a prosthetic eye put in to help hold the lid up and make the right eye look close to the left eye, esthetically speaking. None of this has stopped the sinus from going crazy or stop me from taking antihistamine. Have you heard of anything like this? Could it possible that sinus next to my eye is causing this? I can put spray in my nose on my right side and almost taste it right away. When I put the spray in the left side, I do not taste the spray like that. One last piece of information for you. When I got my tonsils out as a kid, I had a polyp taken out of my sinuses.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome back to icliniq.com.

She had a minor heart failure with a BNP of 110. Recently, she had a bad UTI and asthma. Up to that point, her O2 saturation levels without supplemental oxygen were 95 to 96. Now that she is recovering from UTI, her O2 levels are 97 to 98 with 2 liters of supplemental O2 and her O2 level without supplemental O2 are between 88 and 92. All of these numbers are at rest. She does not do too much activity. What can be the contributing factor to this change? She had a chest CT scan and it did not show COPD. Should she stay on the O2? It is somewhat of a hazard. The tubing is difficult for her to handle. We must have someone with her all the time even throughout the night. We are concerned if she gets up to use the bathroom her foot will get caught on the tubing. She had a complete blood workup done. All the results were normal except that she is anemic. Currently, she is using nebulizer given by the primary care physician containing Ipratropium, Levalbuterol, Budesonide and antibiotics for recurrent UTI.","Doctor":"Hi. I do not understand the correlation between urinary tract infection (UTI) and low oxygen saturation. If the UTI has caused sepsis and multiorgan failure, then only it can affect lungs and saturation would drop. Asthma is a chronic disease and does not occur suddenly. She either had pre-existing asthma that got exacerbated by UTI or she had acute bronchitis or lower respiratory tract infection. I would recommend you go for a re-evaluation of her heart by 2D echocardiogram for her ejection fraction and for any signs of pulmonary embolism. If we do not treat the basic cause of falling saturation, we will not be able to come out of this problem. I would like to know whether you are treating her at home or hospital. Also, mention if you have her latest blood counts and urine test reports.

This is regarding my sister, who is 16 years old. When she was younger, we noticed she would have these moments where she would just blank out. There were no body movements or other concerns, she would just zone out for a few seconds. When we told her PTP these concerns, he played it off as her just being a kid and zoning us out. But as time went on, we knew it was not that. We found her a new PTP and he did refer us out to a neurologist. Before four months, we were told that she had petit mal seizures. We did notice that when she had a seizure she would say huh and what. But, that was all that changed and she would sometimes just zone out and just repeat this even if nobody was talking to her. The doctor wanted to start her with Ethosuximide 250 mg pill one in the morning and one at night. We noticed a great improvement. She still had the small seizures, but they were greatly cut down. But, she began to feel very tired, sleepy and would get headaches. On her next visit the doctor was not satisfied with the results. He said we would have to keep raising the amount of pills until she was 100% seizure free. But, I have read that some neurons are fine with an 80% improvement. Which is correct? I told him about her side effects, but he said it was normal. It would now be two pills in the morning and one at night. This is where we came to see some trouble. Her headaches began to make her cry. She started to fall asleep in class and would get just want to be left alone. We called the doctor, but we just got the nurses who said they will leave a note for him and get back to us. He never calls and would talk to us during her next appointment. As we could not like seeing her suffering, my mom told her to just go back to her one pill in the morning and one at night. She is still sleepy, but was not crying over headaches. On her next visit the doctor was under the assumption that she had continued taking the three pills. His concern was if that had eliminated her seizures, which had not. Just like when she was taking two pills, in the beginning, the seizures were drastically cut back, but they were still there. He decided to put her in Lamotrigine 25 mg. He said to go back to two Ethosuximide pills and when she finished what she had left to start on Lamotrigine. Then, her finals week came along. She was sleeping less and was always studying. One day, with everything going on she forgot to take her medication. The next morning at around 9, she still had not had the chance to take her morning pill when she had her first ever tonic-clonic seizure. Can this happen from not taking medication for one day? We took her to the ER. They ran some test and was told everything was fine and asked her to follow-up with her neurologist. I called the doctor and once again got the nurse. And was told while reading the notes, it seemed like he had wanted her to start her Lamotrigine pills while still finishing up on her Ethosuximide. They said they started her with 25 mg of Lamotrigine just to see if she did not develop a dangerous rash, but if not they would up her Lamotrigine dose. She had to take Ethosuximide until she ran out and would just continue taking Lamotrigine. She would be eliminating two 250 mg of Ethosuximide for one 25 mg of Lamotrigine. Will randomly cutting two Ethosuximide do her any harm? When I told my sister this she refused to even touch Lamotrigine. She has pretty worked up from the ER scare and says she does not want to go back if she gets the dangerous rash. She is currently taking two Ethosuximide. I have noticed we are back to about one small seizure throughout the course of a day or two. Since the neurologist told us she had to be 100 perfect seizure free, my mom was thinking of following the neurologist's request to have her take three pills, since with two she is still getting some seizures. But, she was wondering if instead of two in the morning and one at night can she take one in the morning and two at night? This way, if she feels sleepy she is at home and not school and can go to sleep. My dad also read Omega 3 is good. But he got supplements at claim to have 2,000 mg. Is that too much? I know this is a lot of information, but I really need some sort of guidance. This situation is stressing our whole family. Once again thank you for everything.","Doctor":"Hi.

That incident affected me very much and after that I am not willing to go anywhere. In the meantime, my mother had a problem. She had nipple discharge and so, doctors asked to check for cancer. I was very much worried about that. I cannot able to sleep at night. After so many tests, doctors told that was not a cancer, but duct problem and have to remove that. Then, I had that tension also about my mom's surgery. All these things again made me very depressed. Now, my behavior is not good and I can feel that. Even, I get angry with small things to my husband. I am always thinking about something, mostly my mother-in-law's fight and I am scared of small things. I broke my husband's mobile and feel guilty for that. I do not know what to do. Also, My husband losing control sometimes and in stress. Because of his mom and dad, we are facing this trouble. I cannot share these things with anyone. My friends are thinking that I am leading a happy life. I do not know how to come out of this.

HIV negative test report at 26th day post-exposure is quite assuring, but, a confirmatory HIV antibody test is further required at three months of last exposure. There are no specific symptoms by which we can diagnose HIV. The complaints which you are having could be due to multiple reasons and do not necessarily means HIV. For the complaints you mentioned besides getting tests for other STIs (sexually transmitted infections) like HBsAg (hepatitis b virus antigen), anti HCV (hepatitis C virus), VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory), gonorrhea PCR (polymerase chain reaction), herpes simplex 1 and 2, I also suggest you to get vitamin D3 and vitamin B12 levels.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent.

His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

And will the ovulation test show positive regardless of fertilization has occurred immediately? I had sex three days ago but the ovulation test still showed positive today.

Fertilization can happen within 24 hours after ovulation. Once LH surge happens ovulation actually occurs after 36 hours of LH surge. Ovulation test comes positive when LH surge happens. So you should have sex after two or three days of positive ovulation test. It is the most likely time of ovulation. But it is not confirmatory. Ovulation does not always happens after LH surge. Ovulation test does not have a relation with fertilization.

I assumed those were temporary and they did usually subside over time. Two weeks ago I took a pill and had worse symptoms. I had pain and discomfort inside my ears. My hearing was a little affected until three days ago, where it started getting worse, and has gotten worse in the last three days. My hearing is about 80% of normal. I have some pain and feel fullness in my ears. It is very uncomfortable overall. I have started researching this two days ago and found out that Cialis can cause permanent hearing loss, which is very scary. I also read that two things could potentially prevent some of the permanent loss of hearing, Prednisone and hyperbaric oxygen. But, only if they are given within about a month of the problem occurring. Today I went to the hospital to get checked, the doctor checked my ears and said he could not see anything wrong. He gave me a referral to an ENT. I was however able to convince him to prescribe me Prednisone 60 mg a day due to the time-sensitivity of this issue. Other than that, what should I do now? I have seen places that do hyperbaric oxygen where you go in a room for 2 hours, but I am not sure if those are legitimate and would work in my case.

My urine culture at first showed bacteria, but now they are not showing that I have an infection. I also used to be pain-free for one to two days after starting antibiotics. But, during the last three episodes, it has taken around 8 to 10 days to be out of pain. The most recent one did not show as UTI, but I was treated with Bactrim anyway. I got better after seven days, but then got yeast infection two days later and I was treated with Fluconazole. Once the yeast infection was gone, I started getting pain in my bladder, similar to UTI and it felt better when I empty my bladder, but not pain free. It is really bad first thing in the morning. I have an ache all day and it hurts more when I bend over. I have not had sex since the first UTI. Uristat, Tylenol and Ibuprofen did not help with the pain. I have also started to get a burning sensation when I urinate. Myself and my partner has been tested for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea within the last two weeks. It has been four weeks of dealing with this and I am getting worried that it is something other than a UTI because it came back without even having sex.","Doctor":"Hi.

Do you think that is possible? What else could it be?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case. In my opinion, there are two to three possibilities for the rash. First yes, it could be drug eruption as the rash is itchy and appeared after she took treatment for otitis. Drug rash can either occur immediately or even after six weeks. Second, it could be due to any viral or bacterial infection which first caused otitis and then the rash. But as she did not have a fever and there are no vesicles so in my opinion, it is not chickenpox. Third possibility is insect bite or papular urticaria. Last possibility is Gianotii crosti syndrome. It is common in children of this age group and rash in it is itchy. Please apply 1 percent hydrocortisone cream on lesions two times a day for 10 days.

When I was at school, I was messing around in the changing rooms one day after PE. When I went over on my ankle, I heard a loud crack and experienced instant severe pain in my ankle. When I tried to limp into the nurse room, I passed out in the corridor. I could just walk, but it was incredibly painful and I could put no weight on my ankle. My mother collected me from school and took me to my GP to have it looked at. My ankle was swollen, really badly on the outside (a lump) and on the instep was a long black bruise. My GP said it was just a sprain and sent me home with a support bandage. I remember it being a good while before I could really walk again. Fast forward 20 years and I still get pain in my ankle if I step the wrong way and it feels weak. I recently had to walk through an uneven field and it bothered my ankle a lot. It bothered me again last night. So, I was wondering if it was likely more than a sprain when I did it. The crack was really loud and I was quite annoyed my GP as did not even suggest an x-ray.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

You will need to visit a psychiatrist and he will prescribe you SSRI type of medicines (such as Escitalopram 10 mg, or Fluoxetine 20 mg, etc.) which will help with your problem. It basically happens when some neurotransmitters such as Serotonin reduce in your brain leading to a problem with handling the day to day stresses of life.

In addition to the medicines, if needed, you can also undergo a few sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy from a clinical psychologist.

It conducts annual full body MRI to detect anything early if it should arise. I had a 19 mm lesion laterally in the left kidney with signal suppression for three years. However, there is now a new 14 mm heterogeneously T2 hyperintense lesion at its lateral margin, which was not present previously. While this could conceivably represent a de novo cystic lesion, the contiguity with the fatty lesion raises the possibility of contained hemorrhage from an angiomyolipoma. The impression of the MRI was given as a 19 mm fatty lesion in left kidney associated with a 14 mm heterogeneously T2 hyperintense component at its lateral margin, suspicious for a small contained hemorrhage from an angiomyolipoma, though not specific for this. The left renal lesion could be further assessed at a targeted multi-phase contrast enhanced study. I have an allergy to iodine contrast; therefore the CT scan was canceled.

For that have to check clinically for any sign of vaginal tear or just bleeding from your uterus. If you have a doubt that last month had sex and can be pregnant, then do a urine pregnancy test. If negative, then you are not pregnant and it was either your period or bleeding due to masturbation. Cramping also can be due to your menstruation, as it may be going on and you will bleed in short time. In case of laceration of the vagina while masturbation also, you will get cramps.

I have been eating chicken/salmon mainly, fruits, veggies, and unsaturated fats mainly. I have been taking a couple weight loss supplements as well since yesterday. Before I took the supplements yesterday my lower part of my stomach has had a little pain. Is that because my stomach is trying to adjust to the change in my diet? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. First, I would appreciate the fact that you have switched from unhealthy eating habits to a healthy diet and healthy eating habits. Stay motivated. If a person had been into extensive unhealthy eating habits from a long time, it may be difficult for his digestive system to adjust. The digestive system needs some time to adjust if you have been eating a lot of fiber (fruits and vegetables) recently. Gradually increase fiber in your diet as your stomach needs some time to get accustomed to it. The pain may be due to more intake of dairy products. Increase dairy products gradually. Low or high intake of certain healthy foods can cause bloating or gas. But it does not mean that you should go back to unhealthy eating habits. The pain must not demotivate you. Consistency is the key. If the pain persists, make sure to go to a physician or GI specialist. Moreover, you can eat gluten if you do not suffer from gluten intolerance. You can eat oats, barley, whole wheat. Just do not eat refined flours and cereals. Do not fall into the trap of buying everything from the market that is labeled as healthy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I just got one side of my wisdom teeth removed both upper and lower six days ago, and I have another one scheduled after two days for the left side.

If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this?","Doctor":"Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

Or any other dermoatology cream can I use? My hands are also brown in color and full of tan. Do you suggest any creams to get fair? I want to become fair as my marriage is going to get fixed by next year. Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

You will need to visit a psychiatrist and he will prescribe you SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) type of medicines which will help with your problem. It basically happens when some neurotransmitters such as serotonin reduce in your brain leading to a problem with handling the day to day stresses of life. Medicines are usually given for two to four months and then tapered off slowly and stopped. The medicines I have mentioned are usually prescribed by psychiatrists. Apart from those, you can take Melatonin 5 or 10 mg. It is available in any decent pharmacy over the counter and does not need a prescription. You can try taking that daily at night. Apart from that, you can try some sleep hygiene methods like 1. Maintain good temperature, no noise or light. 2. One hour prior to bed, wind down and try reading or music. 3. Do not use the laptop, TV, or phone one hour prior to sleeping. 4. Avoid caffeine, alcohol or tobacco two hours prior to sleeping. 5. Avoid exercises three hours before sleeping and take warm milk at bedtime. 6. Go to bed only when sleepy and avoid other activities on bed. 7. Use bed only for sleeping or sex. 8. If you do not get sleep, do not toss and turn, get up, go to another room, walk about for 10-15 minutes and come and lie down. See for 10 minutes, if not sleepy go out again. 9. Try deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation techniques, or yoga or meditation.

Will it affect my future pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello. Actually, it is known that Isotretinoin can cause severe birth defects in the baby if taken during pregnancy. So, you must not take it, if you are pregnant. And if you have taken, then some doctor will advice termination also in early pregnancy. But, there is no study done specifically to find correlation between Isotretinoin and infertility. And if done, then there is no correlation found significantly. So, you can use Isotretinoin if you are not pregnant. If you are planning for pregnancy, then stop using at least two to three months before. If you have acne and you are taking treatment for that, then let me tell you that try to lose some weight if possible. It will also decrease your problem.

It feels unfamiliar and I can feel the roughness on the top of the tooth with my tongue.

I have a 5-year-old son and no abortion in the past. I have conceived naturally both times. My doctor has asked me to do either NIPT or CVS and I am not sure if I really need to do any. She has asked me to take Ecospirin 150 immediately if not doing CVS else start after CVS. I have some queries. Do I really need to go for either NIPT or CVS? Or I can forgo these tests? Should I take Ecospirin 150 as my previous pregnancy did not have any complications and at present also I am in good condition with no health issues (also I don't drink and smoke)? Are there any issues with my beta HCG and Papp-a value? Do you see any other concerns in my report? Please reply.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the report. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Now every laboratory has its own calculation methods to come to a risk ratio after the test. b-HCG and PAPP-A levels are also different at different times of pregnancy and also has some effects of weight and age on it. This is a genetic screening test. And we do this test to find out what is the risk of this pregnancy having a congenital abnormal baby. (Specifically Down’s, Edward, Turner, and Patau syndromes). This risk ratio has cut off values. Means trisomy 21 (Down’s) has a risk ratio of 1:365 in your case and cut off is 1:250. Now with this report, we are calculating the risk of having a baby with Down’s syndrome is 1 in 365 pregnancy with your age and with the test and ultrasound reports you have. We are calculating the risk and the report is always low risk or high risk. There is never no risk. Practically also after doing all available tests we never can rule out all the possible abnormalities in the baby. CVS (chorionic villus sampling) and sometimes amniocentesis are 100% if they found baby DNA in the procedure to rule out that the baby does not have trisomy 21 or other major chromosomal anomalies. That does not mean all genetic abnormalities are ruled out. Both of these procedures also have some risk of abortion during or after. And that is why we advise these test in high-risk double marker. NIPT (non-invasive prenatal testing) is also a screening test like double marker but the test is less risky as compared to CVS and amniocentesis but at the same time more costly. And test sensitivity to rule out trisomy 21 and other is 99.99%. After all these details you must be confused. Now other trisomies are definitely low risk but in case of trisomy 21, your report is 1:365 and which is somewhat near cut off 1:250. Ideally I advise further testing of CVS and amniocentesis if the value is below cut off value. But 1:365 is also near the cut off value. So it is a debatable issue. 1:365 means that out of 365 pregnancy 364 will be normal and 1 pregnancy will have trisomy 21. Secondly, you can start Ecosprin tablets. We usually start it in some high-risk patients. If you have pregnancy after 30 years then you come under high-risk group. So you should start it. In CVS there is chance of bleeding inside and that is why your gynecologist does not ask to start it if you are going for CVS. And every pregnancy is different. And we cannot say that if previous pregnancy did not have any problem nor the baby has any problem then this pregnancy will not have anything wrong. Yes, we can say that if previous pregnancy was normal then there is somewhat more chance that this pregnancy will also normal. Go through all details two or three times to understand it properly and then ask anything if you have more questions. I hope this helps. I am not able to open NT scan report. Yes, but the second report is saying that NT is 1.93 and nasal bone is seen. Mostly these two sonography markers are also used to calculate the risk in double marker apart from b- HCG (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) and PAPP-A (pregnancy associated plasma protein-A). Both NT (nuchal translucency) and NB (nasal bone) are normal."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I just got one side of my wisdom teeth removed both upper and lower six days ago, and I have another one scheduled after two days for the left side.

Again, I had sex in a gap of three days after the intake of tablet. I am really worried if I should take the pill again. This was a terrible mistake. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I am assuming that you have regular monthly periods. In that case, it is the time where you are going to ovulate. So, it is an unsafe period to have sex. And, if you have once unprotected sex and have taken I-pill (emergency contraceptive pill) once, then why to make mistake for the second time. Because, I-pill in itself is not 100% effective even if taken once. There is no study about two times taken I-pill. It works with two mechanisms. First of all, it will delay ovulation and second, it brings bleeding. So, if pregnancy happens, it resists implantation. In your case, if I believe that ovulation is delayed while you have taken the tablet, then it is good. If you have taken the tablet for the second time, then the ovulation is more delayed and period will be somewhat late with more chance of avoiding pregnancy. The second thing is that with I-pill your period cycle can become irregular. The chance of that increases more if you have taken two times. Because, it is a chemical (hormone), which is produced in your body to maintain your regular cycle. And, when you take it from outside it can disturb your normal cycle. If you do not want pregnancy in the first place, then either use condom or other method as preferred by you both after discussing with your doctor. I-pill is an emergency contraceptive and not a regular contraceptive pill that you can take as and when required. It should be taken when fear of failure of normal contraception is more.

I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.","Doctor":"Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this?","Doctor":"Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

I want to become fair as my marriage is going to get fixed by next year. Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects.

His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

I have been taking Risperidone 2 mg for 16 years, Escitalopram 10 mg for 7 years and for hypertension Met XL 25 mg for 5 years. My cholesterol levels are normal. I am a pure vegetarian. I do not smoke. I am not even an occasional drinker. My thyroid hormone levels are normal. I am not a diabetic, but my weight is 103 kg and my height is 5'7\\". I walk around 5 km for five days a week. I have been working in shift for the past 15 years. I am working as a senior engineer with full competence, but with little nervousness. I experienced delusions alone and not hallucinations when I was broken down for first time before 16 years when I was studying post graduation. Earlier than that, I used to suffer from severe anxiety. Before 8 years, with a doctor's prescription, I reduced Risperidone 1 mg to 0.5 mg and Escitalopram 10 mg. It proved fatal and relapse of delusion occurred. From then onwards, Risperidone 2 mg and Cita S 10 mg followed. I am a bit anxious, but mentally fine. Except the two above events, I never experienced delusions. Except obese, I have no other problems. There is no one to remind me for tablets as I am living alone. I am married, but my wife is working in another location. I am having one daughter, who is healthy and active. As there is a family history, from your answer only I do will decide about my daughter's higher study.","Doctor":"Hi. I am sorry to hear about your mental state, but at the same time I do appreciate you for being on regular medicines. However, even though your question is very direct, I am sorry to say that I cannot give you a straight forward answer or diagnosis. First and most importantly, I implore you not to go chasing after a specific diagnosis as the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) and other books that are used for diagnosing psychiatric conditions. They keep changing some criteria every decade or so. Hence, as long as you have understood that you have delusions which get better with regular treatment, that it is more insight than most people with your condition. Secondly, I cannot figure out why you want to link your daughter's career with your diagnosis. Please do let her live her own life. Though there is a genetic risk of schizophrenia in her, it is in no way a certainty. Now, coming to your actual question, if the delusions that you had were deemed bizarre by your treating psychiatrist, he would be right in fitting you into a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia even if you have not had any sort of hallucination. So, it would depend on the content of your delusions too. Apart from delusions and hallucinations, there are a variety of other criteria too, like disorganized speech or behavior or negative symptoms, which could give you a diagnosis of schizophrenia. So, once again, I would like to end my response saying that it would be best if you discuss the reason for your diagnosis with your treating psychiatrist. But, please do not let it affect your daughter's future in any manner. Take care. For more information consult a psychiatrist online -->  To rule out any congenital syndromes.

I do hiking and exercise daily. I also do the Kegel exercises faithfully. I have read several ways to do them and I can locate the sphincter muscle. After the surgery, besides the catheter, I had a drain tube from my chest. For the two days in the hospital, it drained at least a cup a day. On the second day, as I was leaving, the nurse took out the drain. I traveled six hours to my home. Upon arriving, I noticed that the scrotum had swollen and my penis had shrunk. By the end of the next day, it had swollen so much that I could hardly walk and if I scratched, it would bleed. I called the surgeon, and he was not concerned. The next day, I was in very much pain and could not reach the surgeon. That evening, I called my regular doctor who told me to go to ER. The next day, they did a CAT scan and found a lake at the bottom of my abdomen, but told not to worry as my scrotum would not explode. Four days later I saw the surgeon, who told me to increase the diuretic that I was using to reduce blood pressure (Hydrochlorothiazide). I increased the dose from 50 mg once a day to 150 mg. After a week, I suffered from severe cramps. My surgeon told me to eat bananas. I did and there was no change. So, he lowered the dose to 100 mg. After three weeks, the scrotum returned to normal, but my penis was shrunken from about 4 to 5 inches to less than an inch. Today, I can stop the urination with mental concentration, but the sphincter does not seem to get the signal from the bladder. My penis is now about one inch. I am socially isolated because of the smell. I cannot continue my professional speaking to promote books. My surgeon says sorry. In a year, I can be put in with an artificial sphincter. Do you think the lake in my abdomen caused the problem? Do you have any suggestions? Currently, I am taking Atenolol 50 mg, Amlodipine or Olmesartan 5 to 40 mg and Simvastatin 20 mg. The blood examination revealed all parameters within the normal limits.","Doctor":"Hi, Relax and do not worry. Urinary incontinence is a major complication of radical prostatectomy. It happens in 90 percent of the patients. Your urinary incontinence is not related to the lake in the abdomen. Usually, urinary incontinence will be present till one year in almost every patient who undergoes prostate surgery. The best solution is to do the Kegels exercises properly. Your sphincter might recover by one year. Regarding the penis size also, you do not have to worry as it will recover with time. I can give you some temporary solutions so, that your quality of life becomes better and you can do your daily work. I suggest you use a penile clamp. It is an external clamp like device, which you can apply daily to prevent incontinence. It will stop the urine so that at least you get time to go to the bathroom. You can also use a condom catheter. It is also a good option as you can wear it every time and go outside so that the urine drain continues through a condom catheter into urine bag, which will be attached to your leg.

By the way, she did not shave her pubic hair and it was a turn off for me. Moreover, when I try to wear a condom, it makes me loss erection. I feel bad and afraid to have sex for the next time.

I am a patient of PCOD. I also have a family history of breast cancer. My father's sister had breast cancer recently. I am in a very big financial crisis. So, one of my friends suggested me to donate eggs. Will it be risky if I donate my eggs only once? As I am a patient of PCOD, will I be able to conceive in the future? Will I be given some hormonal treatment to conceive later? Please advise me whether I should proceed with the idea of egg donation. Is there any chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer if I donate eggs? Please guide me. I just want to know about its long term consequences as I am afraid of breast and ovarian cancer.","Doctor":"Hi. A single cycle of ovulation induction for egg donation and then, possibly in the future for yourself would not increase your chance of breast or ovarian cancer. The heredity for a woman is decided from her maternal background and not from the father's side. So, if your paternal aunt had it and your mother or maternal grandmother did not have it, then there are very minimal chances that you should get it in future. You can safely go ahead with an ova donation if you wish to without fear. PCOS - polycystic ovary syndrome is a disease, which can be controlled and many women had a natural conception without hormones. So, whenever you decide to get pregnant, conservative management of treatment can always be considered.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

Welcome to icliniq & thanks for the query. Recurrent boils can be a nuisance. It is a bacterial infection of the hair follicle and can cause painful pus filled eruptions on the body. If you are having frequent recurrences it could be because of persistent infection or reinfection. Are you diabetic or atopic? If so, you may be more prone to develop recurrent bacterial infections. You mention seeing pus coming from many openings which indicates it could be a carbuncle. This may need incision & drainage. Ideally a pus culture should be done to know the sensitivity of the organism and antibiotics started accordingly to completely treat the infection. Usually penicillins, cephalosporins or tetracyclines are used orally. Application of mupirocin in the skin fold areas helps to eradicate the colonising bacteria in these locations.

Before joining the new organization, I had a stable blood pressure (less than 118/75 mmHg). About five months back, I felt feverish and visited a hospital for the same. That time, I came to know that my blood pressure had risen to 145/85 mmHg. Since then, my life has never remained the same. My parents are not hypertensive. I was having chest pain and sleeping problems from then. I was given Nifedipine for blood pressure and Lexotan for sleep. After taking these two drugs for two days my condition got worsened. I started having anxiety. I reported back to my doctor. In fact, I personally stopped using those drugs. My BP dropped to a range of 125-130/87-80 mmHg. Since I was not comfortable with the blood pressure, I bought a blood pressure monitor to check at home. I am a food technologist. So, I started working on the food I eat. But, my sleeping problem and anxiety worsened. So, I decided to take my annual leave and that was about three months back. After resting for a month, my blood pressure dropped to 110-118/75-72 mmHg. My BP dropped without any drug, only with the inclusion of fruits and vegetables in most of my meals. I resumed work around two months back. In the first week of this month, my blood pressure had started rising again. I have been looking for a new job, but you understand the economic crisis now. I feel the shift in work is not good for my system. During the morning shift, my blood pressure ranges from 140-125/85-80 mmHg. During the night shift and off days, the BP ranges between 112-119/75-78 mmHg. What could be the cause for this rise in BP? I was thinking that maybe the restaurant food I consume during the morning shift as the probable cause because during a night shift, I eat at home.

Just from yesterday, I started spotting and had the worst cramps I have ever had. Today, I continued with the spotting and cramps and I started throwing up everything I ate. Is it possible that I could be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. I presume the birth control that you mentioned is about oral contraceptives pills. Sometimes, it is not uncommon to have spotting while you are on pills, especially if you miss a few of your pills and again start taking the rest. At times, it is possible to have some breakthrough bleeding even if you have not missed your pills. It is very unlikely to get pregnant if you are taking your pills regularly. But, if you do fall into the unfortunate group, who do get pregnant even after taking their pills regularly, I am afraid it is a concern as the incidences of pregnancy in abnormal sites (ectopic pregnancy) are common. So, I suggest you visit a gynecologist at the earliest to rule out the same.

I was into remission within a week but the disease relapsed while on the full dose. Cyclosporine was added and steroids were tapered to 0 within six months. Recently, last month I had an injury during a MMA (mixed martial arts) fight and since I was to run a 5k military obstacle marathon in the coming week I decided to consult a doctor. The consultant was a third year PG who was my sister's senior in medical college. While there was not any signs of injury he noticed changes of avn in left femoral head. I had an MRI the same day that showed stage 1 avn with kerboul angle of 205 in the right hip and stage 2 with angle 170 in the left. I recently underwent core decompression in bilateral hips. What are the chances of the disease reversing its course? And if I do require a hip replacement will I be able to do high impact activities with it? I am really worried since I am only 23 years old. I have uploaded my post core decompression x-ray. What are the chances of prognosis in my condition?","Doctor":"Hello. AVN (avascular necrosis) of the hip is usually due to a number of causes. Prolonged steroid intake is one of them. The treatment of AVN hips ranges from rest, core decompression and eventually hip replacement. Since you have had stage 1 and 2 in your respective hips, core decompression was a good choice. This procedure involves drilling one larger hole or several smaller holes into the femoral head to relieve pressure in the bone and create channels for new blood vessels to nourish the affected areas of the hip. When osteonecrosis of the hip is diagnosed early, core decompression is sometimes successful in preventing the collapse of the femoral head and the development of arthritis. Core decompression is often combined with bone and cartilage grafting to help regenerate healthy bone and support cartilage at the hip joint. A bone graft is a healthy bone tissue that is transplanted to an area of the body where it is needed. The tissue may be taken from a donor (allograft) or from another bone in your body (autograft). Core decompression prevents osteonecrosis from progressing to severe arthritis and the need for hip replacement in some cases. Your x-ray does not appear too bad and I am hopeful that core decompression could help in reversal.

I have seen the reports of echocardiogram (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The patient has a condition called patent ductus arteriosus. Usually ductus arteriosus closes at birth of a baby, but sometimes, it remains patent and does not close naturally. This condition is called patent ductus arteriosus. Labored breathing and poor weight gain are the earliest signs of PDA. An uncorrected PDA may lead to congestive heart failure with increasing age. PDAs can be closed by percutaneous interventional method (avoiding open heart surgery). A platinum coil can be deployed through a catheter through the femoral vein or femoral artery, which induces thrombosis (coil embolization). Alternatively, a PDA occluder device composed of nitinol mesh is deployed from the pulmonary artery through the PDA. The echo of the baby shows left-to-right shunt. It is a good time to do the surgery as after a particular time due to right ventricle hypertrophy the shunt reverses itself, which is called reversal of shunt and complicates the prognosis. If left untreated, the disease may progress from left-to-right shunt (acyanotic heart) to right-to-left shunt (cyanotic heart) called Eisenmenger's syndrome. Pulmonary hypertension is a potential long-term outcome, which may require a heart or lung transplant. Another complication of PDA is intraventricular hemorrhage. Patent ductus arteriosus. surgery.

Or can I consider this test as conclusive? Later, I got two swellings one in my hand other in my neck. The swelling in the neck went off in two days. Again I get some sort of swelling in hand and in the leg a small size lump appeared, and it disappeared within few hours. I am noticing this happening frequently from three days, however, two of such lump have turned red. Earlier, I used to get infected very easily by cold and throat infection even before I had sex. Could that be a pre-existing immunodeficiency? Given all this, can I conclude that HIV Elisa test (12 weeks after sex, 89 days after sex) as conclusive? Or should I have another test after six months? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me answer your question step by step: 1) Your chances of contracting HIV or for that matter any other STI (sexually transmitted infection) was non-existent with the consistent and corrective use of a condom. 2) You had mentioned that there was a slight slippage of the condom and it is assumed that you had a low risk of contracting HIV or any other STI if the other person will be having it. 3) The ELISA testing kits for HIV used these days are highly sensitive and specific and gives accurate results. 4) Your negative HIV test at three months of exposure is highly conclusive of your negative HIV status. 5) Majority (99.9%) of the people who are infected with HIV after exposure, develop antibodies by three months. So, your negative test result is quite reassuring. 6) There are very rare cases of late seroconversion or positive antibody response at six months has also been reported in the literature. 7) There are recommendations and I also suggest to my patients to repeat the rapid HIV antibody test at six months of last exposure and if that will be negative, you need not to repeat it further. 8) The symptoms which you have mentioned could be due to various other causes or just due to anxiety also. There are no HIV specific symptoms or signs. Relax, as you have crossed three months hurdle. I suggest you to get your routine hemogram, biochemistry, fasting blood sugar, thyroid profile and lipid profile done. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My relative has got heart attack some days before. I have his reports. We need a second opinion about surgery whether he should go or not.

For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 33 year old female. I have been getting shingles since I was 6 years old. Until high school, I would get it once a year around the same time. Then, I began getting it twice a year. As I got older, I started getting multiple outbreaks in a year. I have had shingles for 27 years. This year, I had four outbreaks that occurred once in every three months. In the past, my doctor was against vaccinating me because it was not tested on anyone under the age of 50 or 60. With the multiple outbreaks over the past two to three years, we discussed it again and we decided that it might help. Previously, I had taken Famvir and Hydrocodone. Currently, I am continuing the same medicines for shingles outbreak. I had undergone a wellness checkup a few months back and all my laboratory test results were normal. In your opinion, do you think that the vaccination would help me? Are there any concerns or issues about a person of my age getting the shingles vaccine? I am not currently pregnant, but could possibly want another child in a couple years from now. Could the vaccination have any effect on future pregnancy or children? I trust my doctor and know he has my best interest in mind; I just wanted a second opinion as this vaccine has not been tested on anyone in my age group.","Doctor":"Hi. From the history, it is apparent that you are getting frequent recurrences of shingles, which have increased in the recent past. Shingles occur when your body immune system is low. I am not aware if you are on medication as that may lower your immune system (except for steroids that you are taking for acute attacks). As your physician rightly said, varicella vaccine is not recommended below the age of 50. Logically, vaccination at this age may provide relief from frequent recurrences, but I do not have enough literature or evidence to support this. You may go ahead with the vaccination after detailed discussion with your doctor. The point of caution is to make sure that the vaccination is given when an acute attack is not there and when you are not on steroids or any medicines which considerably reduce body's immune system as it is a live vaccine. As far as pregnancy is concerned, you can plan the same. But, you may require frequent visits to your obstetrician for close supervision as the effects on the fetus cannot be ruled out.

All types of nuts have healthy fats in them which have been proved to be healthy by a bundle of researches done over the years. They do not have cholesterol and the fat in them does not lead to weight gain. Instead, studies are consistently showing that nuts lower the cholesterol levels of an individual. Nuts can prove very beneficial to have satiety (satisfaction) and in improving your blood glucose levels. They can control your hunger prangs while providing you satisfaction. In this way, they can assist in weight loss. You can include nuts in your breakfast or can consume it as a snack in between meals. You can eat a handful of them or you can add them to your cereal, plain cornflakes, weetabix, porridge, sagudana, kheer, gravy or raw/boiled salads. You can also consume them in the form of milkshakes e.g. almond milkshake or you can simply mix almond or walnut powder in milk and consume it as a mid-morning snack or as an evening snack or before bed. Homemade almond or peanut butter is also good. You can use honey or brown sugar 1.5 tablespoons on a daily basis. Include seeds in your diet (basil seeds, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds). You can season them on your salads, in your milk, milkshakes, yogurt, porridge. Basil seeds need to be soaked in water before use. Chia seeds are eaten both raw as well as soaked. Pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds are eaten raw. Use olive oil. Season it on your salads, egg, toast, fish, lean meat. Extra virgin olive oil can be used for cooking as well. You can use edible corn oil, sunflower oil, mustard oil, soy bean oil for cooking. Add more vegetables and fruits in your diet. Use more green leafy vegetables. Add whole grains in your diet (whole wheat, oats, barley). Do not use refined and polished flours. White flour is also a refined flour. Use fish, poultry, red meat (use lean cuts). Use low-fat dairy products and sugar-free as well. Strain milk before use. Make home-made yogurt using strained milk. Do not drink any kind of juice or fizzy drinks. Juice made from juicer is also not allowed. If one wants to drink juice, simply add one recommended fruit in water and grind it in a milk shake jug. Do not add sugar. You can use boiled rice or tarke wala chawal twice a week only (one small plate). Do not consume rice in dinner. I hope this helps. Do not add sugar or artificial sweeteners in your daily foods. Do not use commercially prepared nut spreads. Do not use nuts with sauces, mayonnaise as both of them are fattening. Do not use nuts with added salt in them if you suffer from high blood pressure. Do not use margarine. Do not use flavored cornflakes. Limit the consumption of canned and tinned foods, biscuits, cakes and desserts."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My father, who is 71 years old, has a problem of shaking hands for the past 4 to 5 years.

I am neither easily fatigued from being active nor do I ever feel breathless other than normal. There is no history of peripheral artery disease in my family or coronary artery disease and to my knowledge; there has been no heart attack in my family or episodes of sudden cardiac death. I am a non-smoker and I do not drink alcohol. My concern is that I suffer regularly with aches and pains in my legs, soles of feet, arms, shoulders and my chest. I do suffer costochondritis. The pain is never severe; it is more of a dull ache or a pulling sensation. If I had to rate the pain out of 10, I would say the discomfort is not more than 1 or 2 and maybe 3 at the worst. I feel that I have severe health anxiety and I do regularly check my pulse, blood oxygen and blood pressure. I have had numerous ECGs and of which, I will attach three for your reference. I have also had a coronary calcium score before 5 years, which was zero. I have had every blood test, including cardiac enzymes a number of times and my blood work is always normal except for borderline low testosterone. My cholesterol also in borderline and I am managing it through diet. Initially, I had chest pain before six years. I had a consultation with my GP and he organized a coronary calcium score due to a dramatically elevated cholesterol level. CCS was normal and I began a treatment of Atorvastatin. There was no further issue for the next three years. Then, when I was involved in moving a disabled person from a high rise apartment and was lugging furniture and other household items up and down five flights of stairs, I felt unwell, chest discomfort and pain in the arms. Also, I felt dizzy and fast pulse. I attended A and E promptly and they performed an ECG. But, it showed nothing and cardiac enzymes were also normal. The only thing there was an inverted T-wave, which the cardiologist was not concerned with as it was only in one lead. Two years ago, I attended A and E again with chest pain. Another ECG was performed along with a chest x-ray and all of which were normal. I was kept in overnight for routine observation and in the morning I was visited by a cardiologist. He felt that the issue was muscular and not cardiac in origin and I was subsequently sent home. Before 10 months, I attended my GP surgery to discuss my past and was told that it was a likely anxiety disorder. To settle my mind, I asked my GP to perform an ECG and the machine autogenerated a diagnosis of possible peri-infarction age undetermined. This subsequently triggered a panic episode. My GP checked it and said if I had been presented this ECG without the autogenerated diagnosis then he would say it was a perfectly normal ECG. As I asked for a second opinion, he sent my diagnosis to a cardiologist. The reply sent was I find it highly unlikely that this gentleman has ever had an MI. However, if he is still concerned, then consider a referral for stress echocardiogram. I opted for the stress echo. When I met with the consultant cardiologist, he told me that it was not anything to worry about as everything appeared normal and was basically an anxiety based. He advised no further tests necessary and discharged me as healthy with a diagnosis of GAD. Before three months, I attended A and E with chest pain and discomfort following a stressful day. Another ECG was taken and everything was normal apart from Q waves in lead 3. A and E consultant examined ECG and reported no change from earlier ECGs. A month later, I had an ambulance call out to the home address. Two ECGs were taken in one hour difference. The first again showed inferior infarction, age undetermined and QRS duration (corrected) 491 ms. Ambulance crew said it is fine and otherwise a normal ECG. All other observations are normal with oxygen 99% and somewhat high BP. It was likely anxiety again. The second ECG showed a normal QRS duration and no other issues. I was advised to see GP for anxiety medicines I visited my GP last month. He repeated ECG again and it was normal. He gave me Sertraline and said based on my entire history that it is definitely not a cardiac chest pain. From last month, I started a new job at the hospital. Due to shoulder pain and leg pain, I attended A and E and an ECG was performed allegedly and it did not show any of the previous Q waves from earlier ECG's and appeared completely normal. The cardiac enzymes were taken and were reported normal. The final diagnosis was anxiety. Yet, again, I attended A and E in the last month as my fitbit showed that my pulse was elevated to 159. When I rushed to A and E, my pulse was 144. On arrival at A and E, I had my BP taken 154/94 mmHg. My spo2 was 100% and pulse was 114. Another ECG was performed and the nurse informed me that everything normal except QTC. So, I was asked to repeat an ECG by the consultant there. The second one was reported to be normal. In the meantime, I had panicked and checked on the internet regarding QTc durations and learnt about sudden cardiac death due to the long QTc syndrome. The nurse very bluntly told me that it was very highly unlikely to happen to me as I had no other symptom. Again, I was just diagnosed with anxiety. I have still been getting the pain in the back of my leg, around the sole of my foot, shoulder and a very slight ache in my jaw. Also, I feel some chest pain, but I relate this to my costochondritis. Please be aware that all the pain mentioned above is the same that I have presented with for a number of weeks or months and have attended A and E. Is it true that all this can be due to anxiety? Should I worry about QTc? Does my ECG look like I have ever had a heart attack? What could be causing the other pains? Sometimes, while taking a rest, my fitbit reports my pulse to be as low as 54 and when walking my pulse tends to be around 114 to 120 bpm. When it is around 120, I can feel my heart beat. One thing that is new and has recently nerved me is the ability to hear my pulse most often after running up my flight of stairs from living room to bedroom. The heartbeat can be heard externally for only a few seconds, maybe 10 at the most and then settles back to normal. This incidence occurs when I am highly anxious, during pre-anxiety attacks and only when I have done something like running upstairs. Recorded pulse during this audible heart beat is usually 120, but then within 2 minutes again that will drop to normal range. In fact, I have clocked my pulse at 136 and after 30 seconds it has dropped to 96. I am just concerned about the actual audible heartbeat. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. It is good to see your detailed history for which I have asked for. Firstly, your ECG is perfectly normal. For anything to be wrong in case of ECG, the changes should be present in at least two consecutive leads at a time. In your case whether it is a T-wave or Q, it is always there in one lead, which does not signify anything. As your stress echo and all cardiac enzymes are normal (far superior to ECG in diagnosing a problem) you are cleared from cardiac side. Secondly, you say that you were prescribed statins (Atorvastatin). One of the most common side effects of statins is myalgia (pain in a muscle or group of muscles). The generalized body ache and dull aching in nature is a characteristic feature of myalgia. I request you to consult your doctor and immediately stop Atorvastatin. Also, get your liver function test done. 1. Myalgia induced by statins. 2. Panic disorders. 3. Obsession induced anxiety. Liver function test.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

Regarding maintaining a normal body weight: If she can eat and drink and has no major disease process going on in her body, then I never recommend supplements and medications for the purpose of weight gain or keeping weight within normal limits. Diet Suggestions for her: 1. Taking plenty of water, fresh fruit juices made at home, salads and healthy diet. A healthy diet should include a good proportion of proteins like fish, eggs, meat, nuts, beans and wholegrain foods. 2. Say no to alcohol and cigarettes. 3. Avoid excessive tea, coffee, chocolates etc and other caffeinated drinks. 4. Avoid beverages of any kind including energy drinks. 5. Take zinc containing foods like oyster, chicken, nuts and beans, red meat, vegetables and salads and whole grain foods. You need zinc for normal hormone levels too and for good health. 6. Avoid fast food, refined meats, fried foods. Say no to extra sugars and salts. Physical Activity: 1. Without regular physical activity, she cannot get in shape and cannot maintain her body weight in limits. 2. Ask her physician for the ideal body weight goals and body mass index. I need her age, weight, height, waist circumference if you need any guidance from me in this regard. 3. Jogging, yoga, meditation, cardio exercises and aerobics are all good activities for her healthy heart and body.

I have seen the attachment. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The USG (ultrasound) abdomen and the TMT (treadmill test) are not cause for concern. The prostatomegaly (i.e prostate enlargement seen on the USG has been correlated with a normal PSA level). The high hemoglobin 17 gm% may cause symptoms due to clotting and blood sludging like headaches, chest pain and sometimes stroke. So that you should need to be evaluated by a hematologist. If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking as that too could cause high hemoglobin levels. Low vitamin D levels are seen very commonly in India. You can do some running, getting at least half an hour exposure to sunlight, and take D-rise 60,000 Units per week for six weeks to improve these levels. Do not worry about cystatin C as your GFR (glomerular filtration rate) is normal. The cholesterol especially the LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is worrisome. I would advocate daily aerobics for half an hour, stop fried foods and bakery foods, more nuts and green leafy vegetables. If you want to take a medicine to lower cholesterol then Rosuvastatin 10 mg would be good. The creatinine is again a value and eGFR being normal I would not advise anything, but if you wish further information you could consult a nephrologist."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,What are the long-term consequences of bad posture? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hi. Poor posture is likely to cause structural changes or fixed musculoligamentous issues. The outcome and timing is dependent on the starting point. By this I mean, if this starts in early childhood, one will notice the changes by late adulthood. The severity of symptoms and actual clinical effects do not follow a straight line path and many other factors, including genetic, environmental, etc., play important roles in expression of symptoms. Further, the cause of poor posture such as muscle weakness, bony cause, trauma, neurological. etc., have their own natural history. Poor posture is likely to cause backache, stiffness, increased likelihood of sustaining injuries to the hip, knee and shoulder, appearance anomalies, etc., and in extreme cases, breathing problems due to sustained pressure and lack of space for expansion of the lung.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

The cervical MRI showed severe stenosis and disc herniation at the C6-7 level going right and C5-6 going left. The worst symptoms were numbness, tingling, and weakness down the left arm. These symptoms really did not follow the C5-6 dermatome, however. They were all over the place in the left arm. Six months later, the numbness and tingling have resolved. I feel stronger overall. However, I have had body-wide fasciculations for four months. And I can see wasting of the first dorsal interossei muscle of the left hand. It is subtle, but I notice it. I have trouble holding a pot or a phone with elbow bent past 90 degrees. I have seen two neurologists including one neuromuscular specialist at an academic center. Both EMGs were clean. They needed the dorsal interossei muscle and all the other major muscles of the left arm. Clinical exams were also normal though benign fasciculations were noted. How do I know that I do not have ALS? What are the chances that these fasciculations are benign given the perceived weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations (body-wide)? How long does it take after the beginning of atrophy for an EMG to pick up ALS? What else could this be? Would not it be odd to develop ulnar neuropathy, worsening rotator cuff issues and bodyside fasciculations at the same time? I am not a doctor, but these seem like system wide problems. Currrently, I am taking Lamictal, Zaleplon and Lipitor.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. It is highly unlikely that the EMGs (electromyography) are clean in the presence of muscle wasting and fasciculations. I believe the symptoms and signs you are experiencing are due to cervical stenosis and not due to ALS. A C6-7 disc herniation can cause all the symptoms you have described. Is it possible for you to upload the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) pictures? In ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), usually, EMG findings precede clinical symptoms such as fasciculations and muscle wasting.

As he also has GERD (gastroesophageal reflux) and hiatal hernia, he needs a proper time to time follow up with a gastroenterologist. 1. Endoscopic nasal septoplasty and polypectomy are the surgical procedures needed. It can be handled with care by experienced hands of an otorhinolaryngologist. 2.

There are different types of power chains that are available for the treatment depending on the interlink space. 1. Short (connects every alternate bracket). 2. Long (connects every third bracket). 3. Closed (connects each bracket). So depending on the stage of your treatment, either of the types can be used which may or may not connect individual brackets.

At first, I was excited then I realized that I went into a very hot sauna (90 degrees) celsius for one and a half hours when I was around 4 weeks pregnant (2 weeks from conception). The whole point of the sauna is to detox, and I definitely was overheating (sweating and red-faced). I did however take two breaks where I jumped in cold water to cool down. Anyways, I read that overheating when pregnant can cause horrible neural tube damage that can lead to birth defects especially in these crucial early weeks when it is forming. My question is how worried should I be? Should I go to a specialist for this? Is it so bad that I should consider termination? My first scan is at 12 weeks and that is the only time I will be able to ask anything and I will be worried it is too late.","Doctor":"Hello. Neural tube defects (NTD) in the baby mostly occur in women deficient in Folic acid, or who are diabetic, or if they have any family history or as an associated defect with other chromosomal anomalies. Yes, the baby's organs do develop in the early weeks of pregnancy, and any extreme exposures can pose risk for maternal health and also for fetal development. But I have never come across the risk of developing NTD with exposure to sauna. But anyway it would be better if you avoid it for the future. As of now you need not worry too much about this exposure, stay calm and stay positive. The first-trimester scanning at 12 weeks is good enough to pick any NTDs and I do not think that would be too late, or you need to go for any termination of pregnancy just because of the exposure to sauna. At this early pregnancy, there is no means to find out if the baby has developed any abnormalities or not. And also the second TM scan detailed anatomical scan at 18-20 weeks can also pick most (90-95%) of any structural anomalies. Also regarding your gestational age calculations, if your cycles were always regular, then you should calculate the weeks from the starting day of your last menstrual period. It would have been really helpful if you had mentioned the same, it would have helped me correlate if your assumption of weeks of pregnancy are correct or not.

Since the first day of my marriage, my husband has some or the other issue like trust, with the clothes, my siblings, and my friends. He hardly cares for me, no love is there between us. Over it, my in-laws are also very much interfering. At this point, I do not know what should I do. Because with such circumstances it is not possible for me to be in this relationship. But somewhere I feel can the circumstances change? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I completely understand that you feel disturbed due to your partner-related problems. Every girl faces challenges at the start of marital life. For some girls, it may be difficult to adjust with the new partner/ family. Some of them get adjusted after spending time with in-laws and understanding them.  Major problems that arise between couples are due to communication problems e.g., not discussing the issues directly with the partner, assuming that your partner must be thinking like this, lack of communication/not talking about the problems or ignoring them. This may lead to 3rd party involvement such as in-laws start interfering because they see partners are unable to resolve their issues. Detail about the kind of trust and other issues you are facing with the partner. Insufficient information to diagnose. I suggest you some of the strategies which may help you and your partner resolve the marital issues.  Take couple counseling from a psychologist and learn effective communication skills to sort out daily life issues.  Directly communicate the problems with your partner before discussing it with any third person.  Share your real feelings with your partner such as how much you feel concerned about your relationship, how much you love or care about your partner, etc.  If communicating any negative feeling e.g., anger, hurt feelings, focus on your tone of voice and body language. A polite talk with the next person can resolve many problems even you communicate your negative feeling, but the key is your polite and low tone and saying words which are similar to your internal or real state. E.g. if you are saying to your partner I love you and saying it with grimaces and loud voice this is not going to communicate your real feelings and the next person will believe in your body language, not the words, which will definitely leave a negative message. In this scenario, if you are trying to resolve the problem by crying or shouting, this will even worsen the problem instead of doing something positive to your relationship.  Tell him that you feel to resolve the issues, and wonder if your circumstances can change.  Think about something positive in your relationship and tell your partner. For instance, praise his good qualities and anything you like in your partner.  Spend time with your partner talking about each other and planning something that you both enjoy. It can be an outing, working together on home chores, laughing/talking together, making love, or anything which you both prefer to do.  As you spend time, figure out the reasons for disagreement or conflicts between you and partner. Start working on the issues to resolve the problems. Remember, problems are a part of life, so every time you face a problem, just apply a problem-solving approach.  Apply above mentioned tips and techniques. If you face difficulty or further need assistance, you both can directly go to a psychologist office and ask for couple counseling. You are recommended to work on your relationship or start proper treatment as soon as possible. Delay in treatment often results in worsening of relationship and the consequences may be negative.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.","Doctor":"Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

When is the right time to conceive, either during fertile days or ovulation? I tried during fertile days, but nothing happened. Please explain. My cycle is 31 to 34 days.","Doctor":"Hi. If your cycle is 31 to 34 days long, then 13th to 24th day of your cycle is fertile period. You should have sex in the above period for at least on alternate days and this will increase the chance of having a pregnancy. Even if everything is normal then also, you do not need treatment for at least a year. There is naturally a minimum of one chance in 12 cycles in a year of having a pregnancy. You have only one chance of pregnancy if ovulation is normal in one cycle. So, there is one chance in 30 days and 12 chances in one year and this is when you have a normal cycle and ovulation. So it is a time-consuming process. Do not get frustrated. Just say that in one cycle, if you did not ovulate at all, then that chance is gone and you have to wait for the next. This is what you should first understand.

During his first year college, he was in love with a girl and that was a one side affair. So, he became depressed. He was diagnosed with acute psychosis and treated with Divalproex sodium and Olanzapine. He was stabilized by then. He continued medication for three months and then stopped it. Again, before four months, he became hyperactive, sleepless, angry and began to feel invincible. He was being treated for acute mania with Lithium carb 900 mg and Olanz 15 mg. Now, he has to appear for his final examinations and he is too much worried and depressed. Sometimes, he cries. I took him to the same doctor and he gave some antidepressant, but no improvement in the last six days. Only we have five more days to exam. Kindly advice what to do.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand the situation that you and your son are in and you have my sympathies for the same. If worry and exam anxiety are the main issues currently, then he can be given tablet Trika SR (Alprazolam) 0.5 mg in the morning daily. This can be given till his exams are over. Alprazolam should help to certain extent by temporarily reducing worries and stress. Bipolar depression takes time to respond and I am sorry to say that there is no therapy, which will treat it instantaneously. Continue with the prescribed medication and things will hopefully improve with passing days. I would also like to recommend that you convince him not to burden himself with the pressure of exam unnecessarily. The priority must be on coming out of bipolar depression and remaining normal in the future with proper treatment.

But, it increases the risk of CVS diseases if taken in oral contraceptive pills. And, they say that oral contraceptive pills should be avoided after 40 years because of CVS complications. I am not getting it. If it is cardioprotective, then why cannot it be given after 40 when estrogen levels in the body decrease? Also, I wanted to know, whether these side effects of oral contraceptive pills are dose dependent. Because, normally in young women estrogen is cardioprotective, but if given extra from the outside, it is increased in the body than required and so, it cause complications. Is this true? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hi. Natural estrogen is cardioprotective as it increases the level of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) and decreases the level of LDL (low-density lipoprotein). Oxidation of LDL cholesterol is believed to be the initiator of atherosclerosis. Estradiol and other estrogens are believed to inhibit this process. Hormone replacement therapy - HRT rapidly increases the level of C-reactive proteins in the body, a marker of inflammation associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Recently, two major studies found that HRT in postmenopausal women increases the risk of breast cancer. Another study proved that HRT in postmenopausal women increases the risk of cardiac events and thrombosis. Hence, women should be advised to cease therapy postmenopause. However, a detailed analysis showed that the time of initiating HRT postmenopause plays a crucial role. When initiated within five years of menopause in a healthy woman estrogen-based HRT has far more benefits than adverse outcomes. The pros of HRT includes: The cons of HRT are: So, pros and cons are to be evaluated before initiating HRT in postmenopausal women.

I have lymphedema in my lower legs since eight years. Intermittently, the condition is mediated with compression stockings, massage therapy and occasional stationary exercise. The swelling persists with activity, just to a lesser degree as long as garments are applied. At this point, there is slight pitting. The tissues from the calves down to the feet are consistently engorged and tough. Extensive rest is required to adjust leg shape from the calves down from columnar to moderately curve. The condition has limited impact on my physical activity and energy. It manifests as pain and hence, there is related slowing down after cardiovascular sports. Before six years, I began experiencing upper respiratory infections several times a year, coinciding with or without any flu or cold, requiring days of rest and OTC medication to recuperate. The timing coincided with a change of place and so, I presumed climate adjustment may have been the culprit. But, the symptoms have persisted ever since, with or without vaccinations. I had signs of anemia since my young age and got to know the diagnosis in after a year following the testing related to a women's wellness examination. A year later, lethargy and moderate pain of the lower extremities became a regular occurrence regardless of the physical activity. The symptoms would subside over time with rest. Migraine pain also emerged that year, seeming to coincide with sinus activity, due to the pain's concentration around the forehead and eyes, and required the use of OTC pain relievers. Migraines had not been a concern prior to that point. Then, the lethargy and body ache became a more persistent fixture, occurring several days a week, weekly, subsiding on its own, regardless of the amount of rest. Last year, the lethargy overwhelmed the physical pain and is remaining at the same frequency, but coupled with a spike in symptoms of anxiety, such as difficulty in concentrating, aphasia, heightened fear around mundane circumstances and nausea. Additionally, during winter a brief exposure outdoors at night resulted in Raynaud's disease in the fingertips of both hands for about a month, until it started to warm outside. Since the beginning of this year, the ongoing fatigue has occurred daily and the body ache occurs throughout the day, regardless of rest or activity. The pain is usually dull all over, but also presents with inflammation around the joints (knees, elbows, wrists and ankles) and muscle soreness primarily of the mid and lower back. Daily use of extra-strength OTC pain reliever is now necessary, though I try to refrain from every day use as much as possible. Dull headache pain, in the front region occurs several times a week, as do issues of concentration and mental fog. Additionally, twice this year I have experienced syncope.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects.

For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

Now, I am 35 years old. Also, I suffer from hemorrhoids, which affect my mood very severely. I have social impairments as my emotions are no longer clean. This is really an important issue for me. With my doctor's advice, I tried laxatives such as Miralax and Lactulose. I found that most laxatives, try to draw water into the stools. I tried to eat lots of fiber and flax seeds. My opinion is that the fruit contains fiber and lots of water, so there would be no need to take laxatives as the water is already included. In my opinion, since the kidneys will simply filter the water out, it is difficult to get the water to really mix with the food in the gut. It is much better to eat food that already contains water. Also, I noticed that fruit does not have many calories and I lost 5 kg. Now, I am really in my ideal weight. Today, I bought nut, nutella and peanut butter to have high calorie dense food. However, it was not easy, even to eat chocolate and nuts. Chocolate makes the stools sticky. Also, these snacks are very expensive and they have a lot of negative effects on health. How can I eat as much fruit as possible and still eat between 1800 and 2400 calories per day? I am 185 cm tall and currently only weighs 80 kg. It is also important for me to keep my weight.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

By using soap, you are destroying this normal barrier mechanism to prevent other infections and make the skin prone to other infection. Secondly, you mentioned that there is a little burning sensation. If burning is associated with urination, then there is a chance of urine infection. If it is so, then get your urine checked.

We plan to start trying for baby by next month. Is there anything I can do to help with the process? I am just confused with my doctor's words, as we have waited a year and the disease has more likely spread. I have been taking progesterone since the diagnosis. I just want to prepare myself mentally before trying. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, let me tell you that sonography is not always suggestive of adenomyosis. It cannot diagnose it. For diagnosis, you have to send biopsy of the uterus. In adenomyosis there is pain before, during and after menses. There is also focal and diffuse type of adenomyosis. Whatever you read on the internet is about diffuse or generalized adenomyosis. A few things on focal adenomyosis are available because most of the time it goes undiagnosed or has very mild symptoms that do not hamper routine. So, just focus on the present and start trying for pregnancy. In fact, if you get pregnant and pregnancy goes up to term or near term, then there is a chance of cure from adenomyosis theoretically. If you do not have the symptoms of clear adenomyosis, then there is a chance that it is not adenomyosis. So, do not worry and take chance for a year.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

Basically, if you are depressed, you will feel irritable, low, feel like crying, sad, do not wish to eat, have difficulty sleep, there can be anxiety, tiredness, headaches, etc. In bipolar illness, there will be a period of these depressive symptoms and then after a period of normalcy, the reverse happens. That is, you feel unusually happy for no reason, there are episodes of spending money excessively on things which you do not need, or maybe excessive use of alcohol, other illicit drugs, sex, irritable behavior, decreased need for sleep and still feeling fresh, grandiose talks and ideas, many non-goal directed activities, etc. So if you have not had the manic or hypomanic phase, then you probably suffered from major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am female of 25 years old.

An increase in the facial hair can be attributed to either hormonal abnormality or topical steroid abuse. Isotretinoin must be continued in tapering doses for at least six months. You need to go for a hormonal evaluation by ultrasound abdomen in order to rule out PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), which is a common source of ectopic hormone. You also need to undergo serum testosterone, FSH and LH ratio (follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone) and serum DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone).

I have a long time problem with receding gums on all my teeth. The teeth are quite tight also. I have also had esophagus hernia for many years and the stomach does not close properly and this makes it so that I feel the effect of my stomach acid like heartburn. It is very unfortunate for the teeth because it also changes pH in my mouth and makes it acidic. This happens especially when I sleep at night since I feel some dull pain in my teeth at night or when I wake up in the morning. I am trying to do something so I take the medicine that hinders acid production before I go to bed (Prazol) and I also rinse my mouth with water whenever I wake up even at night. Still, I think this acidity weakens my gums and teeth. The tooth that is in the picture has been fixed a few times with neck filling but now I feel there is some inflammation there that causes pain and the gum is very sensitive. I can hardly brush this tooth. I have an ointment that I started to use yesterday, it is called Carident and is made of Framycetini sulfas, Papainum and Natrii benzos. Do you have any recommendations on what I should do? I could go to a dentist to try to put a new neck filling but I am afraid that the gum has gone so low already that there is not enough of it left to put another filling. I am not even sure what will happen when I have this tooth extracted if it will be possible to make up for the hole in the gum. I am quite worried about it.","Doctor":"Hi. I checked your query and attached files. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can totally understand the situation you are going through. The best part is you know the root cause is stomach issue, you are doing best and accurate already to keep the pH maintained. I would like to add some points. 1. Do saline water mouth rinses instead of normal water rinses. Take a pinch of salt in a half cup of lukewarm water and do its rinse before sleeping and after breakfast. Do it for one week. This is the best remedy by book and by practice so far for strengthening the gums, as healthy gums will grow they will attach to tooth more firmly. 2. Change your brushing habit. Do brush with very light hand pressure. This canine tooth root exposure as is evident in the picture clearly indicates that while brushing unconsciously more pressure or harsh brushing is done at this corner of the mouth, so if this is the case try breaking down your habit. This will prevent gum from going down further. 3. At this stage, extraction is not recommended. Take Brufen 400 mg twice a day for three days. This will cover the inflammatory condition at the gum line of this sensitive tooth. Now get slight scaling done of this area and get neck filling done again. This will save the tooth. Do not brush this area as it is very sensitive. 4. Oral gel: Revomet Plus (Metronidazole and Chlorhexidine gel) can help with swollen gums. Put at the affected part thrice a day for five days. Do all these recommended things and please give me followup after five days. I hope this helps. Acidic pH of mouth due to stomach problem and hard brushing habit. It would be very helpful if a PA x-ray is done of lower right canine. 1.Filling. 2. RCT (root canal treatment). Filling and scaling. Medications plus scaling followed by filling. I need follow up right after five days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, 24 years ago, while giving birth, I had a perineal incision. Though one stitch tore after a few days, it was not repaired. For the last 10 years, I have been riding horses with no issues. But, slowly over time, my perineal tissue has continued to deteriorate. Until now, I have no perineal tissue between my vagina and anus. This is causing problems of irritation, soreness and swelling of the area. I am sure that I need this repaired. But, can this be done after such a long time? And, what would be involved? Would the recovery time be some months? Could I ride again? I am scared if I do not get it done there will be serious consequences later.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, you are right. It has to be repaired. If you do not have a problem in defecation, then you can wait for some time. But, after repair, you have to take rest for at least three months and you cannot ride horses until then. Healing will complete by three months time and you have to wait for three months or more according to your age and other blood status. If the problem is increasing over time, then you have to get perineal repair done as early as possible. After repair also there is a minor chance of forming fistulous track. Depending on the anal sphincter involvement, the repair will be decided.

Please tell some solution other than laser treatment. Also, I see floaters in both eyes.","Doctor":"Hi. In simple words, CSCR is disease of the retina in which fluid is collected under the retina (central serous chorioretinopathy). It is common in people with stress and taking steroids. If it is the first time, then treatment is not advised until three months as in majority cases it resolves spontaneously. You just need to make some changes in lifestyle to be stress-free. If you are having recurrent attacks, then after some tests like fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) or OCT (optical coherence tomography) the treatment could be advised. The laser is applied if we find some leaking spot. Other options are injection in the eye. New studies have shown the role of Rifampicin. I suggest tablet Rifampicin 600 mg for four to six weeks and that has good results. You need to visit your eye doctor and discuss all these options. If you have a fear for laser or injection, then you can try tablets after some basic tests such as LFTs (liver function tests) and RFTS (renal function tests). I would advise you to visit your retina specialist for further management and discuss all options. He will do the best for you.

The most recent consultation said these tests were the best out there and I can rely on the results I have. Your professional opinion is much appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. The test which you underwent on day 8 and 16 was definitely the best available test for that duration and you can surely rely upon the results. This test is highly sensitive for this duration to catch the infection if there had been any exposure. As far as the timing of this test is concerned it is conclusive as early as 7-14 days post-infection. Unlike the other tests, this will always give a positive result as long as there is HIV in someone's blood. Also, if there had been an HIV infection, HIV antibodies must be present in the person's blood. Studies have shown that the majority of the HIV antibodies develop in two to eight weeks period if there had been any exposure to HIV. Furthermore, I suggest you to undergo an HIV antibody test also and at this time you can undertake fourth generation HIV rapid test. This is again a highly sensitive and specific test and gives accurate result. If the same is negative, then you repeat the rapid HIV antibody test at three months.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

What do you think? I have a thyroid problem and recently changed my dose from 100 mcg to 75 mcg.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and can understand your health concern. If you have taken the oral contraceptive pill within 72 hours of sex, then no need to worry. As you got your periods after that though they are delayed there is nothing to worry. As you have mentioned that you have thyroid problem also, I think it is due to hormonal imbalance as thyroid problems can also cause irregular menses. Your symptoms can be due to PMS (premenstrual syndrome). Still, I suggest you to check your serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) levels to make sure that there is no pregnancy. I suggest you to consult a gynecologist if serum beta hCG comes to be high and periods get delayed further. 1. Premenstrual syndrome. 2. Hypothyroidism. 3. Ectopic pregnancy.

Abnormal reports are one is lipid profile, you are having hyperlipidemia and secondly, blood sugars which are just in a diabetic range. Bold figures are not necessarily abnormal and slight variation is acceptable. Get one ECG (electrocardiography) done as well. You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high-calorie diet. Have a low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly and should not be persistently more than 140/90 mmHg. Take lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, and avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. There should not abdominal fat deposition or obesity. Also, you should be started on lipid medicine like tablet Rosuvastatin 10 mg at bedtime, repeat the lipid profile after eight weeks. For sugars, I think we should try vigorous lifestyle changes which includes strict avoidance of sweets, regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and five days a week, and above mentioned changes. Repeat fasting and postprandial blood sugar after two weeks and also get HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) done. If they are still in the diabetic range then you need to take medicine like Metformin.

I stay away from food and drinks with sugar other than wine typically. My family doctor is English speaking and my urologist is Spanish speaking. Six months ago, I noticed that I was urinating more often and when I had to go, I felt an urgency to go. Previously, I was told that I had a somewhat enlarged prostate at about 4 centimeters and figured that may have been it or infection and thought that would pass. I recently went to my family doctor and he recommended that I get an ultrasound for the prostate. The radiology stated the below. Prostate was well visualized and is enlarged measuring 3.7 x 3.7 X 5.4 centimeters. There is a nodule that is pressing into the bladder that measures 1.9 x 2.1 x 2.4 centimeters. This nodule does not have blood flow within as visualized by ultrasound. My family doctor then sent me to a urologist. I showed him my lab results and he pointed out my PSA level of 1.54. He also pointed out my urine test which said Specific gravity: 1.015, Hidden blood: Traces, Leukocyte esterase: +, pH 7.0. I can upload that and the blood test. I will upload the tests, but they are in Spanish, but the technical words are the same. He also did a rectal exam with his finger. He told me that he thinks that I almost definitely do not have cancer and I have prostatitis. He prescribed Levofloxacin 500 mg once daily for one month, Meloxicam 15 mg, once daily for 14 days, Doxazosin 4 mg, taken every night once daily for two weeks. I am basically healthy, other than having some short term memory problems and stress. That may be from having a B12 level of 185, which I discovered two weeks ago and have taken two B complex shots for that so far.

I used to do it in the sleeping position with the left side down. I could feel heat in my left ear when I masturbate. Initially, I did not think it as a big issue, but I am worried now. A year ago, I did over masturbation one night and the next day my left ear got infected. But, there is no hearing loss or tinnitus that time and that infection went off. Now, I am having pus and a ringing sound in my left ear. Also, I feel only some 50% hearing in my left ear. Is this temporary or permanent? Will my left ear recover completely?","Doctor":"Hi.

I can hold my ejaculation during foreplay with my girlfriend, but I cannot even control it for more than 30 seconds after entering into the vagina. Is this a problem of lifelong PE?

If your cousin was seizure free before Allopurinol, then I do not think Carbamazepine is the right thing for her. She should be given anti-epileptic such as Clobazam, which has immediate action. I think Carbamazepine should be stopped gradually and his treatment protocol should have added Clobazam per day for a duration of two to four weeks and dose of Depakine -Valproic acid should be increased. In case, your cousin is having recurrent seizures despite Depakine 1500 mg per day, then there is a need to increase the dose of Depakine.

If you are having fever for three to four days and not having any improvement, then do one blood test CBC with MP (complete blood count with metabolic panel) and one urine routine test. From history it looks like you have viral fever. If the platelet count is low in the report, then you have to do a test for dengue. Also, look at white blood cell count (WBC). If it is increased, then you have to take a higher dose of antibiotic along with some other antibiotic. If it is low, then it is some other viral fever. In that case continue your medication, take Paracetamol for fever and do sponging if the fever did not subside. If you are more uncomfortable, then get admitted and take proper nursing care. In viral fever, we can give only supportive therapy as there is no definite treatment for it. Antibiotics in viral fever will just help to avoid another infection as your immunity will be low due to fever. Also, Augmentin 325 is pediatric dose (combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid).

Laxatives also did not work. The only test I have not done is endoscopy. Every doctor I have been to said a different thing and none seems to know the problem. If possible, based on the symptoms I have mentioned, please do inform me what this could be. I am a 23 year old male.","Doctor":"Hi.

It is a natural human reaction to feel sorrow or low or depressed after a loss or failure. We call this grief. Although he is still in your life and sometimes you talk to him, this cannot be considered a loss. The feelings you are experiencing is similar to grief. You need to identify the meaning of his departure in your life. For this, you need to ask yourself a few questions.  Is he gone forever from your life? Has he left you? Are crying, being sorry and worried a healthy way to deal with your relationship when you and your partner are going through a tough time in life? What can be other healthy ways or solutions to deal with the situation?  These questions will help you redefine the situation of your life. Grief. Here I am advising you some things to cope up better in this crucial time of your relationship. 1. Do share your thoughts and feelings to your partner. 2. Missing your loved one is a positive emotion. Communicate it with your partner. As you mentioned that there are a few moments when you both talk, make this shorter time well productive and good that you both miss talking to each other instead of feeling bad. 3. Find meaning in your life. Think about your interests and what you want to do in life. Now you have more time available to focus and work out to reach your goals. Share your plans with your partner. Get new ideas to spend your time in more productive and healthy way. 4. Be around people instead of spending time alone, because it generates the feeling of loneliness even you are surrounded by lots of people who can help and support you in this hard time of your life. 5. Spend time with your friends and find enjoyment in life. Do whatever you enjoy. It can be anything as listening to music, doing exercise, eating your favorite food, traveling, wearing your favorite dress or aroma, etc. 6. Do a relaxation exercise or deep breathing to calm yourself down. Sit in a comfortable position, take a deep breath, focus on the air going in and out and imagine something positive. Do this exercise every day. For further information consult a psychologist counsellor online.--->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 32 years old and having a kid. Currently, my TSH value is 7.19.

After self-examination of my throat, I noticed a row of growths under my palatine tonsils, right beside my lingual tonsils. I had visited an ENT doctor and the specialist insisted that they were just harmless lingual tonsils and followed the statement with lingual tonsils can be cryptic in architecture. These growths have no pain associated with them. They appear to be flesh colored and slightly firm to my observation. The ENT also purported that I had no abnormal masses or lymph node swelling. I do sometimes experience a cracking or air bubble popping sensation in my jaw while chewing. One of my wisdom teeth has come up and has caused infection sometimes.

I must also note that I have had sinus drain since the day of my cold. It has gotten better, but I also figured it could be chronic sinusitis.

From the available description, it appears that you are having depression, which is often characterized by sadness, decrease interest in almost all activities, including pleasurable one, indecisiveness, poor attention and concentration in addition to sleep and appetite disturbance. Most persons with depression feel miserable without any reason and that distinguishes it from normal sad experience. The presence of conflict with mother in regard to ongoing relationship could be the trigger for the onset of depression. In my view, you should see a psychiatrist without delay. He will ask you more questions to confirm the diagnosis of depression and to rule out other disorders presenting in a similar way such as bipolar disorder. Post evaluation he may prescribe medication or offer you psychotherapy after discussing with you. I must assure you that in current times depression is completely treatable illness and there is an excellent hope to recover from it.

I have lived with this for over 40 years and I am getting worried that I will not be able to work. I have reached out to human resources and they basically suggested to get glasses to protect my eyes. Any of your help would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. I clearly understand your symptoms. The basic reason behind the whole issue is the autonomic imbalance which your nervous system shows to specific sensory inputs. Let me simplify that thing for you. All the senses give input to our brain like smell, vision, taste, hearing and touch. Out of these five, the first two can have relatively major influence on our autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is the part of nervous system which regulates blood circulation, digestion, respiration, cardiac rhythm, etc. The alteration of blood flow in the brain produces those flashes of light and sometimes a lost patch of vision in a field. Now, people with migraine have little problem with these autonomic regulations and that is what is happening to you. The new smell is excessively disturbing your autonomic nervous system and so you have all the symptoms which you described. The olfactory system gets adapted relatively quickly. So, if you continue to go there eventually you will get adopted. If that does not happen, then you can use mechanical barriers such as a small mask to avoid the smell up to a certain extent, but it may not help much. For nausea, I suggest Emefilm (Ondansetron) 8 mg, a thin mouth dissolving film of medicine to be kept below the tongue when you feel nauseated and Topiramate 50 mg twice a day for headache. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.

Serum potassium level should be done once in every three days. Hyperkalemia (elevated level of potassium) is a very dangerous thing. It can precipitate many sorts of arrhythmias (abnormal heart beats) and excessive levels can even be fatal. You have not mentioned the reason for which you had Potassium chloride tablets.

He got a stabbing pain in his chest and his vision went blurry. The pain went down his left arm and hand. It eased up, but the numbness stayed in his hand for about a week. He ignored it. A few nights later, he woke up gasping as if he could not catch his breath. Again, he ignored it. A few days later, at work, he experienced the same stabbing pain in his chest and inability to catch his breath. Several minutes passed and as always he ignored it. He has been diagnosed with high blood pressure and was prescribed with medication, which he takes rarely. What could all of this be?

Chest pain with radiation to arms associated with breathing difficulty and blurry vision points towards classical angina. According to the symptoms, a cardiac event is more likely than a stroke.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM.

Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

I have also taken the birth control pill. My throat has been feeling dry and sometimes I feel this burning sensation in one of my ears interchangeably, sometimes my eyes feel dry. When I try to come off birth control, I just bleed continuously so I just keep going back on the pills. I believe this combination has left my hormones unbalanced and causing me to have headaches, low energy, and low concentration. Whilst I can ignore most of the symptoms, the dry feeling in my throat that affects one side of my throat at a time along with sensation in my ear at the same side makes me wonder if there is anything wrong with my thyroid or if I have an STI that is not normally tested for at sexual health center?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I just read your query and from what you described it appears that you have withdrawal bleeding which usually takes place when you discontinue hormones. It takes sometime but it does stop in a week or so if not then you need to see a doctor for stopping your bleeding. As for the symptoms you mentioned regarding your throat and ear, it does not seem like it is from the thyroid gland although it does look like a respiratory tract infection. If you are worried about STI (sexually transmitted infection) then you can just have your throat swab test done to know what sort of infection you have. Also, have your complete blood count done to know if you have low hemoglobin to check why you have low energy and concentration levels. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 24 years old. Ever since my first period, my cycles have always been irregular. For almost 7 to 8 years, I had irregular cycles. I had a scan and nothing abnormal was seen. My doctor said that I should just leave nature do its work. A year back, I started with yoga. Also, I started following rice and processed sugar free diet. I lost abundant weight, although 5 kg more to go. My cycle since last one year became regular all by itself without any medications. However, last year I had a scan and it showed polycystic ovaries. Still, almost for 10 months my cycles were regular. But, they become scanty and last only for three days instead of five days. Now, since three months I have not got my period at all. I would like to add that I stopped yoga since three months. Before two months, again, I went to a gynecologist. She said PCOS cannot get cured completely. She said there is no medicine that can do wonders and so pointlessly she does not want to put me on medications. She asked me to start yoga again. Also, she advised me to eat well and stay away from junk and dairy foods to reduce another 5 kg. She is hoping that will greatly benefit me. I have started with my yoga again. But, I have a few questions to get clarified. Usually, I do get acne a week before of my period. In the last three months, I have not gotten my period, but I got acne around the date of the period. Why is that happening? Can I conceive in future? My gynecologist is an allopath, but she suggested me to take up natural ways of healing PCOS. Is that a good advice? I heard that some natural products like licorice roots, fenugreek seeds, flax seeds, etc., are very much effective for PCOS. I am planning to start with this. How beneficial would it be? Most importantly, until now I was convinced that I have PCOS. I read about menopause and perimenopause. The symptoms are the same including irregular periods, vaginal dryness, etc. Also, perimenopause is very high these days in women of less than 40.

He set me up in order to see a pulmonary physician; however, stated that it was extremely unlikely that I had any breathing restrictions due to the several tests I have had. Also, stated that he was fairly confident that my heart was fine. I have lost count of the EKGs, ECGs, CT scans, chest x-rays, and blood work, which is all negative. He did mention that my physical symptoms could potentially be coming from sleep apnea. I know that I have caused some of this on myself, because I am obese and I do smoke. I have no quality of life and at this point I am beginning to feel depressed. I barely can get through a shift at work. When I stay at home, I am afraid to be alone. Also, driving is a nightmare. I am at my wits end; I just feel a sense of hopelessness and also feel as if the doctors do not believe that my symptoms exist. I am just a 29 year old female. Is this really due to anxiety? What step should I take next in order to get better? Please help me. I have a 3 year old daughter and I want to enjoy my life with her. I think about my death daily because of the chest pain and shortness of breath.","Doctor":"Hi. I have the following recommendations to you. If you really want to help yourself, then start immediately. Quit smoking immediately. Follow a healthy diet and start losing weight. Initially, start with a 10 minute physical exercise and increase it gradually. By that, I mean a very simple walking to start with. Please you follow these steps and sleep apnea will eventually go away. Have a stress ECG to identify if your blood vessels of heart spasm on exertion. If things did not improve, then visit a psychiatrist to alleviate your anxiety.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent.

I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning.

For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

I was put on Ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice a day. My doctor suspected a GI bleed because I have acid reflux that is under control with medications, but I wanted to try supplements first. I am not having any crazy GI symptoms though. They said to try the iron for a month and then go back for another test. I just went for a blood test last week and my serum level came back at 102. I am feeling much better and yesterday I had a follow-up appointment at which my doctor said to stop taking the iron supplements and to retest in three months. That seems like a long time to stop taking iron supplements after having only taken them for one month. I also wonder about the validity of the recent test because I am now reading that supplements can falsely elevate your actual iron level. I was not told to stop taking the supplements before the test. Was the iron serum blood test accurate if I did not stop taking iron for a short period beforehand? Also, is it safe to stop taking iron for three months? I am currently taking Omeprazole, Prozac, and Klopin.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, the test is still valid. The results would show the effect of increased iron intake for the past weeks that you have been taking it and a few days of not taking it will not have much effect. Not taking it for three months is still fine. I believe your doctor has already concluded that you do not have GI bleed as of now, so most likely your body can replenish the iron through diet without any need for supplements. But if you have symptoms of dizziness, fatigue, and lightheadedness, seek further consult with your doctor. In the meantime, I recommend stick with a high iron diet such as meat and green leafy vegetables. I also recommend you take food and drinks high in vitamin C to better absorb the iron in the gut.

I am a 23 year old male who is married to a beautiful 27 year old female. I am a nice person and at least I believe so, a caring husband and a fun brother. Recently, we had a baby girl and she is 2 months old from today. The problem that I am facing is that my wife has become as cold as ice. I am more than certain that my wife did not cheat on me, so this theory is simply out the window. I do not know what I do wrong or how to fix this. I have tried several different advices that were already out there on the internet, but none of them seem to even slightly shift the situation in my favor. I have even raised this question several times with my wife, we talk about it ans she says that she will try, but then does not even do a single bit of what she promised. My wife always seems to have an excuse to avoid any contact. When we just got married there was passion, love and romance. But, right when she got pregnant, which was a planned pregnancy and we worked for it very hard for several months as she became irritated by everything and everyone. I did not seem to even get offended by that and simply try to be the best husband possible. I never said no to any errands, no matter how dumb they were. Even if it was 11 PM and if she wanted an orange juice, I would get my butt up and go get it. She had a complicated pregnancy and I have honestly tried to support her as much as I could. Now, the pregnancy is over and we have a baby girl to look after. It is not an easy task and definitely a person gets tired. Since, I am the only working person in family; my wife spends 80% of her time in raising our daughter. Though that is very tiring, I cannot believe that it is so tiring that she will not even want to hug me. When I come from work she does not greet me. Every time I get some rude responses like you stink or do not touch me or it is irritating. When I just approach her and try to say something nice, she just smirks it off and does not even say anything in return. She has no interest of doing any activities together. When we actually do decide to do something together, she is always on her phone texting to her girlfriends. I always ask her if she wants anything and in return I get a growling. With this behavior I definitely get discouraged, sad and simply go and play videogames. I still go up to her every hour or so and give her a little kiss or a hug and ask if she wants anything now, but still get rudeness in response. I just forgot my sex life? What is that? I never straight jump into sex, as you have probably noticed at this point. I am romantic. I always try to comfort her with some foot massage or hugging. I do not even mind doing it even if I get nothing in return, but the problem that I get none of the action. She gets my undivided attention. I do not forget to get her flowers or gift on a special occasion, yet I get nothing. I know that it sound one-sided like I am putting her in bad light, but it is all that bothers me. I am very honestly trying to keep this relationship going till the end of our days. I just ran out of ideas and I hope for some advice.","Doctor":"Hi.

I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.","Doctor":"Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this?","Doctor":"Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain.

His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

I had a laboratory work and my TSH was 3.4. It was considered normal on laboratory ranges. But, my primary doctor said that 3.4 is high on what it should be consider the new normal. My LDL cholesterol was also high. After a year of very good nutrition, I asked my doctor to also check my free T3, T4 and reverse T3. Basically, I did this because of my research. Laboratory work came back as TSH 5.8 (out of the normal) and my doctor said it was fine, again. Free T3 low and he said it was fine. Reverse T3 a little on the high end. Based on the research, when free T3 is low it can affect cholesterol and then both thyroid and cholesterol affect my free testosterone, which is lower now. He just gave me medicine for cholesterol. I went to another doctor and he said that he only considers hypothyroidism when someone is with TSH higher than 10. He is completely different than all information on the internet and books. He said my cholesterol is high, but HDL ratio to triglycerides was good. He thinks that I may be the exception and have a problem with a 5.8 TSH and wants to give me Synthroid. I am planning to go to another doctor. My TSH is high and my free T3 is low. It can be a conversion of T3 to T4 problem. Therefore, in order to solve it, I need Armour or Armour plus Cytomel. But, the two doctors whom I consulted, think that my TSH is fine. They believe TSH is the important part, when everywhere doctors keep repeating to check FT3 and FT4 and reverse T3.

She had an absolute normal pregnancy till 9th month. She had no BP, diabetes or other issues throughout and even today. Only issue, she has is migraine and for which she takes Diclogesic. So, it happened on a day of routine checkup when Doppler scan released little less fluid (7.3) around baby and placental calcification that doctor advised C-section. She was empty stomach after breakfast from morning till evening and developed a migraine, which is normal as she had this condition before as well. Gradually, she became breathless, tachycardia and her pulse rate shoot up to 170 or 180 while saturation was around 99%.

Post surgery, I developed acute steroid induced ocular hypertension, which was resolved with IV drug treatment. Fast forward, I developed open angle glaucoma in both eyes and I am undergoing trabeculectomy for the right eye (non-phaco LASIK eye) and will undergo phaco in the trabeculectomy eye as well since there is a sign of a posterior subcapsular cataract. I am already on maximum medical therapy Xalatan, Cosopt, Alphagan-P and Diamox. The visual acuity is already bad on the right eye due to glaucoma; it is about 78% according to a recent visual field test. So, I am not too worried about that. I have been placed on Xalatan for almost half a year now on my left eye, which had phaco done. Vision is still good, but there appears to be a slight haze and the glare appears to worsen over the past few months after starting Xalatan.

There is no other recent infection or disease that could cause the high lymphocyte count. My diet is extremely poor and I am taking very less amount of water. A preliminary detailed analysis of the report would be appreciated before my scheduled visit to the hospital later this week.","Doctor":"Hi. My first step is to congratulate you for a definite action towards your health as the bariatric surgery. Also, you have achieved a great weight reduction with it which needs appreciation too. I understand that you have not been following the diet and just accept the fact and move forward in life. But, I could not understand the term poor health. Is it low, lean muscle mass or weakness or fever or not achieving the desirable body shape? I did analyze your blood report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), which does show vitamin D and folic acid deficiency, with apolipoprotein-A and lymphocytes being high. With poor compliance to diet, vitamin A, D, E and K deficiency are expected. So, the same to the folic acid. It can be easily corrected with supplementation. High apolipoprotein-A is surrogate of cardiac disease marker and can be raised in inflammatory stress to the body such as your current state. For lymphocyte being high I will not worry at present as the absolute value is less than 5000. I suggest repeating a CBC (complete blood count) after two to three weeks. If it is still high or increasing, then we will evaluate. Scalp folliculitis can be an indirect representation of your body inflammatory state and also can reflect vitamin A and D deficiency. Though depending on state, you may need antibiotics. You will do well with dietary supplementation and regular exercise.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

You are experiencing a breakthrough bleeding occurring due to missing your pills and also probably due to not taking them on time. If it is a combined oral contraceptive pill, then it should be started from day 2 or 3 of your cycle ideally. So, the best is to stop the pill pack now and wait for your withdrawal bleed to start in the next seven days and then you can start the fresh pack from day 2 of your next cycle. Till then, you may use barrier contraception to prevent any pregnancy and if the bleeding is discomforting, then you can use antifibrinolytics for three days to stop it completely as well.

A month later, I had an MRI and a couple of neurologists said that the MRI is fine. I was referred to an ENT doctor. One ENT doctor said that all is fine after several audiography tests. Now, three weeks before, I started getting giddiness and the tinnitus continues the whole day in both ears. I went to another ENT specialist.

I am a vegetarian with no smoking and drinking habit. Please look into my MRI and give your opinion.","Doctor":"Hi. Your MRI looks grossly normal. In an unexplained tinnitus like this, you need further investigations to rule out two rare conditions, jugular bulb abnormalities and sigmoid sinus diverticulum (sinus wall abnormality). You will require high resolution CT of the temporal bone to look for any bony abnormalities. Another possibility is dural arteriovenousfistula dAVF; however, MRI does not show any evidence for this. You will need cerebral DSA (digital subtraction angiography) for excluding this condition because of tinnitus. The same test will also identify jugular vein and sigmoid sinus problems.

Blood tests revealed that he had malaria (Vivax) and a platelet count of 44,000, which is below normal. But, there was no dengue or typhoid. He had also complained of slight pain near his heart area. It has been only for the past five days that is from the day of fever. Malaria treatment has been started already in the hospital. For heart, they did an ECG and echocardiography and the results were normal. His doctor said that my father's ECG graph was slightly different than the same 9 years back. Then, they tested for the cardiac enzyme marker CPK. Apparently, the CPK result should be in the hundreds, but it was in the thousands. So, they are suspecting a heart condition, although they are not sure about the condition. But, echocardiogram gave a normal heart without any blocks. They are thinking that at a later stage, they may do an angiogram. Could the elevated CPK value be related to the malaria attack or the treatment antibiotics for malaria? Could age (70 years) be an issue for high CPK level? Is an angiogram must now? Could the platelet count be an indication of heart problems as well as malaria? Are CPK and angiogram tests invasive? Can they be harmful at times?

After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

For further information consult an orthopaedician and traumatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,Three years ago, I had a stent in my LAD, which had been 96% occluded. At that time, my cardiologist put me on Plavix for a year and ongoing 81 mg Aspirin therapy. I am also taking 50 mg Atenolol. It was 25 mg until this month and was increased due to palpitations probably stress related. I was also put on 5 mg of Crestor a day. My doctor and I agreed to this, since five men in my family took statins and all had an adverse reaction. Also, two of them were hospitalized due to it. The therapy had been working and my total cholesterol dropped from pre-stent therapy total 219, HDL 140, HDL 44, triglycerides 209 to post-stent with medicine total 138, LDL 71, HDL 39 and triglycerides 141. Over the past one year, I have been doing intermittent fasting. In the past year, have further lowered my numbers to 91 total cholesterol, 48 LDL, 40 HDL, and 61 triglycerides. This latest result has been repeated twice at six months intervals. Now, my GP is skeptical about the low dose statin and wanted to put me back on a blood thinner as well. I cannot get in to see a cardiologist for a month. I am reluctant to be put back on Plavix and I am equally reluctant to change statins and increase the dose. The new GP has kept me where I am with medicines for now. What are my options? It appears with diet and the current medical regimen that I am getting excellent results. Am I mistaken? Are high dose statins required despite the good blood results? Are all statins created equal and are they interchangeable for every individual?","Doctor":"Hi. Good to know that you are in good control of your lipids. First of all, statins must be used when one has had any heart attack or stroke. The dose of statin is set by the level of LDL (low-density lipoprotein). LDL must be lowered to one half. In your case, Crestor (Rosuvastatin 5 mg) is doing the best. Yes, there are side effects of statins. The most common are muscle pain and weakness. In my opinion, Rosuvastatin 5 mg is the best for you because it is of very low dose. If you change to another statin (Atorvastatin), you will have to take at least 40 mg per day and that may cause side effects as these are common in your family. So, I recommend to continue Crestor 5 mg. You may be thinking that should I quit statin as my lipid levels are quite under control. Remember, the good effects of statins in case of heart attack or stroke is not only through decreasing lipid levels, but there are also many other ways statins benefit patients. So, keep up with your current treatment regimen. Keep your blood pressure under control and do regular exercise of moderate intensity for about 30 minutes a day for at least five days a week.

Everything will be fine in the end. Coming to OHSS (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome), yes, it is true. PCOS - polycystic ovarian syndrome patients have a higher chance for it. However, at the time of egg stimulation in your IVF cycle (in vitro fertilization), your doctor will monitor the egg growth and adjust your injection doses accordingly. So, OHSS is prevented. If you are overweight, then please try to lose weight. Please speak to your doctor before starting IVF and explain your concerns. So, she or he is aware that you are aware of OHSS and will take stringent care. Be aware that despite the doctor's best efforts, sometimes a mild degree of OHSS can happen and it is nothing major.

My doctor just prescribed these medications when I told him about my anxiety issues and extreme mood swings. I am still unaware of the diagnosis as it is still affecting my day to day life.","Doctor":"Hello. What are your symptoms exactly? If they are of depression, then the treatment with SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) is ideally given for six months or so. The Lamez 25 (Lamotrigine) is just a mood stabilizer, if the psychiatrist is suspecting bipolar disorder. Zapiz is a benzodiazepine and I would not advise you to take it for longer periods. Basically, if you are depressed, you will feel irritable, low, feel like crying, sad, do not wish to eat, have difficulty sleep, anxiety, tiredness, headaches, etc.  In bipolar illness, there will be a period of these depressive symptoms and then after a period of normalcy, the reverse happens. That is, you feel unusually happy for no reason, there are episodes of spending money excessively on things which you do not need, or maybe episodes of excessive use of alcohol, other illicit drugs, sex, irritable behavior, decreased need for sleep and still feeling fresh, grandiose talks and ideas, many non-goal directed activities, etc. So if you have not had the manic/hypomanic phase, then probably you might suffer from a major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 17 months old.

Please clear my doubts. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. Fibroids can cause fertility problems if they are too large in size or in the wrong location. If you have seedling fibroids, then they are unlikely to cause problems in conception. They may grow a bit during pregnancy, but will decrease in size after delivery. If you are married, then I would suggest you get another ultrasound done to check the status of the fibroids and if still seedling please try to plan your family and conceive. Fibroids grow over time, albeit slowly. If you delay by a few years, then they may cause fertility issues. Retention cyst is different from a polycystic ovary. PCOS is a syndrome of several factors and not just diagnosed by ultrasound. There are multiple small cysts in the ovaries. If you have a single retention cyst, then it may be physiological. The cyst may resolve on its own. You will need to get another ultrasound on the second day of your next period to find out the status of the cyst. If it is more than 3 to 4 cm and of a dubious nature, then it may need laparoscopy and removal. This does not cause infertility.

With so much prolonged amenorrhea, ovulation is unlikely to have occurred and pregnancy is less likely. Kindly use barrier contraceptive (condom) for three weeks and repeat home pregnancy test. If it comes negative, then pregnancy is almost ruled out. Absence of menstrual cycle for such a long term is not desirable, as it increases the chance of endometrial cancer by unopposed estrogen exposure to endometrium.

I understand that you may be hassled by your periods, but removing your uterus before you have completed your family or without any pathology is not the way to go. You can take the oral contraceptive pills, which will both regularize your periods as well as decrease the duration of flow, the pain and the discomfort as well. If you have an event and you need to be not bleeding, then you can manage to postpone the periods with minimal disruption to your hormones. You can take a milder form of contraception, which will not give you the side effects like bloating or migraines. I would suggest Yasmin or Yaz. It is mild and will keep your hormones in order. When you do wish to conceive you just need to stop the oral contraceptive pill. You can take it for six months on a cyclical basis as per the instructions on the back of the pack and give a break of a couple of months and then restart again with the consent of your specialist doctor.

After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had unprotected sex on 1st of last month and missed my period on 20th. I did a urine pregnancy test on 3rd of this month, it came negative and then I took Regestrone 10 mg for five days one tablet each day from 3rd to 7th. Then on 8th, I did a bhCG which came negative and today I got a slight spotting and when wiping a little brownish kinda discharge came. Am I pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. No, you are not pregnant as urine pregnancy test and HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) test are negative. You have taken Regesterone so your period is delayed more. Your period should start now. It normally takes two to seven days after the last Regesterone tablet. So do not worry you are not pregnant because it is already more than 30 days after unprotected sex and all tests are negative. Brownish discharge can be the starting of menses. You are definitely not pregnant. Do not take much stress."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My sister-in-law is 3 months pregnant.

However, to give the benefit of doubt, I think that people has considered to give chemotherapy followed by response evaluation. If the result is favorable, then they may even opt for surgery (variable). In stage 4 hormone positive, we prefer to give the only antihormonal agent. In her case, anti HER2 therapy has to be added as she is positive for it. I will not suggest the second type of chemotherapy at this time if there is no obvious progression. In my opinion you should continue with third dose and see the response on radio imaging. We may plan to continue anti HER2 with hormonal agents, while keeping her on close follow up. In less often scenario, if the response is phenomenal, then we may plan surgery. But, this will need further discussion. Do not worry, she should do well.

But, I have herpes 2. Will it affect my baby?","Doctor":"Hi. The biggest concern in a pregnant genital herpes patient is that the infection is transmitted to the baby during labor and delivery, which can be devastating. This can happen if you are contagious or shedding the virus. There is no way to know for sure if you are shedding the virus or not. But, if you have herpes before you got pregnant and you have no symptoms of an outbreak or an impending outbreak when your water breaks or your labor starts, then you will be able to go for vaginal delivery and the risk of transmitting the disease to the baby will be less than 1%. As you develop antibodies soon after you are first infected and you pass these to the baby through placenta on the other hand, if you are having an outbreak or an impending outbreak when your water breaks or when you go into labor, then you need immediate cesarean delivery. This is the case when you have any visible sores on the cervix, vagina or external genitalia or any symptoms such as tingling, burning or pain that signal an imminent outbreak of herpes. To improve the chance of being able to deliver vaginally it is recommended that pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes will be offered oral antiviral medications from 36 weeks till the delivery.

I have no diabetecs and I am a non-smoker, and non-alcoholic. I am a software engineer. I am having neck and back pain issues for the past 10 years particularly more severe neck pain for the last one week, as my neck is hurting and pain is radiating into my head and shoulders, etc. Till now there is no pain in my hands or fingers. My job is computer programming so I have to focus hours on the screen this is one of the main reasons behind it as I never had any vehicle or sports accident. Now more terrible thing is that I have started vertigo/spinning in head while lying down and move my head towards the left side. Because of this vertigo fear, I kept laying straight on my back full night. I can cope with the pain but vertigo/spinning of my head is putting me under stress and depression as it could affect my daily life too. I have taken thousands of medicines in the last ten years. Currently, my doctor advised me some medicines, which I am using since four days. I take Zenorit 8mg (Azithromycin), Lavistina 16 mg (Betahistine dihydrochloride), Parafon (Chlorzoxazone 250 mg and Paracetamol 300 mg) and Neurobion Forte. Well my first question is, what is the main reason for having vertigo/spinning head while lying down and tilt the head on the left side? My doctor has diagnosed that my ear is having balancing issue. Is that true? However, I guess any of my cervical disc pinches some nerve or artery while I lay down and turn my head as you can see from the MRI report that almost all of my discs are having issues. Moreover, regularly I do a light massage with deep-heat cream and then keep a hot water bottle on my neck/back for some time. Earlier I had some physiotherapy sessions as well for pain management. However, there is no chiropractor available in our city. I will be greatly thankful to you if you could at least diagnose the root cause of this vertigo which comes up while lying down and turn head to the left side. Once the vertigo is subsided we can start working on pain management. Please note that I feel quite relax and less pain while I walk or even stand up, however having full of pain while sitting and had neck pain and vertigo in the bed.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your history and reviewed your total spinal MRI. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).   Do not be nervous. Vertigo that you are experiencing is not related to your discopathy. You have disc bulging in the cervical spine (C5-C6 and C6-C7), at least one mild disc bulging in the thoracic spine and two more disc problems in the lumbar area, especially in L5-S1 that is complicated by spondylolisthesis (i.e. spinal body sliding). Nevertheless, as I said, none of them is related to vertigo. Your vertigo is a benign paroxysmal peripheral vertigo (BPPV) that is caused due to a benign problem in one of your horizontal semicircular canal in the inner ear. In simple words, one of your sensors which reports the brain any horizontal rotation of the head, suffers from a temporary problem and gives exaggerated data to the brain. I agree with the prescribed medicine, except the antibiotic Azithromycin that seems unnecessary if you do not have a fever or ear pain. The key treatment is not medicine. Please accept my advice and do not avoid the head movement that triggers your vertigo. In contrast, repeat it more and more. In every try, you will notice that the severity of vertigo will lessen. It is similar to seasickness. By repeating the movement and sending exaggerated data by your ear, your brain habits the situation and will neglect the bad data and you will improve. If this strategy does not work after five days, in combination medicines, then you will need to be treated by a maneuver that is called Gufoni' maneuver. It should be done by a trained neurologist or ENT specialist. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My daughter is 6 years old.

Since it is symptomatic and you have had children, then the best for you is to go for a hysterectomy. This will make you to have peace of mind. If you do not get surgery, then there is a tendency of recurrent heavy menstrual bleeding resulting in fatigue and weakness. Then there is a chance of recurrent blood transfusion with all the complications associated with blood transfusion. The alternative is the use of drugs, which can only be used for a short period and the fibroid will grow back once you stop using the medicine. The drugs may also have so many side effects.

Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a history of ear problems (seven surgeries as of right now). I had tubes placed in both ears when I was younger and more recent before few years. After the tubes were removed, both ear drums were left with holes in them which have been closed with surgery. In the left ear, there was only one tympanoplasty done. As for the right ear, there was a fat plug done and failed, next there was a tympanoplasty which also failed. Finally, a neurotologist preformed another tympanoplasty with cartilage back up and it has taken. Within the last three months, I have had fluid in the left ear twice and Prednisone has been used. Once I was flying and caused barotrauma from being sick and flying. The other was just fluid sitting there, which is still there after 12 days of Prednisone. Also, I have been told to take Amoxicillin three times the last three months, only I did it with the barotrauma as there was blood sitting behind the ear. Now, I have got three different opinions from ENT doctors and still, I am confused as to what to try. The normal ENT that has done all but the last surgery, where he made me go elsewhere because he was not comfortable trying again and said the hearing in my right ear has gotten worse from the last hearing test (I do not have a copy of the most recent hearing test), he wants to put a hole in the right ear. The neurotologist was for putting a tube in the right after surgery, as there was fluid behind the ear drum but he has left the country so my choices are limited to go back to him. I have been traveling back and forth 12 hours each way for the last few months and driving after the barotrauma is getting pain in the left ear. Now, the second doctor's opinion, he said that he would not recommend tubes as both ear drums are intact. He recommended for an allergy test if it helps at all I have been using Flonase as well continuously (all three doctors said to do it). The third doctor told me he would leave the right ear alone and recommended a tube in my left ear with my travel schedule. He basically said I need to determine if I want to live with holes or leave them intact and have pain when it comes on. Also, I have been diagnosed with TMJ after the first tube surgery, which I think that lead to the pain that made me go through with the tubes in the first place. I have had treatment for that, I hit all the limits I could with my dentist and am now having a day time splint made. All the problems in the left ear have started since three months back. I was placed on Prozac by a doctor, which is known for making clenching worse. I have done the botox in the masseter (for TMJ), which has helped in the past and we did 25 units this time (last time was 15 units). Overall, I am wondering if it is in my best interest to try and pull off the Prozac (with the doctor's permission) or just getting tubes in both ears and not doing any more reconstructive surgery.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for the detailed history. I can understand that you have gone through a lot because of your repeated ear issues. Very clearly none of the conditions you have (either fluid in middle ear or hole in the eardrum) are painful conditions. Surgery for these conditions is done mainly to improve hearing. Repeated collection of fluid in the middle ear can occur due to various reasons such as eustachian tube dysfunction, adenoids, allergy, etc. The most common being eustachian tube dysfunction. Now, coming to the treatment of your condition. You can continue Flonase nasal spray for a few months and see if there is any improvement in fluid in the middle ear. If that is not working then the next option would be to undergo balloon dilatation of eustachian tubes which may work sometimes. Last option would be the insertion of grommet again. But an operated ear grommet can cause permanent perforation and you have to live with it all your life. As far as pain is concerned, it is probably due to TMJ dysfunction. As you said Prozac worsens bruxism and you may need to stop it with your symptoms or doctor's consent. These chronic conditions such as eustachian tube dysfunction are difficult to treat and eustachian tube balloon dilatation may be a good choice for you (as you are a frequent flyer)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My heart rate is 90 to 100 while doing exercise.

Over the past few days, my eyelid is also drooping and makes the eye appear smaller. I still do not have any symptoms such as pain, but now both my eyes are itchy. This tends to happen more at night, accompanied by such thick stringy discharge. Just to give some background, I had a severe case of red, itchy eyes a few months back.

On top of that, I have my exams. For the past four days, I have been applying an ointment, which is antifungal and antibacterial. I have also been taking Cetirizine, but it does not seem to help.

The quality of your pictures was unfortunately not very good, but decent enough to allow me to make a provisional diagnosis (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It seems that you are suffering from a form of contact allergic eczema. It is an eczema in response to an allergy to some agricultural substance or vegetation product or chemical such as a pesticide or fertilizer or some other occupational exposure substance. It is also possible that you may have an intrinsic tendency of allergies in general and reacting to these purported substances, in an out of proportion way due to that tendency. I suggest applying a potent corticosteroid cream, preferably with an antifungal combination, such as Tenovate-M (Clobetasol propionate) cream or a plain potent steroid cream or ointment such as Halox or Halovate (Halobetasol propionate) ointment to be applied twice a day over the affected areas for a duration of 15 days. Additionally, I suggest tablet Allegra (Fexofenadine) 180 mg one tablet to be taken daily in the evening around 6 to 7 PM for 10 days. Try to visit a general practitioner or a family physician and take the above treatment with consent. Use only a mild soap, such as a baby soap or creamy soap for washing hands. Strictly avoid exposure to any detergents, medicated soaps, harsh soaps and hand sanitizer, as they may worsen the condition. This should provide you with instant relief from your current problem. However, after your examinations are over and the condition subsides, you shall need to consult a dermatologist in person. So, that further tests such as a patch test may be conducted to elucidate a suspected cause of this contact allergy. Patch test after subsidence of the acute allergic phase. Avoidance of exposure to medicated or harsh soaps, detergents and chemical sanitizer. Revert back after 10 days to a dermatologist online.--->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 29 years old.

Several of the fillings have fallen out. They were not worn down by brushing, but actually they are detached as a whole from the tooth. I was shocked that they had lasted less than a year because online searches indicate they should last for five to seven years. Under normal circumstances, how long should composite fillings last?","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your images. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Usually, composite restoration lasts for four to five years. Composite filling is not as strong as amalgam fillings. Moreover it has to be taken care of more than amalgam fillings. Precautions to be taken for successful composite filling should be followed to last it longer. Most of it are the job of the dentist who is performing procedure, but there are few things that should be followed by patients also. 1. Avoid taking or biting hard food or candies with those teeth. 2. If there is any microfracture line of the tooth because of any hard substance bitting or trauma then it is harmful to the composite filling. 3. If any trauma or impact to filling then composite filling will not last long. 4. If you having any habit of nail biting then it is not good for filling. 5. If you have a habit of bruxism or night grinding then it is agrravating factor for fracture of restoration. 6. You should avoid tea, coffee or hard drinks consumption too frequently because it will lose its property and color. Apart from these things, there is natural shedding or wearing of composite layer like natural teeth wears as the time passes. Yes, your dentist is right if there is a fault in preparation of restoration or while doing composite feeling then it would have gone within few weeks. So, for permanent solution, you can go for root canal with zirconia crown. If zirconia is costly then you can ask for other options for crown to your dentist which are available to them.

I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.","Doctor":"Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this?","Doctor":"Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

I want to become fair as my marriage is going to get fixed by next year. Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife is 25 years old. Her right eye has been detected of idiopathic CNVM. She had an OCT test already. She has been asked to take three injections of Accentrix with a gap of one month in between each. I read various articles all refer to an injection of a drug called Bevacizumab (brand name Avastin). Are Accentrix and Bevacizumab (brand name Avastin) the same? Is this the only way of treatment? Will this treatment completely cure the Idiopathic CNVM and my wife will have her normal vision back? Which would be the best place for treatment in India? What is the rough cost of the complete treatment?","Doctor":"Hello. Avastin and Accentrix are both more or less equally efficacious in CNVM (choroidal neovascular membrane). The difference lies in the fact that Accentrix is FDA (food and drug administration) approved but Avastin is not. In case any side effect appears after injecting Avastin (though very rare) then your treating ophthalmologist will land up in trouble and media will blame him for using Avastin and he may be in soup. It is irony of our nation that due to some uneducated people, doctors are forced to offer costly treatment when cheap options are available. This is not the only option, but yes, this is the best option. I am sorry but the prognosis is guarded, she may recover fully and gain good vision or she may not attain 6/6 vision again and she may have central scotoma. Regarding the best place, treatment is same everywhere. You may get the treatment from any place of your choice. Regarding the treatment cost, it is difficult to say. She may need more than three injections also, so be mentally prepared for that also.

The doctor suggested Omega 369 tablets (Fultos 369) for 15 days and an eye drop (Softdrops) daily. The dry eye problem cured after taking tablets and has been using the same eye drop daily for around four to five times since then. My eyesight was tested and fine that time. I use transparent lens and glasses while working because without that it feels the moisture is getting evaporated from eyes. I also use an eye mask after keeping in freezer to relax eyes for some time. In the last month, I again started feeling some burning sensation in eyes like earlier due to dry eye. I started taking Omega 369 tablets (Well 369) for 10 days and the eye burning problem almost stopped. Now, I am feeling the same burning problem in the eyes. These are some specific queries on this issue. How much dosage of Omega 369 can be taken for dry eye this time? What are the best medicines having Omega 369? Is there any side effect of having Omega 369 for a long time? Which foods are the best supplements of Omega 369 in this case? Is there any side effect of using eye drop for a long time? I put 2 drops in each eye for four to five times daily. Is there any alternative treatment or medicine for dry eye problem? I am looking forward your reply. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello.

I feel weird and unusual sensations in my brain. The best way I can describe it is that it basically feels like there is a big bubble in my head, trying to fill in a missing gap or something, combined with a pins and needles feeling. Also, every now and then, I feel a very small pulsation or a kind of jerky feeling. It is very weird. The sensations are not painful, but they are very uncomfortable and very noticeable. It is a physical feeling and not a mental one. In other words, they are not simply because of depression or anxiety. They occur constantly and sometimes, they are more intense. I originally had thought that it was just a prolonged withdrawal from my medication (Adderall) and that my brain chemistry was just resetting back to normal. I had ceased taking this medication, roughly a year ago and even went to rehabilitation for some extra help. But, I am still noticing these very weird symptoms. Also, whenever I do take my medication (Concerta), I do not feel the effect of the medication at all. It just recently happened, maybe four months ago. As soon as I got out of a rehabilitation center, I was switched to Concerta and it was working great. I only took it as prescribed, but out of nowhere, it all of a sudden just stopped working. I have even gone as far as taking breaks as long as two weeks and still nothing. It just does not make any sense to me. It is making me to worry that something more serious may be going on with me medically. I am going to meet a neurologist. I would also like to get a second opinion from another specialist. I should also mention that I had a SPECT scan done. I got the scan done just to get some insight on the behavior of my brain because of my ADHD. The SPECT scan came back and said that my results were 3 standard deviations away from the most extreme of cases. I am honestly not sure if those results were due to just depression as I have been going through a lot of it or if it was just a neurochemical thing from the quitting of Adderall. But, either way it showed that something was not quite right. The doctor said it was just from playing too many video games, but I do not really believe that. I am worried that it could be a brain tumor, but I guess SPECT scans can detect brain tumors. The SPECT scan I had done did not show any brain tumors. The neurologist that I talked to online said it did not sound like anything serious from what I described. I have told the doctor, who did my SPECT scan, about what I have been going through. He says that it should not be Adderall that is still affecting me years later and he recommended me to see a neurologist. I have also told my psychiatrist that I normally see about what I have been going through as well and I guess he said that stimulants can take up to a year to recover from. Any help you can give me would be great. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. It seems that it has been because of your medications only that you are having these symptoms. Your Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms were well controlled with Adderall (combination of Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine), which is a more effective medication for ADHD. However, now you have been started on Concerta (Methylphenidate), which is not as potent as Adderall. Hence, you are having all these symptoms. Besides medications, you should also opt for some behavioral therapies to regulate these symptoms. These symptoms can be the reflection of your mind's craving to switch back to Adderall. Stimulant withdrawals can be protracted and can last for a longer period as well. Hence, you must get yourself assessed in detail in view of stimulant therapy revision. Thank you.

It hurt only when I touch. It has not got any worse. In fact, it is better and less tender unless I touch it. When I had an appointment with my doctor, I was asked to give a blood sample. I got the reports back and everything was normal except the CBC. The polymorphs were 82.4 (normal range is 36 to 78) and the lymphocytes were 9.7 (normal range is 12 to 48). WBC 9.21, HCT 12.3 and HGB 36.8. I do not have any fever, night sweats, weight loss, chills or fatigue.

I have a relationship for about five years now and we are married for the last four years. We have a boy, who is 2.5 years old. I am an architect. My wife is 29 years old and she is an interior architect. But, she is not working at the moment as she is looking after our son. I had my first sexual engagement when I was 16 years old. I knew from the beginning that something was wrong with the way I was doing sex. I did not have any proper education about it. I always felt my erection time a little below the standards. I do not really know how much it should actually be. While having sex, I could not go all the way as my erection was no more. When I had a proper erection, I was early all the time. That was not a problem those days as I was young. I was comforting myself about how young and inexperienced I am and believed it will be better as I get older. But the truth is, it has got worse. I had sex with my wife for around four or five times after the birth of my son, which means five times in 2.5 years. In the early stage of our relationship, our sex life was good. Later, our sex period started to decrease. After we learned about my wife's pregnancy, real problems began. We did not have sex for 3 or 4 months and it continued the same way, until this point. But, there were no problem with my masturbation count. I had never had such a high libido and so is my wife. But, we had a good vibration and our relationship got better and better. We were always into the ordinary type of sex and did nothing so special. I can even say we have three or four positions and all of our diversity comes from differentiating our location, such as living room, bedroom, etc. My biggest issue about our sex pattern was not doing it in the mornings. I guess most of the women do not like it, but it became a bigger issue. Because, after some time, those were my only moments that I want to have sex.  But, we could not do any, because she did not want that. Initially refused morning sex and then she said she does not like to have sex at all. Last week, she told me that she like to get a divorce and that really made me so sad. My wife's parents are with us for the past two months. As they are renovating their house, they will stay with us for a year. We also got other problems, but none of them are desperate as this one. I am not expecting a magic response from you, but at least I need a direction to solve this issue. Should I begin with myself or should we do something together? Where should I seek further medical advice? Should I get checked physiologically or just see a family counselor? What should be the first step of a solution for me to be happy forever with my wife and child?","Doctor":"Hi.

The symptoms you are experiencing are classic of an infected sinus, leading to the spread of that infection to other parts of your upper respiratory tract. It can be possible that the magnet, is compressing one of the sinus openings, leading to secondary infection and hence the symptoms. Please, do not delay any further.

I do like to describe the pain as irritation, burning, feeling like eating sandpaper; constant pulse to puff and burp, acid reflux and fire in my breast and stomach. I used tons of medications for years, such as proton pump inhibitors, antacids, etc. It is a constant and continuous problem. I tried every natural supplement for stomach, acid reflux, gut health and healing. I raised my bed, but nothing really worked. Around seven years ago, I was tested for Celiac disease, but all tests came back negative. I never considered gluten as being a problem for me. Until, out of desperation and pain, a year ago I tried anyway to go off gluten. After a week, I had my life back. I could not believe it. All the symptoms were completely gone. After some time, the symptoms came back and then by recalling the events, I realized that I had made a mistake. On some evenings my pains were back. Finally, when analyzing what I did, I realized I started taking a nutritional supplement in a powder form. I checked the label and it said that manufactured in a facility that also processes gluten. Also, I had a beer. I forgot about the barley in that moment and got sick again. When I started buying the whole roasted chicken, my symptoms were back. There was no gluten containing ingredients on the label, so I did not pay much of attention. Finally, I got to know that the spices have traces of gluten. It is relevant to know that I did not like the taste and I had no time to cook or to heat it, so I used to remove the skin completely, and rinse the chicken pieces thoroughly under the hot running tap water using a strainer until the flesh was completely white and then, I eat. I ate some cashews and was sick again. The label stated that the facility also processes wheat.I got graduated in Food Science Technology with honors last year. I am a quality assurance manager in a food industry. I have an academic education, training, and work experience in both the fields involved in the topic of gluten and allergens in general. Also, I aware of the topic from the point of view of the human body, health, nutrition, immune system and antigen interaction, nutritional sciences, nutritional related gastroenterology, clinical nutrition, from the point of view of the food itself, its substrates, components, chemistry, etc. In spite of all these things, when I eat together with my husband, it is often an argument and absurd things happen. For example, that it is my invention that I should not share the same tools, especially if they are made of wood, etc. When I say it is my background they answer that I think I know everything. It is not everything, but it is my job.

He can manage anything and can do any task. But, he quickly gets irritated when saw any flaw around. He expects me to be 100% perfectionist in any work at home. Due to the irritation, he was throwing nasty slangs. It does not mean anything serious. It is natural from his side and after two minutes he forgets everything. But, I cannot cope up with listening these slangs. It is mentally affecting me. However, I did not blame him. I tried to analyze the cause of his irritation and I found that he has financial panic and stress. So, I pushed him to start giving tuition to IT professionals. As he is getting extra earning, he feels better with more confidence now. Also, I pushed him slowly to join a spiritual community where they offer breathing exercise techniques for free and he said that he got benefited from it. Also, I observed that the frequency of his irritation reduced. Even though he has reduced his irritation, I really do not know to handle him when he shouts after me horribly and talks rubbish. He treats me very low for that moment. Otherwise, he is very fine with me and those are just a matter of moments. I am very gentle, soft natured and hardly argue with others.

I am 90% fine after having a baby.","Doctor":"Hi. I completely understand that you are facing a hard time dealing with your husband at times he gets irritated and you feel concerned about your baby if she gets affected by this attitude. Here, I am telling you something related to psychological theories and research findings on how children form perceptions. Communication pattern may gets disturbed if one or both of the partners are going through some stress, psychological problems or any sort of personality patterns which clash with each other. Psychological assessment of both partners is necessary when there is a partner related problem. Together, you both can consult a psychologist (family therapist) for assessment, so that the communication patterns of both the partners can be assessed and guided towards positive growth.  Because, in case of only one partner suffering from psychological illness, individual psychotherapy is suggested. But, if both are having some psychological issues, first of all they both need individual counseling or therapy and when they complete the individual treatment, their partner related issues are worked out in couple therapy.  Do get your partner assessed psychologically and get confirmed your own diagnosis, so that you can get effective treatment before it affects your offspring. Partner relational problem. A research shows that the couple therapy or marital therapy is the best treatment for partner related problems or communication problems. Do take some couple therapy sessions to work on your communication patterns.  As you have mentioned that you are dealing with your husband since long time, I appreciate; the way you are handling is very well. Keep handling it gently. Here, I am giving you some tips to develop effective communication skills. 1. What you feel is very important to communicate with your partner, whether you feel positive or negative, do communicate it. But, the key to effective communication is the way you communicate it to your partner. For example, you are giving a positive comment in a harsh or loud tone, definitely it will give a negative sense and the next person will never take it positively. 2. In contrast, you talk in a low and humble tone. You can talk to your partner that you feel very concerned that if our baby will be affected by our words. She may not learn what we are saying in front of her and she might not get fearful of our loud tone. You do not hit the person directly, but try to tell your real feelings and concerns and then definitely it will give a positive sense. 3. The next person will never ignore your concern if you give him the sense that you respect his personality and you like him, but this particular behavior is unacceptable for you and you want him to be more likable. 4. Always use positive affirmations in your language if you want others to listen you. For example, I respect what you are going through, I am always there for you, I want to see you happy, you are a very nice person and any other positive phrases. If you start your talk with positive things and then lightly come to the negative aspect, it will definitely give another person the sense that you really want him to improve, rather than trying to hit or hurt. 5. Take care of your verbal (the words you say) and nonverbal messages (body language). If both are congruent, you will be considered true and genuine. If you say that I am happy, but your body posture or facial expressions say that you are not happy inside and something is wrong, then the next person will definitely believe on your body language and not your words. I appreciate that you are concerned regarding your baby at this initial stage. Do take help to deal with the issues before it affects your child. Because, once the child's personality patterns are formed, then it is very difficult for the parents to reshape it.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My 19 months old daughter has suffered with for around seven months. Then, we had an MCU test and it was diagnosed that she had grade 5 reflux in right side and grade 4 in left side. Her ultrasound showed she had 40 cc urine residual. Her doctor suggested ureteric bilateral surgery. She has an open vascular surgery before two months and her stents removed before 20 days. Now, she again had an UTI and reflux problem. Is there any problem? Please guide us.","Doctor":"Hi. Surgery to correct reflux will not prevent UTI (urinary tract infection). It will only prevent bacteria from reaching kidneys, thereby preventing renal damage. Yes, UTI can still occur after correction of reflux. Other factors which predispose to UTI must be ruled out, like neurogenic bladder, voiding dysfunction, dysfunctional elimination syndrome, etc. If there are no other factors, then the child can be put on prophylactic antibiotics for a few months and this will stop the recurrence.

At your age, disturbances in heart rhythm are very common. About 1 out of 5 people in their 90's have this condition known as atrial fibrillation. Hence, we need to rule that out. If the condition does not resolve by itself, what I would do is to get an echocardiogram done in addition to a 24-hour monitoring of ECG (electrocardiogram). The 24-hour ECG monitoring is called Holter test and can be done easily at most of the local hospitals. These two tests will tell us if there is anything wrong with the structure and electric rhythm of your heart. Your ECG shows slow conduction (attachment removed to protect patient identity), so you definitely need a Holter test.

I have hypothyroidism and I am on Synthyroid. Overall, I am healthy. I exercise daily and do not smoke. I have a 15 month old toddler. Throughout my pregnancy, my blood work showed an elevated WBC, but they are under 15 k/mL. They just assumed it was due to being pregnant. At six months postpartum, I noticed a lump on my neck. Further examination and ultrasound showed it was a thyroid nodule. FNA confirmed it was a follicular goiter, which is assumed to be benign. Follow up CBC blood work showed the following: WBC 15.9 k/uL, basophils 10%, IG 9.8%, absolute neutrophil count 8.8 k/uL, absolute basophils 1.6 k/uL, IG ABS 1.65 k/uL. All other counts were within the normal range. I would like to add that I have had a persistent rather annoying headache for almost three months and have developed a weird itching. I itch like crazy and then when I scratch it, it leaves a red chaffed mark that is more than normal. I also feel rather fatigued, but have just assumed it was due to being a new mom.

I am fatigued, pale and have periodic random strange symptoms like mild numbness or heaviness in legs and fluttering in stomach.  I have tried an antibiotic for a suspected sinus infection, but low grade fever and fatigue persists. I eat well and I am maintaining a good weight. How do I narrow down the possibilities of illness? Is it possibly a fungal infection?","Doctor":"Hi. This is a chronic fever, which is called as pyrexia of unknown origin when we are unable to ascertain a cause. As your blood tests and x-ray are normal, lung infection is ruled out. Conditions causing chronic fever are numerous. Also, certain infections like tuberculosis, HIV and malignancies can cause it. But, in your case it is unlikely as there is no weight loss or other risk factors, neither you have an x-ray abnormality. Now, we move to the lymph nodes. Do you have any lymph node swelling? If yes, then get it tested. Try to get an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out lymphadenopathy. Get a urine routine and culture as sometimes a mild urine infection can get unnoticed and cause fever. Get a blood glucose and renal function test too. If everything comes normal, then we should look for anemia. A low hemoglobin can cause low grade fever and fatigue. Fungal infections usually cause severe illness. To confirm if it is a fungal infection, a blood culture is required.

She fainted then and after that, she only remembers waking up. She says that all these are coming back now because she is curious about what happened to her that night. Her delusions and nightmares were triggered by a rape scene she was seeing in a daily soap recently which made her remember the incident. What is worse is that if she gets to know what happened that night, and if it is really something that bad, she might commit suicide or hurt herself.

She might respond to a small dose of Escitalopram 10 mg at morning and 0.25 mg Clonazepam at night, if there are severe nightmares there is also an option of Prazosin 1 mg at night, you could meet a local psychiatrist for these. I would recommend you to not actively talk about the rape thing to her or do any online therapy since it can make her focus too much on the topic. Try to distract her and keep her engaged.

I have had RUQ pain and colic attacks for the past three or four years. Ultrasounds at the time showed no symptoms. Then I had a HIDA scan that showed 12% ejection fraction, so the doctor suggested surgery to remove the gallbladder, even without stones or anything. I declined. I modified my diet. The attacks became more sporadic, but last month I had an acute acalculous cholecystitis event. An ultrasound showed some sludge and 3 mm wall thickening. Again, surgery was suggested and scheduled. But symptoms resolved within a week and I am completely asymptomatic now. I am really scared of having unnecessary surgery if I have no stones. What is the worst that can happen if I just decline surgery? I am afraid of having ongoing new indigestion symptoms post-surgery. I do not want new problems. I am really afraid.","Doctor":"Hi. Since you had GB sludge with multiple attacks of biliary colic, the chances of getting a repeat attack are very high. Sludge or microlithiasis denote a dysfunctional gall bladder. It is always better to remove a dysfunctional gall bladder as it has a high probability of stone formation. All attacks need not be mild as you had. At times severe attacks may happen which need emergency surgery. There can be infectious episodes too. The next severe complication happens from secondary pancreatitis. This microlithiasis are not easily picked up on ultrasound scans. So if you see the risks of retaining gallbladder and the advantages of surgery, the advantages overweigh the risks. I would definitely recommend a planned surgery before developing complications and ending up with an infection and unplanned surgery. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a sex addict.

Many people do respond to a combination of Lamotrigine and Quetiapine (popularly called as Lami-quel). It takes time to act, but it is highly effective. Currently, I would suggest that instead of Lithium you use Lamotrigine 25 mg x 2, then 50 mg x 2 and finally 100 mg x 2. Dose titration is every two to three weeks. Instead of Olanzapine, I would replace it with Quetiapine 50 to 100 mg for start and raise if needed based on the sedation. Also, continue Escitalopram if needed or replace it with a TCA (tricyclic antidepressant) class of antidepressants. And yes, do add Bupropion (Wellbutrin).

I applied the apple cider vinegar to the mole daily until it formed a scab, which later fell off leaving pink skin underneath. There is still a pinkish scar, which is very slowly fading and I have been applying scar reducing serum daily. Prior to removing the mole, I had it checked by a few doctors and all of whom said it looked normal.  A week before the application of apple cider vinegar, I had visited a dermatologist for a skin cancer screening. On visual examination, he said it looked normal. The mole was very slightly larger than a pencil eraser, symmetrical, uniform light brown in color and very slightly raised. I have also just recently visited another dermatologist I pointed out the scar to her and told her what I had done. She said that the spot looked fine. Lately, my health anxiety has been heightened due to weaning off an SSRI a few months ago and subsequently trying different medicines, all of which have raised my anxiety level. I just would like some reassurance that I did not cause any damage by mole using the apple cider vinegar. I presume if it had somehow been cancerous, it would not have scabbed and fallen off, leaving just a scar. Also, is there any possibility that I could have somehow caused any cancerous changes to the remaining cells or into the bloodstream that just cannot be seen on the surface of my skin? Thank you for any input and assistance you can provide. I have attached photos for your reference. The first photo is a picture of a very similar looking mole, which I currently have in my abdomen.

Suddenly, when I awake, I realize that he is not beside me. Why am I getting such feel?","Doctor":"Hi. There could be associated psychological condition such as narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is explained by the bouts of sleep during any time in the day, even a person may sleep at workplace. This causes extreme disturbance and requires medical or psychological treatment. If hypnopompic hallucinations are the only thing you have experienced and no narcoleptic bouts are present, then this is the indication that you are going through normal process of transitions during rapid eye movement sleep. Hypnopompic hallucinations (auditory type). There is no particular medical or psychological treatment for mere hypnopompic hallucinations. However, some doctors prescribe medicines to treat the disturbance that is anxiety caused by this condition. If you are fine with your hypnopompic hallucinations after learning that it is a normal thing, then you do not need any further treatment. If you find yourself worried about your condition, then you can just take a counseling session with a psychologist. I appreciate that you just noticed this phenomenon and consulted a specialist. If you find any other psychological factors such as narcolepsy, then this is the alarming point. Just get the problem treated as soon as possible without any hesitation and delay.  Also, check if there is any other sleep related problem present such as nightmare, sleep terror, narcolepsy, etc. You can consult a sleep specialist in order to rule out these conditions.

Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I went for an HIV test at six weeks after low-risk exposure and get false positive. At eight weeks both fourth generation and HIV RNA PCR are negative. At 9 and 10 weeks rapid test is negative. At 12 weeks HIV RNA PCR is negative. Is it conclusive? My doctor told me no need for further tests.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome back to icliniq.com. To answer your query, I want to give reference of published research that, Although the reported sensitivity and specificity of fourth generation tests are more than 99% in numerous studies, there are several instances of discordance between screening and confirmatory techniques (Liu P et al. AIDS Research and Therapy 2016 13:1). False positivity can be due to user error or cross contamination, if there is ongoing some other illness eg. malaria, or if there is a history of blood transfusion, autoimmune diseases. A positive test result always needs to be routinely confirmed using a different type of test or testing kit. Fourth generation tests are more than 95% accurate at six weeks and this needs to be confirmed after three months with a second test. If the test in your case has been performed at three months after the exposure and is giving negative results, and you have not had another risk, you do not have HIV. Your fourth generation test and RNA PCR at 9 and 10 weeks and further 12 weeks negative RNA PCR, suffices to rule out infection. If you still have apprehension, get a repeat HIV antibody test at six months of exposure, no need to repeat it in between. Take precautions in the future (consistent and correct condom usage). I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I recently had an echocardiogram. The results were normal, but the deceleration time is 439 ms.

I mean, it never really used to bother me besides the occasional mess and I used to think it was more a result of tight underwear or something. My urine basically splits into two streams. In terms of how strong or steady the flow is, it seems normal, just right to get it into the urinal. There are also times that I have difficulty. When I mean difficulty, I mean 10 to 20 seconds of waiting at the very most. That is, some exertion needed to urinate, but this happens on occasion. When this happens, there is some discomfort in the perineum. After I finish, it drips a little. I was just wondering about the dribbling thing.

Last year, when she was 5 years old we had to do a physical examination for getting admission in the school. During the examination the primary care doctor noticed some abnormal growth in her body like breast buds and asked us to consult a pediatric endocrinologist for further examination. We consulted a pediatric endocrinologist and did a complete examination such as blood test, bone age and brain MRI. The MRI came back normal with no issues, however the bone age showed 8.5 years old. Also, physical development shows Tanner 2 breast development, Tanner 1 pubic hair and scanty axillary hair. Her random LH value was 0.9. The doctor said she is hitting the precocious puberty and needs to be treated. The treatment plan was Lupron or Supprelin. We researched the side effects of Lupron and Supprelin and found like overweight and unconsciousness affects the body in later stage and many mixed answers. We were confused and was not able to discuss with anyone. As this was new to us, we left that moment without proceeding any treatment. Again, this year, we went for another set of examination and the results came up with the bone age as 10.5 years. Actually, she is 6 years old. I am attaching the current results for your reference. The doctor again said that we need to do treatment and to start with Lupron 30 mg every three months. We are still in a confused state whether to start the treatment. So, we like to have a second opinion. What will happen if we do not treat? Will she end up in less height and growth once she hit puberty? 3. What are the side effects of Lupron? Will you be able to tell us the experience shared with any of your patients? Can this get cured naturally? Is it due to the environment or food habits of my place? If we move to our native, will that environment and food habit cure this? We are totally in a confused state and not able to take a firm decision.","Doctor":"Hi. Estrogen tablets intoxication.

The honeymoon phase did not last long and on the end anyway. I noticed that within two to three months our sex life really slowed down. At first it did not bother me because he is more of a passive or shy personality. So, I thought I would initiate more. That worked for another month or two, but by the second month it was more no than yes. Then, I stopped initiating and figured I would let him initiate at his own pace and two weeks went by with no sex. I asked him if he still found me attractive and he insisted he did and nothing was wrong. We did have sex only because I was the one being suggestive. In these almost one year of life, we had not had sex for the last two months or maybe more. We recently had an argument about something else and the lack of sexual intimacy came up. Once again, he swore it had nothing to do with me. I am so torn. I care about him very much, but I have recently had lost my sex drive. The constant rejection and lack of interest shown on his part leaves me feeling unattractive and confused. I should mention that he has made unflattering comments before about my body. Before six months, when I asked him about our sex life, he mentioned that sometimes he cannot feel anything. I felt lost, but not all the time. I tried not to make a big deal of it. But, I was extremely hurt and still I am. I personally enjoyed having sex with him. Till this day he claims he is still into me and says that he just does not really get the urge to have sex. He has even mentioned a couple of times that he would get that checked out. Of course, that has not happened. Where do I go from here?

After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

I guess you are taking combination pill that is hormonal contraceptives containing both estrogen and progestin (synthetic progesterone). These act by preventing your ovulation and making your cervical mucus thicker. You need to take combination pills within five days after the start of the period.

Yes, you need not take pills in the fourth week and this will initiate your withdrawal bleeding that is you will have a menstrual bleed in that week and you will be protected. Some measures you need to follow. You need to ensure that you take these pills regularly at the same time each day. If you vomit immediately following pill consumption, then take one more pill. You should not miss the pill. If you miss a period, then do not panic as irregular periods are common. You need to confirm by urine pregnancy test .

It turned out that fruits were really the solution to my problem. I have now almost 100% perfect control over digestion and live very happily. I have a tendency to exaggerate a little bit and have too much discipline. I am eating a whole large fruit every day. I mean 1 to 2 kg of fruit, which I eat at once.

With this amount of hemoglobin, we put you into the group of severe anemia. Due to low oxygenation, you could be having severe headaches.

Improved nutrition with protein, iron and vitamin-rich diet is necessary along with Iron, vitamin B12 and Folic acid supplements. Along with it, adequate rest and possibly packed red cell transfusion will be necessary. Anemia is very severe and any further fall could affect the heart and maybe result in heart failure.

I have reviewed your question. I am sorry you are experiencing back pain and dizziness. Believe it or not, 80% of people will experience back pain at some point in their life. I do have several questions before I can fully answer your question. How do you know C1 is your issue and how do you know it is out? Have you had any other diagnostic tests to explain your dizziness? Any CT scans, MRIs, etc? When did the dizziness start? Have you tried any exercises for this issue? Answers to these questions would be very helpful. Since I do not have the answers to the above questions, I can only say this. Chiropractors are taught to examine the whole spine and evaluate the whole body, symptoms and all. If your chiropractor is not adjusting C1 like you want him to, it probably means that he is finding something else that he believes may be more of an issue for you. With that being said, it is ultimately your decision as to whether or not you continue to see this chiropractor. Without answers to the questions above and without reviewing the chiropractor’s notes, it does not sound like he/she is doing anything wrong by not grabbing the out of place bone and cracking it.

The reason being every drug is good and bad and has its own pros and cons. Metoprolol is a wonderful drug to slow down the heart rate without side effects on other organs. Metoprolol is a cardioselective beta blocke. Having said that, if you do not have any associated features or specific cause, then you ask your doctor to follow the protocol of the JNC 8 (the Eighth Joint National Committee) - the international guidelines for hypertension. I suggest you tablet Losar-H (Losartan) once daily as it is the safest drug. But, the switch has to be slow as you are addicted to beta blocker and removing it suddenly would cause withdrawal.

Stones smaller than 6 mm are likely to pass without any intervention. Those that are larger than 6 mm or which cause severe pain, vomiting, or fever need surgical removal (endoscopic). In your case, the stone should pass in a few days time. If pain recurs, you can go for admission and flush therapy (intravenous fluids to flush out stone) for one or two days. You can stop either Aceclofenac or Mefenamic acid as both are pain killers. Take either of the two.

We tried every other day in my fertile time for two months, but I got my periods. Should I continue Clomid for third cycle and try every day for six to seven days during my fertile period? Should I increase my Clomid dose to 100 mg for this cycle? Please advise. I used to have tender breast post ovulation, which last till periods. But, after taking Clomid and Duphaston, in the last two cycles, I did not have tender breasts post ovulation. Is it because of vitamin and Folic acid intake?","Doctor":"Hi.

Approximately 3 months ago, he started to lose the ability to walk. He is not able to stand up with making a tripod position. His balance is extremely unstable and his grip in his hands has diminished that he is not able to hold a crayon. When he does walk, he skirts the furniture or just refuses and says ouch. I took him to his primary care doctor and he ran a CBC and a CRP. Both came back normal as well as x-rays on both ankles and knees. He asked to wait for a few weeks, monitor him and return if it does not improve. After a few weeks, the doctor himself understood that it has gotten worse from just observing him in the clinic. He again ran another CBC, CRP and CKMB. All those came back normal. We then got an EKG and discovered borderline RVH. We have an appointment with a neurologist by next week. So, I wanted to head up on the things to ask for, possibilities and directions on where we go from here. Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns.

My usual blood pressure will be 140/90 mmHg. Both my parents are with high BP. I have taken my blood tests and urine analysis. Everything is fine, including my ECG. Last year due to improper posture, I had muscle spasms. I was scared and my anxiety increased. Hence, my BP shot up to 150/95 mmHg.

Left lower abdomen pain, constant mushy stools (twice had blood), constant watery stools, heart twitches a couple of times a day, abdomen hurts more when I sit or lay down. I am a chronic alcoholic. I have searched in the internet resources and was horrified when I matched with the symptoms of colon cancer. I went to the ER that night. I had barely quit drinking two days prior to that. The doctor said that he does not think it is colon cancer. They took my blood, urine, EKG and x-ray. They gave an IV drip or saline and painkiller. The doctor also gave me Lorazepam 1 mg for anxiety and sleepless nights. This is due to my student loans and taxes being so far behind and so I drank way too much for many years. He also prescribed me Labetalol 100 mg for high cholesterol and Ondansetron 4 mg for nausea and vomiting, which they said I will be experiencing during withdrawals. The doctor advised me not to quit alcohol cold turkey. My drink of choice was plain vodka. He said to take the amount I normally drink, cut it in half and add the other half as water. Then gradually decrease the amount of alcohol until I have weaned myself off. Would that interfere with medicines, especially Lorazepam?","Doctor":"Hello. Your left lower quadrant pain can be due to any of the following: 1. Acute diverticulitis. 2. Ureteric or kidney stones. 3. Inflammatory bowel disease. 4. Irritable bowel syndrome or infectious colitis. 5. Colon cancer is very down on the list. But, if you have a family history of colon cancer, then you should consider colonoscopy depending upon their age at the time of diagnosis. I guess that all your laboratory tests were normal. Please upload them if you can. I will be interested in seeing CT scan with contrast.  Get a colonoscopy for sure if diarrhea with bleeding recurs to rule out inflammatory bowel disease. Diverticulitis. If your uncomfortable feeling and mushy stools comes back, then you might need to consult your gastroenterologist for antibiotic treatment and colonoscopy.

The chances for it being NPC is minimal. To rule it out we need to do a nasal endoscopy. What hearing loss came out in the test? Conductive or sensorineural?

The laparoscopic surgery will definitely reduce your symptoms and the endometriosis of the ovary will be taken care of.

My last period was on the 25th of last month and my average cycle is around 28 days. My husband and I had unprotected sex on 5th and 6th. I noticed some dark brown discharge on my underwear. When I wiped, it was mixed dark brown and red strands of blood. It has been more than 24 hours and very light when I wipe. I also have been experiencing soreness and light cramps as I would feel in the beginning of my period. However, the discomfort in my abdomen is located on one side and it comes and goes. I have soreness in my legs, lower back and breasts. I also have been experiencing some aching sensation in my vagina. I have also experienced sudden feelings of nausea, but it has not lasted very long. When I began spotting, I was very surprised. I have never spotted between periods before. I am not sure if this is because I have missed taking my pills or if it is implantation bleeding. I have been driving myself crazy by thinking that I could actually be pregnant. The thought of having a baby makes me so excited. But, I do not want to get my hopes up. Please clarify.","Doctor":"Hi. The spotting that you are experiencing is probably you have not taken the pill regularly and withdrawal due to that. You had unprotected sex on day 11 and spotting on day 16. I do not think it is implantation bleeding. However, if you are keen to know whether you are pregnant or not, then you can get a blood test beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) and see the value. Wait for your normal cycle and if you do not get periods, then get a TVS (transvaginal scan) done. If you are keen to get pregnant then you should not take tablet Lo Loestrin (birth control pill) since it is a contraceptive. If you are taking it without fail, then you need not take any other precaution.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My tongue remains white for about 1 to 1.5 years. It could be long, but not less than the duration I mentioned. My tongue gets hurt often.

Suddenly, I had a stomach pain in the lower side and no other symptoms were found. We visited our doctor and she said that the cervix started to open slightly. I got severe pain, some medicines were given that night and in the morning the cervix opened completely and the baby got delivered. The doctor said that it may be due to some infections. But, my vaginal and urine culture had no infections. After one week, we had a test for rubella and CMV. My rubella ICG value is more than 500 and CMV ICG value also more than 500. Rubella IGM is 0.243 and CMV IGM is 0.413. Are these viruses responsible for premature pregnancy? What can I do to avoid this in future?","Doctor":"Hi.

The bones were displaced and the doctors advised to heal it conservatively. They used sling and the figure of 8 brace for six weeks for the same. No retraction for alignment or surgery was performed. It has been three months and still I have slight pain in the joint. There is an obvious bump. In x-rays, it still looks like a fractured bone with no joint in between. It pains to lift the hand sideways and while lifting weights. I am a pilot.

I consulted a doctor and he said it as Pityriasis rosea. I took treatment for a month, but I guess they are enlarged. Now, I have completely stopped medicines. I took Averzine 25, L-Cet 5 mg, applied Propynate, Clobivax and Galderma. Another doctor says that I need to do a skin test to confirm psoriasis. I have attached the prescription here and the test is yet to take. Right now, I am applying an ayurveda cream Sorion topical and taking ayurveda medicines. I have also attached my recent blood test report. Please suggest any medications and right action.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your investigation reports and they are normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I have seen your images and it is psoriasis only. Yes, a skin biopsy should be done to have documentation for the future. It is a very small procedure. The small skin sample will be taken from the lesion. Your dermatologist prescribed Methotrexate and it is a test dose given to you. Subsequently, if needed the dose of Methotrexate will be increased depending on your response. You have started on the right treatment. Along with oral the topical medications given to you will help. Also, narrow band UVB therapy (ultraviolet B) called as phototherapy works well in case of psoriasis. If your doctor has this facility, then ask him when you visit next time. Because, it will take time to resolve only with medication.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.","Doctor":"Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this?","Doctor":"Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

Or any other dermoatology cream can I use? My hands are also brown in color and full of tan. Do you suggest any creams to get fair? I want to become fair as my marriage is going to get fixed by next year. Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have just got married and I am planning to have a child. I am 44 years old have not had a child before and have no medical problems. I wish to check if I need to take any medical tablets like Folic acid, etc or shall I just go proceed naturally. As mentioned before, I have no health issues and neither do I smoke or drink.","Doctor":"Hello. Congratulations on your wedding. First thing you should do is to start Folic acid and try for timed intercourse. For that, if your periods are regular you can download an application of period tracking. It will tell you the most fertile days of your cycle. Since you are 44 where ovarian reserve may be on a lower side I will not advise you to waste much time. So while you try for a month or two for natural methods of conception I want you to also get tested in the meantime so that you are ready for any medical intervention for fertility enhancing if needed after two months. So please go for LH (leutinizing hormone), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), AMH (anti-Mullerian hormone) and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) blood levels. Also get an OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) and ultrasound pelvis. Your partner can also go for semen analysis to see if the quality of his sperm is good enough. Eat healthily, sleep well and ask your partner also to avoid smoking and alcohol."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis.
