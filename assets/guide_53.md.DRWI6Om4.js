I think that what the doctor put on the warts irritated my skin. What can I do to reduce the irritation and stop my scrotum from being so dry. There is some burning as well","Doctor":"Thanks for asking in healthcaremagic forumIn short: Any alcohol bases/strong solution can cause irritation to scrotum as the skin is very sensitive thereExplanation: As I told to you that, any strong solution of chemical can cause irritation of scrotal skin as it is very sensitive. So, if you are cured with your wart with complete healing of wound. Just stopping any dressing chemical can relieve your problem. Or else you can wash it with gentle warm water and apply vaseline/coconut oil over there.                Usually sebaceous secretion over there keeps area moist and avoids crusting. Sometimes over washing can cause dryness due to washing away of sebaceous secretion from body especially in winters.

I did go to the doctor about 3 weeks ago and was prescribed ciprofloxacin for prostatitis. It was working, but then I think what may be the grand cause of my issues is over masturbation. I did masturbate about 3 times since I started the medication and my last time was Saturday which will be my last. I am also prescribed 20mg Adderall XR s and 10 mg instants. I have been having a lot of brain fog and lack of concentration since this issue has been peaking and it has been making school very difficult. My ultimate question is, do you think this is an infected prostate or something else? Because I also recently went number 2 and it seemed like semen came out in my stool.","Doctor":"Thanks for asking in healthcaremagic forumIn short: I think you have discharge coming out of urethra due to infection not semenExplanation: My dear XXXX, please stop thinking like this. Semen can never come from stools or while passing motion. What you have is infection in your prostate or urethra which is coming out due to pressure while passing motion.

My urologist says it might be varicolese and that it is difficult to diagnose so I had a varicocelectomy which did relieve some of the pain however there is still some pain remaining. It is especially noticeable when blowing my nose, the left testicle experiences more pain the harder I blow my nose. I planned to see my urologist again in 2 weeks (4 weeks after my varicocelectomy) and mention this but what do you think the problem could be and what should I look out for and ask my urologist?","Doctor":"THanks for asking in healthcaremagic forumIn short: Varicocoele is difficult to treat & it recurrsExplanation: There are many reasons for acute(sudden) and chronic(long duration) testicular pain. As you have seen urologist he would have investiogated you thoroughly for these things. Usually dragging pain will be there if you have varicocoele.                    If the pressure in vascular system(pampiniform plexus) increases pain may aggravate. So only you are having more pain during blowing nose. As you have been operated blowing nose can cause pain after surgery due to the same reason. SO, visit your urologist when due for visit and take rest till then.

Masturbating when ever you are fully excited is a normal phenomenon. But masturbating 2-3 times daily without urge may cause erectile dysfunction like this.                  So, concentrate on some other things like playing games, reading books. Do not sit alone in your room. Try to get control over it.

My foreskin used to be very elastic and almost loose a few years ago, but now it feels like a tourniquet even when flaccid. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Thanks for asking in healthcare magic forum.In short: Any infection of glans and prepuce can cause this.Explanation: As you told you were able to retract your foreskin previously but is difficult now. Any infection of glans and prepuce (balanoposthitis) can cause adherence of skin to glans and make it difficult to retract.                 So, you can apply oint clobetasol locally and try retracting it daily once for few days. If it subsides its ok otherwise consult your doctor for this or for surgery(curcumcision).

I am 57 years old...","Doctor":"Thanks for asking in healthcaremagic forumIn short: 1-5 ml of seminal fluid at ejaculation is normalExplanation: You have undergone vasectomy is well and good. Usually bulk of the seminal fluid is from seminal vesicles and prostate not sperms. So, your vasectomy had not affected your seminal fluid volume much. As I told you 1-5 ml of ejaculate is normal.                    So stop thinking of volume unless you have problem in erection or orgasm.

If you are suffering from bed wetting please visit a neurologist as early as possible.                  If you are having wet dreams/ejaculation while sleeping then it is entirely normal at this age.

There is also the possibility of shaving itself causing such bumps if you are new to shaving and do not do shaving regularly. Ingrown hair follicles can also cause a similar pattern of bumps and irritation. Itching after shaving is common if you do not apply moisturisers in the region. This is because the small hairs irritate the skin.

The other possibility is a mild infection of the foreskin (if uncircumcised) or the glans. This might require a short course of antibiotics.

Fungal infections affect moist areas where the skin remains moist and allows the fungus to grow. It is possible that the fungal infection in your penis shaft is treated but some of the fungi have now started growing in the scrotum. This causes itching and discoloration. Please trim your pubic hairs short and dry your genital area completely after bath. Wear cotton inner clothes and wash your genital region with warm water twice daily. Apply antifungal ointment to the area of itching and skin discoloration twice daily. You can use the same ointment which you have taken earlier. Avoid scratching the area as this will spread the infection. The itching should stop 3 days after starting application of anti fungal ointment and treating the condition might take a month if treatment is taken regularly.

Whether STD or a non STD, it requires treatment at the earliest.

Is that normal?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Testis are originally intra abdominal organs and descend to the scrotum after birth. When you tighten the abdominal; muscles or stroke the thigh region, the testis can get pulled up. This is due to a reflex mechanism involving the nerves of the autonomic system and called cremasteric reflex. By tightening the lower abdomen there is contraction of the cremasteric muscle which then causes pulling up of the testis on one side. Similarly when the inner thigh is stroked, sensory fibers of the femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve and the ilioinguinal nerve are stimulated. These synapse in the spinal cord and activate the motor fibers of the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve which causes the cremaster muscle to contract and elevate the testis."},{"Patient":"Hi, I sustained a small cut on the shaft of my penis a month or two ago.

A scar in the area due to an injury can cause a scar which will show delayed healing. Such a scar might remain for a long time and this is not a serious concern. The bacterial infection might have healed by now and since you have applied ointments as suggested by dermatologist, please continue it for some more time.

It is important to know your age and any symptoms related to the urinary system. Since your doctor had said that there is no problem, I think you should not worry much about the cyst. You might take antibiotics to treat any infection that is causing the bleeding."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir, My penis size is 5.2 inches in full erection i want to increase atleast 2 inches.

Once it has healed, you can try using a lubricant during sex to prevent the problem from happening again.It is not a serious issue and might take 2 weeks to heal. Right now you are required to keep your genital clean and dry. Please wash with warm water twice a day to avoid any infection. You may apply neosporin ointment over the torn frenulum.Since the bleeding seems to have stopped, you do not need surgical suturing. It may happen that a scar might form in the area, if this happens then there is shortening of frenulum and might be released by minor surgery .

This is fairly normal and there is no need to be tensed about it. It can commonly happen if your masturbation frequency has decreased recently. If you used to masturbate about 4 times a week then your body was used seprms accordingly and now that you masturbate less frequently the body is still producing sperms at the rate it was used to. And therefore when its not getting an outlet via masturbation it is coming out with urine  and during stools passage as these are times that the sphincter gets relaxed. So dont worry. Your body will get used to less masturbation and the sperm discharge will decrease. You should keep the masturbation to once a week and it will regularize the body to that level.

The usual drug is cipro but since you stopped it prematurely due to side effects you need to seek you doctor to start an antibiotic that will treat the infection.

In Japan about half of genital herpes is type 1 not type 2. Or it could be something else. As mentioned it is difficult to say. without an exam, I can only give general information. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I feel good for some time ..after that I fell guilty and I am also worried about my health...also about my future that wheather it will affect my sex life with my wife...or anything like my sperm count will decrease soo much that I will not be able to have child..Please help me out.. Thanks a lot in advance.","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM with  your health care concerns.You are concerned about masturbation causing a decrease in you ability to conceive a child. With excessive masturbation usually several times a day the sperm count will decrease and can cause fertility issues. But only intermittent masturbation should cause only a minimal drop in sperm counts. Masturbation does not cause any other health concerns and should not worry you. I hope this answers your question.

Have also had pain during ejaculation and have also had difficulty maintaining an erection.  I have been on an antibiotic(Bactrim) for around 21 days and symptoms did get somewhat better but after about a week being off the antiobiotic the symptoms came back.","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM with your health care questions.You are concerned about having painful urination and pain on ejaculation. Your symptoms sound like you have prostatitis and your doctor has been treating you as such with a 21 day course of Bactrim. Unfortunately prostate infections are sometimes very difficult to cure and may require an additional 4-6 weeks of a more powerful antibiotic. In my practice I will use cipro or Levaquin for 4-6 weeks to treat difficult cases of prostatitis.  In summary you may have chronic prostatitis and need additional antibiotics for 4-6 weeks. Please contact you medical provider to proceed with treatmentI hope this answers your question. Please contact HCM again with any of your health care concerns"},{"Patient":"So I am an 18 year old male, and I masturbate (surprise surprise) anyways, Today when I was finished i noticed that on the shaft of my penis a little lower than half way (so towards the scrotum) there was a red bump. I don't know if it is from friction or maybe a pimple or what. It is red, it doesn't hurt unless i pinch like popping a pimple but even then it doesn't really even hurt much  or at all. It is on the right side of my penis. I masturbate with my right hand my hand makes contact with where the bump is. The part of the hand it touches is the palm right where the thumb starts to branch off the hand. There is only one bump and I have felt it and there is nothing hard underneath it, and there does not appear to be any puss on top. However I am scared because, 3 days ago my girlfriend of 3 months came over and we were naked and hugging each other and getting physical and are genitals touched but there was nothing more no insertion of any kind, and I just want to make its not an STD and just something from friction. It is on the top of the penis so her genitalia never, or should not have even touched there. Let me know if you need any more information.","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM with your health care concerns.you ae experiencing a lump on your penis at the base that is not very painful and does not appear to be infected. From your description this is probably a sebaceous cyst which are very common on the penis shaft and scrotum. This is basically an oil gland that is under the skin and can be irritated from rubbing or squeezing. I recommend that you lay off the masturbation for awhile and this area should reduce in size. It may become irritated again with masturbation.You also have no need to concern over an STD because you did not engage in sexual intercourse.I hope this answers your question.

These lumps are most likely small sebaceous cysts and are very common and completely benign. You have nothing to be concerned about here. These lumps are small oil glands under the skin that create small lumps or cysts. These never are an indication of any other diseases or do they change into anything worrisome. I can reassure you that you are healthy and normal.The itching maybe minor yeast infections which can occur and is called tinea cruris or jock itch.

I have an appointment next week with my urologist. In the meantime should I apply ice or refrain from anything. There is some mild discomfort but nothing much other than the bend while erect","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM with your health care concernsI am sorry to hear that you have had a change in the shape or curvature of your penis. This is a result of trauma and damage to the blood vessels in the penis. This is called Peyronie's disease and is caused by a plaque or damage to the vessels inside the penis that helps with erections. There is nothing you can do to fix or repair or lessen the effects of that trauma. The damage may get better with time and can improve over a 1 year. If there is no improvement then the urologist can do injections to help reduce the plaque and improve the circulation to improve erections. There can be pain with erections from the scarring.

This is not a real problem and more a normal thing to happen.

Doing is 3 to 4 times a week is closest to normal. Since you are doing everyday and more than once then you have to control the urges.

It might be that you have done rough sex with your wife as it is the first time. There can be injury to the soft tissues of penis and urethra. This can cause small lacerations in the wall of urethra. When more force is exerted due to continued sex, this will cause burning and pain during passing urine as the soft tissues are engorged with blood and blood vessels are dilated and the lining or urethra might have suffered small amount of damage. Please avoid sex for 3 to 4 days and use lubrication while doing it gently. Apply enough lubrication jelly on your penis before penetration. Have a relaxed sex session with long foreplay and create a good emotional bond with your wife.

Right now you are required to keep your genital clean and dry. Please wash with warm water twice a day to avoid any infection. You may apply neosporin ointment over the torn frenulum. Please take oral pain killers for 5 days.Since the bleeding seems to have stopped, you do not need surgical suturing. It may happen that a scar might form in the area, if this happens then there is shortening of frenulum and might be released by minor surgery . This cannot be known now and will be obvious only after one month.Please wear loose inner clothes and maintain genital hygiene. Avoid masturbation or sex for two weeks."},{"Patient":"i do hand job daily what are the side effects of this 2.i will do not remember for a long time and i remember for a short time things are slip from my mind 3.it effect my brain or not? 4.i found diffculty in running i loose my stamina 4.pimples occured on my face.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Masturbation is a healthy sexual activity and completely safe but should be done within limits. Doing it 3 to 4 times or every alternate day is recommended. Doing it more than once daily is abnormal.1. Side effects happen when a person does masturbation frequently and this can lead to disturbances in normal work and study. There can be neglect to self and relationships and this can cause depression.2. Memory is a cognitive function and masturbation does not have direct effects on it. If you always have sex and masturbation thoughts in your mind then your memory can get affected due to addiction to sexual thoughts.3. Masturbation does not affect brain but continuously having masturbation or sex related incidents in mind can affect your thought process leading to depression, anxiety and inability to solve complex functions.4.

It is possible that your penile muscles are still in erect stage and therefore the penis is deviated at an angle to one side. This is perfectly normal and not a concern. With the erect penis, the urethra is also deviated to the same side as it is located in the centre of penile shaft.

It is the same process as sex, only difference is that during sex what happens in vagina, occurs in hand or against any surface during masturbation.

Read some materials you are interested in, other than porn2. Spend more time with family and friends3. Do some activities you like.4. Engage in exercises.5.

Available treatment is varicocelectomy. It is an outpatient surgical treatment and is usually indicated in symptomatic patients and patients having abnormal semen analysis.Hope this helps you.Thanking you."},{"Patient":"I have a tingling feeling in the penis area towards the tip.

Masturbation is common practice in male and has not been found to be the cause for any of the problem you describe. Secondly for early ejaculation use start-stop technique , squeeze technique, or medicines like SSRI also helps.About size of penis and testes , i would like to say there is a variation in size for different person. When you consider it smaller then normal , it should be smaller then 85% of males and this is difficult to define. Do not feel guilty about anything and do not hesitate to consult a doctor.

Its most noticeable when I run or jump. Since I am an active runner, this is disconcerting to me. It feels light something is squeezing my right testicle. Is this something that will clear up in a few days? Can I wait to see if it will get better?","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCMYou are concerned about having right testicular pain after exercise. This pain could have many causes. The most common would be just strain of the groin muscles. During your exercises make sure you wear a jock strap and tight fitting underwear to support your testicles.Another possibility is an inguinal hernia. These are congenital and will manifest themselves with testicular pain and a lump in the groin. Your doctor should do a hernia check.Also you could have epididymitis an infection of the sperm tubules behind the testicles. Your doctor again should check and if needed start you on antibiotics.I recommend if after wearing better supportive underwear or jock strap that if you are still having pain that you seek medical attention.Hope this answers your question.

Recently I noticed a large pea sized bump on my penis and am worried if it is herpes or not. I have had the same girlfriend for the better part of two years and haven't had sex with anybody and she hasn't either. I went to the doctor and he said he wasn't sure what it was and could be an std but I'm confused how I would have contracted that. I did some research online and think it is a sebaceous cyst, but I'm still concerned it might be something else. It grew to the size of a pea and didn't really hurt or itch but started to be pretty sensitive when it got larger. It ruptured or popped last night by itself when I looked at it before bed and it was just a little blood.  I am going in to get it checked out again in a couple of days but am worried it could be something.  Any advice would be great thanks!!","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCMFrom your description I do agree with you that this maybe a sebaceous cyst. These are glands that are blocked and build up material under the skin. This are completely benign and do not have any long term effects. Since the cyst has already ruptured I recommend that you keep the area clean with soap and water. You may also try small amount of neosporin or other topical antibiotic ointment. This will heal within the next 1-2 weeks. It may reappear at sometime if the blocked gland becomes blocked again.Hope this answers your question.

I do have some back pain but nothing so bad I need Advil or painful running. I do take vitamins and an OTC acid reducer. Is it possible my LBP is causing the problem?","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM. I am sorry to hear that you are having erectile dysfunction. From the description of your symptoms it does not sound like your back pain is the cause of your pain. It is possible that you may have low testosterone problems. Sometimes in men that are very healthy and thin that their hormone levels of testosterone are low and need replacement. I recommend that you go to your doctor and have them check you testosterone levels.Another cause is just getting older and having erectile problems. This is common and not usually associated with any disease. Though stress can play a part in ED. I recommend meditation and relaxation exercises. When engaging in sex that you both take your time and don't rush. Also if you drink alcohol or take any drugs then you need to stop.If these measures don't help I would recommend the use of Viagra or Cialis.

Healing usually occurs within two weeks. But if there is no evidence of healing, then you need to consult your Doctor.Also make sure that during intercourse in near future, you are using lubricant & being gentle, then injury can be avoided. I would suggest you to take some antibiotics like Augmentin twice daily and apply topical antibiotic ointment locally. Avoid any sexual encounter till it heals completely which may take 1-2 weeks.

Pull the foreskin back gently then gently clean the glans using just water, or water and a bland soap.Apply some liquid parafine (vaseline) in the foreskin to prevent cracks.If the inflammation doesn't improve with antibiotic cream and steroid cream, then it might be an fungal infection and you need to use an anti-fungal cream (Clotrimazole twice a day).Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hi, I think i am suffering from pre-mature ejactulation.

The foreskin of penis slides forwards in the flaccid state and retracts back when you have an erection. This is because the erections are harder as the penis is more muscular due to testosterone effects. If it is causing any infection or swelling then you must consult the urologist.There will be no sexual problems if the foreskin is pulled back during erection and covers the head of the penis when flaccid.

If the bleeding has stopped then there is no need to worry. If there is continuous bleeding only then you should go to ER.

This is a time when your body is transforming to that of an adult. Your testes are increasing in size and have started producing sperms as in every adult male. The sperms are manufactured in the testes as a result of hormonal developments. Each day a small amount of semen is made. When enough semen is there in the testes, it overflows in the form of nightfall. This is a normal process and not some thing to worry about.You can read about this under adult male sexual development online and also ask your biology teacher.The way to avoid nightfall is to masturbate once in 2 - 3 weeks. This will not allow the semen to overflow. Please note that masturbation done occasionally is normal and not a bad habit."},{"Patient":"Recent blood work returned t levels of 320 and free of 4.04.

You need not have that complex that you have a very small penis. The average erect penile length is about 12.8 to 15 cms when completely erect. Also as you are 250 lbs, you find your penis to be small when is flaccid position.

I left masturbation and bodybuilding. (after 2 months) now my testacies become too soft. what should I do?","Doctor":"There are no much studies which prove the relation between masturbation and shrinkage of testicles. The issue is linked with your body building. There can be a few reasons behind this. When you exercise, your circulatory system makes adaptations that result in the shunting of oxygenated blood pumped from the heart toward the working muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. In fact, while 20 percent of cardiac output passes through the muscles at rest, 80 percent is fed through the muscles during all-out exercise. Since there is only so much blood to go around, this shunting occurs at the expense of tissues not in immediately in need of heavy oxygenation, including the genitals. As a result of diminished blood flow, the penis and testicles appear to shrink during and after heavy exercise.Also if you had used injected testosterone for your body building, then definitely, that is the reason. You need not do anything right now, as your testicles have regained its size, there is nothing to worry. Continue with regular exercise, however, strenuous work out should be avoided."},{"Patient":"hey doc i have man boobs.............it all started after my appendix surgery so after my surgery suddenly men boobs started to appear i consulted with a doctor who recommended me for some tests i did my blood tests as he recommended at that time my testosterone was low then now i again conducted my tests and every thing was fine so what should i do plz tell me have tried every thing tablets,fat burning cream,exersize in gym so what should i do","Doctor":"If it is too embarrassing for you, it is advisable that you may opt for a surgical correction.

By practicing yoga, you can delay your time of ejaculation. There are other simpler techniques also like:1. usage of condoms (Also there are condoms which contains benzocaine, which will delay your ejaculation and you can last long in bed, but regular use is not advisable)2. Giving pressure at the junction between your scrotum and anus with finger (even your partner can do this for you)3. Reduce anxiety and fears4.

To confirm an infection requires consultation with a surgeon. If a single diagnosis cannot be found after clinical examination then an ultrasound scan of scrotum has to be done. This will show and features of infection, abnormal blood flow or collection of fluids as found in hydrocele. If it happened few days back then it is most likely and infection.

There are 4 stages of penis arousal.Stage 1 excitementStage 2 plateauStage 3 orgasm and ejaculationStage 4 refractory periodWith increasing age, the duration of excitement stage increases and that is the reason you take longer time to have orgasm when compared to earlier times.

If the hydrocele is uncomplicated, the doctor makes an incision directly into the scrotum. After the canal between the abdominal cavity and the scrotum is repaired, the hydrocele sac is removed, fluid is removed from the scrotum, and the incision is closed with sutures.10 days is a very short time for the surgical wound to heal completely. The hydrocele sac has been removed surgically and now the fluid is accumulating in the scrotum. This will be present for some time until it gets absorbed in to the body.

It is a safe sexual practice among most people at your age as a way of sexual exploration. If you do more than 2 -3 times in a week and more than once daily then you must control yourself. The side effects of excessive masturbation includes not achieving a strong erection and decreased semen volume. Masturbation also can cause you problems in daily life including work and studies with loss of concentration and significant negative emotions which can predispose you to sexual addictive behaviour.At first please keep away from any kind of pornography material that you have and avoid staying alone in your room or at home. Whenever thoughts of masturbation come, you must go out to the exteriors and have walks or meet friends. To stop such thoughts at night, you can start listening to good music and start doing some work or rad books.In the beginning you keep a target of not masturbating for at least 10 days and follow it even if you get strong urges to do it. After this is achieved, start increasing your target and soon try not masturbating for a month.Please do not touch your genitals except when you are urinating or passing motions. Unnecessary stimulation of genitals also causes thoughts of masturbation."},{"Patient":"Diogonosed with BPH. Prostrate size 47 Gm.

The penis head and fore skin is a very sensitive structure. After putting the stitches, it has developed into scar tissue. This scar tissue is preventing the foreskin to roll down. The pain and discomfort is do to the scar tissue formation. For a small scar tissue, you can try manipulating it by using a lot of lubrication jelly during sex and masturbation and slowly trying to roll down the foreskin. If this does not happen then please do not do it forcibly.Using too much force can cause further injury to the foreskin. If it does not roll down with lubricants then please consult the urologist for scar release surgery. This is a minor surgery and works for most patients. If scar tissue is difficult to repair then circumcision can be done depending on the findings after clinical examination."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I am planning for a baby from last 4-5 months but not getting success.

Best is to consult a surgeon who can examine you and confirm the diagnosis. Once confirmed, a carefully planned surgery must be done to remove the cysts and then probably reconstruct the scrotum using skin flap surgery.

As you have not mentioned what is 10 - 12 percent, I guess you are talking about sperm motility. It is assumed that such sperm motility may not be always favorable but if this has happened on a single occasion then you can get repeat testing done and then discuss your report findings. A low erection can be due to psychological cause if it has happened suddenly or due to any medication you might be taking.

It is possible that you are having a urinary or urethral infection causing the symptoms and it is not sperm leaking but pus formation. I strongly suggest that you consult the urologist and get clinically examined for your problems. The loss of proper erection can also be due to the same problem if it is of recent onset and both the symptoms have developed together. If it is not an infection, then it is most likely due to stress related anxiety and the urologist will confirm it and suggest appropriate treatment. Both conditions are completely treatable and please do not worry."},{"Patient":"i had pus generating from my foreskin after sexual intercourse with my girlfriend. Urinating seems fine, no pain etc. The pain developed during sexual intercourse. The pus started coming out on the next day. Is it due to infection? As of now the foreskin is reddish.","Doctor":"Hi,You might have developed an infection after sexual intercourse. The foreskin is very thin and sensitive. During sex there might have been friction and rough sex leading to small cuts and abraisions in the foreskin. Following this if you have not washed the area and taken care of hygiene then there is every possibility of development of an infection with pus formation. As pus is there, the infection might be severe and you must consult your doctor and take oral antibiotics. Please keep your genital clean and use condoms with lot of lubrication the next time you are having sex with your girlfriend. Also get her tested if she has any genital infections."},{"Patient":"My husband is 36 years old.he smokes 4, 5 times a day.his sperm count is 100 percent but his sperm motility rate is 50 percent only.is this motility rate okay?we have not been able to conceive for the last one year.my all reports are fine.Mona Sharma age-32 years","Doctor":"Hi,Normal sperm motility is considered to be greater than 50 percent. When the motility falls between 25-50 percent on a single ejaculate, this may not reflect a real problem. When the motility consistently falls below 25 percent, the chances of a problem are much higher. When the motility consistently falls below five to 10 percent, the chances that fertility is normal is highly unlikely. However you should not worry as your husband has sperm motility of 50 percent which can be taken as normal."},{"Patient":"Respected Doctor, First of all THANK YOU for giving Sex Education.

Due to the elasticity of the scrotum, time and gravity cause it to elongate,giving a feeling that the left testicle moving freely within the scrotal sac.2.Numbness  in the area between your left leg and crotch is due to section of the left ilioinguinal nerve while repairing hernia.Regards Dr. T.K.

At 49 having a penis 4.5 inches when soft and 5.9  inches when hard is above average. The penis, like most organs is made of muscles and soft tissues. In males, a good erection can be achieved till about 65 - 70 years age. If you are getting good erections then there is no reason to worry. At 18 you were just entering adulthood and at that time, due to strong influence of testosterone and nutrition, the muscles are much more active than at 49 years. Also you might have been lean at that time and presently you weigh around 220 lbs which is slightly overweight for your age. It is also possible that due to being over weight there is apparent decrease in measurement of penis size because of deposition of fat in waist and pubic regions. There is no need to worry."},{"Patient":"i am a 18 year old boy nd i m very about my sex organ and sex ...my penis has not growth with my age ...my penis is too small and thin ...and sperm also flows with urine...and my sex time is too shart mens  if i ever think about sex my sperm comes out and my testes have also not remain tight...SO,please help me ...i will be very greatful to you..thanking you","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Apprehension about the normal size of penis is a major concern for men. At 18 years age, you are too young to judge the size of  your penis. It is made up of muscles and the growth at puberty and adolescent is under the influence of testosterone. A research study was done in healthy Indian males on penis size during flaccid and erect and the width of the penis. Mean flaccid length was found to be 8.21 cm, mean stretched length 10.88 cm and circumference 9.14 cm. Mean erected length was found to be 13.01 cm and erected circumference was 11.46 cm. If your penis measurements are at least as mentioned above then there is no need to worry.Semen flowing with urine is a misconception in most men at your age. If you feel it is present then it needs to be evaluated after clinical examination with the urologist. Any urine infection must also be ruled out."},{"Patient":"Male married having one kid.pressure sugaar and cholestrol(TGL-387) normal weight 57kg.while doning sex lot of lubricating fluid secreting.In one minute 1 drop.It is secreting from the feel of sex.Scanning result is normal.so i have to take too much care on to my erection otherwise I will loose. please suggest","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.You might be having sexual performance anxiety leading to pre mature ejaculation. This is because your penis scan is normal and there is no organic or physical cause for your problem. Constant worry over your appearance or ability in bed can make sex stressful leading to pre mature ejaculation. It is all in the mind and you need to relax your mind and be more emotionally close to your partner.There are certain brain chemicals which regulate ejaculation in males. In fact, deficient amounts of GABA and serotonin are responsible for norandrenergic sympathetic nerve function overpowering the parasympathetic nerve control of an ejaculation. The end result can cause premature ejaculations for men, producing embarrassing, often debilitating side effects such as creating more fear and nervousness toward intimacy.To overcome premature ejaculation please have sex with a free mind probably at the end of the day or early in the morning. Also spend a good amount of time having foreplay with your partner. You may also practice the start stop technique where when you feel that your penis is becoming erect then take rest and then again try to get arousal after some time. The subsequent erection will be stronger and help you delay ejaculation. You can also practice yoga to get stress free."},{"Patient":"Sir,I am 18yr old maleI am suffering from erection problem from last 2months Before that i was on pimples treatment Having accutane (isotretnoin) and azythromycin Nw i am facing erection problem Morning erection is slightly weak..I think i had ruin ma life Wanna commit suicide ....Plzzz help me out M in situation like depression ...","Doctor":"Hello,Please dont panic.

Once it has healed, you can try using a lubricant during sex to prevent the problem from happening again.It is not a serious issue and might take 2 weeks to heal. Right now you are required to keep your genital clean and dry. Please wash with warm water twice a day to avoid any infection. You may apply neosporin ointment over the torn frenulum as you are doing. Please take oral pain killers like Tylenol for pain control.Since the bleeding seems to have stopped, you do not need surgical suturing. It may happen that a scar might form in the area, if this happens then there is shortening of frenulum and might be released by minor surgery . This cannot be known now and will be obvious only after one month.Please wear loose inner clothes and maintain genital hygiene. Avoid masturbation or sex for two weeks.

If I totally give up although I have done that for nearly 8 years ,is it still possible to give birth to a baby if I marry soon like within 6 months or after a year?

A history of burning during urination is also important. In most patients circumcision involves removal of the foreskin. In some patients, a catheter might be used for passing urine following surgery. This can cause infection or trauma to the penile urethra and lead to minimal bleeding. This needs to be discussed in detail if you were put on a urinary catheter immediately after surgery.

I sometimes noticed a slight urinating sensation when aroused; would that be a small amount of the pre-ejaculate? I am not sexually active, but my body appears to be sexually healthy: large amounts of ejaculate periodically released during the night and erection when aroused or during hormonal spikes. Any comments would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.You are absolutely normal. As you are not sexually active, the semen builds up in the testes and is released in sleep as wet dreams. The tingling sensation is also normal. The increase size of penis should not be a concern if there is no abnormal swelling, pain or itching. The noticeable increase in penis by 0.5\\" to 0.75\\" is most likely a difference in observation taken at two different times. It is possible that the longer length was measured when you were totally aroused and the penis fully erect. Please do not worry for it."},{"Patient":"I snapped my frenulum whilst having sex with my girlfriend on Halloween of all nights. There was a lot of blood everywhere. Two days later My frenulum is clearly not attached anymore but I feel fine and have had sex pain free and with no bleeding.

Once it has healed, you can try using a lubricant during sex to prevent the problem from happening again.It is not a serious issue and might take 2 weeks to heal. Right now you are required to keep your genital clean and dry. Please wash with warm water twice a day to avoid any infection. You may apply neosporin ointment over the torn frenulum.Since the bleeding seems to have stopped, you do not need to consult a doctor. It may happen that a scar might form in the area, if this happens then there is shortening of frenulum and might be released by minor surgery . This cannot be known now and will be obvious only after one month."},{"Patient":"hi sometimes i feel pain in my testicles which is OK after masturbation. its like if i am regularly masturbating then its ok  and if do not do for 4-5 days then i feel pain in my lower stomach and testicles and if i ejaculate then it s ok.

When i get erect the more excited and blood engeorged i get my left testicle pulls back inside of me and to the left of my penis shaft. this is very painful and i dont remember it being so painful or if it even pulled inside of me when i was younger and first became sexually active. what should i do?","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCMYou are concerned about having an undescended testis. From your description is sounds like the undescended testis is not fully extended and giving you discomfort.

He is 45lbs overweight and hasn't been very active for the last three years. Four weeks ago he started an exercise program and diet change, hence the visit to the doctor for a physical. The doctor is now ordering another blood test and a ultra sound. What does that number mean?","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM with your health concernsYou are concerned about your son having an elevated ALT. The ALT is a liver enzyme that occurs when there is damage to the liver. In this case the elevation is very small and seen frequently with people who are overweight. This elevation is caused by fat being deposited into liver cells and causing the ALT to be squeezed out. If your son continues to lose weight the ALT will improve as well as his overall health.I recommend he start a low fat diet, exercise regularly and follow up with his doctor in 3-6 months.Hope this answered your question.

From your description it sounds like you husband has balantitis. This is a fungal infection of the foreskin and penis. This is frequent in men who are uncircumcised and are at greater risk with diabetes. The foreskin is a warm and moist place that allows for fungal infections. To help treat this I recommend patients start Lamisil cream. This will help reduce the swelling and splitting of the skin. If that does not help then he may need an oral antifungal like diflucan. His other problem could be prostatitis. This again is a common condition in men and will need 2-4 weeks of oral antibiotics to help treat the infection.

To help with medical aspect of erectile dysfunction I usually recommend seeing his doctor and getting a prescription to Viagra or similar medication.

I really can't afford the treatment, so was researching ways to remove them myself. I came across a form of a guy who said to use a soldering iron and just touch the tip of the papule and they would disappear permanently. The guy who posted it said he did it himself and it worked, i first thought the guy was a complete RETARD!! but then i starting thinking about it and realized that all the CO2 laser does is burn off the legions with high concentrated heat, and don't see the fundamental problem with using a soldering iron on the papules. I do realize there are obvious dangers such as over burning, slipping while holding the iron, and scarring, but i want to get other peoples (and hopefully some doctors) responses on my idea to burn off these papules with a soldering iron. (FYI: i'm planning on buying \\"Dr. Numb\\" numbing medicine and applying it prior to burning them off which is exactly what dermatologists do when they burn off the paplules with the CO2 laser except with a more powerful numbing agent).","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM with your medical question.

There is also a medication called condylox which is basically the same medication as podophyllin but you can use it in your own home. Both of these measures help to remove the wart.

Because of your Hashimoto's thyroiditis you may have infertility problems and erectile dysfunction. I recommend you see your endocrinologist to control our thyroiditis.

Hepatitis A is a viral illness that affects the liver and can cause yellowing of the skin. This yellow color is caused by an increase in bilirubin in the blood stream and tissues. This bilirubin can also get in your semen. So your first few ejaculations maybe yellow in color. Over a few more ejaculations the normal color will reappear. The actual sperm are unaffected. I can reassure you that your semen is normal and you have nothing to worry about. Hope this answers your medical question.

He had molluscum and I thought it was gone. Could it be molluscum?","Doctor":"Hi, It can be a molluscum if you had unprotected sex, it can also be due to condom and boxers if you have red dots along with the bumps.

Ive never hurd of someone his age with prostate problems....","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM. You are concerned about your boyfriend having had gonorrhea when he was 16 could still give you gonorrhea after all these years. The short answer is not likely. Gonorrhea would have been an active infection for nearly a decade and that is not possible. What is possible even for a young adult prostatitis can occur. I recommend that he complete his antibiotics and follows up with his doctor o be sure it has resolved. There is no chance for you to get the same infection from prostatitis.

You are mostly concerned about the force of the ejaculate material at time of ejaculation. As men get older the force of the ejaculate will decrease and will not affect fertility.

I am sorry to hear that you are having problems with erectile dysfunction. The fact that you can maintain erection for orgasm with oral sex demonstrates that you have no physical problem with erections. But when you put a condom on your erection dissolves. This is usually related more to anxiety. To help improve your confidence I recommend that you seek your doctor for a supply of Viagra. With Viagra it will allow you to maintain an erection.

Masturbation did not cause your erections to get less nor cause your penis to shrink. More than likely your anxiety and stress related to your up coming marriage is affecting your sexual performance.

The testosterone levels are highly dependent on the time of day. After waking is the time that is the best time to obtain a blood sample.If the level is still normal then I might suggest using a medication like Viagra or Levitra to help with sexual performance.If these measures are not satisfactory then I recommend you seek medical attention by a urologist or a specialist in male endocrinology.Hope I answered your question.

A hernia in this area does require repair. I would recommend you seek a general surgeon for consultation and surgery.If this is an umbilical hernia, one from the middle of your belly button then this is less of an issue. It does not usually require repair but if it does cause significant pain and discomfort then I do recommend consultation with a surgeon for repair. The repair is more difficult to preform if you are over weight.The time off from work with both procedures could take 4-6 weeks.Hope I answered your question.

The reason you are tired and feel weak is because of having sex. The physical nature of your wife has nothing to do with your own physical strength and well being.

I have gone through your query. Your problem is most likely psychological. If you get erections while sleeping then you are not having any organic problems. You should get rid off stress and anxiety as those can be a cause also. When you have enough foreplay with your partner  you will get a normal erection.If not getting in such situation then you can approach a psychiatrist for antidepressants or phosphpdiesterase inhibitors like sildenafil. You should have a proper exercise and nutritious food. Sea foods dairy products etc can be taken as aphrodisiac. Regarding size: only 2 and half inches in vagina is the sensitive part. So you don't need to have a long penis to satisfy your woman. You can shave your pubic hair which will give you confidence about your size. Hope this may help you.

During puberty and adolescence, there is sudden increase in hormones like testosterone and development of secondary sexual characters in boys. This causes increased deposition of pigment called melanin in the genital areas.However if there is itching that is along the inner thigh as described by you, then you might be having fungal infection. Please apply antifungal ointment like CANDID-B twice a day. Wash your genitals with warm water twice a day and keep it dry. Wear loose cotton inner wear and avoid itching."},{"Patient":"i masterbate daily 2 to 3 times i m getting weak i want sex but i dont have girl friend i never made any sex in life i m 23 male","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is said that masturbation is normal 2 to 3 times a week. At your age, even if you want to do daily, please do not do it more than once a day. You need to keep yourself interested in other areas like study and work. Eat healthy food and go for regular exercises. Do not allow sexual thoughts to come to your mind.

Thank you in advance for your answer.","Doctor":"Good Day and thank you for being with Healthcare Magic!Pain in the vas deferens could be bacause of infection medically called orchitis if the infection is in the testis and epididymitis if it is in the epididymis. This presents as pain and marked swelling in the affected area. Another differential diagnosis would be varicocoele. This is abnormal enlargement and diilation of the veins in the spermatic cord (the structure that connects the testis to the ejaculatory ducts located in the prostate). This presents as no swelling but enlargement of the spermatic cord especially during straining and valsalva maneuvers. This can be confirmed by doing a scrotal ultrasound with doppler studies.

As a young man, I used to masturbate a lot and it was after one such session that I started feeling disorders in my scrotum till it developed to these movements. When the movements are on I actually see the scrotum sack move as well and if I put my finger under the scrotum I actually feel the movements like one is hold some worms in his hand which are sort of “struggling to escape”, that kind of feeling.Over the years I have been consulting General Practitioners who would tell me that my condition was normal and there was really nothing to worry about. However some would prescribe me amitriptyline for a couple of months, but this never really helped by situation. Now over the years I have developed a very bad odour coming from my genitals which I suspect could be linked to this problem. I have often thought perhaps the scrotum skin is so won out (though it does not look so) that it now sticks.  Now I worry more about the odour than the movements as they are not painful as such. The odour makes it quite difficult for me to freely mix with people and this is worse in my professional circles. Just last year I went to consult a urological surgeon who advised me that I had varicoselectomy that is why I feel the wormlike movements. He said to correct that I needed to undergo a minor operation which I did, but to no avail. I have also consulted a dermatologist about, but so far the prescriptions I got from him have not really helped my situation either.

When i look it up they dont really give me much. I was wondering if you could help me? Destine","Doctor":"Hi, the function of the Testicles is to form sperms which are then transferred to the Urethra via the Vas Deferens. On their way, the secretions of Seminal vesicles are added to the Sperms and is then called Semen. this secretion provides nutrition to the Sperms. Semen then enters the Penile urethra or the urine tube in the penis and is secreted in spasms caused by the Cavernosa layers in the Penis.

Firstly you should reduce the masturbation to once or twice a week. Then you can let us know your sperm count so that we can suggest accordingly.

To check for retrograde obstruction I would suggest you do a urinalysis after ejaculation to see if there are sperms in the urine or not. You may have dry ejaculation from masturbating too much. I suggest you refrain from over masturbation and let your semen replenish itself. Eat plenty of fruits and drink adequate fluids for faster recovery.

I feel light pain in my groin, lower back, theighs etc. - I feel tired and feel lack of stamina.

If there are symptoms symptomatic treatment is recommended- scrotal support or analgesics according to the symptom.If required, an operation can clear a varicocele. Some methods that can be used are venous ligation or embolization with a success rate 90%-95%, laparoscopic surgery (expensive but better for bilateral procedures) or radiologic embolization via groin catheter (expensive, good for recurrent varicocele).However, remember that most men with a varicocele are not infertile.Take care,Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi sir...

Male sperm requires a certain gestation period to reach full maturity (72 hours I believe).  With a lower sperm count, and \\"pre-adult\\" sperm (say only a few hours old), I would assume that the chances for pregnancy are decreased.Would a person who \\"relives\\" themselves multiple times a day have a lower chance of inducing pregnancy compared to someone who only ejaculates during sex?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The sperm are manufactured regularly in the testes and ejected out of the system regularly through sex, masturbation or wet dreams. While sex and masturbation are active methods and wet dreams happen due to accumulation of semen. If a person masturbates many times a day then it causes the sperm volume to certainly decrease but even one drop of semen can cause pregnancy. There is nothing like pre adult sperm being ejected out in someone who masturbates. Having sex or doing masturbation once daily can be normal but a person masturbating many times a day is surely not normal behavior in males."},{"Patient":"hii dr. .i am 17yr oldi usually shake my penis daily.now i m felling that my penis is becoming soft and also i am not getting excited easily. is this create a problem for me in future sex satisfactions of my partne .pls answer me as fast as possible .               thanking you","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in/Masturbating daily might be too much at your age. You are still growing and your penis will also increase in length and girth until you complete growth. You should masturbate one in 2 - 3 days and not allow your mind to be preoccupied with sexual thoughts all the time. Also if you watch lots of pornography then please try to minimize it.

Most varicoceles develop over time. Fortunately, most varicoceles are easy to diagnose and many don't need treatment.

Nocturnal emissions are a release phenomenon and nothing to get embarassed about.Blood in urine at the end is called Terminal hematuria and may occur with a prostatic, bladder, or trigonal cause of hematuria.

During sex the blood flow in the penis is maximum and once there is ejaculation the blood flow decreases and the penis becomes soft. In normal males the erection comes down soon after ejaculation and only in few there is sustained erection even after ejaculation.

Avoid smoking & alcohol. You can also do oil massage of the penis...it increases blood flow & maintains the erection.Despite these measures, if you experience difficulty, it will be better to rule out other causes like high blood pressure, blood sugar and other local causes that impair blood flow to the genital organ.There is no need to worry.Wish you a Happy Married Life.

Single small cyst in prostate does not usually cause any harm. However, PSA of 7 ng/ml is high. Please get a repeat PSA done, since the last value was one year old. The free PSA of 15.6 seems to be wrong. It could have been 1.56 ng/ml (free PSA is a part of total PSA and it cannot be higher than total PSA). Please make sure that you do not ejaculate within 48 hours prior to PSA testing and get a urine microscopy test done to rule out urinary tract infection (since urinary tract infection can falsely increase PSA).If the repeat PSA is more than 2.5 to 4 ng/ml (and freePSA/total PSA ratio is I hope I have answered your query.

Never have had any allergies or any health issues ever. For the last several weeks I've noticed smaller red spots or blotches of sort directly above my penis in the pubic hair area and also on my inner thighs. I started shaving this area for the first time several months ago and the area was always irritated and red. I was having unprotected sex with my girlfriend of the time and never had any issues then. Now over four months later these spots show up. They do NOT hurt, itch or feel raised above the skin. They actually seem to get more red after long days at work where I move, stand and sweat. Now after I wash the area and I've been using hydro-cortisone cream they actually fade away drastically. They come back though and never go away completely. I've also not shaved the area anymore thinking it could be tied in with that. Again there is no pain, no itching or any other weird colors, odors, puss or anything being secreted. Does this sound like a skin irritation, heat rash or something horrible? Thanks for any insight, it's much appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for a detailed description. Its much helpful. It seems like it could have been triggered by the shaving but has an element of fungal infection called tinea cruris.

When I masturbate  my penis swells for few hours and becomes normal after some hours. As many time I masturbate in a week , penis swells. so this is what Phimosis? My penis swells only after ejaculation.","Doctor":"Hi, does the foreskin revert back after ejaculation or during the height of ejaculation? If yes then you probably do not have Phimosis. If the foreskin takes time to revert back ahead after ejaculation then it is likely to be phimosis and the swelling of glans is also likely to be due to the same. If yes, then you should get it evaluated by a Surgeon and it can be managed with a small operation. Full fledged circumcision might not be required as it is retractable in the flaccid state.

Actually in today’s world we really need some one to guide us to correct knowledge regarding sex & relationship as there are lot of contradictory & unauthentic information are available on net and it is very difficult for a common man/woman to find out what is correct or wrong? Dear Doctor I am 35 years old married man, I like “Going Commando” (i.e. without underwear) and feel comfortable. But my friends told me that it is not good for male genitals as my testicles may get injured or twisted due to lack of support and testicles always need some support. While surfing the net I found that some tribes in South America or Brazil are always full nude, and do all their daily routines like running, swimming, climbing trees & hunting without any support for their testicles. Even \\"vanuhatu tribes\\" were doing \\"bungee jumping\\" fully nude almost from a height of 80 feet (as shown in a YouTube video. Also I found on some websites for the “Nudists/Naturists” that the men are playing games like Basketball, Volleyball and even Football fully nude without any support for their testicles.Now the question arise that if support is necessary for the testicles then why these guys (as mentioned above) do not get their testicles hurt/injured or twisted? I asked my friends but they could not answer it. Now I hope to get some correct medical view from your side, please I am really confused!! Thanking you Mr. Irfan Ahmed (India)","Doctor":"Good Day and thank you for being with Healthcare Magic! Technically speaking not wearing any underwear is not harmful and definitely not cause twisting of the testis (testicular torsion).
