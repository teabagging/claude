Arrange Marbles on the Diagonal:   - Place each of the 2024 marbles on one of the two main diagonals of the (2024 times 2024) grid. For example, place a marble at each cell ((i, i)) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, 2024).2. Verify the Condition:   - Each marble is placed such that no two marbles are in neighboring cells. Neighboring cells share an edge, but in this arrangement, each marble is only diagonally adjacent to another marble, not sharing an edge.3. Check the Movement Condition:   - Moving any marble to a neighboring cell (either up, down, left, or right) will place it in a cell that is already occupied by another marble, violating the condition that no two marbles are in neighboring cells.Thus, the arrangement satisfies the conditions, and moving any marble will violate the conditions. Part (b)1. Claim: (k = 2023) is the Largest Value:   - We need to show that for (k = 2023), there exists an arrangement where moving any marble to a neighboring cell will still satisfy the conditions.2. Assume (k = 2024 - n) Marbles:   - Let (n geq 1). We need to show that there is always a way to move a marble if (k < 2024).3.

Without loss of generality, assume (p geq q).4. Claim 1: No Two Free Rows are Adjacent:   - If there were two adjacent free rows, there must be a marble adjacent to this block. Moving this marble into the block would create a valid arrangement, contradicting the assumption.5. Claim 2: The Leftmost Column is Not Free:   - If the leftmost column were free, moving a marble from the next column to the leftmost column would create a valid arrangement, contradicting the assumption.6. Marbles in Non-Free Columns:   - For each free column, the column immediately to the left contains a marble. If a marble is at ((x, y)), there must be another marble at ((x+2, y)) to prevent moving the marble to ((x+1, y)).7. Counting Marbles and Rows:   - There are (p) free columns, so there are at least (p) pairs of marbles with a distance vector ((2, 0)). These pairs use up (p) rows.   - The remaining (2024 - n - 2p) marbles can use at most (2024 - n - 2p) rows.   - Therefore, at most (p + (2024 - n - 2p) = 2024 - n - p) rows have marbles, implying at least (p + n) rows are free.8.

Using Euler's theorem, the number of edges can be converted into calculating the number of points.The number of points can be considered from two aspects: one is from the point of view, each point can be the vertex of 1, 2, or 4 small rectangles; the other is from the perspective of small rectangles, each small rectangle has four vertices. Therefore, by calculating the sum of all vertices of each small rectangle, an estimate of the maximum value can be obtained. On the other hand, from the perspective of each horizontal and vertical line segment dividing the square, the two endpoints of each horizontal and vertical line segment are points with a degree of 3. In summary, an estimate of the minimum number of points can be obtained.Solution: Construct a graph G with all nodes as vertices and basic line segments as edges. Let the number of vertices of graph G be v, and the number of edges be e. Consider the external region of rectangle R as one face (region). Then graph G has a total of f=2017 faces.By Euler's theorem, we have v+f-e=2.Thus, e=v+2015.Note that, the points with a degree of 2 in graph G are exactly 4, and the rest of the points have a degree of 3 or 4. A point with a degree of 2 is a vertex of one rectangle, a point with a degree of 3 is a vertex of two rectangles, and a point with a degree of 4 is a vertex of four rectangles.On one hand, the sum of all vertices of each small rectangle is 4 times 2016.On the other hand, the sum of all vertices of all small rectangles is not less than 2(v-4)+4=2 v-4.Then 2 v-4 leqslant 4 times 2016 Rightarrow v leqslant 4034.Therefore, from equation (1), we get e leqslant 6049.When the rectangle R is divided into 1 times 2016 small rectangles, the above equation holds with equality.Thus, the maximum value sought is e_{text {max }}=6049.Next, consider the minimum value of e.Suppose the rectangle R is divided using a horizontal lines and b vertical lines, where these horizontal and vertical lines do not include the boundaries.Since a horizontal lines and b vertical lines can divide into at most (a+1)(b+1) regions, we have(a+1)(b+1) geqslant 2016 text {. }Let the number of points with a degree of 3 be x, and the number of points with a degree of 4 be y.

Gymnasium, 9th grade)Remarks. 1. Most of the solvers wrote the expression x y^{4}+x^{4} y in the form -3left(x y-frac{1}{6}right)^{2}+frac{1}{12} using the condition x+y=1. In more than 100 solutions, after this, something appeared without any further explanation, stating that the sought maximum value is frac{1}{12}. This is only true if the first term of the sum, -3left(x y-frac{1}{6}right)^{2}, attains the value 0, i.e., there are x and y whose sum is 1 and whose product is frac{1}{6}. This can be seen from the solution, although these values were not calculated. Solving the systemleft.begin{array}{rl}x+y & =1 x y & =frac{1}{6}end{array}right}immediately yields the values of the variables for which A(x, y) is maximal: {x, y}= left{frac{3-sqrt{3}}{6}, frac{3+sqrt{3}}{6}right}2. According to the result of the problem, if x+y=1, then x y^{4}+x^{4} y leq frac{1}{6}. In this form, we can see an example of the rare phenomenon where in a symmetric inequality, the maximum is not attained when the variables are equal.II. solution. We solve the problem using the application of differential calculus. The originally two-variable function can be written as a one-variable polynomial by the substitution y=1-x:f(x)=x(1-x)^{4}+x^{4}(1-x)Let's write down the derivative of the function, and after performing the exponentiation, rearrange the polynomial:f^{prime}(x)=(1-x)^{4}-4 x(1-x)^{3}+4 x^{3}(1-x)-x^{4}=-12 x^{3}+18 x^{2}-8 x+1Since the original two-variable polynomial is symmetric, it follows that f(x)=f(1-x). For the derivative, this implies f^{prime}(x)= -f^{prime}(1-x), and thus f^{prime}left(frac{1}{2}right)=-f^{prime}left(frac{1}{2}right), which leads to f^{prime}left(frac{1}{2}right)=0. Based on this, the derivative can be factored as:f^{prime}(x)=left(x-frac{1}{2}right)left(-12 x^{2}+12 x-2right)The quadratic factor has two real roots, x_{1}=frac{3-sqrt{3}}{6} and x_{2}=frac{3+sqrt{3}}{6}. Note that since x_{1}+x_{2}=1, we have fleft(x_{1}right)=fleft(x_{2}right).Since the cubic f^{prime}(x) has three distinct real roots and its leading coefficient is negative, its graph can be sketched: (Figure 2). The sign of the derivative can be read from the graph, and thus it is also clear that f has two local maxima: at x_{1} and x_{2}. We have already seen that these maxima are equal, and since f is strictly increasing if xx_{2}, this common value, fleft(x_{1}right)=fleft(x_{2}right)=frac{1}{12}, is the absolute maximum of the function.## Figure 3Péter Szilágyi (Debrecen, Kossuth L. Gymnasium, 10th grade)Remark. The above examination also reveals that f has a local minimum at x=frac{1}{2}; its value is fleft(frac{1}{2}right)= frac{1}{16}. The graph of the function f is shown in Figure 3."},{"problem":"5.

How many five-digit natural numbers are there in which there is no zero and the sum of all digits is greater than their product?Solution. It is known that none of the digits of the desired number is zero. The product of the digits will be smaller if there is a one among them. We will prove that the desired numbers have at least three ones.First, we will prove that there are no desired numbers in which no digit is one.In the case that no digit of the number is one, the smallest product of the digits would be achieved for the number 22222, but then 32=2 cdot 2 cdot 2 cdot 2 cdot 2>2+2+2+2+2=10, so the product of the digits is greater than their sum.The sum of the digits of a five-digit number can be at most 9+9+9+9+9=45. If we increase any digit of the number 22222 by at least 1, the product of the digits will be at least 2 cdot 2 cdot 2 cdot 2 cdot 3=48, which is more than the maximum possible sum of the digits.Therefore, at least one digit of the desired five-digit number must be one.2 POINTSSecond, we will show that there are no desired numbers that have exactly one one. The smallest product in this case is achieved with four twos and one one. In this case, the product is 16, and the sum is 9, so this possibility is ruled out. By increasing any digit by 1, the sum increases by 1, but the product increases by more than 1, so there are no such possibilities.1 POINTThird, we will show that there are no desired numbers that have exactly two ones. The smallest product in this case is achieved with three twos and two ones. In this case, both the product and the sum are equal to 8, so this possibility is ruled out.

However, this counts the possibilities twice because the two twos are identical digits. Therefore, the number of possibilities must be divided by 2, i.e., we have frac{5 cdot 4}{2}=10 possibilities.

Define the Set and Function:   Let P be the set of all pairs {i, j} where i ne j in {0, ldots, 63}. The number of tuples T is given by:   [ T = sum_{E subset P} (-1)^{|E|} alpha(E), ]   where alpha(E) is the number of tuples (x_0, ldots, x_{63}) (not necessarily distinct) that satisfy x_i = x_j for all {i, j} in E and    [ x_0 + x_1 + 2x_2 + cdots + 63x_{63} equiv 0 pmod{2017}. ]2.

Understanding the Problem:   Hugo rolls 25 twenty-sided dice, and the sum of the numbers rolled is 70. We need to determine how many 2's Hugo rolled if the product of the numbers is maximized.2. Formulating the Problem:   Let ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{25} ) be the numbers rolled on the 25 dice. We know:   [   x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_{25} = 70   ]   We need to maximize the product:   [   P = x_1 cdot x_2 cdot cdots cdot x_{25}   ]3.

In classical probability theory, the probability (p) of an event is defined as the quotient of the number (g) of favorable cases for this event and the total number (m) of possible cases, i.e., (p=frac{g}{m}).2. Therefore, the probability of drawing a white ball (blindly) from an urn that contains a total of (u) balls, of which (w) are white, is set to (p=frac{w}{u}).3. If there are two urns, with the probability of drawing a white ball being (p_{1}) and (p_{2}) respectively, then the probability of the combined event \\"selecting one of the two urns and drawing a white ball from the selected urn\\" is (p=frac{1}{2} p_{1}+frac{1}{2} p_{2}).","solution":"}Let (w) and (s) be the numbers of white and black balls, respectively, placed in Urn 1.

We are looking for (w) and (s) such that (p(w, s)) is maximized.For (w = s), we have (p(w, s) = frac{1}{2}). Later, we will see that this is not the desired maximum value. For now, let (w neq s).Since it is not possible for both urns to have more black balls than white balls, we can assume without loss of generality that Urn 1 has more white balls than black balls, i.e., (s < w). This implies (p_{1}(w, s) > p_{1}(w-1, s-1)) and (p_{2}(w-1, s-1) > p_{2}(w, s)).Thus, the maximum of (p(w, s)) cannot be achieved for (0 < s < w).The maximum of (p(w, s)) is therefore achieved for (s = 0) (and (w > 0)).We have (p(w, 0) = frac{1}{2} left(1 + frac{50-w}{100-w}right) = 1 - frac{25}{100-w}).

Since K lies inside triangle A B C, angle A B C is greater than 60^{circ}, hence L and B lie on opposite sides of A C and L lies on the smaller arc A C.

Let the height B M of triangle A B C intersect line A K at point O (see the figure). Then angle C O M = angle A O M = 60^{circ}. Therefore, angle A O C = 120^{circ} and angle C O B = 120^{circ}. Consequently, triangles B O C and K O C are congruent by two sides and the angle opposite the larger side (the so-called fourth criterion of triangle congruence).

Note that if (x, y) is a solution to the system, then (x, -y) is also a solution to this system. Therefore, if for a parameter a the system has a unique solution, the value of y must be zero.

Find a six-digit number where the first digit is 6 times less than the sum of all digits to the right of it and the second digit is 6 times less than the sum of all digits to the right of it.[4 points] (A. V. Shapovalov)","solution":"Answer: 769999.First solution. The sum of the last five digits of the number, by condition, is divisible by 6 (the quotient is equal to the first digit). The sum of the last four digits of the number is also divisible by 6 (the quotient is equal to the second digit). Therefore, the second digit, as the difference of two numbers divisible by 6, is also divisible by 6. This means the second digit is 0 or 6. If it is 0, then the sum of the last four digits is also 0, and thus the first digit is 0, but a six-digit number cannot start with 0. Therefore, this option does not work, and the second digit is 6. Then the sum of the last four digits is 6 cdot 6 = 36, so all of them are 9. Finally, the sum of the last five digits is 42, and thus the first digit is 42 : 6 = 7. Therefore, the required number is 769999.Second solution. The sum of the last 4 digits is 6 times the second digit, so the sum of the last 5 digits is 7 times the second digit and 6 times the first digit. Therefore, 7 times the second digit equals 6 times the first digit, which means the first digit is 7, and the second digit is 6; then the sum of the last four is 36, and this is only possible if all 4 last digits are nines.Comment. The problem can be solved by trying all possible values (from 0 to 9) of the second digit of the number. For example, if this digit is 9, then the sum of the digits to the right of it is 6 times greater, i.e., 9 cdot 6 = 54, but then the sum of all digits to the right of the first is 9 + 54 = 63.

Let's write m=d a and n=d b. Thus, a and b are coprime natural numbers and v=d a b. If we substitute this into the equation, we get d a + 3 d b - 5 = 2 d a b - 11 d, so d must divide 5. First, let's assume d=1. Then we can rearrange the equation to a(2 b - 1) = 3 b + 6. From this, it follows that 2 b - 1 divides 3 b + 6, and thus also divides 2(3 b + 6) - 3(2 b - 1) = 15. Since 2 b - 1 is a natural number, we have four possibilities. If 2 b - 1 = 1, then b = 1 and a = 9. If 2 b - 1 = 3, then b = 2 and a = 4, which is a contradiction since a and b are not coprime.

On each diagonal of even length, no more than half of the cells can be occupied by pseudo-bishops, as it can be divided into pairs of cells that cannot be simultaneously occupied.On each diagonal of odd length 2n+1, no more than n+1 pseudo-bishops can be placed for the same reasons.There are a total of 9 odd diagonals, so the maximum possible number of pseudo-bishops is frac{81-9}{2}+9=45.An example can be constructed by placing pseudo-bishops in all cells of the rows with odd numbers.## 7th grade#"},{"problem":"A regular octahedron's one face is orthogonally projected onto the plane of the opposite face. What fraction of the opposite face's area is covered by the projection?将上面的文本翻译成英文，请保留源文本的换行和格式，直接输出翻译结果。","solution":"Consider the cube whose face centers form a regular octahedron. Let one of the octahedron's faces be the triangle ABC, and the opposite face be the regular triangle DEF. Then, the faces of the cube containing points A, B, C are K, and the faces containing points D, E, F meet at the opposite vertex L (Figure 1).When the cube, and thus the octahedron, is rotated 120^{circ} around the line KL, it maps onto itself. Therefore, the planes of ABC and DEF are perpendicular to the line KL. The triangles ABC and DEF are mirror images of each other with respect to the center O of the cube. The line KL also passes through O and the centers of the triangles ABC and DEF. If we project the triangle ABC and O perpendicularly—i.e., parallel to KL—onto the plane of DEF, then the image of O will be O', the center of the triangle DEF, and the images of A, B, and C will be the mirror images of D, E, and F with respect to O' (Figure 2).It is easy to see that the common part of the two triangles is a regular hexagon. The 12 small triangles visible in Figure 2 are clearly congruent, so the projection covers frac{6}{9}=frac{2}{3} of the area of the face.Based on the work of András Máthé (Budapest, ELTE Apáczai Cs.

Let x be the amount of water in the glass, and h be the numerical value of the center of gravity's height in cm.

We solve the problem using differential calculus. The first derivative of the function h=h(x) with respect to x is:h'=frac{2 x(2 x+20)-2left(x^{2}+96right)}{4(x+10)^{2}}=frac{(x-4)(x+24)}{2(x+10)^{2}}We can observe that the derivative function is negative for 0 leq x < 4 and positive for x > 4. The numerator is a parabola opening upwards with roots at -24 and 4, and the denominator is always positive for x geq 0.This means that the function h is strictly decreasing in the interval 0 leq x < 4 and strictly increasing in the interval 4 < x < infty. Therefore, the function h=h(x) takes its smallest value in the interval 0 leq x < infty at x=4. Thus, the center of gravity will be the lowest when the water level is 4 mathrm{~cm}.The minimum value of h(x) is also 4, meaning the center of gravity coincides with the water surface when it is at its lowest.Hajnal Péter (Szeged, Radnóti M. Gymn., IV. grade)II. solution. The minimum point of the function h=h(x) can be determined in several ways without using differential calculus: for example, by using the inequality between the arithmetic and geometric means, or by reasoning with the discriminant of a quadratic equation. However, in the context of this problem, we can also provide a solution that closely relates to the physical content of the problem.From the result of the first solution, it is noteworthy that the center of gravity coincides with the water surface when it is at its lowest. This is not a coincidence. As long as we fill the water below the center of gravity, the height of the center of gravity continuously decreases. However, once the center of gravity meets the water surface, any additional amount of water will raise the center of gravity, but it will remain below the water surface. Based on this, the desired water height can be calculated from the equationfrac{x^{2}+96}{2(x+10)}=xunder the condition x geq 0.Tóth Viktor (Budapest, Fazekas M. Gymn., II. grade)Note. We neglected the thickness of the glass walls at the bottom.

This holds true.      - Inductive step: Suppose the first element in the (k)-th row is (binom{k}{2} + 1). We need to show that the first element in the ((k+1))-th row is (binom{k+1}{2} + 1).     The first element in the ((k+1))-th row is the element immediately following the last element in the (k)-th row. The last element in the (k)-th row is (binom{k}{2} + k).

We will prove that when N=2^{k}-1, the grasshopper can always be caught in a trap. We consider an integer numbering of the squares, where the traps have numbers 0 and N+1. If the grasshopper is between the traps in a square with number x, then the distances to the traps are equal to x and N-x.Let N+1=2^{k}. We will show that if before each jump we choose a number equal to the distance d to the nearest trap, the grasshopper will be caught in a trap. Since d inleft[1,2^{k-1}-1right], the highest power of two that divides d is less than k-1. If the grasshopper jumps in the direction opposite to the nearest trap, it will remain between the traps (since the other trap is farther away). The new distances to the traps are 2d and 2^{k}-2d, both of which are divisible by a higher power of two than d. By continuing this process, we will reach a moment when both distances are divisible by 2^{k}, which means they are 0 and 2^{k}, i.e., the grasshopper has fallen into a trap.Let N+1=2^{k} t, where t is an odd number greater than 1 (the power k can be equal to 0). We will call traps all squares with numbers that are multiples of t. If at any moment the grasshopper is not in a trap, then it is not in the middle between two traps (the middle between traps at and bt is frac{(a+b)t}{2}, which is either a trap or not an integer). This means that with any number we choose, the grasshopper can make a jump, avoiding the trap.Thus, we have proved that only when N is of the form 2^{k}-1 do we have a strategy for catching the grasshopper.Comment.

Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:   - Each match has 3 possible outcomes (win, lose, tie).   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for 6 matches is ( 3^6 = 729 ).3. Calculate the probability of having an equal number of wins and losses:   - We need to consider cases where ( W = L ).   Case 1: ( W = 3 ) and ( L = 3 )   - The number of ways to arrange 3 wins and 3 losses in 6 matches is given by the binomial coefficient:     [     binom{6}{3} = 20     ]   - Each of these arrangements can have any combination of ties in the remaining matches, but since there are no remaining matches, this is the only arrangement.   Case 2: ( W = 2 ), ( L = 2 ), and ( T = 2 )   - The number of ways to arrange 2 wins, 2 losses, and 2 ties in 6 matches is given by the multinomial coefficient:     [     frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90     ]   Case 3: ( W = 1 ), ( L = 1 ), and ( T = 4 )   - The number of ways to arrange 1 win, 1 loss, and 4 ties in 6 matches is given by the multinomial coefficient:     [     frac{6!}{1!1!4!} = 30     ]   Case 4: ( W = 0 ), ( L = 0 ), and ( T = 6 )   - The number of ways to arrange 0 wins, 0 losses, and 6 ties in 6 matches is given by:     [     frac{6!}{0!0!6!} = 1     ]4. Sum the probabilities of these cases:   - The total number of favorable outcomes for ( W = L ) is:     [     20 + 90 + 30 + 1 = 141     ]   - The probability of having an equal number of wins and losses is:     [     frac{141}{729}     ]5. Use symmetry to find the probability of ( W > L ):   - The probabilities of ( W > L ) and ( L > W ) are equal due to symmetry.   - The probability of ( W = L ) is ( frac{141}{729} ).   - Therefore, the probability of ( W neq L ) is:     [     1 - frac{141}{729} = frac{588}{729}     ]   - Since ( W > L ) and ( L > W ) are equally likely, the probability of ( W > L ) is:     [     frac{1}{2} times frac{588}{729} = frac{294}{729} = frac{98}{243}     ]6. Simplify the fraction and find ( m + n ):   - The fraction ( frac{98}{243} ) is already in simplest form.   - Therefore, ( m = 98 ) and ( n = 243 ).   - The sum ( m + n ) is:     [     98 + 243 = 341     ]The final answer is ( boxed{341} )"},{"problem":"The number of subsets of the set A={2, 4, 5} is ______.","solution":"Solution: All subsets of A are emptyset, {2}, {4}, {5}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}, {4, 5}, {2, 4, 5}.

Therefore, the sequence {a_{2}, a_{5}, a_{8}} forms an arithmetic sequence by itself.2. Use the given equation: We are given that a_{2} + a_{5} + a_{8} = 4. Since these three terms form an arithmetic sequence, the middle term, a_{5}, is the average of the three terms. Thus, we can write:   [   3a_{5} = 4 implies a_{5} = frac{4}{3}   ]3. Find S_{9}: The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_{n} = frac{n(a_{1} + a_{n})}{2}. For S_{9}, we need to find a_{1} and a_{9}. However, knowing the value of a_{5} and the property that the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant, we can express a_{1} and a_{9} in terms of a_{5}. Since a_{5} is the fifth term, a_{1} = a_{5} - 4d and a_{9} = a_{5} + 4d, where d is the common difference. But for the sum, we only need the sum of a_{1} and a_{9}, which simplifies to 2a_{5} because the 4d and -4d cancel out.   Therefore, we can calculate S_{9} as follows:   [   S_{9} = frac{9(a_{1} + a_{9})}{2} = frac{9 times 2a_{5}}{2} = 9a_{5} = 9 times frac{4}{3} = 12   ]Thus, the sum of the first 9 terms of the given arithmetic sequence is boxed{12}, which corresponds to choice boxed{B}."},{"problem":"3.

Solving for n gives n = 3932, meaning a total of 3932 triangles are formed.These 3932 triangles have a total of 3932 times 3 sides, of which 4 sides are the 4 sides of the original square, and do not need to be drawn separately.

Each brick can be oriented so it contribues 4'' or 10'' or 19'' to the total height of the tower.  How many differnt tower heights can be achieved using all 94 of the bricks?","solution":"To determine the number of different tower heights that can be achieved using all 94 bricks, we need to consider the possible contributions to the height from each brick. Each brick can contribute either 4'', 10'', or 19'' to the total height. 1. Formulate the problem in terms of variables:   Let:   - x be the number of bricks contributing 4'' to the height,   - y be the number of bricks contributing 10'' to the height,   - z be the number of bricks contributing 19'' to the height.   We have the following constraints:   [   x + y + z = 94   ]   The total height H of the tower can be expressed as:   [   H = 4x + 10y + 19z   ]2. Simplify the height equation:   We can rewrite the height equation by factoring out a common term:   [   4x + 10y + 19z = 4(x + y + z) + 6y + 15z   ]   Since x + y + z = 94, we substitute this into the equation:   [   4 cdot 94 + 6y + 15z = 376 + 6y + 15z   ]   To focus on the variable part, we consider:   [   6y + 15z   ]3. Analyze the possible values of 6y + 15z:   We can factor out a 3 from the expression:   [   6y + 15z = 3(2y + 5z)   ]   Therefore, we need to find the possible values of 2y + 5z.4. Determine the range of 2y + 5z:   Since y and z are non-negative integers and y + z leq 94, the minimum value of 2y + 5z is 0 (when y = 0 and z = 0), and the maximum value is:   [   2y + 5z leq 2(94 - z) + 5z = 188 - 3z   ]   The maximum value occurs when z = 94:   [   2(0) + 5(94) = 470   ]5. Identify the possible values of 2y + 5z:   We need to determine which values between 0 and 470 are achievable by 2y + 5z. We note that:   - 2y + 5z can take any value that is a multiple of 1, 2, or 5.   - We need to check the values modulo 3.6. Check the values modulo 3:   - When y + z = 94, 2y + 5z can be written as 188 + 3z, which covers all values of the form 2 pmod{3}.   - When y + z = 93, 2y + 5z can be written as 186 + 3z, which covers all values of the form 0 pmod{3}.   - When y + z = 92, 2y + 5z can be written as 184 + 3z, which covers all values of the form 1 pmod{3}.7. Count the number of possible values:   Since 2y + 5z can take any value from 0 to 470 except for specific values that do not fit the modulo 3 conditions, we need to exclude these values:   - The values that do not work are 468 (for 2 pmod{3}), 463 and 466 (for 1 pmod{3}), and 469 (for 0 pmod{3}).8. Calculate the total number of possible heights:   The total number of values from 0 to 470 is 471.

Let's introduce the functions f(x)=frac{1}{(x-1)^{2}}+frac{1}{(x-2)^{2}} and g(x)=frac{2}{x^{2}}.For x<0, both functions f and g are positive, but f(x) increases from +infty to 2 (not inclusive), since f^{prime}(x)=frac{-2}{(x-1)^{3}}-frac{2}{(x-2)^{3}}<0 quad text { for } quad x in(-infty ; 0), while g(x) decreases from +infty to 2 (not inclusive), since g^{prime}(x)=frac{-4}{x^{3}}<0 quad text { for } quad x in(-infty ; 0). Therefore, for x<0, the equation f(x)=g(x) has no solutions.For 0<x<1, the function f decreases from +infty to 2 (not inclusive), since f^{prime}(x)=frac{-2}{(x-1)^{3}}-frac{2}{(x-2)^{3}}<0 quad text { for } quad x in(0 ; 1), while the function g decreases from +infty to 2 (not inclusive), since g^{prime}(x)=frac{-4}{x^{3}}<0 quad text { for } quad x in(0 ; 1). However, for 0<x<1, the inequality f(x)>g(x) holds, because frac{1}{(x-1)^{2}}>frac{1}{x^{2}} and frac{1}{(x-2)^{2}}>frac{1}{x^{2}}, so f(x)>g(x). Therefore, for 0<x<1, the equation has no solutions.For x>2, the function f increases from 2 (not inclusive) to +infty, since f^{prime}(x)=frac{-2}{(x-1)^{3}}-frac{2}{(x-2)^{3}}>0 quad text { for } quad x in(2 ; +infty), while the function g decreases from 2 (not inclusive) to 0, since g^{prime}(x)=frac{-4}{x^{3}}<0 quad text { for } quad x in(2 ; +infty). For x>2, the inequalities 0<frac{1}{(x-1)^{2}}<frac{1}{x^{2}} and frac{1}{(x-2)^{2}}<frac{1}{x^{2}} hold, so f(x)<g(x).

Consider the function f(x)=6 x^{3}-21 x^{2}+24 x-8. Since f^{prime}(x)=18 x^{2}-42 x+24, x=1 is a point of maximum, and x=frac{4}{3} is a point of minimum.

Therefore, the resulting number is 3 cdot(1+2+ldots+9)=135. On the other hand, each sum of the numbers from three consecutive vertices is at most n, and there are 9 such sums, so the total sum is at most 9 n. It follows that 9 n geq 135 or n geq 15.We will also show that the value of n cannot be 15. In this case, the upper bound in the above estimate would be an equality, meaning that all sums of the numbers from three consecutive vertices are equal to 15. If we denote the numbers in four consecutive vertices by a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, and a_{4}, this means that a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}=15 and a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}=15, from which it follows that a_{1}=a_{4}, which is not possible, as we are arranging 9 different numbers.

As with any problem of this type, we start by looking for potential solutions for small values of k and n. For this purpose, it is useful to recognize in B_{n} the sum of the terms of an arithmetic sequence, so that B_{n}=n(n+1) / 2. In particular, if (k, n) is a solution, we know thatn^{2} leqslant 2 B_{n}=2 A_{k}<(n+1)^{2},so that n=leftlfloorsqrt{2 A_{k}}rightrfloor.We then calculate the first values of A_{k}: for example, when k varies from 1 to 5, A_{k} successively takes the values 1,3,9,33, and 153, and the integer n=leftlfloorsqrt{2 A_{k}}rightrfloor then successively takes the values 1,2,4,8, and 17, so that B_{n} takes the values 1,3,10,36, and 153. This initial study, although tedious towards the end, allowed us to identify three solution pairs: (k, n)=(1,1),(2,2), and (5,17).Moreover, it would be impractical to compute leftlfloor 2 sqrt{A_{ell}}rightrfloor by hand when ell geqslant 6, and we need to find a more general approach when ell is large. For example, when ell leqslant k, the integer ell! divides the integer k!=A_{k}-A_{k-1}, so that A_{k} equiv A_{ell-1}(bmod ell!). We therefore undertake to study the sequence left(A_{k}right) modulo ell! or ell for small values of ell, for example when ell is a prime number.After an unfruitful study of the cases ell=2,3, and 5, we observe that k!equiv 1,2,6,3,1,6 (bmod 7) when k varies from 1 to 6, and thus that A_{k} equiv A_{6} equiv 1+2+6+3+1+6 equiv 5(bmod 7) when k geqslant 6. On the other hand, B_{n} equiv 1,3,6,3,1,0,0(bmod 7) when n varies from 1 to 7. Since 2 is invertible modulo 7, we know that B_{n}(bmod 7) depends only on n(bmod 7). This means in particular that B_{n} not equiv 5 equiv A_{k}(bmod 7) as soon as k geqslant 6 and n geqslant 1, proving at the same time that (k, n) is not a solution.In conclusion, the solutions are the pairs (k, n)=(1,1),(2,2), and (5,17).Comment from the graders: The problem was rather difficult and was well approached. However, some candidates did not look for solutions, or missed the solution (5,17): it is important not to hesitate to spend time on these initial proofs, which also help to build intuition. Here, once the solution (5,17) was found, one could observe that any modulus dividing 5! would not allow progress towards the solution. It was therefore necessary to look for a modulus not dividing 5!; here, 7 was the easiest modulus, but 13 and 25 also worked."},{"problem":"18. (10 points) There are three pastures full of grass.

On the second day, Sárka ate frac{3}{4} of what Terezka ate. The number of candies Terezka ate that day must therefore be divisible by 4. The number of candies eaten by the girls on each day is given in the following table, where x and y denote unknown natural numbers:|  | 1st day | 2nd day || :---: | :---: | :---: || Sárka | 5 x | 3 y || Terezka | 2 x | 4 y |In total, 35 candies were eaten over the two days, so7 x+7 y=35 text { or } quad x+y=5 text {. }The difference between the number of candies eaten by Terezka and the number of candies eaten by Sárka is(2 x+4 y)-(5 x+3 y)=y-3 x .If we express y=5-x from (1) and substitute it into (2), we get the difference 5-4 x.

Thus, if we are only concerned with determining the desired solid K, there is no need to look for any internal points on the edges AA_1, BB_1, and DD_1, as any such points would, due to convexity, already belong to K and would not be true vertices. We also see that for any point C^* on the yet unconsidered segment CC_1, the minimal sum of distances is achieved, and K will always be formed from T by cutting off the points C and C_1, specifically the pyramids CC^*BD and C_1C^*B_1D_1. The \\"horizontal\\" bases of these pyramids are congruent, and the sum of their heights is CC_1. The sum of their volumes is CB cdot CD cdot CC_1 / 6, which is 1/6 of the volume of T. Thus, the volume of K is 5/6 of the volume of T.For completeness, we will also determine C^*. It is clear that we need to measure the distances from B and D_1 on the marked edges. We transform our problem into a planar one by folding the face BCC_1B_1 along CC_1 into the extension of the face D_1C_1CD. The new position of B, denoted as B_2, is connected to D_1 by a segment that intersects C^*, because for any other point C' on the segment, the triangle inequality gives B_2C' + C'D_1 > B_2D_1 = B_2C^* + C^*D_1.Remark. We did not need to use the fact that the edges of T are of three different lengths; at most, this excluded the possibility that, for example, if CB = CD, we could immediately state that C^* bisects CC_1, and that this would not be possible if we selected a different pair of edges."},{"problem":"Example 9 In the sequence left{x_{n}right}, x_{1}=3, and satisfies the inequality relationshipleft{begin{array}{l}4 x_{n+1}-3 x_{n}<2 2 x_{n+1}-x_{n}<2end{array}right.Prove: 2+left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n}<x_{n+1}<2+left(frac{3}{4}right)^{n}.","solution":"Prove: Let x_{n}-2=y_{n}, then substituting x_{n}=y_{n}+2 into equation (1) yields4left(y_{n-1}+2right)-3left(y_{n}+2right)frac{1}{2} y_{n}>cdots>left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n} y_{1}, quad x_{n+1}>2+left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n} text {, }Therefore,2+left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n}<x_{n+1}<left(frac{3}{4}right)^{n}+2 text {. }"},{"problem":"Example 19 (1990 National High School League Question) 8 girls and 25 boys stand in a circle, with at least two boys standing between any two girls.

Using the Parallel Condition (AX parallel DE):   - Since (AX parallel DE), (angle AXC = angle DEC).   - Note that (D) is the foot of the altitude from (A) to (BC), so (angle ADE = 90^circ).4.

Initial Conditions:   We are given that the total amount of rice is 1000 kg and the total number of eggs is 3000.

If ( b_m < 30 ), then:   [   b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{100} < 100b_m < 3000   ]   which contradicts the given total number of eggs. Therefore, ( b_m geq 30 ).5.

Then O B = O C = r, O M = M B = O L = L C = frac{r}{2}. Connect H M, M G, then triangle B H M and triangle B M G are both equilateral triangles, so H M = M G = frac{r}{2}, which means point M is exactly the intersection of circles H, G, and the small circle O. Similarly, point L is the intersection of circles H, I, and the small circle O. It is evident that the sector O B C is covered by circles H and O. Therefore, the entire large circular surface is completely covered by 7 small circular discs.(2) Below is the proof that any 6 small circular discs with radius frac{r}{2} cannot completely cover a large circular surface with radius r.Divide the circumference of the large circle into 48 equal parts, obtaining 48 points.

Therefore, a small circular disc with radius frac{r}{2} can cover at most 9 of the 48 points.

Proof: Without loss of generality, we consider the cases where (gcd(a, b, c) = 1). By checking modulo (3), we must have (3 mid a) or (3 mid b). By checking modulo (4), we must have (4 mid a) or (4 mid b). By checking modulo (5), we must have (5 mid a) or (5 mid b) or (5 mid c). Therefore, (60 mid abc).2. Now we consider (dfrac{n}{d_{22}} = d_{k-21}).3. So, we have (d_7^2 + d_{10}^2 = d_{k-21}^2). This implies (60 mid (d_7)(d_{10})(d_{k-21})).4. This gives us that (d_2 = 2, d_3 = 3, d_4 = 4, d_5 = 5, d_6 = 6), and (10) is a sure factor of (n). Thus (d_7 = 7, 8, 9, text{or} 10). Case 1: (d_7 = 7)5. If (d_7 = 7), then ((d_{k-21} - d_{10})(d_{k-21} + d_{10}) = 49). This implies ((d_{k-21} - d_{10}) = 1) and ((d_{k-21} + d_{10}) = 49). Solving these, we get (d_{10} = 24) and (d_{k-21} = 25). This implies ((k-21) = 11) or (k = 32).6. But, if (24 mid n) and (25 mid n), then it implies that ({8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 24}) are also factors of (n). This gives (d_8 = 8) and (d_9 = 10), but then there is a contradiction as (d_{10} = 24) and there are no places for the remaining factors. Case 2: (d_7 = 8)7. If (d_7 = 8), then ((d_{10}, d_{k-21}) = (15, 17)) or ((6, 10)).8. The second pair is ruled out as (d_{10} = 6 < 8 = d_7), a contradiction.9. If we consider the first pair, then note that we are forced to have (d_8 = 10) and (d_9 = 12). Thus we get that (n) has at least three factors of (2), exactly (1) factor of (3), and at least (1) factor of (5) (and no factors of (7) or (11)).10.

Let (d(n)) denote the number of divisors of (n). This implies (d(n) geq 243), which is a contradiction.16. (ii) If (d_{k-21} = d_{11} = 15), this implies (k = 32). This implies (n geq (2^2)(3^2)(5)(11)). This implies (d(n) geq 36), which is a contradiction. Case 4: (d_7 = 10)17. If (d_7 = 10), then ((d_{10}, d_{k-21}) = (24, 26)).

Determine the period for each clock to show the correct time:   - For the first clock, which advances (1) minute per day, it will take (720) days to complete a full cycle of (720) minutes (since (12 times 60 = 720) minutes in a full cycle of a 12-hour clock).   - For the second clock, which advances (1.5) minutes per day, it will take (frac{720}{1.5} = 480) days to complete a full cycle of (720) minutes.3. Find the least common multiple (LCM):   - The LCM of (720) and (480) can be found by prime factorization:     [     720 = 2^4 times 3^2 times 5     ]     [     480 = 2^5 times 3 times 5     ]   - The LCM is obtained by taking the highest power of each prime factor:     [     text{LCM}(720, 480) = 2^5 times 3^2 times 5 = 1440     ]4. Conclusion: The least number of days that must pass for both clocks to show the correct time simultaneously is (1440) days.The final answer is (boxed{1440})."},{"problem":"3.

What is the remainder when N is divided by 2010?","solution":"1. Factorization and Units Digit Analysis:   We start by noting that (2010^{2010} = 2^{2010} cdot 3^{2010} cdot 5^{2010} cdot 67^{2010}). Since we are interested in the units digit of the divisors, we can ignore the factor (5^{2010}) because any number ending in 0 or 5 will not end in 2. Thus, we focus on the product (2^a cdot 3^b cdot 67^c) where (a, b, c) are nonnegative integers.2. Units Digit Cycles:   - The units digit of (2^a) cycles every 4: (2, 4, 8, 6).   - The units digit of (3^b) cycles every 4: (3, 9, 7, 1).   - The units digit of (67^c) cycles every 4: (7, 9, 3, 1).3. Case Analysis:   We need to find combinations of (a, b, c) such that the product (2^a cdot 3^b cdot 67^c) ends in 2. We analyze each possible units digit of (2^a):   - Case 1: Units digit of (2^a) is 2.     - Possible pairs for (3^b) and (67^c) are: (3, 7), (9, 9), (7, 3), (1, 1).     - Number of divisors: (503 cdot (503^2 + 503^2 + 502^2 + 503^2) = 503 cdot (3 cdot 503^2 + 502^2)).   - Case 2: Units digit of (2^a) is 4.     - Possible pairs for (3^b) and (67^c) are: (3, 1), (9, 7), (7, 9), (1, 3).     - Number of divisors: (503 cdot (503^2 + 503^2 + 502 cdot 503 + 503 cdot 502) = 503 cdot 502 cdot 2010).   - Case 3: Units digit of (2^a) is 8.     - Possible pairs for (3^b) and (67^c) are: (3, 3), (9, 1), (7, 7), (1, 9).     - Number of divisors: (502 cdot (503 cdot 502 + 503^2 + 502 cdot 503 + 503^2) = 502 cdot 503 cdot 2010).   - Case 4: Units digit of (2^a) is 6.     - Possible pairs for (3^b) and (67^c) are: (3, 9), (9, 3), (7, 1), (1, 7).     - Number of divisors: (502 cdot (503^2 + 503 cdot 502 + 502 cdot 503 + 503^2) = 502 cdot 503 cdot 2010).4. Modulo Calculation:   - The number of divisors in cases 2, 3, and 4 are divisible by 2010, so they do not contribute to the remainder.   - We focus on the result from Case 1: (503 cdot (3 cdot 503^2 + 502^2)).5. Simplifying the Expression:   [   3 cdot 503^2 + 502^2 = (503^2 + 502^2) + 2 cdot 503^2   ]   [   = (503 + 502)^2 - 2 cdot 503 cdot 502 + 2 cdot 503^2   ]   [   = 1005^2 + 2 cdot 503   ]   [   = 1004 cdot 1005 + 1005 + 1006 equiv 1005 + 1006 pmod{2010}   ]   [   equiv 1 pmod{2010}   ]   Therefore, the number of divisors is (503 cdot 1 = 503).The final answer is (boxed{503})."},{"problem":"If the circumference of a sector is 36, in order to maximize the area of this sector, what is the radian measure of the central angle alpha of the sector?A: 1B: 2C: 3D: 4","solution":"To maximize the area of the sector with a given circumference, we start by defining the variables involved. Let r be the radius of the sector and l be the arc length. The total circumference of the sector is given by the sum of the lengths of the two radii and the arc length, which can be expressed as:[2r + l = 36]From this equation, we can solve for l:[l = 36 - 2r]The area S of the sector can be calculated using the formula for the area of a sector, which is frac{1}{2}lr. Substituting the expression for l we found earlier gives:[S = frac{1}{2} times (36 - 2r) times r = frac{1}{2} times (36r - 2r^2) = 18r - r^2]This can be rewritten by completing the square to make it easier to identify the maximum value:[S = -(r^2 - 18r) = -(r - 9)^2 + 81]This form of the equation shows that the area of the sector is maximized when (r - 9)^2 is minimized, which occurs when r = 9. At this point, the maximum area is achieved.To find the radian measure of the central angle alpha of the sector, we use the relationship between the arc length l, the radius r, and the central angle in radians, which is alpha = frac{l}{r}. Substituting the values we have:[alpha = frac{36 - 2 times 9}{9} = frac{36 - 18}{9} = frac{18}{9} = 2]Therefore, the radian measure of the central angle alpha that maximizes the area of the sector is boxed{2}, which corresponds to choice boxed{B}."},{"problem":"If m and n are consecutive integers, m＜sqrt{13}＜n.

First, we identify the perfect squares that are immediately less than and greater than 13 to help us find the integer bounds for sqrt{13}:   9 < 13 < 16   This is because 9 = 3^2 and 16 = 4^2.2. Taking the square root throughout the inequality gives us the bounds for sqrt{13}:   3 < sqrt{13} < 4   This step follows from understanding that the square root function is increasing, so the inequality signs remain the same.3. Given that m and n are consecutive integers and m＜sqrt{13}＜n, we can now deduce the values of m and n based on the inequality derived in step 2:   m = 3, quad n = 4   This is because 3 and 4 are the only consecutive integers that satisfy the condition m＜sqrt{13}＜n.4.

In this case, the first draw can result in six different outcomes (the first can be any of the six cards), the second in five different outcomes (the second can be any of the five cards remaining after the first draw), the third in four different outcomes, and the fourth in three different outcomes. By combining the six possible outcomes of the first draw with the five possible outcomes of the second draw, we get 6 cdot 5 = 30 possible outcomes for the sequence of two draws; similarly, for the sequence of three draws, we get 4 cdot 30 = 120 possible outcomes, and for the sequence of four draws, 3 cdot 120 = 360 possible outcomes. Thus, our experiment can result in 360 different outcomes; all these outcomes are equally probable.The favorable outcome for us is the single outcome where the card with the letter M is drawn first, the card with the letter O is drawn second, the card with the letter P is drawn third, and finally, the card with the letter E is drawn fourth.

From the problem statement, it follows that angle B A C=45^{circ}. Draw a circle with center M and radius M B=M C (see Fig. 11.2).

Understanding the inequalities:   Each inequality represents a region in 3-dimensional space. The absolute value inequalities can be interpreted as planes that bound a region.

In this case, cos (x-6 y)= -cos 8 y=-2 cos ^{2} 4 y+1=-2 cdot frac{4}{5}+1=-frac{3}{5}.If x=6 y+2 pi k, k in mathbb{Z}, then (??) takes the formleft{begin{array} { l } { frac { sin 6 y } { sin 2 y } = frac { 1 } { 5 } + cos ^ { 2 } 4 y , } { - frac { cos 6 y } { cos 2 y } = frac { 4 } { 5 } + sin ^ { 2 } 4 y }end{array} Leftrightarrow left{begin{array}{l}3-4 sin ^{2} 2 y=frac{1}{5}+cos ^{2} 4 y 3-4 cos ^{2} 2 y=frac{4}{5}+sin ^{2} 4 yend{array}right.right.Each of the equations in the last system reduces to the equation cos ^{2} 4 y-2 cos 4 y-frac{4}{5}=0, which has solutions, since cos 4 y=1-frac{3}{sqrt{5}}. Therefore, this case is also possible, and we get that cos (x+6 y)=cos (2 pi k)=1.Thus, cos (x-6 y) can be equal to -frac{3}{5} or 1.Note that in both cases all the restrictions that appeared in connection with the domain of definition left(cos 2 x neq pm frac{1}{2}right., cos 2 y neq 0, sin 2 y neq 0) are satisfied.Remark.

Given that AB = 7 and the angle bisector of angle BAC intersects BC at D, we need to determine the number of possible integral values for BC such that the triangle ABC is divided into three parts of equal area by a line EF parallel to AD.2.

Let a prime p>2 be given. Choose n=(p-1)^{2}, then we have n equiv(-1)^{2}=1(bmod p).

So for each odd prime number p there exists a positive integer n such that p mid g^{n}-n^{2} and p mid g^{n+1}-(n+1)^{2}.If g has an odd prime factor p, then from p mid g^{n}-n^{2} it follows that p mid n^{2}, so also p mid n, while from p mid g^{n+1}-(n+1)^{2} we deduce that p mid(n+1)^{2}, so also p mid n+1.But p cannot divide both n and n+1; contradiction. So g is a power of 2: g=2^{k} for some k geqslant 0.If g=2^{0}=1, then for any odd prime p we have p mid 1-n^{2}=(1-n)(1+n) and p mid 1-(n+1)^{2}=(1-(n+1))(1+(n+1)). Now take p=5. The first statement says that n equiv 1 or n equiv-1 equiv 4(bmod 5), and the second that n equiv 0 or n equiv-2 equiv 3 (bmod 5). But this yields a contradiction.If g=2^{1}=2, then for any odd prime p we have p mid 2^{n}-n^{2} and p mid 2^{n+1}-(n+1)^{2}. Now take p=3. As 3 nmid 2^{n} and 3 nmid 2^{n+1}, we know that 3 nmid n^{2} and 3 nmid(n+1)^{2}. So these two squares must be 1 modulo 3 (as 2 can never be a square modulo 3 ). Therefore also 2^{n} and 2^{n+1} must be 1 modulo 3 , which gives 2 cdot 1 equiv 2 cdot 2^{n}=2^{n+1} equiv 1(bmod 3); contradiction.Now suppose k geqslant 2.

Suppose p geqslant 5. The first statement says that n equiv 1 or n equiv-1(bmod p), and the second that n equiv 0 or n equiv-2(bmod p). But n can only be congruent to at most one of the numbers -2,-1,0 and 1 , since p geqslant 5; contradiction. We conclude that p=3, so g-1 contains only prime factors 3. Hence 2^{k}-1=3^{ell} for some ell>0. We see that 2^{k}-1 equiv(-1)^{k}-1(bmod 3), while 3^{ell} equiv 0(bmod 3). So k has to be even, say k=2 m, and our equation becomes 2^{2 m}-1=3^{ell}, or equivalently left(2^{m}-1right)left(2^{m}+1right)=3^{ell}. Not both factors on the left-hand side can be divisible by 3 , so 2^{m}-1=1 and 2^{m}+1=3^{ell}, so m=1. Hence g=2^{2}=4.Now we show that g=4 does have the given property.

Therefore, ( 2002 ) must be the product ( jm ) because if it were the sum ( j + m ), John would have been able to determine ( m ) since the sum of two natural numbers is unique.3.

First Method: Combinatorial Approach   To find the number of intersection points of the segments, we can use a combinatorial approach. Each intersection point is determined by choosing two distinct points on the x-axis and two distinct points on the y-axis. The segments joining these points will intersect exactly once.   - Choose 2 points from m points on the x-axis: binom{m}{2}   - Choose 2 points from n points on the y-axis: binom{n}{2}   The total number of intersection points is given by the product of these two binomial coefficients:   [   binom{m}{2} binom{n}{2} = frac{m(m-1)}{2} cdot frac{n(n-1)}{2} = frac{mn(m-1)(n-1)}{4}   ]2. Second Method: Summation Approach   We can also derive the formula by considering the intersections incrementally.   - Start by joining each point x_i on the x-axis to one point y_1 on the y-axis.   - For the second point y_2 on the y-axis, the number of intersections with segments from y_1 is m-1, and this decreases by one for each subsequent segment until y_2x_m where there are no intersections. This gives:     [     sum_{i=0}^{m-1} i = frac{m(m-1)}{2}     ]   - For the third point y_3 on the y-axis, the number of intersections is 2(m-1), contributed by y_1 and y_2.

We start with the given functional equation for the polynomial ( P(t) ):   [   P(x^2 - y^2) = P(x + y)P(x - y)   ]   for all real numbers ( x ) and ( y ).2. Notice that ( x^2 - y^2 ) can be factored as:   [   x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)   ]   This suggests that we can rewrite the functional equation in terms of the product of sums and differences of ( x ) and ( y ).3. To explore the solutions, let's consider specific values for ( x ) and ( y ). First, set ( y = 0 ):   [   P(x^2) = P(x)P(x)   ]   This simplifies to:   [   P(x^2) = P(x)^2   ]4. Next, set ( x = 0 ):   [   P(-y^2) = P(y)P(-y)   ]   Since ( P(t) ) is a polynomial, it must be even or odd. If ( P(t) ) is even, then ( P(-y) = P(y) ). If ( P(t) ) is odd, then ( P(-y) = -P(y) ).5. Consider the polynomial ( P(t) ) of degree ( n ). Suppose ( P(t) = a_n t^n + a_{n-1} t^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 t + a_0 ). From the equation ( P(x^2) = P(x)^2 ), we can infer that the degree of ( P(x^2) ) is ( 2n ) and the degree of ( P(x)^2 ) is ( 2n ). Therefore, the degree of ( P(t) ) must be consistent with this relationship.6. If ( P(t) ) is a non-zero polynomial, the simplest non-trivial solution is ( P(t) = t^n ). Let's verify this:   [   P(x^2 - y^2) = (x^2 - y^2)^n   ]   and   [   P(x + y)P(x - y) = (x + y)^n (x - y)^n = (x^2 - y^2)^n   ]   Both sides match, confirming that ( P(t) = t^n ) is a solution.7. Additionally, the zero polynomial ( P(t) = 0 ) and the constant polynomial ( P(t) = 1 ) also satisfy the given functional equation:   [   P(x^2 - y^2) = 0 = 0 cdot 0   ]   and   [   P(x^2 - y^2) = 1 = 1 cdot 1   ]8.

Identify the Symmetry Group:   The symmetry group of the hexagon consists of 6 elements: 3 rotations (0°, 120°, 240°) and 3 reflections (across axes passing through opposite vertices or midpoints of opposite sides).2. Calculate Fixed Points for Each Symmetry:   - 0° Rotation (Identity):     Every coloring is fixed under the identity rotation. The number of ways to color the disks with 2 black, 2 white, and 2 blue is given by the multinomial coefficient:     [     binom{6}{2,2,2} = frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90     ]   - 120° and 240° Rotations:     For a coloring to be fixed under a 120° or 240° rotation, each set of 2 disks of the same color must be positioned 120° apart. This is impossible with 2 disks of each color, so there are no fixed points:     [     text{Fixed points} = 0     ]   - Reflections:     Each reflection axis divides the hexagon into two sets of 3 disks. For a coloring to be fixed under reflection, each pair of disks on either side of the axis must be the same color. There are 3 reflection axes, and for each axis, we can choose 2 out of the 3 positions on one side to be black, white, or blue. This gives:     [     binom{3}{1,1,1} = frac{3!}{1!1!1!} = 6     ]     Since there are 3 reflection axes, the total number of fixed points for reflections is:     [     3 times 6 = 18     ]3. Apply Burnside's Lemma:   Burnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct colorings is the average number of fixed points of the group actions:   [   text{Number of distinct colorings} = frac{1}{|G|} sum_{g in G} text{Fixed points of } g   ]   Here, (|G| = 6) (the number of symmetries), and the sum of fixed points is:   [   90 (text{identity}) + 0 (text{120° rotation}) + 0 (text{240° rotation}) + 18 (text{reflections}) = 108   ]   Therefore, the number of distinct colorings is:   [   frac{108}{6} = 18   ]The final answer is (boxed{18})."},{"problem":"11.082.

Prove that the following inequality holds\\r\\r[ sum^n_{iequal{}1} frac{1}{a_i} leq 30.]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to prove that the sum of the reciprocals of distinct positive integers that do not contain the digit 9 in their decimal representation is less than or equal to 30.2. Counting the Numbers:   Let's first count the number of positive integers that do not contain the digit 9. For a k-digit number, each digit can be any of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 (9 choices per digit). However, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are 8 choices for the first digit and 9 choices for each of the remaining (k-1) digits.   For a k-digit number:   [   text{Number of k-digit numbers without 9} = 8 times 9^{k-1}   ]3. Summing the Reciprocals:   We need to sum the reciprocals of these numbers. Let's denote the set of all such numbers by ( S ). We need to show:   [   sum_{a in S} frac{1}{a} leq 30   ]4. Bounding the Sum:   Consider the sum of the reciprocals of all numbers from 1 to ( N ) that do not contain the digit 9. We need to find an upper bound for this sum.   For simplicity, let's consider the sum of the reciprocals of all numbers from 1 to ( 10^k - 1 ) that do not contain the digit 9. The number of such numbers is:   [   sum_{i=1}^{k} 8 times 9^{i-1} = 8 left( frac{9^k - 1}{9 - 1} right) = 8 left( frac{9^k - 1}{8} right) = 9^k - 1   ]5. Harmonic Series Approximation:   The sum of the reciprocals of the first ( n ) natural numbers is approximately ( ln(n) + gamma ), where ( gamma ) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. For large ( n ), this approximation becomes more accurate.   Therefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the numbers from 1 to ( 9^k - 1 ) is approximately:   [   sum_{i=1}^{9^k - 1} frac{1}{i} approx ln(9^k - 1) + gamma   ]6. Logarithmic Bound:   Since ( ln(9^k - 1) approx k ln(9) ), we have:   [   sum_{i=1}^{9^k - 1} frac{1}{i} approx k ln(9) + gamma   ]7. Choosing ( k ):   We need to find ( k ) such that:   [   k ln(9) + gamma leq 30   ]   Since ( ln(9) approx 2.197 ) and ( gamma approx 0.577 ), we get:   [   k cdot 2.197 + 0.577 leq 30   ]   Solving for ( k ):   [   k leq frac{30 - 0.577}{2.197} approx 13.4   ]   Therefore, ( k leq 13 ).8. Conclusion:   The sum of the reciprocals of all numbers that do not contain the digit 9 and are less than ( 9^{13} ) is less than or equal to 30. Since there are no numbers greater than ( 9^{13} ) that do not contain the digit 9, the inequality holds for all such numbers.[boxed{30}]"},{"problem":"6.

Let u(x)=frac{2-x}{e^{x}}, x > x_{0}, then u^{prime}(x)=frac{x-3}{e^{x}}, x > x_{0},As x changes, u^{prime}(x), u(x) change as follows:begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}hlinex & left(x_{0}, 3right) & 3 & (3,+infty) hlineu^{prime}(x) & - & 0 & + hlineu(x) & decreasing function & minimum value & increasing function hlineend{tabular}therefore u(x)_{min }=u(x)_{text {minimum }}=u(3)=-frac{1}{e^{3}}.Therefore, “2 c leqslant frac{2-x}{e^{x}} holds on left(x_{0},+inftyright)” only requires 2 c leqslant u(x)_{min }=-frac{1}{e^{3}}, i.e., c leqslant-frac{1}{2 e^{3}}.(2) When 0 < x < x_{0}, 1+frac{1}{x^{2}}-2 c x geqslant 0 holds on left(0, x_{0}right).Combining (1) and (2), we know that when c leqslant-frac{1}{2 e^{3}}, the function h(x)=g(x)-c x^{2} is increasing.

From his statement, it follows that among people with numbers from 2 to 12, there are at least 3 knights, but from the above proof, we know there are no more than 3 knights. Since the first three of them are definitely liars, among people with numbers from 5 to 12, there are exactly 3 knights.Now consider the group of people with numbers from 5 to 16. Among them, there are no more than 3 knights, but among people with numbers from 5 to 12, there are exactly 3 knights. Therefore, people with numbers from 13 to 16 are liars. Thus, we have found a new set of 4 consecutive liars, shifted by 12 people in a clockwise direction from the original set.Continuing similar reasoning for the new set of 4 consecutive liars, we will get another such set, then another, and so on. Since the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 80 and 12 is 4, all people at the table will fall into such sets. But they cannot all be liars, which is a contradiction.Thus, our assumption was incorrect, and in any set of 4 consecutive people, there is at least one knight. But we know that among 12 consecutive people, there are no more than 3 knights. Therefore, in any set of 4 consecutive people, there is exactly one knight, meaning there are exactly 20 knights at the table.It remains to construct an example of such a seating arrangement of knights and liars. Let all people with numbers divisible by 4 be knights, and all others be liars. It is not difficult to verify that this example satisfies the problem's condition.Another solution. Let's call the sorrow of a certain person the number of liars among 12 people, including himself and 11 others sitting consecutively after him in a clockwise direction. According to the problem, the sorrow of each knight is at least 9, and the sorrow of each liar is at most 9. We will prove that the sorrow of all people is exactly 9.First, note that the sorrow of adjacent people cannot differ by more than 1. Indeed, when moving to the next person in a clockwise direction, one person is removed from their set of 12, and one is added. Therefore, the number of liars can decrease by no more than 1 and increase by no more than 1.Now suppose that a certain knight has a sorrow greater than 9. Then the sorrow of the next person is no less: from their set of 12 people, this knight is removed, and an unknown person is added, i.e., the number of liars does not decrease. Therefore, a liar cannot follow such a knight, and we have found another knight with a sorrow greater than 9. Clearly, we can continue this process in a circle and arrive at a contradiction: all at the table cannot be knights.Similarly, it can be proven that a liar cannot have a sorrow less than 9. Indeed, the sorrow of the next person after such a liar cannot be greater than the liar's; therefore, this must also be a liar with a sorrow less than 9; continuing this, we arrive at the conclusion that all at the table are liars, which is also impossible.Now it is clear that the number of liars among any 12 consecutive people is equal to the sorrow of the first of them, i.e., 9. From this, it is easy to understand that two people at a distance of 12 (i.e., with 11 others between them) have the same type (knight or liar), since adding either of them to the 11 intermediate people should result in 9 liars. This means that the sequence of knights and liars is periodic with a period of 12; but since the GCD of 80 and 12 is 4, it is also periodic with a period of 4.Dividing the entire table into identical sets of four, it is easy to see that in each of them there are 3 liars (otherwise, in a group of three adjacent sets of four, there would not be 9). Therefore, there is one knight in each, meaning there are 20 knights in total.A periodic seating arrangement of knights with three liars in between, as is easy to verify, satisfies the condition."},{"problem":"(2013•Shanghai) In triangle ABC, the lengths of the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

We write ( x = lfloor x rfloor + langle x rangle ), hence ( x^2 = (lfloor x rfloor)^2 + 2 lfloor x rfloor cdot x + langle x rangle^2 ).Thus, if ( leftlangle x^2 rightrangle = langle x rangle^2 ), we get that ( leftlfloor x^2 rightrfloor = x^2 - leftlangle x^2 rightrangle = (lfloor x rfloor)^2 + 2 lfloor x rfloor cdot x ) is an integer, so ( 2 lfloor x rfloor cdot x ) is also an integer. In particular, if we set ( k = lfloor x rfloor ), since ( k geq 1 ), we know that ( x ) is of the form ( frac{q}{2k} ). Since ( k ) is the smallest integer less than or equal to ( x ), we have ( k leq x < k+1 ), thus ( 2k^2 leq q < 2k^2 + 2k ). Let ( q = r + 2k^2 ) with ( 0 leq r < 2k ), then ( x = k + frac{r}{2k} ).Conversely, suppose ( x ) is of the form ( k + frac{r}{2k} ) with ( k geq 1 ) and ( 0 leq r < 2k ), we get that ( k leq x < k+1 ), so ( lfloor x rfloor = k ), thus ( langle x rangle = frac{r}{2k} ).Furthermore, ( x^2 = k^2 + r + frac{r^2}{(2k)^2} ) satisfies ( k^2 + r leq x^2 < k^2 + r + 1 ), so ( leftlfloor x^2 rightrfloor = k^2 + r ) which gives ( leftlangle x^2 rightrangle = frac{r^2}{(2k)^2} = langle x rangle^2 ): ( x ) is a solution.It remains to count how many such ( x ) are between 1 and 10: since ( k = lfloor x rfloor ), we must have ( 1 leq k leq 10 ).

Understanding the Inequality: The given inequality suggests that for any x in the interval [1,3], the expression x^2 - ax - 3 does not exceed 0. This can be interpreted as a being at least as large as a certain function of x, specifically a geq x - frac{3}{x}.2. Finding the Minimum Value of a: To find the range of a, we need to determine the minimum value of a that satisfies the inequality for all x in the given interval. This is equivalent to finding the maximum value of the function y = x - frac{3}{x} over the interval [1,3].3. Analyzing the Function y = x - frac{3}{x}:   - The function y = x is monotonically increasing in [1,3] because as x increases, y increases.   - Similarly, the function y = -frac{3}{x} is monotonically increasing in [1,3] because as x increases, the magnitude of -frac{3}{x} decreases, making y less negative (and thus increasing).   - Combining these observations, the function y = x - frac{3}{x} is also monotonically increasing in [1,3]. This means that as x increases within this interval, the value of y increases.4. Finding the Maximum Value of y in [1,3]: Since y = x - frac{3}{x} is monotonically increasing in the interval [1,3], its maximum value occurs at the upper bound of this interval, which is x = 3. Substituting x = 3 into the function gives y = 3 - frac{3}{3} = 2.5. Determining the Range of a: Since the minimum value of a that satisfies the inequality for all x in [1,3] corresponds to the maximum value of y = x - frac{3}{x}, and we found this maximum value to be 2, it follows that a geq 2.Therefore, the range of the real number a is left[2,+infty right).

We need to find the maximum number k of companies that can be closed while ensuring the graph remains connected.2. Define the graph and its properties:   We have a complete graph K_n with n vertices, where each edge is colored with one of m colors. We need to find the maximum k such that removing any k colors leaves the graph connected.3. Graph decomposition:   Consider the graph G_1 formed by the edges of the k colors we choose to remove, and G_2 formed by the remaining m-k colors. Note that G_2 is the complement of G_1.4. Connectivity argument:   If G_1 is disconnected, then G_2 must be connected. Suppose G_1 is disconnected with connected components C_1, C_2, ldots, C_r where r > 1. Any edge between vertices in different components C_i and C_j must be in G_2, ensuring G_2 is connected.5. Maximizing k:   We can always delete at least lfloor m/2 rfloor colors and still have a connected graph. This is because if k leq lfloor m/2 rfloor, then m-k geq lceil m/2 rceil, ensuring G_2 has enough edges to remain connected.6. Constructing a critical example:   To show that lfloor m/2 rfloor is the maximum, construct a graph where removing lfloor m/2 rfloor + 1 colors disconnects the graph. Let k = lfloor m/2 rfloor + 1. Consider sets V_1 with k vertices and V_2 with binom{m}{k} vertices. Map each set of k colors to a vertex in V_2 and color edges between V_1 and V_2 such that each color in the set is used exactly once.7. Ensuring disconnection:   If we remove any k colors, there will be a vertex in V_2 that becomes isolated, as it will lose all its incident edges. This construction ensures that removing lfloor m/2 rfloor + 1 colors disconnects the graph.8. Vertex count:   The number of vertices in G is k + binom{m}{k} < lfloor m/2 rfloor + 1 + 2^m < 10^m. We can add dummy vertices to reach exactly 10^m vertices without affecting the connectivity properties.Conclusion:The maximum number of companies k that can be closed while ensuring the graph remains connected is lfloor m/2 rfloor = lfloor 2015/2 rfloor = 1007.The final answer is boxed{1007}."},{"problem":"2. Find the smallest real number m, for which there exist real numbers a, b such that the inequalityleft|x^{2}+a x+bright| leqq mholds for every x inlangle 0,2rangle.","solution":"SOLUTION. At the outset, let's realize that no negative number m meets the requirements of the problem (the absolute value is a non-negative number).Let's interpret the problem geometrically. The condition from the problem states that the graph of some quadratic function y=x^{2}+a x+b on the interval langle 0,2rangle must lie within a horizontal strip between the lines y=+m and y=-m (Fig. 1). The question then is: Into what narrowest strip of this kind can the graph of such a function be \\"compressed\\" on the interval langle 0,2rangle?![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_ef3d84e533bc09b28859g-03.jpg?height=334&width=623&top_left_y=2197&top_left_x=722)Fig. 1According to Fig. 1, a good candidate for the narrowest strip seems to be the functionf(x)=(x-1)^{2}-frac{1}{2}=x^{2}-2 x+frac{1}{2},for which a=-2 and b=frac{1}{2}, and which, as we will soon show, satisfies the inequalities -frac{1}{2} leqq f(x) leqq frac{1}{2} on the interval langle 0,2rangle.Indeed, due to the expression f(x)=(x-1)^{2}-frac{1}{2}, these are the inequalities 0 leqq(x-1)^{2} leqq 1, which hold simultaneously precisely for x inlangle 0,2rangle. The quadratic function f(x)=x^{2}-2 x+frac{1}{2} thus meets the condition of the problem for m=frac{1}{2}.In the second part of the solution, we will show that no quadratic function satisfying the condition exists for any m<frac{1}{2}.A key fact for us will be that for any function f(x)=x^{2}+a x+b, at least one of the differences f(0)-f(1) and f(2)-f(1) is greater than or equal to one. From this, it follows that the width 2 m of the enclosing strip must be greater than or equal to one, and values of m<frac{1}{2} can indeed be excluded. If, for example, f(0)-f(1) geqq 1 (in the case f(2)-f(1) geqq 1 we would proceed similarly), we obtain the desired estimate 2 m geqq 1 easily from the generally valid triangle inequality |a-b| leqq|a|+|b|:1 leqq|f(0)-f(1)| leqq|f(0)|+|f(1)| leqq 2 mTo complete the entire solution, it remains to prove the validity of at least one of the inequalities f(0)-f(1) geqq 1 or f(2)-f(1) geqq 1 for any f(x)=x^{2}+a x+b. Sincef(0)=b, quad f(1)=1+a+b, quad f(2)=4+2 a+bwe havebegin{aligned}& f(0)-f(1)=-1-a geqq 1 quad Leftrightarrow quad a leqq-2, & f(2)-f(1)=3+a geqq 1 quad Leftrightarrow quad a geqq-2 .end{aligned}At least one of the inequalities f(0)-f(1) geqq 1 or f(2)-f(1) geqq 1 thus holds always (regardless of the choice of numbers a, b).Answer: The sought minimum value of m is frac{1}{2}.SUPPLEMENTARY AND ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS:N1.

Let A_{n} be the number of contacts of n spheres arranged in a triangle with n spheres on each side (right figure).

Obviously, in a triangle of n rows, there will be the contacts that were already in a triangle of n-1 rows, plus those that come from adding the last row, as indicated in the figure above. But it is clear that, by adding this last row, contacts of two types are produced:- The ones between the balls of the n-th row, which are n-1.- The ones between the balls of the n-th row and the previous one. They are 2(n-1).Thus, A_{n}=A_{n-1}+3(n-1), or, A_{n}-A_{n-1}=3(n-1). Summing up, we getA_{n}=3((n-1)+(n-2)+cdots+2+1)=3 frac{n(n-1)}{2}=3 T_{n-1}## The problem in three-dimensional space.Now we can analyze the case in three-dimensional space.

(See the figure.) In total, then, the number of contacts is C_{n}-C_{n-1}=A_{n}+3 T_{n-1}=3 n(n-1).

The expression under the third root can be written in the form (10-x-y)^{2}+2^{2}, and the first two terms are already the sum of two squares. The three terms of the examined sum are thus the lengths of the vectors with coordinatesu(x, 1), quad v(y, 3), quad w(10-x-y, 2)in a Cartesian coordinate system. The value of the function K(x, y) being examined is thusK(x, y)=|u|+|v|+|w|where the absolute value symbol now denotes the lengths of the individual vectors. The sum of these three vectorsa=u+v+whas coordinates a(10 ; 6), which do not depend on the variables x, y. We will show that the minimum of K(x, y) is equal to the length of the vector a, sqrt{136}.Consider the usual representation of the sum z=u+v. If the positions of u and v are different, the vectors u and v connected to each other form a triangle, in which the length of the side corresponding to the vector z is less than the sum of the lengths of the sides corresponding to the vectors u and v:|z|=|u+v|<|u|+|v| text {. }If the positions of u and v are the same, then|z|=|u|+|v| quad text { or } quad|z|=|| u|-| v||depending on whether the directions of u and v are the same or opposite. According to these, the inequality|u+v| leq|u|+|v|always holds, and equality holds if and only if the positions and directions of u and v are the same.Apply (3) to the vectors z and w:|z+w| leq|z|+|w|that is,|u+v+w| leq|u+v|+|w|According to (3), from this we get the inequality|u+v+w| leq|u+v|+|w| leq|u|+|v|+|w|The first equality holds if and only if the positions and directions of z and w are the same, and the second if and only if the positions and directions of u and v are the same. In the latter case, the position and direction of z are the same as those of u and v, so equality holds in both places if and only if the positions and directions of the vectors u, v, w are the same. According to these, for any vectors u, v, w the inequality|u+v+w| leq|u|+|w|+|w|holds, where equality holds if and only if the positions and directions of u, v, w are the same.Summarizing the results obtained, according to (1), (2), and (4)K(x, y)=|u|+|v|+|w| geq|u+v+w|=|a|=sqrt{136}Here, equality holds only if the positions and directions of u, v, w are the same as those of a, that is,u=lambda a, quad v=mu a, quad w=nu awhere lambda, mu, nu are suitable positive numbers. From the comparison of the second coordinates, it follows that lambda=1 / 6, mu=1 / 2, nu=1 / 3, so from the first coordinatesx=frac{10}{6}=frac{5}{3} ; quad y=frac{10}{2}=5Thus, the minimum of the function K(x, y) is sqrt{136}, which is attained (and only attained) at the values given in (5).II. Solution. First, fix the value of y, let it be y=y_{0}, and examine where thef(x)=Kleft(x, y_{0}right)=sqrt{x^{2}+1}+sqrt{y_{0}^{2}+9}+sqrt{x^{2}+y_{0}^{2}-20 x-20 y+2 x y_{0}+104}one-variable function attains its minimum. This function is defined everywhere, since the quantity under the third root is also definitely positivex^{2}+y_{0}^{2}-20 x-20 y_{0}+2 x y_{0}+104=left(x-10+y_{0}right)^{2}+4If the derivative of this function,f^{prime}(x)=frac{x}{sqrt{x^{2}+1}}+frac{x-10+y_{0}}{sqrt{x^{2}+y_{0}^{2}-20 x-20 y_{0}+2 x y_{0}+104}}is 0, thenx^{2}left(x^{2}+y_{0}^{2}-20 x-20 y_{0}+2 x y_{0}+104right)=left(x^{2}+1right)left(x-10+y_{0}right)^{2} .Subtracting x^{2}left(x-10+y_{0}right)^{2} from both sides of our equation, we get the equation4 x^{2}=left(x-10+y_{0}right)^{2}whose roots are either the2 x=x-10+y_{0}or the-2 x=x-10+y_{0}equation roots, that is, x=y_{0}-10 or x=left(10-y_{0}right) / 3.If y_{0}=10, then these two roots are equal. The root obtained from (7a) cannot make f^{prime}(x) 0, since in the original form of f^{prime}(x), the signs of the numerators of the two fractions are the same (and these numerators are non-zero), and the denominators are positive. Therefore, f^{prime}(x) can only be 0 at the root of the equation (7b)x_{0}=frac{10-y_{0}}{3}If y_{0}=10, then in the original form of f^{prime}(x), the numerators of both fractions are 0, so f^{prime}left(x_{0}right)=0.

If the carpet does not touch the wall overline{B C}, there is no obstacle to moving it towards that wall. Similarly, if it does not touch the wall overline{C D}, we can move it so that it touches. In other words, if a carpet of a certain radius can fit in the bathroom, it can be placed so that it touches two opposite walls.This means that the carpet of the largest radius touches the walls overline{B C} and overline{C D}. Therefore, the center of the carpet lies on the diagonal overline{A C}.Of course, the carpet of the largest radius also touches the bathtub at point F, because otherwise we can increase the size of the carpet.Let N be the foot of the perpendicular from point S to the line F G. Consider the triangle F N S and apply the Pythagorean theorem: |F N|^{2} + |S N|^{2} = |F S|^{2}.Let the radius of the circle/carpet be r. Then |F N| = |F H| - |N H| = 4.5 - r.

Now, let's first discuss the prime factors of x.If x has a prime factor p different from 2 and 5, and let p^{alpha} | x, then from the previous result, we know x mid 50 alpha, which implies p^{alpha} mid 50 alpha. Since p neq 2, 5, it follows that p^{alpha} mid alpha. However, for any prime p and positive integer alpha, we have p^{alpha} > alpha, so p^{alpha} mid alpha cannot hold. This indicates that the prime factors of x can only be 2 or 5.Thus, we can set x=2^{alpha} cdot 5^{beta} (where alpha, beta are non-negative integers). In this case, x mid 50 alpha, x mid 50 beta, so 2^{alpha} mid 50 alpha, 5^{beta} mid 50 beta. The former requires 2^{alpha-1} mid alpha, and the latter requires 5^{beta-2} mid beta. Note that when alpha geqslant 3, 2^{alpha-1} > alpha, and when beta geqslant 3, 5^{beta-2} > beta. Therefore, 0 leqslant alpha leqslant 2, 0 leqslant beta leqslant 2.

Mark points X^{prime} and Y^{prime} on line M N such that X^{prime} M = M A and Y^{prime} N = N A (see Fig. 1). Note that the length of segment X^{prime} Y^{prime} is also equal to half the perimeter of triangle A B C, i.e., A P = X^{prime} Y^{prime}. Since X^{prime} M = M A, it follows that M P = M Y^{prime}.

Similarly, point Q lies on gamma, so gamma is circumscribed around triangle P A Q. Therefore, X^{prime} = X, Y^{prime} = Y, and X Y = 1 / 2.Solution 2. Mark point I - the center of circle omega. Since angle A P I = angle A Q I = 90^{circ}, points A, P, I, Q lie on the same circle gamma, constructed on segment A I as the diameter. Let M and N be the midpoints of segments A B and A C respectively, and X^{prime} and Y^{prime} be the points of intersection of lines B I and C I with line M N respectively. We will prove that X^{prime} and Y^{prime} lie on gamma.Note that angles P B I and M B X^{prime} are equal as vertical angles, and angles C B I and M X^{prime} B are equal because lines B C and M N are parallel. Since B I is the angle bisector of angle P B C, angle M B X^{prime} = angle M X^{prime} B, so triangle B M X^{prime} is isosceles and B M = M X^{prime}. In triangle A B X^{prime}, median X^{prime} M is equal to half the side, so this triangle is right-angled with a right angle at X^{prime}. Thus, angle A X^{prime} I = 90^{circ}, so X^{prime} lies on gamma, hence X^{prime} = X. Similarly, triangle A C Y^{prime} is right-angled and Y^{prime} = Y. Then X Y = X M + M N + N Y = 1 / 2.Remark. Essentially, the solution proves the known fact that the projection of vertex A onto the bisector of an internal or external angle lies on the midline of the triangle.Solution 3.

Since x is positive, x = c. Similarly, y = b. Therefore, X Y = a + b + c = 1 / 2.Solution 4. As in the second solution, note that circle gamma is constructed on A I as the diameter. Let omega^{prime} be the image of circle omega under a homothety with center A and coefficient 1 / 2. Since A I is the diameter of gamma, circles gamma and omega^{prime} have a common center.Under the same homothety, triangle A B C transforms into triangle A M N, so omega^{prime} will be tangent to lines A P, A Q, and X Y. Thus, X Y, A P, and A Q are three chords of circle gamma that are tangent to the concentric circle omega^{prime}. Therefore, their lengths are equal.

Solution:# Part (1)First, we find the derivative of f(x):begin{align*}f'(x) &= frac{d}{dx}left(aln x + (x-3)^2right) &= frac{a}{x} + 2(x-3) &= frac{2x^2 - 6x + a}{x}end{align*}At x=1, the derivative f'(1) and the function value f(1) are:begin{align*}f'(1) &= frac{2(1)^2 - 6(1) + a}{1} = a - 4 f(1) &= aln(1) + (1-3)^2 = 4end{align*}The tangent line at x=1 can be written as:begin{align*}y - f(1) &= f'(1)(x - 1) y - 4 &= (a - 4)(x - 1) y &= (4 - a)x + a - 8end{align*}Comparing this with the given tangent line equation x + y + b = 0, we get:begin{align*}4 - a &= 1 a - 8 &= bend{align*}Solving these equations gives us:begin{align*}a &= 3 b &= -5end{align*}Therefore, the values of a and b are boxed{a = 3} and boxed{b = -5}.# Part (2)For f(x) to have two critical points, the derivative f'(x) = frac{2x^2 - 6x + a}{x} must have two distinct real roots in (0, +infty). This implies:begin{align*}2x^2 - 6x + a &= 0 text{ has two distinct real roots.}end{align*}For two distinct real roots, the discriminant Delta must be greater than 0:begin{align*}Delta &= 36 - 8a > 0 36 - 8a &> 0 8a & 0 a &> 0end{align*}Combining these conditions, we find the range of a to be:begin{align*}0 < a < frac{9}{2}end{align*}Therefore, the range of real numbers for a is boxed{(0, frac{9}{2})}."},{"problem":"A student scored 85, 67, m, 80, and 93 in five exams (in points), where m > 0.

Determine the smallest value of frac{4s^2+t^2}{5st} and when this minimum is achieved.","solution":"1. Given: (ABCD) is a quadrilateral circumscribed in a circle (k), with ([ACB] = s) and ([ACD] = t), where (s < t). We need to determine the smallest value of (frac{4s^2 + t^2}{5st}).2. Inequality Analysis: We start by analyzing the expression (frac{4s^2 + t^2}{5st}). To find the minimum value, we use the inequality (4s^2 + t^2 geq 4st). This inequality can be derived from the fact that the sum of squares is always greater than or equal to twice the product of the terms, i.e., (a^2 + b^2 geq 2ab).3. Applying the Inequality:   [   4s^2 + t^2 geq 4st   ]   Dividing both sides by (5st):   [   frac{4s^2 + t^2}{5st} geq frac{4st}{5st} = frac{4}{5}   ]4. Example to Achieve Minimum: To show that the minimum value of (frac{4}{5}) can be achieved, consider a specific configuration of the quadrilateral (ABCD). Let (|AB| = |BC| = 1) and (|CD| = |DA| = sqrt{2}), with (angle ADC = angle ABC = frac{pi}{2}).5. Verification Using Ptolemy's Theorem: Ptolemy's theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD), the sum of the products of its two pairs of opposite sides is equal to the product of its diagonals:   [   |AB| cdot |CD| + |BC| cdot |DA| = |AC| cdot |BD|   ]   Substituting the given lengths:   [   1 cdot sqrt{2} + 1 cdot sqrt{2} = |AC| cdot |BD|   ]   [   2sqrt{2} = |AC| cdot |BD|   ]   Since (|AC| = sqrt{2}) (diagonal of a square with side 1), we get:   [   |BD| = frac{2sqrt{2}}{sqrt{2}} = 2   ]6. Angles and Areas: Given (angle ADC = angle ABC = frac{pi}{2}), the areas ([ACB]) and ([ACD]) can be calculated using the right triangle properties. For (triangle ACB):   [   s = frac{1}{2} cdot |AB| cdot |BC| cdot sin(angle ABC) = frac{1}{2} cdot 1 cdot 1 cdot 1 = frac{1}{2}   ]   For (triangle ACD):   [   t = frac{1}{2} cdot |AC| cdot |CD| cdot sin(angle ACD) = frac{1}{2} cdot sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{2} cdot 1 = 1   ]7. Substituting into the Expression:   [   frac{4s^2 + t^2}{5st} = frac{4 left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 + 1^2}{5 cdot frac{1}{2} cdot 1} = frac{4 cdot frac{1}{4} + 1}{frac{5}{2}} = frac{1 + 1}{frac{5}{2}} = frac{2}{frac{5}{2}} = frac{2 cdot 2}{5} = frac{4}{5}   ]Thus, the minimum value of (frac{4s^2 + t^2}{5st}) is indeed (frac{4}{5}), and it is achieved when (|AB| = |BC| = 1), (|CD| = |DA| = sqrt{2}), and (angle ADC = angle ABC = frac{pi}{2}).The final answer is (boxed{frac{4}{5}})."},{"problem":"Given sinleft( frac{pi}{3} + a right) = frac{5}{13}, and a in left( frac{pi}{6}, frac{2pi}{3} right), the value of sinleft( frac{pi}{12} + a right) is (　　)A: frac{17sqrt{2}}{26}B: frac{-7sqrt{2}}{26}C: -frac{17sqrt{2}}{26}D: frac{7sqrt{2}}{26}","solution":"Since sinleft( frac{pi}{3} + a right) = frac{5}{13}, and a in left( frac{pi}{6}, frac{2pi}{3} right), it follows that cosleft(a + frac{pi}{3}right) = -sqrt{1 - sin^2left(a + frac{pi}{3}right)} = -frac{12}{13}.Then, sinleft( frac{pi}{12} + a right) = sinleft[left(a + frac{pi}{3}right) - frac{pi}{4}right] = sinleft( frac{pi}{3} + a right)cosfrac{pi}{4} - cosleft( frac{pi}{3} + a right)sinfrac{pi}{4}= frac{5}{13} cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} + frac{12}{13} cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{17sqrt{2}}{26},Therefore, the correct choice is: boxed{A}.This problem mainly tests the basic relationship between trigonometric functions of the same angle and the application of the sine formula for the sum of two angles, and is considered a basic question."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=begin{cases} 1-|x|, & xleq 1 x^2-4x+3, & x > 1 end{cases}, if f(f(m))geq 0, then the range of m is (    )  A: left[ -2,2 right]  B: left[ -2,2right) cup left(4,+infty right]  C: left[ -2,2+sqrt{2} right]  D: left[ -2,2+sqrt{2}right) cup left(4,+infty right]","solution":"By plotting the graph of the function f(x), as shown,  it is known that because f(f(m))geq 0,  so -1leq f(m)leq 1 or f(m)geq 3,  from 1-|x|=-1, we get x=2 or -2,  from x^2-4x+3=1, we find x=2pm2sqrt{2},  from x^2-4x+3=3, we find x=0 or x=4,  then, from the graph, we can determine that -2leq mleq 2+2sqrt{2} or mgeq 4.

Line segments APD, BPE, and CPF are drawn with D on BC, E on AC, and F on AB (see the figure below). Given that AP=6, BP=9, PD=6, PE=3, and CF=20, find the area of triangle ABC.[AIME 1989 Problem 15.png](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:AIME_1989_Problem_15.png)","solution":"Solution 1 (Ceva's Theorem, Stewart's Theorem)Let [RST] be the area of polygon RST.  We'll make use of the following fact: if P is a point in the interior of triangle XYZ, and line XP intersects line YZ at point L, then dfrac{XP}{PL} = frac{[XPY] + [ZPX]}{[YPZ]}.This is true because triangles XPY and YPL have their areas in ratio XP:PL (as they share a common height from Y), and the same is true of triangles ZPY and LPZ.We'll also use the related fact that dfrac{[XPY]}{[ZPX]} = dfrac{YL}{LZ}.  This is slightly more well known, as it is used in the standard proof of [Ceva's theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Ceva%27s_theorem).Now we'll apply these results to the problem at hand.Since AP = PD = 6, this means that [APB] + [APC] = [BPC]; thus triangle BPC has half the area of triangle ABC.  And since PE = 3 = dfrac{1}{3}BP, we can conclude that triangle APC has one third of the combined areas of triangle BPC and APB, and thus dfrac{1}{4} of the area of triangle ABC.  This means that triangle APB is left with dfrac{1}{4} of the area of triangle ABC:[[BPC]: [APC]: [APB] = 2:1:1.]Since [APC] = [APB], and since dfrac{[APC]}{[APB]} = dfrac{CD}{DB}, this means that D is the midpoint of BC.Furthermore, we know that dfrac{CP}{PF} = dfrac{[APC] + [BPC]}{[APB]} = 3, so CP = dfrac{3}{4} cdot CF = 15.We now apply [Stewart's theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Stewart%27s_theorem) to segment PD in triangle BPC—or rather, the simplified version for a median.  This tells us that[2 BD^2 + 2 PD^2 = BP^2+ CP^2.] Plugging in we know, we learn thatbegin{align*} 2 BD^2 + 2 cdot 36 &= 81 + 225 = 306,  BD^2 &= 117. end{align*}Happily, BP^2 + PD^2 = 81 + 36 is also equal to 117.  Therefore triangle BPD is a right triangle with a right angle at B; its area is thus dfrac{1}{2} cdot 9 cdot 6 = 27.  As PD is a median of triangle BPC, the area of BPC is twice this, or 54.  And we already know that triangle BPC has half the area of triangle ABC, which must therefore be boxed{108}.Solution 2 (Mass Points, Stewart's Theorem, Heron's Formula)Because we're given three concurrent [cevians](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Cevian) and their lengths, it seems very tempting to apply [Mass points](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Mass_points). We immediately see that w_E = 3, w_B = 1, and w_A = w_D = 2. Now, we recall that the masses on the three sides of the triangle must be balanced out, so w_C = 1 and w_F = 3. Thus, CP = 15 and PF = 5. Recalling that w_C = w_B = 1, we see that DC = DB and DP is a [median](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Median) to BC in triangle BCP. Applying [Stewart's Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Stewart%27s_Theorem), BC^2 + 12^2 = 2(15^2 + 9^2), and BC = 6sqrt {13}. Now notice that 2[BCP] = [ABC], because both triangles share the same base and the h_{triangle ABC} = 2h_{triangle BCP}. Applying [Heron's formula](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Heron%27s_formula) on triangle BCP with sides 15, 9, and 6sqrt{13}, [BCP] = 54 and [ABC] = boxed{108}.Solution 3 (Ceva's Theorem, Stewart's Theorem)Using a different form of [Ceva's Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Ceva%27s_Theorem), we have frac {y}{x + y} + frac {6}{6 + 6} + frac {3}{3 + 9} = 1Longleftrightarrowfrac {y}{x + y} = frac {1}{4}Solving 4y = x + y and x + y = 20, we obtain x = CP = 15 and y = FP = 5.Let Q be the point on AB such that FC parallel QD.Since AP = PD and FPparallel QD, QD = 2FP = 10. (Stewart's Theorem)Also, since FCparallel QD and QD = frac{FC}{2}, we see that FQ = QB, BD = DC, etc. ([Stewart's Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Stewart%27s_Theorem))Similarly, we have PR = RB (= frac12PB = 7.5) and thus RD = frac12PC = 4.5.PDR is a 3-4-5 [right triangle](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Right_triangle), so angle PDR (angle ADQ) is 90^circ.Therefore, the area of triangle ADQ = frac12cdot 12cdot 6 = 36.Using area ratio, triangle ABC = triangle ADBtimes 2 = left(triangle ADQtimes frac32right)times 2 = 36cdot 3 = boxed{108}.Solution 4 (Stewart's Theorem)First, let [AEP]=a, [AFP]=b, and [ECP]=c. Thus, we can easily find that frac{[AEP]}{[BPD]}=frac{3}{9}=frac{1}{3} Leftrightarrow [BPD]=3[AEP]=3a. Now, frac{[ABP]}{[BPD]}=frac{6}{6}=1Leftrightarrow [ABP]=3a. In the same manner, we find that [CPD]=a+c. Now, we can find that frac{[BPC]}{[PEC]}=frac{9}{3}=3 Leftrightarrow frac{(3a)+(a+c)}{c}=3 Leftrightarrow c=2a. We can now use this to find that frac{[APC]}{[AFP]}=frac{[BPC]}{[BFP]}=frac{PC}{FP} Leftrightarrow frac{3a}{b}=frac{6a}{3a-b} Leftrightarrow a=b. Plugging this value in, we find that frac{FC}{FP}=3 Leftrightarrow PC=15, FP=5. Now, since frac{[AEP]}{[PEC]}=frac{a}{2a}=frac{1}{2}, we can find that 2AE=EC. Setting AC=b, we can apply [Stewart's Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Stewart%27s_Theorem) on triangle APC to find that (15)(15)(frac{b}{3})+(6)(6)(frac{2b}{3})=(frac{2b}{3})(frac{b}{3})(b)+(b)(3)(3). Solving, we find that b=sqrt{405} Leftrightarrow AE=frac{b}{3}=sqrt{45}. But, 3^2+6^2=45, meaning that angle{APE}=90 Leftrightarrow [APE]=frac{(6)(3)}{2}=9=a. Since [ABC]=a+a+2a+2a+3a+3a=12a=(12)(9)=108, we conclude that the answer is boxed{108}.Solution 5 (Mass of a Point, Stewart's Theorem, Heron's Formula)Firstly, since they all meet at one single point, denoting the mass of them separately. Assuming M(A)=6;M(D)=6;M(B)=3;M(E)=9; we can get that M(P)=12;M(F)=9;M(C)=3; which leads to the ratio between segments, [frac{CE}{AE}=2;frac{BF}{AF}=2;frac{BD}{CD}=1.] Denoting that CE=2x;AE=x; AF=y; BF=2y; CD=z; DB=z.Now we know three cevians' length, Applying Stewart theorem to them, getting three different equations:begin{align} (3x)^2 cdot 2y+(2z)^2 cdot y&=(3y)(2y^2+400),  (3y)^2 cdot z+(3x)^2 cdot z&=(2z)(z^2+144),  (2z)^2 cdot x+(3y)^2 cdot x&=(3x)(2x^2+144). end{align}After solving the system of equation, we get that x=3sqrt{5};y=sqrt{13};z=3sqrt{13};pulling x,y,z back to get the length of AC=9sqrt{5};AB=3sqrt{13};BC=6sqrt{13}; now we can apply Heron's formula here, which is [sqrtfrac{(9sqrt{5}+9sqrt{13})(9sqrt{13}-9sqrt{5})(9sqrt{5}+3sqrt{13})(9sqrt{5}-3sqrt{13})}{16}=108.]Our answer is boxed{108}.~bluesoulNote (how to find x and y without the system of equations)To ease computation, we can apply Stewart's Theorem to find x, y, and z directly. Since M(C)=3 and M(F)=9, overline{PC}=15 and overline{PF}=5. We can apply Stewart's Theorem on triangle CPE to get (2x+x)(2x cdot x) + 3^2 cdot 3x = 15^2 cdot x + 6^2cdot 2x. Solving, we find that x=3sqrt{5}. We can do the same on triangle APB and triangle BPC to obtain y and z. We proceed with Heron's Formula as the solution states. ~kn07Solution 6 (easier version of Solution 5)In Solution 5, instead of finding all of x, y, z, we only need y, z. This is because after we solve for y, z, we can notice that triangle BAD is isosceles with AB = BD. Because P is the midpoint of the base, BP is an altitude of triangle BAD. Therefore, [BAD] = frac{(AD)(BP)}{2} = frac{12 cdot 9}{2} = 54. Using the same altitude property, we can find that [ABC] = 2[BAD] = 2 cdot 54 = boxed{108}.-NL008Solution 7 (Mass Points, Stewart's Theorem, Simple Version)Set AF=x, and use [mass points](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Mass_points) to find that PF=5 and BF=2x. Using [Stewart's Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Stewart%27s_Theorem) on APB, we find that AB=3sqrt{13}. Then we notice that APB is right, which means the area of APB is 27. Because CF=4cdot PF, the area of ABC is 4 times the area of APB, which means the area of ABC=4cdot 27=boxed{108}.Solution 8 (Ratios, Auxiliary Lines and 3-4-5 triangle)We try to solve this using only elementary concepts. Let the areas of triangles BCP, ACP and ABP be X, Y and Z respectively. Then frac{X}{Y+Z}=frac{6}{6}=1 and frac{Y}{X+Z}=frac{3}{9}=frac{1}{3}. Hence frac{X}{2}=Y=Z. Similarly frac{FP}{PC}=frac{Z}{X+Y}=frac{1}{3} and since CF=20 we then have FP=5. Additionally we now see that triangles FPE and CPB are similar, so FE parallel BC and frac{FE}{BC} = frac{1}{3}. Hence frac{AF}{FB}=frac{1}{2}. Now construct a point K on segment BP such that BK=6 and KP=3, we will have FK parallel AP, and hence frac{FK}{AP} = frac{FK}{6} = frac{2}{3}, giving FK=4. Triangle FKP is therefore a 3-4-5 triangle! So FK perp BE and so AP perp BE. Then it is easy to calculate that Z = frac{1}{2} times 6 times 9 = 27 and the area of triangle ABC = X+Y+Z = 4Z = 4 times 27 = boxed{108}.~LeoleSolution 9 (Just Trig Bash)We start with mass points as in Solution 2, and receive BF:AF = 2, BD:CD = 1, CE:AE = 2. [Law of Cosines](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Law_of_Cosines) on triangles ADB and ADC with theta = angle ADB and BD=DC=x gives[36+x^2-12xcos theta = 81][36+x^2-12xcos (180-theta) = 36+x^2+12xcos theta = 225]Adding them: 72+2x^2=306 implies x=3sqrt{13}, so BC = 6sqrt{13}. Similarly, AB = 3sqrt{13} and AC = 9sqrt{5}. Using Heron's,[[ triangle ABC ]= sqrt{left(dfrac{9sqrt{13}+9sqrt{5}}{2}right)left(dfrac{9sqrt{13}09sqrt{5}}{2}right)left(dfrac{3sqrt{13}+9sqrt{5}}{2}right)left(dfrac{-3sqrt{13}+9sqrt{5}}{2}right)} = boxed{108}.]~sml1809"},{"problem":"Condition of the problemFind the derivative of the specified order.y=left(1+x^{2}right) operatorname{arctg} x, y^{prime prime prime}=?","solution":"## Solutiony^{prime}=left(left(1+x^{2}right) operatorname{arctg} xright)^{prime}=2 x cdot operatorname{arctg} x+left(1+x^{2}right) cdot frac{1}{1+x^{2}}==2 x cdot operatorname{arctg} x+1y^{prime prime}=left(y^{prime}right)^{prime}=(2 x cdot operatorname{arctg} x+1)^{prime}=2 operatorname{arctg} x+2 x cdot frac{1}{1+x^{2}}==2 operatorname{arctg} x+frac{2 x}{1+x^{2}}y^{prime prime prime}=left(y^{prime prime}right)^{prime}=left(2 operatorname{arctg} x+frac{2 x}{1+x^{2}}right)^{prime}=frac{2}{1+x^{2}}+frac{2 cdotleft(1+x^{2}right)-2 x cdot 2 x}{left(1+x^{2}right)^{2}}==frac{2left(1+x^{2}right)}{left(1+x^{2}right)^{2}}+frac{2+2 x^{2}-4 x^{2}}{left(1+x^{2}right)^{2}}=frac{4+4 x^{2}-4 x^{2}}{left(1+x^{2}right)^{2}}=frac{4}{left(1+x^{2}right)^{2}}Problem Kuznetsov Differentiation 19-10"},{"problem":"3.

We ask the question: \\"Is the number greater than 50000?\\". Regardless of the answer, we reduce the number of remaining possible options by half. Thus, after the first question, there are no more than 50000 possible options for the phone number. If the answer to the first question is \\"yes,\\" we ask: \\"Is the number greater than 75000?\\". After the answer to this question, no more than 25000 options remain. And so on - if after the n-th question, k possible options remain, we can ask the (n+1)-th question in such a way that after the answer, no more than [k/2]+1 possible options remain. Thus, we get the following dependence of the number of remaining possible options on the number of questions asked: After the first question - 50000 options, after the 2nd - 25000, 3rd - 12500, 4th - 6250, 5th - 3125, 6th - 1563, 7th - 782, 8th - 391, 9th - 196, 10th - 98, 11th - 59, 12th - 30, 13th - 15, 14th - 8, 15th - 4, 16th - 2, 17th - 1.

Therefore, at least two phone number options will correspond to some sequence of answers, meaning that if the desired number is any of these two numbers, the sequences of answers will be the same, i.e., it will not be possible to determine the number uniquely.## Answer17 questions.Santa Claus has an infinite number of candies.

If C is the midpoint of segment AB, then overrightarrow{AC} = frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{AB}, thus lambda = frac{1}{2}, mu = 0, which is not possible, so option A is incorrect;  Similarly, if D is the midpoint of segment AB, then overrightarrow{AD} = frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{AB}, thus lambda = 0, mu = frac{1}{2}, which is not possible, so option B is incorrect;  If C and D are both on segment AB, then 0  2, which contradicts frac{1}{lambda} + frac{1}{mu} = 2, so option C is incorrect;  If C and D cannot both be on the extension line of AB,  assume M and N are both on the extension line of AB,  then lambda > 1, mu > 1, thus frac{1}{lambda} + frac{1}{mu} < 2, which contradicts frac{1}{lambda} + frac{1}{mu} = 2,  hence the assumption is not valid, so C and D cannot both be on the extension line of AB, thus option D is correct.

Clearly, the number of such strings is 2^{9}=512 (for each of the 9 symbols in the string, there are two possibilities - to be a plus or a minus). It remains to show that this correspondence is one-to-one, i.e., the permutation is uniquely restored from the string of pluses and minuses. Indeed, let at the beginning of the string there are mathrm{n}_{1} minuses (possibly, mathrm{n}_{1}=0), and then a plus, then mathrm{n}_{2} minuses, then a plus, and so on. Then the permutation must start with a group of mathrm{n}_{1}+1 numbers in a row in descending order, followed by a new group of mathrm{n}_{2}+1 numbers in a row in descending order, and so on. At the same time, the first number of the second group must be greater than the last number of the first group. Since the first and second groups contain different numbers, this means that each number of the second group is greater than each number of the first group. Similarly, each number of the third group is greater than each number of the second group, and so on. The above reasoning allows us to uniquely restore the permutation (while using the fact that each of the numbers 1,2, ldots, 10 must appear in the permutation); the permutation has the form: mathrm{n}_{1}+1, mathrm{n}_{1}, ldots, 1, mathrm{n}_{1}+mathrm{n}_{2}+2, mathrm{n}_{1}+mathrm{n}_{2}+1, ldots, mathrm{n}_{1}+2, ldots (The numbers in the permutation are arranged in \\"steps\\" of lengths mathrm{n}_{1}+1, mathrm{n}_{2}+1, ldots of consecutive numbers in descending order.)## Answer2^{9}=512."},{"problem":"12.

On the sides B C and C D of the square A B C D, points M and K are marked respectively such that angle B A M = angle C K M = 30^{circ}. Find angle A K D.","solution":"Answer: 75^{circ}.Solution. From the condition of the problem, it follows that angle B M A=angle C M K=60^{circ}, and then angle A M K=60^{circ} (see Fig. 8.5a). Further reasoning can be done in different ways.First method. Let A H be the perpendicular from vertex A to M K. Then the right triangles A M B and A M H are equal by hypotenuse and acute angle, from which A H=A B. Using this equality, we get that the right triangles A K H and A K D are equal by hypotenuse and leg. Therefore, angle A K D=frac{1}{2} angle M K D=frac{150^{circ}}{2}=75^{circ}.In the given reasoning, it is used that point H lies on the segment M K, and not on its extension beyond point K. This is indeed the case, otherwise A H would intersect side C D at point X, but then A H>A X>A D, which contradicts the equality A H=A D. For the lack of this explanation, the student's grade should not be reduced.Second method. The diagonal C A of the square is the bisector of the internal angle of triangle C M K, and the ray M A is the bisector of its external angle, so vertex A is the center of the excircle of this triangle. Therefore, K A is also the bisector of the external angle of triangle C M K, so angle A K D=frac{1}{2} angle M K D=75^{circ}.Third method. Extend the segment K M to intersect the line A B at point P (see Fig. 8.5b). Then angle P M B=angle C M K=angle A M B. Therefore, the right triangles P M B and A M B are equal (by leg and acute angle), then P B=A B, that is, A P=2 a, where a is the side of the given square, and P M=A M.By the property of the leg opposite the 30^{circ} angle in a right triangle, A M=2 B M and M K=2 M C. Therefore, P K=P M+M K=2(B M+M C)=2 B C=2 a.Thus, triangle A P K is isosceles with an angle of 30^{circ} at vertex P, so its angle at the base is 75^{circ}.

Also, let T(0 ; b) be the point of intersection of the given line with the ordinate axis, and C be the point of intersection of the circle with the ordinate axis, different from O.Triangle Q O C is isosceles (Q O=Q C as radii), and Q T is its height, thus Q T is also a median, C T=O T, so the point C has coordinates (0 ; 2 b). Drop a perpendicular A H from point A to the ordinate axis. Then angle T A H is the angle of inclination of the line, its tangent is frac{5}{12}.

A number has an odd number of divisors if and only if it is a perfect square. This is because the divisors of a number usually come in pairs, except when the number is a perfect square (where one of the divisors is repeated).1.

An isosceles triangle has at least two sides that are equal in length.Case 1: The base is 6.  In this case, the two equal sides must be 9. For a triangle to exist, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Thus, we check if 6 + 6 > 9. This inequality does not hold, which means a triangle cannot be formed with 6 as the base and two sides of length 9. This case is incorrectly considered in the standard solution; the correct approach is to note that a triangle can still be formed with two sides of 9 and a base of 6, but the inequality to check for triangle formation was misapplied.Corrected Case 1:The perimeter in this case is calculated as 6 + 9 + 9 = 24.Case 2: The base is 9.  Here, the two equal sides are 6. To form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. We check if 6 + 6 > 9. This inequality holds, meaning a triangle can indeed be formed with 9 as the base and two sides of length 6.The perimeter in this case is calculated as:[9 + 6 + 6 = 21]Therefore, based on the corrected analysis and the original consideration, the perimeter of the triangle can be either 21 or 24. However, given the mistake in the initial case analysis, the correct interpretation should reflect that a triangle can indeed be formed in both cases, leading to two possible perimeters.Thus, the final answer, considering the corrected understanding and the original solution's intent, is:[boxed{21 text{ or } 24}]"},{"problem":"A total of n people were asked a question in a survey.

What is the smallest possible value of n ?","solution":"Let Y denote the number of people who answered \\"yes\\" and let N denote the number of people who answered \\"no\\".The number of people is n, so n=Y+N. As well, since 76 % of respondents said \\"yes\\", we have that frac{76}{100}=frac{Y}{n}=frac{Y}{Y+N}.The equation frac{76}{100}=frac{Y}{Y+N} implies 76 Y+76 N=100 Y which can be rearranged to 76 N=24 Y. Dividing both sides by 4 gives 19 N=6 Y.Since Y and N are numbers of people, they are non-negative integers. Furthermore, since a non-zero percentage of people responded with each of \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\", they must be positive integers.Therefore, the equation 19 N=6 Y implies that Y is a positive multiple of 19 since 6 and 19 do not have any positive factors in common other than 1.The smallest that Y can be is 19 , and if Y=19, then N=frac{(6)(19)}{19}=6.If Y=19 and N=6, then n=25, which means frac{Y}{n}=frac{19}{25}=0.76 and frac{N}{n}=frac{6}{25}=0.24.Therefore, Y=19 and N=6 satisfy the conditions, and we have already argued that Y cannot be any smaller.If Y is greater than 19, then n is greater than 2(19)=38 since Y must be a positive multiple of 19.

The area of one such shape is:   [   text{Area of one shape} = frac{2^2}{2} cdot sin(30^circ) - frac{1}{2} cdot (sqrt{3} - 1)^2 = 2 cdot frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2} cdot (3 - 2sqrt{3} + 1) = 1 - frac{1}{2} cdot (4 - 2sqrt{3}) = 1 - 2 + sqrt{3} = sqrt{3} - 1   ]   Since there are 4 such shapes, the total area of these shapes is:   [   4 times (sqrt{3} - 1) = 4sqrt{3} - 4   ]7. Summing Up the Areas:   The total area Terry can roam is the sum of the areas of the sectors and the triangular regions:   [   text{Total area} = frac{8pi}{3} + 4sqrt{3} - 4   ]8.

Thus, the equation of ellipse E becomes:x^2 + 3y^2 = 4.Because AB parallel l and AB passes through the point (0, 0), the equation of the line containing AB is y = x.Let us denote the coordinates of points A and B as (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) respectively.Solving the system begin{cases}x^2 + 3y^2 = 4  y = x end{cases}, we get x = pm1.Therefore, the length of AB is:|AB| = sqrt{2}|x_1 - x_2| = 2sqrt{2}.  Since the height h of triangle ABC on the side AB is equal to the distance from the origin to line l, we have h = sqrt{2}.Thus, the area of triangle ABC is:boxed{S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2} |AB| cdot h = 2}.(2) Let's assume the equation of the line containing AB is y = x + m.By solving the system begin{cases} x^2 + 3y^2 = 4  y = x + m end{cases}, we get a quadratic equation:4x^2 + 6mx + 3m^2 - 4 = 0.Since points A and B are on the ellipse, the discriminant of the equation must be positive:Delta = -12m^2 + 64 > 0.Let's denote the coordinates of points A and B as (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) respectively.Then we have:x_1 + x_2 = -frac{3m}{2}, quad x_1x_2 = frac{3m^2 - 4}{4}.  So, the length of AB is:|AB| = sqrt{2}|x_1 - x_2| = frac{sqrt{32 - 6m^2}}{2}.Also, the length of BC is equal to the distance of point (0, m) to the line l, which gives us |BC| = frac{|2 - m|}{sqrt{2}}.Thus, the square of the length of AC is:|AC|^2 = |AB|^2 + |BC|^2 = -m^2 - 2m + 10 = -(m + 1)^2 + 11.Therefore, when m = -1, the length of AC is the longest, and at this point, the discriminant is Delta = -12 + 64 > 0.At that time, the equation of the line containing AB is:boxed{y = x - 1}."},{"problem":"1.

Therefore, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the value of a:- Sum of roots = 1 + 2 = 3 = -a implies a = -3.So, the function becomes f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2. To find the solution set of f(x) geqslant 1 - x^2, we set up the inequality:[x^2 - 3x + 2 geqslant 1 - x^2]Simplifying this gives:[2x^2 - 3x + 1 geqslant 0]Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:[(2x - 1)(x - 1) geqslant 0]Solving this inequality, we find that x geqslant 1 or x leqslant frac{1}{2}.

Differentiating h(x) gives:[h'(x) = frac{x^2 - 4x + 2}{(x - 2)^2}]Setting h'(x) = 0 to find critical points, we solve:[x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0 implies x = 2 - sqrt{2}]Analyzing the sign of h'(x), we find that h(x) is increasing on [-1, 2 - sqrt{2}) and decreasing on (2 - sqrt{2}, 1]. Thus, the minimum value of h(x) within the interval [-1,1] occurs at x = -1, which is h(-1) = frac{1}{3}.

Two players take turns. The first player, on their turn, \\"places\\" no more than 17 chips on the board, one on any free cell (they can take all 17 from the pile, or part of them - from the pile, and part - by moving them on the board). The second player removes any series of chips from the board (a series is several chips standing next to each other, i.e., without any free cells between them) and puts them back into the pile. The first player wins if they manage to place all the chips in a row without gaps.a) Prove that for n=98 the first player can always win.b) For what largest n can the first player always win?","solution":"a) Let's outline the strategy of the first player. Initially, he builds 12 series of 8 chips each, such that adjacent series are separated by one space, sequentially restoring a removed series and adding another. Then, after restoring the configuration following the second player's move, he inserts two chips into the outermost spaces, resulting in the configuration 17,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,17.For any move by the second player, the first player's next move will be to build a continuous row. Specifically: if the second player removes an outer series, the first player inserts eight chips into the spaces between the series and adds the remaining nine chips to the edge; if the second player removes a middle series (of length 8), the first player's move will be to restore this series (eight chips) and fill the spaces between the series (another nine chips).b) Suppose there are n geq 98 chips, and the first player always wins. Consider the configuration after the second-to-last move of the first player. In this configuration, there are several series separated by one or more spaces, and p chips in a pile. Each series contains no more than 17 chips; otherwise, the second player would remove such a series, and the first player would not be able to place all the chips on the next move.In response to the removal of any series, the first player can only: (a) restore the removed series, then fill all the spaces with chips from the pile and the outer series (or several outer series) or (b) move all the chips on one side of the removed series into the spaces between the series on the other side, adding the remaining chips to the edge. We will call a series \\"middle\\" if the response to its removal is method (a), \\"left\\" if method (b) and the chips are moved to the right, and \\"right\\" if method (b) and the chips are moved to the left. Clearly, if the removal of an outer series can be responded to with method (a), it can also be responded to with method (b); we will assume that the first player responds with method (b), so there are always left and right series. Additionally, if a series is right, then all series to its left allow a response with method (b) by moving to the left. We will assume that the first player responds in this manner. Therefore, right series are the several outermost series on the right. Similarly for left series.Note that the left series and the pile together contain no more than 17 chips: all the chips in the left series and the chips in the pile need to be placed or moved when the rightmost left series is removed (analogously for right series).Suppose there are k middle series. If one of them contains m chips, then m+k+1 leq 17, since when this series is removed, it is necessary to restore m chips and fill at least k+1 spaces between the series, hence m leq 16-k. Therefore, n leq p+2(17-p)+k(16-k).The maximum of this expression is achieved when p=0 and k=8, which gives n leq 98.## Answerb) For n=98."},{"problem":"If the ratio of the surface areas of two spheres is 4:9, then the ratio of their volumes is __________.","solution":"Let's denote the radii of the two spheres as R and r respectively. The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula 4pi R^2 for a sphere with radius R, and similarly 4pi r^2 for a sphere with radius r. Given that the ratio of their surface areas is 4:9, we can write the following proportion:[ 4pi R^2 : 4pi r^2 = 4 : 9 ]We can cancel out the common factor of 4pi from the ratio:[ R^2 : r^2 = 4 : 9 ]Taking the square root of both sides, we find the ratio of the radii:[ R : r = sqrt{4} : sqrt{9} = 2 : 3 ]The volume of a sphere is given by the formula frac{4}{3}pi R^3. The ratio of the volumes of the two spheres can thus be written as:[ frac{4}{3}pi R^3 : frac{4}{3}pi r^3 ]Using the ratio of the radii, which is R : r = 2 : 3, we raise this ratio to the third power to find the ratio of the volumes:[ (R : r)^3 = (2 : 3)^3 = 2^3 : 3^3 = 8 : 27 ]So, the ratio of the volumes of the two spheres is boxed{8 : 27}."},{"problem":"Two workers, A and B, completed a task assigned to them as follows. First, only A worked for frac{2}{3} of the time it would take B to complete the entire task alone. Then, B took over from A and finished the work. In this way, the work took 2 hours longer than if they had started working together and completed it collaboratively. If they had worked together in the latter manner, A would have done half as much work as B actually left for B to complete. How many hours would it take for A and B to complete the work individually?","solution":"I. Solution: Let the given work be a unit. Suppose thatA would complete the work in x hours, so in 1 hour frac{1}{x} work is done,B would complete the work in y hours, so in 1 hour frac{1}{y} work is done.Together, therefore, in 1 hour frac{1}{x}+frac{1}{y}=frac{x+y}{x y} work is done, so the entire work would be completed in 1: frac{x+y}{x y}=frac{x y}{x+y} hours together.A worked for frac{2}{3} y hours, and during this time frac{2 y}{3} cdot frac{1}{x}=frac{2 y}{3 x} work was done, and B was left with 1-frac{2 y}{3 x}=frac{3 x-2 y}{3 x} work.If they worked together, A would have done frac{x y}{x+y} cdot frac{1}{x}=frac{y}{x+y} work in frac{x y}{x+y} hours, and according to the problem, this is half of the work A actually left for B, that is,frac{2 y}{x+y}=frac{3 x-2 y}{3 x}B completed the work left for him in y cdot frac{3 x-2 y}{3 x}=frac{3 x y-2 y^{2}}{3 x} hours. According to the problem, the sum of the working hours of A and B working one after the other exceeds the working time in which they would complete the work together by 2 hours. Therefore,frac{2 y}{3}+frac{3 x y-2 y^{2}}{3 x}=frac{x y}{x+y}+2Rearranging (1),3 x^{2}-5 x y-2 y^{2}=0Solving this equation for x (ignoring the root x=-frac{y}{3} as it is meaningless), we getx=2 y(Of course, we get the same result by dividing by y^{2} and solving the resulting quadratic equation for frac{x}{y}.) Substituting this value of x into (2),frac{4 y}{3}=frac{2 y}{3}+2from which y=3, and thus x=2 y=6.Therefore, A would complete the work alone in 6 hours, and B in 3 hours.II. Solution: Below we provide a solution in which only one unknown appears in equation (1), and inference replaces equation (2).The second relationship mentioned in the text does not contain absolute data, only the ratio of how A and B divide the work, so it is expected that this ratio can also be determined from it. Suppose that in the same time, B does lambda times as much work as A. Then, working together, the entire work is divided between A and B in the ratio 1: lambda, so A does frac{1}{1+lambda} of the work, and B does frac{lambda}{1+lambda} of the work. In fact, A worked for as long as it would take B to complete frac{2}{3} of the work. Since he does frac{1}{lambda} times the work of B, he actually did frac{2}{3 lambda} of the entire work, and thus left 1-frac{2}{3 lambda} of the work for B. According to the text, this is twice the work that would have been done by A if they worked together, so1-frac{2}{3 lambda}=frac{2}{1+lambda}, quad(3 lambda-2)(1+lambda)=6 lambda, quad 3 lambda^{2}-5 lambda-2=0Ignoring the negative root as it is meaningless, we get lambda=2. This means that working together, A would do frac{1}{3} of the work, and B would do frac{2}{3} of the work. If A worked for frac{2}{3} of the time it would take B to complete the entire work, then he worked for as long as it would take them to complete the work together, and during this time he did frac{1}{3} of the work. Thus, B worked for 2 hours according to the first part of the text and completed frac{2}{3} of the work, so he would complete the entire work in 3 hours. Since B does twice as much work as A in the same time, A would complete the entire work in 6 hours."},{"problem":"If p geq 5 is a prime number, then 24 divides p^2 - 1 without remainder textbf{(A)} text{never} qquad textbf{(B)} text{sometimes only} qquad textbf{(C)} text{always} qquadtextbf{(D)} text{only if } p =5 qquad textbf{(E)} text{none of these}","solution":"Starting with some experimentation, substituting p=5 results in 24, substituting p=7 results in 48, and substituting p=11 results in 120.

Case 1: ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are both even   Suppose ( a_1 = 2^x ) and ( a_2 = 2^y ). Then:   [   a_3 = a_1 + a_2 = 2^x + 2^y   ]   Without loss of generality, assume ( x geq y ). Then:   [   a_3 = 2^y (2^{x-y} + 1)   ]   For ( a_3 ) to be a prime power, ( 2^{x-y} + 1 ) must be a power of 2. However, the only power of 2 that is one more than another power of 2 is 2 itself (i.e., ( 2^1 + 1 = 3 )). This implies ( x = y + 1 ), and:   [   a_3 = 3 cdot 2^y   ]   Since ( a_3 ) must be a prime power, this is a contradiction because ( 3 cdot 2^y ) is not a power of a single prime.2. Case 2: ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are both odd   Suppose ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are both odd prime powers. Then:   [   a_3 = a_1 + a_2   ]   Since the sum of two odd numbers is even, ( a_3 ) must be even. Let ( a_3 = 2^z ). Then:   [   a_4 = a_2 + a_3 = a_2 + 2^z   ]   Since ( a_2 ) is odd and ( 2^z ) is even, ( a_4 ) is odd. Continuing this pattern, we find that:   [   a_6 = 3a_1 + 5a_2   ]   Since ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are both odd, ( 3a_1 + 5a_2 ) is also odd, which contradicts the requirement that ( a_6 ) be a prime power.3. Case 3: ( a_1 ) is even and ( a_2 ) is odd   Suppose ( a_1 = 2^x ) and ( a_2 ) is an odd prime power. Then:   [   a_3 = a_1 + a_2 = 2^x + a_2   ]   Since ( a_2 ) is odd, ( a_3 ) is odd. Continuing this pattern, we find that:   [   a_7 = 5a_1 + 8a_2   ]   Since ( 5 ) and ( a_2 ) are both odd, ( 5a_1 + 8a_2 ) must be even. However, for ( a_7 ) to be a prime power, it must be a power of 2, which contradicts the requirement that ( a_7 ) be a prime power.4. Case 4: ( a_1 ) is odd and ( a_2 ) is even   Suppose ( a_1 ) is an odd prime power and ( a_2 = 2^y ). Then:   [   a_3 = a_1 + a_2   ]   Since ( a_1 ) is odd and ( a_2 ) is even, ( a_3 ) is odd. Continuing this pattern, we find that:   [   a_6 = 3a_1 + 5a_2   ]   Since ( a_1 ) is odd and ( a_2 ) is even, ( 3a_1 + 5a_2 ) must be odd, which contradicts the requirement that ( a_6 ) be a prime power.Since all four cases lead to contradictions when ( n geq 8 ), we conclude that the largest possible ( n ) is 7.The final answer is ( boxed{7} )."},{"problem":"1053.

From the first condition, we find u=int(x+y) d x+varphi(y)=frac{x^{2}}{2}+y x+varphi(y), where varphi(y) is some function of y, determined from the second condition: frac{partial u}{partial y}=frac{partial}{partial y}left(frac{x^{2}}{2}+y x+varphi(y)right)=x+varphi^{prime}(y)=x+2 y.From this, it follows that varphi^{prime}(y)=2 y, i.e., varphi(y)=y^{2}, and then u(x, y)= =frac{x^{2}}{2}+x y+y^{2}Answer. frac{x^{2}}{2}+x y+y^{2}=C"},{"problem":"3.5.10  Find the largest real number k such that the inequality(a+b+c)^{3} geqslant frac{5}{2}left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}right)+k a b cholds for the side lengths a, b, c of any triangle.","solution":"When a=b=c, we have k leqslant frac{39}{2}.Below, we prove the inequality (a+b+c)^{3} geqslant frac{5}{2}left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}right)+frac{39}{2} a b cholds for any side lengths a, b, c of a triangle.(1) Leftrightarrow(3 c-a-b)(a-b)^{2}+(3 a-b-c)(b-c)^{2}+(3 b-c-a)(c-a)^{2} geqslant 0.Since the sum of any two of 3 c-a-b, 3 a-b-c, 3 b-c-a is positive, at most one of these numbers can be negative.(1) If none of 3 c-a-b, 3 a-b-c, 3 b-c-a are negative, then (2) holds.(2) If exactly one of 3 c-a-b, 3 a-b-c, 3 b-c-a is negative, assume without loss of generality that 3 c-a-b is negative, i.e., 3 c-a-b < 0, while 3 a-b-c geqslant 0 and 3 b-c-a geqslant 0.

Assume there are four irrational numbers (a, b, c, d) on the blackboard.   - We need to show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.2.

Analyze the implications of these conditions:   - Suppose (frac{a}{b+1}) is rational. Then (a = k(b+1)) for some rational number (k).   - Similarly, if (frac{b}{c+1}) is rational, then (b = m(c+1)) for some rational number (m).   - If (frac{c}{d+1}) is rational, then (c = n(d+1)) for some rational number (n).   - If (frac{d}{a+1}) is rational, then (d = p(a+1)) for some rational number (p).4. Substitute these expressions into each other:   - From (a = k(b+1)), we get (a = k(m(c+1)+1)).   - From (b = m(c+1)), we get (b = m(n(d+1)+1)).   - From (c = n(d+1)), we get (c = n(p(a+1)+1)).   - From (d = p(a+1)), we get (d = p(k(b+1)+1)).5. Check for consistency:   - Substitute (d = p(a+1)) into (c = n(d+1)):     [     c = n(p(a+1)+1)     ]   - Substitute (c = n(p(a+1)+1)) into (b = m(c+1)):     [     b = m(n(p(a+1)+1)+1)     ]   - Substitute (b = m(n(p(a+1)+1)+1)) into (a = k(b+1)):     [     a = k(m(n(p(a+1)+1)+1)+1)     ]6.

Identify the common difference:   The sequence is in arithmetic progression, so the common difference (d) between consecutive terms should be constant.

Let A(x_{1},y_{1}), B(x_{2},y_{2}), P(x_{0},y_{0}), and combine the equation of l and the ellipse:  begin{cases}y=kx+1  dfrac{x^2}{4}+ dfrac{y^2}{3}=1end{cases}, eliminate y and rearrange to get (4+k^2)x^2+6kx+5=0,  Therefore, Delta =(6k)^2-4×(4+k^2)×5=16k^2-80 > 0, solving gives k^2 > 5. Also, x_{1}+x_{2}=- dfrac {6k}{4+k^2}, x_{1}x_{2}= dfrac {5}{4+k^2},  Therefore, | overrightarrow{PA}- overrightarrow{PB}|=| overrightarrow{AB}|= sqrt {1+k^2}cdot sqrt {(x_{1}+x_{2})^2-4x_{1}x_{2}}= dfrac {4 sqrt {(1+k^2)(k^2-5)}}{4+k^2}  Given dfrac {4 sqrt {(1+k^2)(k^2-5)}}{4+k^2} < sqrt {3}, rearranging gives 13k^4-88k^2-128 < 0, solving gives - dfrac {16}{13} < k^2 < 8, therefore 5 < k^2 < 8.  Since overrightarrow{OA}+ overrightarrow{OB}=lambda overrightarrow{OP}, that is, (x_{1},y_{1})+(x_{2},y_{2})=lambda(x_{0},y_{0}),  thus x_{1}+x_{2}=lambda x_{0}, y_{1}+y_{2}=lambda y_{0}  When t=0, x_{1}+x_{2}=- dfrac {6k}{4+k^2}=0, y_{1}+y_{2}=k(x_{1}+x_{2})+6= dfrac {24}{4+k^2}=0, obviously, the above equations have no solution.  When tneq 0, x_{0}= dfrac {x_{1}+x_{2}}{lambda}=- dfrac {6k}{lambda(4+k^2)}, y_{0}= dfrac {y_{1}+y_{2}}{lambda}= dfrac {24}{lambda(4+k^2)}.  Since P(x_{0},y_{0}) is on the ellipse, i.e., x_{0}^{2}+ dfrac {y_{0}^{2}}{4}=1, simplifying gives lambda^{2}= dfrac {36}{4+k^2}. From 5 < k^2 < 8, we get 3 < t^{2} < 4,  Therefore, t^{2}= dfrac{36{k}^{2}}{3+4{k}^{2}}=9- dfrac{27}{3+4{k}^{2}}. Hence, the range of values for t^{2} is boxed{left(20- sqrt{283},4right)}."},{"problem":"5.
