Thus, the total number of ways in this case is given by the product of the combinations:C(8, 4) cdot C(4, 3) = frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!} cdot frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 70 cdot 4 = 280.Case 2: Exactly 5 moves to the right, 2 moves up, and 1 move to the left.Here, we select 5 times to move right from the 8 total moves. There are C(8, 5) ways to do this. After these moves, we have 3 moves left. Then we choose 2 moves up out of the remaining 3 moves, with C(3, 2) possible ways. The last move must be to the left. So there are:C(8, 5) cdot C(3, 2) = frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} cdot frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = 56 cdot 3 = 168.By the principle of counting, the total number of ways is the sum of the number of ways in each case.

If a, b, c are distinct positive real numbers, what is the smallest possible number of distinct numbers among the numbers a+b, b+c, c+a, ab, bc, ca, abc?(Patrik Bak)","solution":"SOLUTION. Since a, b, c are distinct positive numbers, so are the numbers a b, b c, c a, because, for example, from a b=b c it follows that a=c (thanks to b neq 0). We see, then, that in the examined septet of numbers a+b, b+c, c+a, a b, b c, c a, a b c there are at least 3 different values. We will first prove by contradiction that exactly 3 values can never be. Then we will provide an example of the examined septet, which is composed of only 4 different values.First, let us assume that in some septet there are exactly 3 different values. We know that these are the values of the three products a b, b c, c a, and so the product a b c must equal one of them. This means that one of the numbers a, b, c is equal to 1, because, for example, from a b c=a b it follows that c=1.Without loss of generality, we will further limit ourselves to the case c=1. The septet in question with three different values can then be reduced to a sextet of the same property, which is composed of the numbersa+b, a+1, b+1, a b, a, b(we have substituted c=1 and omitted the number a b c equal to a b). Since the equalities a=1 and b=1 have already been ruled out, the three different values are represented both in the first triplet a+b, a+1, b+1 and in the second triplet a b, a, b. Both numbers a, b from the second triplet, therefore, must lie in the set {a+b, a+1, b+1}. This can only be achieved if a=b+1 and simultaneously b=a+1, which is impossible. The proof by contradiction is complete.As we have promised, in the second part of the solution, we will provide an example of the examined septet, which is composed of 4 different values. According to the previous observations, it is worthwhile to examine the situation where, for example, c=1 and at the same time b=a+1. Then we have(a+b, b+c, c+a)=(2 a+1, a+2, a+1) quad and quad(a b, b c, c a, a b c)=left(a^{2}+a, a+1, a, a^{2}+aright).It is enough to find such a positive number a neq 1 so that in the quintet of numbersa, a+1, a+2,2 a+1, a^{2}+athere are only four different values. Considering the obvious inequalities that hold between these five numbers for the considered a, the requirement can be met in exactly two ways. They are expressed by the equationsa^{2}+a=2 a+1, quad text { resp. } quad a^{2}+a=a+2 .Both actually lead to suitable triplets, which are of the form(a, b, c)=left(frac{1+sqrt{5}}{2}, frac{3+sqrt{5}}{2}, 1right), quad text { resp. } quad(a, b, c)=(sqrt{2}, 1+sqrt{2}, 1) text {. }Conclusion. The smallest possible number of different numbers in the examined septet is equal to 4.Note. If we do not distinguish triplets (a, b, c) that differ only in the order of their elements, there are two more admissible triplets for which only 4 different values can be found in the examined septet. The first of them is the triplet(a, b, c)=left(a, frac{a}{a-1}, frac{a}{(a-1)^{2}}right)where a>0 is the only real root of the cubic equation a^{3}-4 a^{2}+4 a-2=0. The second suitable triplet is(a, b, c)=left(a, frac{a}{a^{2}-a-1}, frac{a(a-1)}{a^{2}-a-1}right)where a is the larger of the two positive roots of the equation a^{4}-2 a^{3}-2 a^{2}+2 a+2=0."},{"problem":"Given (x > 0), from the inequality (x+ dfrac {1}{x}geqslant 2 sqrt {xcdot dfrac {1}{x}}=2), (x+ dfrac {4}{x^{2}}= dfrac {x}{2}+ dfrac {x}{2}+ dfrac {4}{x^{2}}geqslant 3 sqrt[3]{dfrac {x}{2}cdot dfrac {x}{2}cdot dfrac {4}{x^{2}}} =3), (…), we can deduce the conclusion: (x+ dfrac {a}{x^{n}}geqslant n+1(ninmathbb{N}^{*})), then (a=()　　())A: (2n)B: (3n)C: (n^{2})D: (n^{n})","solution":"According to the problem, by analyzing the transformation process of the given equations, we first transform the left side of the equation, then simplify it using the basic inequality to eliminate the square root, resulting in the right side;  For the given equation, (x+ dfrac {a}{x^{n}}geqslant n+1),  we first transform the left side (x+ dfrac {a}{x^{n}}) into (x+ dfrac {a}{x^{n}}= dfrac {x}{n}+ dfrac {x}{n}+…+ dfrac {x}{n}+ dfrac {a}{x^{n}}),  in ( dfrac {x}{n}+ dfrac {x}{n}+…+ dfrac {x}{n}+ dfrac {a}{x^{n}}), the denominators of the first (n) fractions are all (n),  to use the basic inequality, it is necessary that ( dfrac {x}{n}× dfrac {x}{n}×…× dfrac {x}{n}× dfrac {a}{x^{n}}) be a constant value, from which we can deduce (a=n^{n}),  thus, the correct choice is boxed{text{D}}.

Consider the possible cases for the angles:   - Case 1: 50^circ is one of the equal angles.     - If 50^circ is one of the equal angles, then the other equal angle must also be 50^circ.     - Therefore, the third angle must be 180^circ - 50^circ - 50^circ = 80^circ.     - This gives us the angle sets (50^circ, 50^circ, 80^circ).   - Case 2: 50^circ is the unique angle.     - If 50^circ is the unique angle, then the other two angles must be equal.     - Let these equal angles be x^circ.     - Therefore, 50^circ + x^circ + x^circ = 180^circ.     - Solving for x, we get 2x = 130^circ implies x = 65^circ.     - This gives us the angle sets (50^circ, 65^circ, 65^circ).4.

The result will be fewer!\\" - What is the truth in this matter? How could Lajcsi have calculated:1 1[^0][^0]:    { }^{1} We recommend to the contestants the note attached to problem 1227, K. M. L. 27 (1963/12) p. 205.","solution":"In the lottery, the numbers 1, 2, ..., 90 contain the digit 8 in the tens place 10 times, and in the units place 9 times: 80, 81, ldots, 89, and 8, 18, 28, ldots, 88. The number 88 belongs to both groups, so the total number of lottery numbers containing the digit 8 is 10 + 9 - 1 = 18.Drawing at least three 8s means that out of the 5 drawn numbers, 3, 4, or all 5 contain the digit 8. We determine the number of such cases N_{3}, N_{4}, N_{5} separately.In the first case, 3 of the drawn numbers are from the 18 numbers mentioned, and the remaining 2 are from the 72 numbers that do not contain the digit 8. The first of these 3 can be chosen in 18 ways, the second in 17 ways from the remaining, and the third in 16 ways. The resulting 18 cdot 17 cdot 16 triplets include each triplet in every possible order, but in the lottery draw, the order of drawing does not matter. Since 3 different elements can be arranged in 3 cdot 2 ways (choosing any one of the 3 as the first, and the remaining two in 2 ways), we get the number of distinct combinations by dividing:frac{18 cdot 17 cdot 16}{3 cdot 2}Similarly, the number of distinct pairs of numbers not containing the digit 8, and the total number of draws in this case:frac{72 cdot 71}{2}, quad N_{3}=frac{18 cdot 17 cdot 16}{3 cdot 2} cdot frac{72 cdot 71}{2}=2085696For the cases where 4 or 5 numbers contain the digit 8, we have:begin{aligned}& N_{4}=frac{18 cdot 17 cdot 16 cdot 15}{4 cdot 3 cdot 2} cdot 72=220320, quad text { and } & N_{5}=frac{18 cdot 17 cdot 16 cdot 15 cdot 14}{5 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 2}=8568end{aligned}Finally, the total number of 5-number draws from 90 numbers, regardless of the digit 8, is:N=frac{90 cdot 89 cdot 88 cdot 87 cdot 86}{5 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 2}=43949268Thus, the fraction of all possible draws where at least three numbers contain the digit 8 is left(N_{3}+N_{4}+N_{5}right) / N, and the average number of such draws out of 100 is:frac{100left(N_{3}+N_{4}+N_{5}right)}{N}=frac{231458400}{43949268} approx 5.3Therefore, Pali's caution was justified.Although Lajcsi's quick calculation could have been wrong in several ways, we can assume he thought as follows: after selecting 3 numbers containing the digit 8, the remaining 2 are chosen from the remaining 87 numbers, so the total number of such draws, and the average number out of 100, are:N_{3}^{*}=frac{18 cdot 17 cdot 16}{3 cdot 2} cdot frac{87 cdot 86}{2}=3052656, text { and } frac{100 N_{3}^{*}}{N} approx 6.9as Lajcsi claimed. This is incorrect because he counted some draws multiple times, where more than 3 numbers contain the digit 8. If the numbers A, B, C, D, E contain the digit 8 and X does not, then the draw A, B, C, D, X was counted 4 times by Lajcsi, as A, B, C, and D were each considered as the \\"fourth\\" number from the \\"other 87\\" numbers, and the draw A, B, C, D, E was counted 10 times, because the 2 additional numbers from the 87 can be chosen in 5 cdot 4 / 2 ways.

Basic ConceptsAn equation that relates the independent variable, the unknown function, and its derivatives or differentials of various orders is called a differential equation.The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative appearing in the equation. For example, the equation ( y' sin x + y operatorname{tg} x = 1 ) is of the first order; ( frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}} = x^{3} ) is of the second order; ( y''' - 5 x y' + x y = 0 ) is of the third order.A function ( y = phi(x) ) that satisfies a differential equation is called a solution of the equation. The graph of a solution is called an integral curve of the equation.If a function that satisfies a differential equation is given implicitly, i.e., by a relation of the form ( phi(x, y) = 0 ), then it is called an integral of the equation.A solution of a differential equation that contains as many independent arbitrary constants as the order of the equation is called the general solution of the equation. For a first-order equation, the general solution has the form:[y = phi(x, C)]and for a second-order equation, it has the form:[y = phi(x, C_{1}, C_{2})]Functions obtained from the general solution by assigning different numerical values to the arbitrary constants are called particular solutions of the equation.Geometrically, the general solution defines a family of curves, and a particular solution defines a specific curve in this family.To find a particular solution of a differential equation, initial conditions are specified. For a first-order equation, they have the form ( y(x_{0}) = y_{0} ); for a second-order equation, they have the form ( y(x_{0}) = y_{0} ), ( y'(x_{0}) = y'_{0} ). Using these initial conditions, the values of the arbitrary constants in the general solution are determined, resulting in particular solutions that satisfy the given initial conditions."},{"problem":"Given that sin alpha = frac{sqrt{5}}{5}, sin beta = frac{sqrt{10}}{10}, and both alpha and beta are obtuse angles, find the value of cos(alpha + beta) and the value of alpha + beta.","solution":"Since sin alpha = frac{sqrt{5}}{5} < frac{1}{2} and sin beta = frac{sqrt{10}}{10} < frac{1}{2}, and both alpha and beta are obtuse angles, we have alpha in (frac{5pi}{6}, pi) and beta in (frac{5pi}{6}, pi).Therefore, cos alpha = -sqrt{1 - sin^2 alpha} = -frac{2sqrt{5}}{5} and cos beta = -sqrt{1 - sin^2 beta} = -frac{3sqrt{10}}{10}.This implies that alpha + beta in (frac{5pi}{3}, 2pi).

Let S_{XYZ} denote the area of triangle XYZ in mathrm{cm}^{2}, and let S=S_{ABP}. According to the problem, we have S_{ADP}=10, S+S_{BCP}=8, and S_{BCP}+S_{CDP}=9. From the second equation, it follows that S_{BCP}=8-S. Substituting this into the third equation, we get S_{CDP}=1+S (Fig. 1).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_e205f11fab915c7d36c0g-2.jpg?height=342&width=758&top_left_y=1885&top_left_x=658)Fig. 1Triangles ABP and ADP have the same height from vertex A. Therefore, the ratio of their areas is S: S_{ADP} = |BP|:|DP|. Similarly, for triangles BCP and CDP, we get S_{BCP}: S_{CDP} = |BP|:|DP|. Hence, it follows that S: S_{ADP} = S_{BCP}: S_{CDP}, which, given the derived relationships, meansfrac{S}{10} = frac{8-S}{1+S}After rearranging, we get a quadratic equation for S:S^2 + 11S - 80 = (S + 16)(S - 5) = 0,which has two roots, -16 and 5. Since the area S of triangle ABP is a non-negative number, only S=5 is valid. From the above relationships, we can easily calculate S_{BCP}=3 and S_{CDP}=6. The area of the quadrilateral ABCD in mathrm{cm}^{2} is thereforeS + S_{BCP} + S_{CDP} + S_{ADP} = 5 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 24.Conclusion. The area of quadrilateral ABCD is 24 mathrm{~cm}^{2}.Alternative Solution. Let the lengths of segments PA, PB, PC, PD (in mathrm{cm}) be denoted by a, b, c, d respectively. According to the known formula S = frac{1}{2}uv sin omega for the area of a triangle with sides of lengths u and v forming an angle of size omega, we express the conditions of the problem with the equations8 = frac{1}{2}ab sin varphi + frac{1}{2}bc sin (pi - varphi), quad 9 = frac{1}{2}bc sin (pi - varphi) + frac{1}{2}cd sin varphi, quad 10 = frac{1}{2}da sin (pi - varphi),where varphi = |angle APB|. For simplicity, let k = frac{1}{2} sin varphi = frac{1}{2} sin (pi - varphi). We then get the system of equations8 = kab + kbc, quad 9 = kbc + kcd, quad 10 = kda,from which we will find the area S of quadrilateral ABCD, which in mathrm{cm}^{2} is given by the formulaS = kab + kbc + kcd + kda.First, we eliminate d by a suitable combination of the second and third equations (1):9a - 10c = kab c.By combining this equation with the first equation (1), whose right-hand side we rewrite as the product k b(a + c), we eliminate b:(9a - 10c)(a + c) - 8ac = 0.Using the identity(9a - 10c)(a + c) - 8ac = 9a^2 - 9ac - 10c^2 = (3a - 5c)(3a + 2c),we see that for (positive) numbers a, c, we have 3a = 5c or 9a = 15c, and thus equation (3) can be rewritten as 5c = kab c, from which kab = 5. From equations (1), it follows that kbc = 3 and kcd = 6, which, when substituted into (2) along with the value kda = 10, leads to the result S = 24.For a complete solution, award 6 points, of which 1 point for expressing the area using one of the three triangles ABP, BCP, or CDP, 2 points for justifying the proportionality between the areas of the four triangles, 1 point for setting up the corresponding equation, and 1 point for solving it.

This implies that one of them must be the counterfeit coin, as the genuine coins all have the same weight, and combining a genuine with a counterfeit would yield an odd number.- The total weight of A, C, and E is 16 grams.Since we've established that A is genuine, we can deduce that the weight of a genuine coin is 5 grams (since A and B together weigh 10 grams).Let's analyze the possibilities:1. Suppose ( C ) is the counterfeit coin. If the genuine coins weigh 5 grams each, then for A (5 grams), C (counterfeit), and E (5 grams) to total 16 grams, the weight of C must be 6 grams. In this case, the assumptions are consistent.2. Suppose ( D ) is the counterfeit coin. Then, the weight of ( C ) would be 5 grams (because C and D weigh 11 grams and C must be the genuine one).

The key to solving this problem is to find the diameter (radius) of sphere O based on the given conditions. Given that points S, A, B, C are on the surface of sphere O, SA perp plane ABC, and AB perp BC, it is easy to see that points S, A, B, C are vertices of a rectangular prism with lengths SA, AB, and BC respectively. Since the diameter of a sphere circumscribed around a rectangular prism is equal to the diagonal of the prism, we can find the diameter (radius) of sphere O and substitute it into the formula for the surface area of a sphere to get the answer.SolutionSince SA perp plane ABC and AB perp BC,  the radius of the circumscribed sphere of tetrahedron S-ABC is equal to the radius of the circumscribed sphere of a rectangular prism with lengths SA, AB, and BC.  Since SA=AB=1 and BC= sqrt{2},  we have 2R= sqrt{SA^{2}+AB^{2}+BC^{2}}=2.  Therefore, the surface area S of sphere O is S=4cdot pi R^{2}=4pi.

A light ray is emitted from a point on the base. After reflecting exactly once from each lateral face (the ray does not reflect from the edges), the ray hits a point on the base of the pyramid. What is the shortest distance the ray could have traveled?","solution":"Answer: frac{10 sqrt{3}}{9}.Solution. Let N be the point from which the ray is emitted, and K be the point on the base of the pyramid where the ray will finally hit.We will sequentially \\"straighten\\" the path of the ray as follows: if at some moment the ray should reflect off a certain plane, we will assume that it continues its path, but in a \\"mirrored\\" copy of the pyramid. Note also that due to the perpendicularity of the edges D A, D B, and D C, the planes (A B D), (B C D), and (C A D) remain in place when reflected relative to each other. Therefore, the result of our \\"straightening\\" will be the segment N K_{1}, where K_{1} is the point obtained from K after sequential reflections relative to the planes (A B D), (B C D), and (C A D) in some order. The length of the segment N K_{1} is exactly equal to the total distance traveled by the ray.We introduce coordinates: D is the origin, and D A, D B, and D C are the directions of the axes. Then, the symmetry relative to each of the specified planes changes the sign of exactly one of the coordinates of the point. Consequently, the point K_{1} is obtained from the point K by changing the signs of all coordinates, i.e., by symmetry relative to the point D. Therefore, the point K_{1} lies on the image of the plane A B C under symmetry relative to the point D.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_a567280d18f9fc82386fg-14.jpg?height=720&width=694&top_left_y=488&top_left_x=698)The length of any such segment does not exceed the distance between these planes. It is easy to see that this distance is equal to twice the distance from the point D to the plane A B C. We can reason in different ways, but we will present only one of them.The distance from the point D to the plane A B C is equal to the height h of the pyramid A B C D dropped from the point D. The volume of the pyramid A B C D is then, on the one hand, V_{A B C D} = frac{1}{3} S_{A B C} h, and on the other hand, V_{A B C D} = frac{1}{6} cdot D A cdot D B cdot D C = frac{25}{6}. It remains to find S_{A B C}. This can also be done in several ways.For example: by the Pythagorean theorem, C A = C B = sqrt{5^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{26}, A B = sqrt{5^2 + 5^2} = sqrt{50}, in the isosceles triangle A C B, it is easy to compute cos angle C A B = frac{A B / 2}{A C} = sqrt{frac{25}{52}}, from which sin angle C A B = sqrt{frac{27}{52}}, andS_{A B C} = frac{1}{2} cdot A C cdot A B cdot sin angle C A B = frac{15 sqrt{3}}{2}Therefore, h = frac{3 V_{A B C D}}{S_{A B C}} = frac{25}{15 sqrt{3}} = frac{5 sqrt{3}}{9}, from which it follows that the length of the path of any ray is not less than frac{10 sqrt{3}}{9}.It remains to provide an example where the length we found is achieved. For this, it is sufficient to present a point on the plane A B C whose perpendicular from D falls inside the triangle symmetric to A B C relative to the point D.Indeed, then the coordinates of the point K_{1} will be negative, so the perpendicular will intersect all coordinate planes. As the point N, almost any point in the neighborhood of the base of the perpendicular from the point D to the plane (A B C) will do. Almost any, since we need the perpendicular N K_{1} not to pass through the coordinate axes.Comment.

We need to analyze the behavior of q-p to determine if it has a maximum, a minimum, both, or neither.1. Understanding the Quadratic Function: The given quadratic function is y = -2x^2 + c. This is a parabola that opens downwards because the coefficient of x^2 is negative (-2). The vertex of this parabola is on the y-axis because there is no x term, implying the axis of symmetry is x = 0.2. Behavior of the Function: Since the parabola opens downwards and the axis of symmetry is at x = 0, as x moves away from 0 (in both positive and negative directions), the value of y decreases. However, given that m leqslant x leqslant m+2 leqslant 0, we are only concerned with the interval where x is less than or equal to 0. In this interval, as x increases (moves towards 0), y increases.3. Calculating q-p: The range of y values is from p to q. To find q-p, we evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval [m, m+2]. At x = m, y = -2m^2 + c. At x = m+2, y = -2(m+2)^2 + c = -2m^2 - 8m - 8 + c. Therefore, q-p = (-2m^2 - 8m - 8 + c) - (-2m^2 + c) = -8m - 8.4. Analyzing q-p: We simplify q-p to get q-p = -4m - 4. This is a linear function of m with a negative slope (-4). Since the slope is negative, q-p decreases as m increases.5. Conclusion: Given that m+2 leqslant 0, as m increases, q-p decreases, which means q-p has a minimum value when m is largest, but it does not have a maximum value because it keeps decreasing as m decreases. Therefore, q-p has a minimum value but no maximum value.The correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"There is a batch of products, among which there are 12 qualified products and 4 defective ones.

Based on the relationship between b and a, and knowing that b = 2a, we substitute and solve for a and b:      c^2 = a^2 + b^2    2^2 = a^2 + (2a)^2    4 = a^2 + 4a^2    4 = 5a^2    a^2 = frac{4}{5}    b^2 = (2a)^2 = 4a^2 = frac{16}{5}   6. With the values of a^2 and b^2 found, we can write the equation of the hyperbola:      frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = frac{x^2}{frac{4}{5}} - frac{y^2}{frac{16}{5}} = frac{5x^2}{4} - frac{5y^2}{16} = 1   Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is:boxed{frac{5x^2}{4} - frac{5y^2}{16} = 1}"},{"problem":"The taxi fare rules in Xinyu city are as follows: a fare of 5 yuan for distances up to 2 kilometers, for distances exceeding 2 kilometers but not exceeding 8 kilometers, the fare is 1.6 yuan per kilometer, and for distances beyond 8 kilometers, the fare is 2.4 yuan per kilometer.

Then the number of lines l satisfying this condition is ______.","solution":"Given the circle equation C:x^{2}+left(y+1right)^{2}=16, we can identify the center of the circle as Cleft(0,-1right). The problem involves a chord passing through a fixed point left(2,2right).1. Identifying the Line Equation: For a line l with a defined slope passing through left(2,2right), its equation can be represented as l:kx-y-2k+2=0, where k is the slope of the line.2. Distance from Center to Fixed Point: The distance from the center Cleft(0,-1right) to the point left(2,2right) is calculated using the distance formula, resulting in sqrt{(2-0)^{2}+(2+1)^{2}} = sqrt{4+9} = sqrt{13}.3. Shortest and Longest Chord Lengths:   - The shortest chord length intercepted by the line l and the circle C can be found by subtracting the squared distance from the center to the fixed point from the radius squared, and then doubling the square root of the result: 2sqrt{16-13}=2sqrt{3}.   - The longest chord passing through left(2,2right) would be the diameter of the circle, which is 2 times text{radius} = 2 times 4 = 8.4. Perpendicular Line to the X-axis: When the slope of the line does not exist, meaning the line is perpendicular to the x-axis, the chord intercepted by the line x=2 and the circle C has a length of 2sqrt{16-4}=4sqrt{3}, which is not an integer.5. Conclusion: Considering the range of chord lengths from the shortest to the longest that pass through left(2,2right), and excluding the non-integer length of 4sqrt{3} for the perpendicular case, we find that there are a total of 9 lines l that satisfy the condition of having an integer chord length.Hence, the number of lines l satisfying this condition is boxed{9}."},{"problem":"1.

Consider k-digit numbers ( 1 leqslant k leqslant 4 ). The number of numbers consisting only of odd digits is 5^{k} (for each of the k positions, any of the digits 1,3,5,7, 9 can be chosen); the number of numbers consisting only of even digits is 4 cdot 5^{k-1} (for the first position, any of the digits 2,4,6,8 can be chosen, and for the remaining positions - any of the digits 0,2,4,6, 8). Therefore, there are 5^{k}-4 cdot 5^{k-1}=5^{k-1} more k-digit numbers containing only odd digits in their notation than numbers containing only even digits.Consider 5-digit numbers not exceeding 60000. Among them, the number of numbers written only with odd digits is 3 cdot 5^{4}, and the number of numbers written only with even digits is 2 cdot 5^{4}+1 (do not forget to account for the number 60000 itself).Thus, there are 1+5+5^{2}+5^{3}+5^{4}-1=780 more numbers written only with odd digits."},{"problem":"13.

Calculate the length of the side of the triangle.","solution":"First, let's examine what we can say about the position of point D. Suppose that point D is inside the triangle, and let's say it is 2 units from A, 3 units from B, and 5 units from C. Since the triangle is equilateral, no vertex has a special role. Point D on the first diagram is the intersection of the circles with radii 5 units centered at C, 3 units centered at B, and 2 units centered at A. Since CD = 5, D can only be inside the triangle if AC, the side of the triangle, is longer than 5 units, but then the circles centered at A and B with radii 2 and 3 units, respectively, would not intersect. Therefore, D cannot be an interior point. Similarly, it can be shown that D cannot be on the sides AC or BC either.If D were on the segment AB, it would be the intersection of the circles centered at A and B, which would mean AB = 5 units, but then D could not be 5 units from C. Therefore, D must be outside the triangle.We will present three different solutions for the rest of the problem.Solution I. Place the equilateral triangle in a Cartesian coordinate system such that vertex A is at the origin, and the side AB lies on the x-axis. Let the side length of the triangle be a, then the coordinates of the vertices are A(0; 0), B(a; 0), and Cleft(frac{a}{2}; frac{sqrt{3}}{2} aright). Let the coordinates of point D be (x; y), and |overrightarrow{DA}|=2, |overrightarrow{DB}|=3, |overrightarrow{DC}|=5. Writing these in coordinates, we get the system of equations:x^{2}+y^{2}=4, quad (1) quad (x-a)^{2}+y^{2}=9, quad (2) quad left(x-frac{a}{2}right)^{2}+left(y-frac{sqrt{3}}{2} aright)^{2}=25. quad (3)Perform the squaring and simplifications:x^{2}-2ax+a^{2}+y^{2}=9, quad (2') quad x^{2}-ax+y^{2}-sqrt{3}ay+a^{2}=25. quad (3')Substituting x^{2}+y^{2}=4 from (1) into (2') and (3'):x=frac{a^{2}-5}{2a} quad text{and} quad y=sqrt{4-x^{2}}=sqrt{4-left(frac{a^{2}-5}{2a}right)^{2}}Substituting the expressions for x and y into (3'), we get the quartic equation for a:4a^{4}-152a^{2}+1444=0From which the side length of the triangle is a=sqrt{19} approx 4.359 units.Zoltán Bakonyi (Bp., Veres Péter Gimn., IV. o.t.)Solution II. Draw the triangle ABC and the point D outside it, such that AD=2, BD=3, and CD=5.Rotate the triangle CBD around point C by 60^circ so that B's image, B', falls on A, and D's image is D'. Thus, CD=CD'=5, and triangle DCD' is isosceles, and since angle DCD' = 60^circ, angle CD'D = angle D'DC = 60^circ. Therefore, triangle DCD' is equilateral, and DD'=5. Since DA + AD' = 2 + 3 = 5, points D, A, and D' are collinear, and angle AD'C = 60^circ.

Gimn., III. o.t.)Solution III. Ptolemy's theorem states that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the opposite sides. The converse of the theorem is also true, i.e., if the product of the diagonals of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the products of the opposite sides, then the quadrilateral is cyclic. (The theorem and its proof can be found, for example, in H. S. M. Coxeter-S. L. Greitzer: The New Mathematical Discoveries, p. 74, Gondolat Publishing, Budapest, 1977.)In our case, 5a = 2a + 3a, so ADBC is a cyclic quadrilateral, and since angle ACB = 60^circ, angle BDA = 120^circ.

Identify Conditions for Monotonic Decrease: For the function to be monotonically decreasing, the coefficient of x (which is ({m}^{2}-3)) must be negative, and the exponent of x (which is {{m}^{2}+m-3}) must be less than 0. This is because a power function decreases when its leading coefficient is negative and its exponent is less than 0.2. Set Up the System of Equations: Based on the above conditions, we set up the following system of equations:   [   left{     begin{array}{l}       {m}^{2}-3 < 0        {m}^{2}+m-3 < 0     end{array}   right.   ]3. Correct the First Equation for Coefficient of x: The condition for the coefficient of x to be negative was incorrectly stated in the solution.

Therefore, the values of (f(x, y)) can be visualized as a strictly increasing sequence when traversing the grid ((x, y)) in a specific order.To find the 19th smallest element, we can use a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently track the smallest elements. Here is a step-by-step approach:1. Initialize the Min-Heap:   - Start with the smallest element (f(1,1)) and insert it into the min-heap.   - Keep track of the elements that have been visited to avoid duplicates.2. Extract the Minimum Element:   - Extract the smallest element from the min-heap. This element is the next smallest element in the sequence.   - Insert the next possible elements (f(x+1, y)) and (f(x, y+1)) into the min-heap if they have not been visited.3. Repeat the Process:   - Repeat the extraction and insertion process until the 19th smallest element is extracted.Let's detail the steps with an example:1.

Subsequent Extractions:   - Continue extracting the smallest element and inserting the next possible elements until the 19th extraction.The cost of each extraction and insertion operation in a min-heap is (O(log k)), where (k) is the number of elements in the heap.

Substituting the values from the table:   - a=20, b=10, c=5, d=25, and n=60.

The chessboard is crossed by ( 2 mathrm{n} - 1 ) horizontal segments and ( 2 mathrm{n} - 1 ) vertical segments, from edge to edge. The circle intersects each of these segments twice.Since ( mathrm{r}^2 ) is not an integer, the Pythagorean theorem allows us to assert that the circle cannot pass through the corner of a square.Thus, for each square crossed by the circle, there are exactly two intersection points with the grid of the chessboard. Additionally, each intersection point of the circle with the grid is on the edge of exactly two squares.Therefore, the number of cells crossed by the circle corresponds to the number of intersection points between the circle and the grid, which is ( 8 mathrm{n} - 4 ).We note that this is also the number of cells on the edge of the chessboard.Comment from the graders: The exercise is very well done!"},{"problem":"A sector with a central angle of 120° and an area of 3pi is used as the lateral surface of a cone.

Then, we calculate the derivative of u(x) to understand its behavior:u'(x) = (x+2)e^{x} - frac{1}{(x+1)^{2}} + asin x.We observe that u'(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (0, frac{pi}{2}) because each term of u'(x) increases with x in this interval. Specifically, (x+2)e^{x} and asin x are increasing, and -frac{1}{(x+1)^{2}} becomes less negative. Therefore,u'(x) > u'(0) = 2 - 1 + 0 = 1 > 0.This implies that u(x), or equivalently f'(x), is monotonically increasing on (0, frac{pi}{2}).Moreover, when a > 2, we examine f'(x) at the endpoints of the interval:- At x = 0, f'(0) = 2 - a  2.- At x = frac{pi}{2}, f'left(frac{pi}{2}right) = left(frac{pi}{2} + 1right)e^{frac{pi}{2}} + frac{1}{frac{pi}{2} + 1} - acosleft(frac{pi}{2}right) > 0 because cosleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = 0 and the remaining terms are positive.Thus, f'(x) changes sign from negative to positive as x increases from 0 to frac{pi}{2}, indicating a unique zero of f'(x) in (0, frac{pi}{2}). This zero corresponds to a critical point of f(x).Therefore, when a > 2, f(x) has a critical point in the interval (0, frac{pi}{2}).boxed{text{Part (1) is proved.}} Part (2) Comparison of 2m and n:From Part (1), we know that f'(x) is negative on (0, m), positive on (m, frac{pi}{2}), and remains positive on (frac{pi}{2}, pi). This implies f(x) is decreasing on (0, m), increasing on (m, n), and f(m)  0.Thus, there exists x_{0} in (m, pi) such that f(x_{0}) = 0. Since f(0) = 0, we have n = x_{0}.To compare 2m and n, we evaluate f(2m):f(2m) = 2me^{2m} + ln(2m+1) - asin 2m.Using the critical point condition f'(m) = 0, we substitute acos m = (m+1)e^{m} + frac{1}{m+1} into f(2m):f(2m) > 2me^{2m} + ln(2m+1) - 2left[(m+1)e^{m} + frac{1}{m+1}right]m.Considering varphi(x) = e^{x} - x - 1 is monotonically increasing on (0, frac{pi}{2}) and varphi(x) > varphi(0) = 0, we have e^{m} - (m+1) > 0.Also, h(x) = ln(2x+1) - frac{2x}{x+1} is monotonically increasing on (0, frac{pi}{2}), implying h(x) > h(0) = 0. Therefore, ln(2m+1) - frac{2m}{m+1} > 0.Combining these results, we conclude f(2m) > 0 = f(x_{0}). Since f(x) is increasing on (m, pi), it implies 2m > x_{0} = n.boxed{2m > n}"},{"problem":"Given the function fleft(xright)=left{begin{array}{l}{ax-1,x＜1,}{{x^2}-2ax,x≥1}end{array}right. with the range of R, the range of the real number a is ____.","solution":"To find the range of the real number a for the function f(x) to have the range R, we analyze the function in two parts based on the given piecewise function.1.

A bus and a minibus, which leave M and K at 8:40 AM according to the schedule, usually meet at 8:52 AM. One day, the minibus left 8 minutes late and met the bus at 8:57 AM. Find the speed of the bus and the minibus, given that the distance from M to K is 24 km.Solution. Let the speed of the bus be v_{1} km/min, and the speed of the minibus be v_{2} km/min. Since the bus and the minibus usually meet after 12 minutes (8:52 AM - 8:40 AM = 12 minutes), we have the equation 12 v_{1} + 12 v_{2} = 24.In the case when the minibus left late, it traveled for 9 minutes (8:57 AM - 8:48 AM = 9 minutes) before meeting the bus, and the bus traveled for 17 minutes (8:57 AM - 8:40 AM = 17 minutes) before meeting the minibus. By the condition, 17 v_{1} + 9 v_{2} = 24.We obtain the system of equations:left{begin{array}{l}12 v_{1} + 12 v_{2} = 24, 17 v_{1} + 9 v_{2} = 24,end{array}right.from which v_{1} = frac{3}{4} km/min, or 45 km/h; v_{2} = frac{5}{4} km/min, or 75 km/h.Remark.

Solve for sin C and cos C:   Given sqrt{3} sin C + cos C = 2, we rewrite this as sin C + frac{1}{sqrt{3}}cos C = frac{2}{sqrt{3}}.   This can be interpreted as sin(C + frac{pi}{6}) = frac{2}{sqrt{3}}.    Since sin(C + frac{pi}{6}) reaches its maximum value of 1 for angles in the range (0, frac{pi}{2}), the equation seems to have been misinterpreted. Correctly, it should be:   sin(C + frac{pi}{6}) = 1   This implies C + frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{2}, giving C = frac{pi}{3}.2. Use the Law of Sines and Law of Cosines:   Applying the Law of Sines, we have frac{b}{sin B} = frac{a}{sin A}.   From the Law of Cosines, cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}.3. Solving the given equation:   Substituting cos A and cos C = frac{1}{2} (since C = frac{pi}{3}) into the given equation frac{cos A}{a} + frac{cos C}{c} = frac{sin B sin C}{3 sin A}, and simplifying, we obtain b(2sqrt{3} - c) = 0. Since b neq 0, it must be that c = 2sqrt{3}.4. Applying the Law of Sines again:   We know frac{c}{sin C} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = 4. Thus, a = 4sin A and b = 4sin B.5. Finding the range of A and B:   Since C = frac{pi}{3}, and Delta ABC is acute, A and B must also be in the range (0, frac{pi}{2}). Given that B = frac{2pi}{3} - A, we find A in (frac{pi}{6}, frac{pi}{2}). 6. Calculating a + b:   Therefore, a + b = 4(sin A + sin B) = 4[sin A + sin(frac{2pi}{3} - A)] = 4(sin A + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos A + frac{1}{2}sin A) = 4(2sqrt{3}sin(A + frac{pi}{6})).   Since A + frac{pi}{6} in (frac{pi}{3}, frac{2pi}{3}), sin(A + frac{pi}{6}) in (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, 1].   Thus, the range of values for a + b is (6, 4sqrt{3}].

(1) Find the range of values for the slope of the line l.  (2) Prove: There exists a fixed point T such that overrightarrow{QM}=λoverrightarrow{QT}, overrightarrow{QN}=μoverrightarrow{QT}, and frac{1}{λ}+frac{1}{μ}=-4.","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part (1): Finding the Range of Values for the Slope of the Line l1. Substitute P(1,-2) into the parabola equation:  Given P(1,-2) and the parabola equation y^2 = 2px, substituting the coordinates of P gives us (-2)^2 = 2p(1).  This simplifies to 4 = 2p, which further simplifies to p = 2.  Therefore, the equation of the parabola becomes y^2 = 4x.2. Let the coordinates of A and B be A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2), and the equation of line l be y = kx - 1 (k neq 0).3. Solve the system of equations:  From the system left{begin{array}{l}y=kx-1 y^2=4xend{array}right., substituting y^2 = 4x into y = kx - 1 gives us ky^2 - 4y - 4 = 0.4. Find the discriminant Delta for the quadratic equation in y:  The discriminant Delta = 16 + 16k must be greater than 0 for the line to intersect the parabola at two distinct points.  Therefore, we have 16 + 16k > 0, which simplifies to k > -1 and k neq 0.  Additionally, the line PA cannot pass through both P(1,-2) and (1,2), so k neq -1 and k neq 3.  Thus, the range of k is k in (-1,0) cup (0,3) cup (3,+infty).The final range for the slope of the line l is boxed{k in (-1,0) cup (0,3) cup (3,+infty)}.# Part (2): Proving the Existence of a Fixed Point T1. Let M(0, y_M), N(0, y_N), and T(0, t).  Given overrightarrow{QM} = lambdaoverrightarrow{QT} and overrightarrow{QN} = muoverrightarrow{QT}, and knowing Q(0,-1), we can express overrightarrow{QM} = (0, y_M+1) and overrightarrow{QT} = (0, t+1).2. Express frac{1}{lambda} and frac{1}{mu} in terms of t, y_M, and y_N:  Since overrightarrow{QM} = lambdaoverrightarrow{QT}, we have y_M + 1 = lambda(t + 1), which implies frac{1}{lambda} = frac{t+1}{y_M+1}.  Similarly, frac{1}{mu} = frac{t+1}{y_N+1}.3. Find expressions for y_M and y_N:  Given the slope of the line PA as k_{PA} = frac{y_1+2}{x_1-1} = frac{4}{y_1-2}, and setting x=0 in the equation of line PA, we find y_M = frac{-2y_1}{y_1-2} and similarly y_N = frac{-2y_2}{y_2-2}.4. Calculate frac{1}{lambda} + frac{1}{mu}:  Using the expressions for y_M and y_N, we find frac{1}{lambda} + frac{1}{mu} = (t+1)left(frac{-y_1+2}{y_1+2} + frac{-y_2+2}{y_2+2}right) = (t+1)frac{2y_1y_2 + 8}{(y_1+2)(y_2+2)} = 2(t+1).5. Given frac{1}{lambda} + frac{1}{mu} = -4, we solve for t:  Setting 2(t+1) = -4 gives us t = -3.Therefore, there exists a fixed point T(0,-3) satisfying the conditions, which is boxed{T(0,-3)}."},{"problem":"Which of the following sets of numbers can form a Pythagorean triple?A: sqrt{3}, sqrt{4}, sqrt{5}B: 9, 12, 15C: frac{1}{3}, frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{5}D: 3^{2}, 4^{2}, 5^{2}","solution":"To determine which set of numbers can form a Pythagorean triple, we need to check each option against the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

If the sides of the rectangle are a and c, then the total number of lattice points inside and on the boundary of the rectangle is (a+1) cdot (c+1), and the broken line passes through each of these points, so h=(a+1)(c+1).

We get strips with lengths:text { 1, 2,..., n - 1, } 1996 text { - n, (1996 - n) + 1,..., 1994, } 1995.It is clear that the first n-1 strips are different, and the remaining strips are also different. However, to ensure that among the first n-1 strips there are no strips equal to any of the remaining strips, it is necessary (and sufficient) that n - 1 < 1996 - n, i.e., n < 999. The case n = 1995 is analogous. We cut the rectangle into 1995 strips of length n. We keep the first one, cut the second into two strips of length 1 and n-1, and so on. We get strips with lengthstext { 1, 2,..., 1994, } n-1994, (n-1994)+1, ldots, nThey will be different if 1994 < n - 1994, i.e., n geq 3989. To prove the necessity of this condition, we again compare the areas. Since the total area of the strips does not exceed frac{n(n+1)}{2}, we get the inequality1995 n leq frac{n(n+1)}{2}From this, n geq 2 cdot 1995 - 1 = 3989.Comments. 1^{0}. A rectangle n times m with n geq m can be cut into strips of different lengths if and only if n geq 2m - 1.2^{0}. We used the formula 1+2+ldots+n=frac{n(n+1)}{2}. This formula can be proven by induction. Moreover, it is a special case of the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression. Nevertheless, we will provide an elegant proof of this formula. Let 1+2+ldots+n=X and calculate the sum of all numbers in the table:begin{array}{cccccc}1 & 2 & 3 & ldots & n-2 & n-1 & n n & n-1 & n-2 & ldots & 3 & 2 & 1end{array}Since the sum in each column is n+1 and there are n columns, the sum of all numbers in the table is n(n+1). On the other hand, the sum in each row is X, so the sum of all numbers in the table is 2X. Therefore, 2X = n(n+1), from which our statement follows."},{"problem":"4.

This set is a strip between lines (in space - planes) passing through points A_{i} and A_{j} and perpendicular to the segment A_{i} A_{j} (Fig.3); we will denote this strip by Pi_{i j} below.From this observation, it follows that if we consider the convex hull V of the given n points - the smallest convex polygon (polyhedron) containing all these points - then all points A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n} must lie on the boundary of the set V; none of them can be inside V: after all, V is contained in each of the strips Pi_{i j}.The solution to part (a) is now in two words. In this case, V is a convex n-gon with vertices A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n}. The sum of its angles is 180^{circ}(n-2), and if each of the angles is no more than 90^{circ}, then180^{circ}(n-2) leq 90^{circ} nfrom which n leq 4.The solution to the planar problem was submitted by many readers. The spatial problem is much more difficult, and we did not receive a complete proof from any of the readers. We will present a solution that was first found by the well-known geometers L. Danzer and B. Grünbaum (1962).Consider, in addition to the polyhedron V (here V can be understood as either the convex hull of the given n points A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n} or the intersection - the common part - of all n(n-1) / 2 strips Pi_{i j}) the following polyhedra: V_{i},obtained from V by translation by the vector overrightarrow{A_{1} A_{i}}left(i=1,2, ldots, n ; V_{1}right., of course, coincides with V), and V V^{prime}, obtained from V by stretching (homothety) with a coefficient of 2 and center at point A_{1}.We will prove the following three statements.1^{o}. The polyhedron obtained from V by translation by the vector overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{j}} does not have common interior points with V (i.e., it can intersect V only on the boundary).2^{o}. No two of the polyhedra V_{1}, V_{2}, ldots, V_{n} have common interior points.3^{0}. All V_{i} are contained in V^{prime}.Let us prove 1^{o}. When translated by overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{j}}, the strip Pi_{i j} transforms into a new strip, which does not have common interior points with it - these two strips have only a common boundary plane. But V is contained in Pi_{i j}, so 1^{0} is even more true.2^{o} immediately follows from 1^{circ} if we note that V_{j} is obtained from V_{i} by translation by the vector overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{j}} (Fig.4). 3^{circ} follows from a more general fact: if A B C are three points of a convex polyhedron, W and W^{prime} is the polyhedron obtained from W by stretching by a factor of 2 with center at point A, then the fourth vertex D of the parallelogram A B D C (i.e., the point obtained from C by translation by the vector overrightarrow{A B}) belongs to W^{prime}. This fact is easily proven: the point K, from which D is obtained by stretching, is the midpoint of segment A D - it is also the midpoint of segment B C, so it belongs to W (since the polyhedron W is convex), so D belongs to W^{prime} (Fig.5).Thus, statements 2^{o} and 3^{o} are proven. Let v be the volume of the polyhedron V. Then the volume of each of the V_{i} is also equal to v, and the volume of V^{prime} is equal to 8 v. From 2^{o} and 3^{circ}, it obviously follows that n v leq 8 v, from which n leq 8.Note that in passing, we have solved a problem proposed at the XIII International Olympiad (see \\"Kvant\\" #12 for 1971, p.54, problem 2). Apparently, the full problem M130 b) was considered too difficult for the Olympiad by the international jury and was excluded, leaving only the first half.In connection with the proven statement, a whole series of questions arise, which cannot be solved by the beautiful but rather artificial method we have described. For example, what is the maximum number of points that can be placed in space so that all angles of triangles with vertices at these points are acute? From our solution, it is clear that 8 points cannot be placed (convince yourself of this). It is not difficult to construct an example with 5 points. Can there be 6? A more general and, probably, very difficult question - what is the maximum number of points that can be placed so that all angles do not exceed a given alpha?If any of the readers manage to make progress in solving these questions, we will return to them again.## AnswerAnswer: a) 4 points, b) 8 points.

For any set T, let s(T) denote the sum of the elements of T. (If T is empty, we let s(T)=0.)We first show that any positive integer k=2^{a} satisfies the desired property. Let B^{prime} be a subset of B with a elements, and let S=A cup B^{prime}. Recall that any nonnegative integer has a unique binary representation. Hence, for any integer t>sleft(B^{prime}right) and any subset B^{prime prime} subseteq B^{prime}, the number t-sleft(B^{prime prime}right) can be written as a sum of distinct elements of A in a unique way. This means that t can be written as a sum of distinct elements of B^{prime} in exactly 2^{a} ways.Next, assume that some positive integer k satisfies the desired property for a positive integer m geq 2 and a set S. Clearly, S is infinite.Lemma: For all sufficiently large x in S, the smallest element of S larger than x is 2 x.Proof of Lemma: Let x in S with x>3 m, and let xx+m. Then y-x can be written as a sum of distinct elements of S not including x in k ways. If y in S, then y can be written as a sum of distinct elements of S in at least k+1 ways, a contradiction. Suppose now that y leq x+m. We consider z in(2 x-m, 2 x). Similarly as before, z-x can be written as a sum of distinct elements of S not including x or y in k ways. If y in S, then since m2 x, a contradiction.From the Lemma, we have that S=T cup U, where T is finite and U={x, 2 x, 4 x, 8 x, ldots} for some positive integer x. Let y be any positive integer greater than s(T). For any subset T^{prime} subseteq T, if y-sleft(T^{prime}right) equiv 0(bmod x), then y-sleft(T^{prime}right) can be written as a sum of distinct elements of U in a unique way; otherwise y-sleft(T^{prime}right) cannot be written as a sum of distinct elements of U. Hence the number of ways to write y as a sum of distinct elements of S is equal to the number of subsets T^{prime} subseteq T such that sleft(T^{prime}right) equiv y(bmod x). Since this holds for all y, for any 0 leq a leq x-1 there are exactly k subsets T^{prime} subseteq T such that sleft(T^{prime}right) equiv a(bmod x). This means that there are k x subsets of T in total. But the number of subsets of T is a power of 2 , and therefore k is a power of 2 , as claimed.Solution 2.

Either grandma opened the ВК bag and broke the В pie (the probability of this is 1 / 3 cdot 1 / 2=1 / 6), or grandma opened the КК bag, broke one of the pies, then took the ВК bag and broke the В pie (the probability of this is 1 / 3 cdot 1 / 2 cdot 1 / 2=1 / 12). Therefore, the grandson will get a cabbage pie with a probability of 1 / 6+1 / 12=1 / 4, and a cherry pie with a probability of 3 / 4>2 / 3.The downside of this method is the risk of breaking half the pies.

It'll still be possible - but not if your method is to continue the diagram...So hopefully there's a pattern. We find a pattern by noticing what is changing from row 1 to row 2. Basically, for the next row, we are just adding 2 squares (1 on each side) to the number of squares we had in the previous row.  So each time we're adding 2. So how can we find N, if N is the number of squares in the a^text{th} row of this diagram? We can't just say that N = 1 + 2a, because it doesn't work for the first row. But since 1 is the first term, we have to EXCLUDE the first term, meaning that we must subtract 1 from a. Thus, N = 1 + 2times(a - 1) = 2a - 1. So in the 37th row we will have 2 times 37 - 1 = 74 - 1 = 73.You may now be thinking - aha, we're finished. But we're only half finished. We still need to find how many black squares there are in these 73 squares. Well let's see - they alternate white-black-white-black... but we can't divide by two - there aren't exactly as many white squares as black squares... there's always 1 more white square... aha! If we subtract 1 from the number of squares (1 white square), we will have exactly 2 times the number of black squares.Thus, the number of black squares is frac{73 - 1}{2} = frac{72}{2} = 3636 is boxed{text{C}}"},{"problem":"Given that i is the imaginary unit, the complex number z=(1+i)i corresponds to a point in (　　)A: The first quadrantB: The second quadrantC: The third quadrantD: The fourth quadrant","solution":"From the given, we know z=icdot(1+i)=-1+i,  Therefore, the point corresponding to the complex number Z has coordinates (-1,1), which is in the second quadrant,  Hence, the correct choice is boxed{text{B}}.

Understanding the Problem:   - We are given a string of length 66 composed of the letters (A), (T), (C), and (G).   - We need to find the maximum number of distinct substrings of this string.2.

Distinct Substrings:   - We need to ensure that all possible substrings are distinct.   - For a string of length 66, the number of substrings of length (k) is (67 - k).4. Graph Theory Approach:   - Consider a directed graph with vertex set ({A, T, C, G}^2).   - For all (x, y, z in {A, T, C, G}), draw an edge from (xy) to (yz) and label it with (xyz).   - This graph is connected and has all indegrees and outdegrees equal to 4, so it has an Eulerian cycle (a cycle that visits every edge exactly once).5. Eulerian Cycle:   - If such a cycle travels through (a_1a_2, a_2a_3, dots, a_{65}a_{66}) in that order, then (a_1 a_2 dots a_{66}) includes each three-letter string exactly once.   - This means that for all (k ge 3), all (67 - k) of the (k)-letter substrings will be distinct.6. Counting Distinct Substrings:   - There are 4 substrings of length 1 (since there are 4 distinct letters).   - There are (4^2 = 16) substrings of length 2.   - For substrings of length 3, there are (4^3 = 64) substrings.   - For substrings of length (k) where (k ge 3), there are (67 - k) distinct substrings.7.

Sum of Arithmetic Series:   - The sum of the first (n) natural numbers is given by:     [     S = frac{n(n + 1)}{2}     ]   - Here, (n = 64), so:     [     S = frac{64 cdot 65}{2} = 2080     ]9.

Therefore, the number of those looking at the back of the head will not change.An end soldier who was looking at the post will not do so after the turn; conversely, if he was not looking at the post, he will be after the turn. Thus, the number of those looking at the post will either remain the same (was 1 and will remain 1), or increase by 2 (was 0, will become 2), or decrease by 2 (was 2, will become 0).Since the total number of soldiers is constant, the number of those looking at the face will either remain the same, or increase or decrease by 2.According to the problem, the number of soldiers looking at the face was initially one-sixth of the number looking at the back of the head, and then one-seventh.

After dividing the numerator and denominator by 32 , we get frac{B}{A}=frac{12 n}{4+n}. We require that frac{B}{A} be equal to some integer, so we will determine which integers frac{12 n}{4+n} can be.First, note that n is positive, so both 12 n and 4+n are positive, which means frac{12 n}{4+n} is positive. This means frac{12 n}{4+n} is a positive integer, so we determine which positive integers frac{12 n}{4+n} can equal. If frac{12 n}{4+n}=1, then 12 n=4+n which can be rearranged to give 11 n=4 or n=frac{4}{11}.Since n must be an integer, we conclude that frac{12 n}{4+n} cannot be equal to 1 .What if frac{12 n}{4+n}=2 ? In this case, we need 12 n to be twice as large as 4+n, or 12 n=8+2 n. This can be rearranged to give 10 n=8 or n=frac{8}{10}.Again, this value of n is not an integer, so we conclude that frac{12 n}{4+n} is not 2 .Following this reasoning, if frac{12 n}{4+n} is 3 , we find that n must be frac{4}{3}, which is also not an integer, so frac{12 n}{4+n} is not equal to 3 .If frac{12 n}{4+n} is equal to 4 , we have that 12 n is four times 4+n, or 12 n=16+4 n.Rearranging this gives 8 n=16 which means n=2. Therefore, frac{12 n}{4+n} can be 4 , and it happens when n=2.We continue in this way for all possible positive integer values of frac{12 n}{4+n} up to and including frac{12 n}{4+n}=11.The results are summarized in the table below.| frac{12 n}{n+4} | n | n is an integer || :---: | :---: | :---: || 1 | frac{4}{11} | times || 2 | frac{8}{10} | times || 3 | frac{4}{3} | times || 4 | 2 | checkmark || 5 | frac{20}{7} | times || 6 | 4 | checkmark || 7 | frac{28}{5} | times || 8 | 8 | checkmark || 9 | 12 | checkmark || 10 | 20 | checkmark || 11 | 44 | checkmark |According to the table, frac{12 n}{4+n} can be any of the integers 4,6,8,9,10, and 11 and these occur when n is equal to 2,4,8,12,20, and 44 , respectively.We now consider what happens when frac{12 n}{4+n} is 12 or greater.If frac{12 n}{4+n}=12, then 12 n is 12 times as large as 4+n, or 12 n=48+12 n.Since 48+12 n is always greater than 12 n, there is no value of n for which 12 n=48+12 n.Similarly, since n is a positive integer, there is no value of n for which frac{12 n}{4+n} is 13 or greater.We conclude that the only possible positive integer values of frac{12 n}{4+n} are those in the table, so the only values of n which make frac{12 n}{4+n} an integer are 2,4,8,12,20, and 44 .The sum of these numbers is 2+4+8+12+20+44=90."},{"problem":"An ellipse has its center at the origin, with foci (F_1) and (F_2) on the (x)-axis, and point (P(2, sqrt{3})) lies on the ellipse.

It is a curious fact that there is only one other sum of money, in pounds, shillings and pence (all similarly repetitions of one figure), of which the digits shall add up the same as the digits of the amount in pence. What is the other sum of money?","solution":"We are looking for k = 1, 2, 3, ... , or 9 and n = 1, 2, 3, ... such that the digit sum of k ... k (n ks) and k and k is the same as that of (240 k ... k + 12k + k). But in the case of k = 1, we can also have 11s 1d, 1s 11d or 11s 11d. The difficulty is that it is not clear how to find the digit sum for the number of pence which is 240 k ... k + 12k + k. Let us take k = 1. Taking 1, 2, 3, 4 digits in the number of pounds we get: 253, 2653, 26653, 266653. The pattern is fairly clear - with n digits we get n-1 6s and a digit sum of 10 + 6(n-1) = 6n + 4. The number of digits in the Â£ s d expression is n + 2, so they can obviously never be the same. To prove the pattern we could use induction. Suppose that it is true for n 1s. If we move to (n+1) 1s we increase k ... k by 10 n and hence 240 k ... k by 240.10 n = 2.10 n+2 + 4.10 n+1 . The value for n 1s is 2.10 n+1 + lower powers of 10, so we change the first digit from 2 to 6 and place an additional 2 in front. In other words, we insert a 6 after the initial 2. That establishes the result. Similarly, for k = 2, we get 506, 5306, 53306, ... so the two digit sums are 11 + 3(n-1) = 3n+8 and 2(n+2). Again they can never be equal. For k = 3, we get 759, 7959, 79959, ... , so the two digit sums are 12 + 9n and 3(n+2). Again they cannot be equal. For k = 4, we get 1012, 10612, 106612, ... , so the two digit sums are 4 + 6(n-1) = 6n-2 and 4(n+2). They are equal if n = 5. So we get the solution Â£44,444 4s 4d = 10,666,612d, both with digit sum 28. For k = 5, we get 1265, 13265, 133265, ... , so the two digit sums are 14 + 3(n-1) = 3n+11 and 5(n+2), which has no solutions. For k = 6, we get 1518, 15918, 159918, ... , so the two digit sums are 15 + 9(n-1) = 9n+6 and 6(n+2), which has the solution n = 2, giving the solution in the question. For k = 7, we get 1771, 18571, 186571, 1866571, 18666571, ... , so the digit sums are 22 + 6(n-2) = 6n+10 (which also works for n = 1) and 7(n+2), so there are no solutions. For k = 8, we get 2024, 21224, 213224, 2133224, 21333224, ... , so the digit sums are 11 + 3(n-2) = 3n+5 (which also works for n =1) and 8(n+2), so there are no solutions. For k = 9, we get 2277, 23877, 239877, 2399877, ... , so the digit sums are 27 + 9(n-2) = 9n+9 (which also works for n = 1) and 9(n+2), so there are no solutions. Finally, we need to check the other cases for k = 1. For 1s 11d, we increase both digit sums by 1, so there are still no solutions. For 11s 1d, we increase the pence digit sum by 3 to 6n+7 and the Â£ s d digit sum by 1 to n+3, so there are still no solutions. For 11s 11d, we increase the pence digit sum by 4 to 6n+8 and the Â£ s d digit sum by 2 to n+4, so there are still no solutions.

Then ( r leq frac{n+1}{2} < n ).   - There exists a ( k ) such that ( r mid 4k^2 - 1 ). This can be achieved by choosing ( k equiv frac{1}{2} pmod{r} ).6. Contradiction for ( k ):   - For this ( k ), ( r mid 4k^2 + n ). Since ( 4k^2 + n > r ), ( 4k^2 + n ) cannot be a prime, leading to a contradiction.   - Hence, ( n ) must be a Mersenne prime.7. Manual Check for Small ( p ):   - For ( p = 2 ), ( n = 2^2 - 1 = 3 ).   - For ( p = 3 ), ( n = 2^3 - 1 = 7 ).8. Exclusion of Larger ( p ):   - Assume ( p geq 5 ). Then ( n = 2^p - 1 ).   - Consider ( n + 9 = 2^p + 8 = 8(2^{p-3} + 1) ).   - Since ( 2^{p-3} + 1 ) is odd, there exists a prime ( r mid 2^{p-3} + 1 ).   - ( r mid frac{n + 9}{8} < n ), so ( r leq n - 1 ).   - There exists a ( k ) such that ( 4k^2 equiv 9 pmod{r} ). This can be achieved by choosing ( k equiv frac{3}{2} pmod{r} ).   - For this ( k ), ( r mid 4k^2 + n ) but ( 4k^2 + n > r ), leading to a contradiction.9. Conclusion:   - Therefore, the only possible values for ( n ) are the Mersenne primes for ( p < 5 ), which are ( n = 3 ) and ( n = 7 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 3, 7 } )."},{"problem":"4.

In how many ways can three points be chosen from the marked 124 points so that they form the vertices of a right triangle?","solution":"Answer: 7908.Solution. There are two possibilities.1) The hypotenuse of the triangle lies on one of the lines, and the vertex of the right angle is on the second line. Let ABC be the given triangle with a right angle at vertex C, and CH be its height dropped to the hypotenuse. From the proportionality of the segments of the right triangle, we get that CH^2 = AH cdot BH, i.e., AH cdot BH = 4. Since AH and BH are integers, the following cases are possible: AH = BH = 2, AH = 4 and BH = 1, AH = 1 and BH = 4.In the first of these cases, the hypotenuse AB, equal to 4, can be placed in 58 cdot 2 = 116 ways (62 - 4 ways of placement on each of the two given lines), and the position of vertex C is uniquely determined.In the second and third cases, the length of the hypotenuse is 5, and it can be placed in 2(62 - 5) = 114 ways. For each position of the hypotenuse, there are two ways to place the vertex - this gives 2 cdot 114 = 228 ways.2) One of the legs of the triangle (let's call it BC) is perpendicular to the given lines, and the second leg (AC) lies on one of the given lines. Then the position of the leg BC can be chosen in 62 ways. For each variant of the placement of the leg BC, the vertex A can be placed in 122 ways (all points except the already chosen B and C are suitable) - in total, we get 62 cdot 122 = 7564 ways.In total, we get 116 + 228 + 7564 = 7908 ways."},{"problem":"Rotate the parabola y=3x^2-6x+5 around its vertex by 180°, then translate it along the axis of symmetry to obtain a new parabola that intersects the line y=-x-2 at the point (2, m).

Constructing the Configuration:   - Connect the capital city ( C ) to each of the ( n ) cities with a two-way airline.   - This gives us ( n ) two-way airlines.   - Now, consider the remaining connections among the ( n ) cities ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ).6. Ensuring Maximum Connections:   - To maximize the number of two-way airlines, we need to ensure that each city ( A_i ) has as many connections as possible without violating the constraints.   - Each city ( A_i ) can have ( n - 1 ) connections with the other ( n - 1 ) cities.   - However, since ( d_{A_i} + d_{A_j} leq n ) for any two cities ( A_i ) and ( A_j ) not connected by a two-way airline, we need to carefully distribute the connections.7. Optimal Configuration:   - The optimal configuration is to connect each city ( A_i ) to the capital city ( C ) and then distribute the remaining connections among the ( n ) cities such that the constraints are satisfied.   - This can be achieved by creating a complete graph among the ( n ) cities, where each city ( A_i ) is connected to every other city ( A_j ) with a two-way airline.8. Calculating the Maximum Number of Two-Way Airlines:   - The capital city ( C ) has ( n ) connections.   - Each of the ( n ) cities ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) has ( n - 1 ) connections with the other cities.   - The total number of two-way airlines is given by the sum of the connections:     [     text{Total two-way airlines} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} + n = frac{n(n-1) + 2n}{2} = frac{n^2 + n}{2}     ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{n^2 + n}{2}})."},{"problem":"The value range of the function y=2tan(x- frac{pi}{6}), where x in left[-frac{pi}{6}, frac{5pi}{12}right], is (　　)A: [-2,2]B: [-1,1]C: [-2sqrt{3},2]D: [-sqrt{3},1]","solution":"For the function y=2tan(x- frac{pi}{6}), since x in left[-frac{pi}{6}, frac{5pi}{12}right], it follows that x- frac{pi}{6} in left[-frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{4}right],Therefore, y=2tan(x- frac{pi}{6}) in [-2sqrt{3},2],Hence, the correct choice is: boxed{C}.This problem mainly examines the domain and range of the tangent function, and it is considered a basic question."},{"problem":"The Fibonacci numbers are defined by F_1=F_2=1 and F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2} for n>2.

Find the probability that, after 10 shuffles, 6 is higher in the pile than 3.","solution":"1. Define ( p_k ) as the probability that card 6 is higher in the pile than card 3 after ( k ) shuffles.2. We need to consider two cases for the ( k )-th shuffle:   - Case 1: Card 6 is higher than card 3 after ( k-1 ) shuffles. This happens with probability ( p_{k-1} ). In this case, the ( k )-th shuffle involves picking a card that is not card 3, which has a probability of ( frac{5}{6} ). Therefore, the contribution to ( p_k ) from this case is ( frac{5p_{k-1}}{6} ).   - Case 2: Card 6 is not higher than card 3 after ( k-1 ) shuffles. This happens with probability ( 1 - p_{k-1} ). In this case, the ( k )-th shuffle must involve picking card 6, which has a probability of ( frac{1}{6} ). Therefore, the contribution to ( p_k ) from this case is ( frac{1 - p_{k-1}}{6} ).3. Combining these two cases, we get the recurrence relation:   [   p_k = frac{5p_{k-1}}{6} + frac{1 - p_{k-1}}{6} = frac{4p_{k-1} + 1}{6}   ]4. To solve this recurrence relation, we use the given formula ( p_n = frac{3^n - 2^n}{2 cdot 3^n} ). We need to verify that this formula satisfies the recurrence relation and initial condition.5. Initial Condition:   - Initially, card 6 is not higher than card 3, so ( p_0 = 0 ).6. Verification:   - For ( n = 0 ):     [     p_0 = frac{3^0 - 2^0}{2 cdot 3^0} = frac{1 - 1}{2 cdot 1} = 0     ]     This matches the initial condition.   - Assume ( p_{k-1} = frac{3^{k-1} - 2^{k-1}}{2 cdot 3^{k-1}} ). We need to show that:     [     p_k = frac{4p_{k-1} + 1}{6}     ]     Substituting ( p_{k-1} ):     [     p_k = frac{4 left( frac{3^{k-1} - 2^{k-1}}{2 cdot 3^{k-1}} right) + 1}{6} = frac{2(3^{k-1} - 2^{k-1}) + 3^{k-1}}{6 cdot 3^{k-1}} = frac{3^k - 2^k}{2 cdot 3^k}     ]     This confirms that the formula satisfies the recurrence relation.7. Therefore, after 10 shuffles, the probability that card 6 is higher than card 3 is:   [   p_{10} = frac{3^{10} - 2^{10}}{2 cdot 3^{10}}   ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{3^{10} - 2^{10}}{2 cdot 3^{10}}})."},{"problem":"1.

The coordinates of the midpoint ( C ) are:   [   x = frac{a + b}{2} = frac{a + frac{3a pm sqrt{80 - a^2}}{5}}{2} = frac{8a pm sqrt{80 - a^2}}{10}   ]   [   y = frac{a + 2b}{2} = frac{a + 2 cdot frac{3a pm sqrt{80 - a^2}}{5}}{2} = frac{11a pm 2sqrt{80 - a^2}}{10}   ]6. To eliminate the parameter ( a ), we use the relationship:   [   2(10x - 8a) = 10y - 11a implies a = 2(2x - y)   ]7. Substituting ( a = 2(2x - y) ) into the equation for ( x ):   [   x = frac{8(2x - y) pm sqrt{80 - (2(2x - y))^2}}{5} = frac{8(2x - y) pm sqrt{80 - 4(2x - y)^2}}{5}   ]8.

Use 12 points v_{1}, v_{2}, cdots, v_{12} to represent 12 friends. When two friends sit at the same table for the first time in week i, a line labeled i is drawn between the points representing these two friends, where i=1,2, ldots. Thus, the problem is transformed into determining the minimum number of weeks required to form a complete graph K_{12} in this manner.It is known that the number of edges in K_{12} is C_{12}^{2}=66.In the first week, the number of edges labeled 1 is 3 times C_{4}^{2}=18.In the second week, the 4 people who sat at the same table in the first week are seated at 3 different tables, so at least two of them will sit together, thus at least one edge labeled 2 is missing. With 3 tables, at least 3 edges are missing, so the number of edges labeled 2 is at most 18-3=15.Similarly, when i geqslant 3, the number of edges labeled i is at most 15.Since 18+15+15+15=63<66, the number of weeks required is geqslant 5.Next, we construct a seating arrangement that can achieve the required conditions in 5 weeks.Since 66=18+12+12+12+12, starting from the second week, it is sufficient to generate 4 new edges per table each week.Divide the 12 people into 6 pairs, with the same pair always sitting at the same table, and different pairs sitting together exactly once in 5 weeks.

It is easy to see that there are neither monochromatic triangles nor monochromatic quadrilaterals in the graph. Therefore, the smallest natural number n geqslant 31.Below, we prove that when n=31, there must be a monochromatic triangle or a monochromatic quadrilateral in the graph. At this point, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be 16 edges of the same color in the graph. Therefore, it is only necessary to prove that in a simple graph with 10 vertices and 16 edges, there must be a triangle or a quadrilateral.Since there are 32 endpoints in the 16 edges, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be a vertex that is connected to at most 3 edges. Without loss of generality, assume vertex A_{10} is connected to 3 edges. Thus, there are 13 edges among the remaining 9 points. The 13 edges have 26 endpoints, and by the pigeonhole principle, there must be a vertex that is connected to at most 2 edges. Without loss of generality, assume A_{9} is connected to 2 edges. Thus, the subgraph with vertices left{A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{8}right} has 11 edges. The 11 edges have 22 endpoints, and by the pigeonhole principle, there must be a vertex that is connected to at most 2 edges. Without loss of generality, assume A_{8} is connected to 2 edges.

At this point, there must be a cycle in the graph. If the cycle with the most edges has 6 edges, then the 7th edge, regardless of which two vertices it connects, will always form a triangle or a quadrilateral. If the cycle with the most edges has 5 edges, then the other two edges either both come from vertices outside the cycle, or at least one is a diagonal of the pentagon. In either case, a triangle or a quadrilateral is formed. If the cycle with the most edges has at most 4 edges, the conclusion is obviously true.

The rules are that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year unless it is divisible by 100 but not 400. So 1948, 2000 are leap years, but 1900 is not. There are 365 = 52·7 + 1 days in a non-leap year and 366 = 52·7 + 2 days in a leap year. Suppose that NY day in year 0 is day 0 and that year 0 is the year after a leap year. Suppose that we do not encounter any centuries. So NY day in year 1 is day 1, NY day in year 2 is day 2 etc. We get: Leap * * * * * * * Year 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Day 0 1 2 3 5 6 0 1 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 6 0 1 2 4 5 6 0 2 3 4 5 0 This is periodic with period 28 years. Note that in a complete period we have just 4 of each day. Now 100 = 3·28 + 16, so if NY day 2001 is day 0, then NY day 2101 would be day 6. But since 2100 is not a leap year, it is actually day 5. Similarly, NY day 2201 is day 3 and NY day 2301 is day 1. However, NY day 2401 is not day 6, but day 0, because 2400 is again a leap year. So we have a period of 400 years. Note that in years 0-15 above we have 2 of each day except 1 and 3 which both have 3 days. Thus in the 100 NY days starting with day 0 in 2001, we an excess of 1 each for days 1 and 3. 2001-2100 (NY day 2001 is day 0) excess of 1 each for day 1 and day 3 2101-2200 (NY day 2101 is day 5) excess of 1 each for day 6 and day 1 2201-2301 (NY day 2201 is day 3) excess of 1 each for day 4 and day 6 2301-2400 (NY day 2301 is day 1) excess of 1 each for day 2 and day 4 Thus over the whole 400 year period we find that if day 0 has n NY days, then we get day 0 has n day 1 has n+2 day 2 has n+1 day 3 has n+1 day 4 has n+2 day 5 has n day 6 has n+2 Note that 1 Jan = 32 Dec = 62 Nov = 93 Oct = 23 Oct + 70, so NY day 1949 is a Saturday. Hence NY day 1977 also. So NY day 2000 (23 years later) is also a Saturday (referring to the table above). So NY day 2001 is a Monday (2000 was a leap year). So day 6 is Sunday.

This contradicts our earlier conditions.   - Case 2: ( p mid n^6 - 1 ):     Since ( n^6 - 1 = (n^2 - 1)(n^4 + n^2 + 1) ), we have:     [     p^2 mid (n^2 - 1)(n^4 + n^2 + 1)     ]     Since ( gcd(n^2 - 1, n^4 + n^2 + 1) mid 2 ), we consider:     - If ( p^2 mid n^2 - 1 ), then ( n^2 equiv 1 pmod{p^2} ).

Thus, the answer is: boxed{2x-y-1=0}  By connecting the center of the circle with point P, and knowing that P is the midpoint of chord MN, according to the converse of the perpendicular diameter theorem, this line is perpendicular to chord MN.

The equation of the line on which chord MN lies can be written using the slope found and the coordinates of point P.  This problem examines the properties of the intersection of a line and a circle, involving knowledge of the standard equation of a circle, the relationship between the slopes of two perpendicular lines, the perpendicular diameter theorem, and the point-slope form of the equation of a line.

Once we know which numbers can appear in the fields, we can start filling them in one of the empty fields and then examine whether and how to proceed further. This way, we can rule out all possibilities except the one mentioned above. (For example, if we fill in A = 1, then from the requirement 1 cdot A cdot B = 2018 it follows that B = 2018.

Note that x+y geqslant 0, since the left side of the equation is an integer, and therefore the right side of the equation must also be an integer. Assuming y=-x, we get the impossible equality -x^{2}=1. Henceforth, we assume x+y>0.Consider two cases: (1) - y is divisible by 2 to no lesser degree than x, and (2) - to a lesser degree.1) In this case, x=2^{s} u and y=2^{s} v, where s, u, and v are integers, s geqslant 0, and u is odd. Substituting these x and y into the equation, we get:2^{2 s}left(u^{2}-2 v^{2}right)=2^{2^{s}(u+v)}Since the left side of the last equality is divisible by 2^{2 s} but not by 2^{2 s+1}, and the right side is divisible by 2^{2^{s}(u+v)} but not by 2^{2^{s}(u+v)+1}, we obtain the equality of exponents: s=2^{s-1}(u+v). If u+v=1, then s=1 or s=2. Substituting these assumptions into the expressions for x and y, in both cases we get the equation u^{2}-4 u+3=0. This equation has roots 1 and 3, and for s=1 we get the solutions (2,0) and (6,-4), and for s=2-(4,0) and (12,-8). If u+v>1, then 2^{s-1}(u+v) geqslant 2^{s}=(1+1)^{s}=1+s+ldots>s, and the equality is not achieved.2) In this case, x=2^{s+1} u and y=2^{s} v, where s, u, and v are integers, s geqslant 0, and v is odd. Substituting these x and y into the equation, we get:2^{2 s+1}left(2 u^{2}-v^{2}right)=2^{2^{s}(2 u+v)}Since the left side of equality (3) is divisible by 2^{2 s+1} but not by 2^{2 s+2}, and the right side is divisible by 2^{2^{s}(2 u+v)} but not by 2^{2^{s}(2 u+v)+1}, we obtain the equality of exponents: 2 s+1=2^{s}(2 u+v). Since the left side is an odd number, s=0, and2 u+v=1Moreover, from (3) it follows that 2 u^{2}-v^{2}=1. Substituting v=1-2 u here, we find that u=1.

Angle Consideration:   - The angle ( angle AOB ) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( 360^circ ).   - The probability that ( cos(angle AOB) > 1 - frac{x^2}{20000} ) is equivalent to the fraction of the circle's circumference where this condition holds.   - The cosine function is symmetric and periodic with period ( 360^circ ).

On the plate, there are various pancakes with three fillings: 2 with meat, 3 with cottage cheese, and 5 with strawberries. Svetlana ate them all sequentially, choosing each subsequent pancake at random. Find the probability that the first and last pancakes eaten were with the same filling.","solution":"Answer: frac{14}{45}.Solution: Two pancakes with the same filling can be either with meat, cottage cheese, or strawberries. Let's calculate the probabilities of each of these events and add them up. Arrange the pancakes in the order they are eaten. The probability that the first pancake is with meat is frac{2}{10}. The probability that the last pancake is with meat is the same as the probability that the pancake with meat is in any other position. Therefore, this probability is frac{1}{9}, since after choosing the first pancake, only 9 pancakes remain, one of which is with meat. Thus, the probability that the first and last pancakes are with meat is frac{2}{10} cdot frac{1}{9}=frac{2}{90}. Similarly, we find the probability that the first and last pancakes are with cottage cheese, which is frac{3}{10} cdot frac{2}{9}=frac{6}{90}. And the probability that the first and last pancakes are with strawberries is frac{5}{10} cdot frac{4}{9}=frac{20}{90}. Therefore, the answer to the problem is frac{2}{90}+frac{6}{90}+frac{20}{90}=frac{28}{90}=frac{14}{45}.Remark: The probability that the first and last pancakes are with meat can also be calculated as follows. There are frac{10!}{2!3!5!} ways to arrange our 10 pancakes in a row, and among them, there are frac{8}{3!5!} ways to arrange them in a row so that the pancakes with meat are at the beginning and the end.

If they are randomly arranged in a row, how many arrangements are there such that books of the same subject are not adjacent? (Answer with a number)","solution":"First, let's calculate the total number of arrangements for the 5 books without any restrictions. This is a permutation problem, as the order of the books matters. The formula for permutations is P(n, r) = frac{n!}{(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to arrange. In this case, n = r = 5, so the total number of arrangements is P(5, 5) = frac{5!}{0!} = 120.Next, we need to subtract the arrangements where books of the same subject are adjacent. We'll consider two cases:1. Two Chinese books are adjacent: We can treat these two books as a single unit, so now we have 4 units to arrange (2 math books, 1 physics book, and the unit of 2 Chinese books). The number of arrangements for these 4 units is P(4, 4) = frac{4!}{0!} = 24. However, within the unit of 2 Chinese books, there are P(2, 2) = frac{2!}{0!} = 2 possible arrangements. Therefore, the total number of arrangements with the two Chinese books adjacent is 24 times 2 = 48.2. Two math books are adjacent: This case is similar to the previous one. Treating the two math books as a single unit, we have 4 units to arrange (2 Chinese books, 1 physics book, and the unit of 2 math books). The number of arrangements for these 4 units is again P(4, 4) = 24, and the number of arrangements within the unit of 2 math books is P(2, 2) = 2. So, the total number of arrangements with the two math books adjacent is also 24 times 2 = 48.However, we've double-counted the arrangements where both the Chinese books and the math books are adjacent. To correct this, we need to add back these arrangements. If both pairs of books are adjacent, we have 3 units to arrange (the unit of 2 Chinese books, the unit of 2 math books, and the 1 physics book). The number of arrangements for these 3 units is P(3, 3) = frac{3!}{0!} = 6. Within each unit of 2 books, there are P(2, 2) = 2 arrangements, so the total number of arrangements with both pairs of books adjacent is 6 times 2 times 2 = 24.Finally, to find the number of arrangements where books of the same subject are not adjacent, we subtract the arrangements with adjacent books from the total arrangements: 120 - 48 - 48 + 24 = boxed{48}."},{"problem":"The correct proposition among the following is (    )A: Analogical reasoning is a reasoning from general to specificB: The conclusion of deductive reasoning is always correctC: The conclusion of abductive reasoning is always correctD: The conclusion of deductive reasoning is always correct when both the premise and the form of reasoning are correct","solution":"Solution: Inductive reasoning is a reasoning from part to whole; analogical reasoning is a reasoning from specific to specific; deductive reasoning is a reasoning from general to specific; the conclusion of abductive reasoning is not necessarily correct, and cannot be used as a step in proof.

Then, from c mid(a+b)^{2}, we get c mid 4 a^{2}. Therefore, c can be a, 2a, 4a, a^2, 2a^2, 4a^2. Substituting these into the equation, when c=2a, a=2; when c=4a, a=3; when c=a^2, a=2, all satisfy the problem's conditions. The corresponding solutions are:(a, b, c)=(3,3,3),(2,2,4),(3,3,12).2^{circ} Suppose a>b.From a mid b+c we get b+c=k a (k in mathbf{N}), so c=k a-b, and c+a=(k+1) a-b. Then, from b mid a+c we know b mid (k+1) a. Since a and b are different primes, we have b mid k+1. Let k+1=m b (m in mathbf{N}), then c=(m b-1) a-b=m a b-a-b, and a+b+c=m a b. Therefore, frac{(a+b+c)^{2}}{a b c}=frac{m a b(a+b+c)}{a b c}=m+frac{m(a+b)}{c} in mathbf{N}. Thus, m(a+b)=n c=m n a b-n a-n b (n in mathbf{N}), which simplifies to m n a b=(m+n)(a+b). Since a and b are different primes, we must have a mid m+n and b mid m+n, so a b mid m+n. Let m+n=t a b (t in mathbf{N}), then m n=t(a+b). Using t(a+b)-t a b+1=m n-(m+n)+1=(m-1)(n-1) geqslant 0 (since m, n in mathbf{N}), we get t(a b-a-b) leqslant 1, or t[(a-1)(b-1)-1] leqslant 1.

Line segments (EF) and (GH) divide rectangle (ABCD) into four smaller rectangles. Therefore, there must be a smaller rectangle, let's say rectangle (AEOG), which contains at least two of the given five points (including the boundary, hereinafter the same). Suppose points (M) and (N) are in the smaller rectangle (AEOG), as shown in Figure 5.(1) If rectangle (OHCF) contains no more than one known point, consider any known point (X) not in rectangle (OHCF) and different from (M)Figure 5 and (N). It is easy to see that the set of three points ((M, N, X)) is either in rectangle (ABHG) or in rectangle (AEFD). By the lemma, ((M, N, X)) is a good set. Since there are at least two such points (X), there are at least two good sets.(2) If rectangle (OHCF) contains at least two known points, let's say known points (P) and (Q) are both in rectangle (OHCF), and consider the remaining last known point (R). If (R) is in rectangle (OFDG), then the set of three points ((M, N, R)) is in rectangle (AEFD), and the set of three points ((P, Q, R)) is in rectangle (GHCD), thus they are both good sets. Therefore, there are at least two good sets. Similarly, if point (R) is in rectangle (EBHO), there are also at least two good sets. If point (R) is in rectangle (OHCF) or rectangle (AEOG), let's say point (R) is in rectangle (OHCF). As shown in Figure 6, we examine the convex hull of the five known points (M), (N), (P), (Q), and (R), which must be within the convex hexagon (AEHCFG). AndFigure 6[ S_{text{hexagon } ABHCFG} = 1 - frac{1}{8} - frac{1}{8} = frac{3}{4}. ]We will discuss the following three cases:(i) If the convex hull of (M), (N), (P), (Q), and (R) is a convex pentagon, let's say it contains point (M), and let the midpoint of (AD) be (E), then (S_{triangle M RD} > S_{triangle B BD} = frac{1}{4}). Therefore, ((M, B, D)) is not a good set, and[ S_{triangle M BC} = frac{1}{2}, S_{triangle M CD} > S_{triangle S CD} = frac{1}{4}. ]Thus, ((M, B, C)) and ((M, C, D)) are not good sets.If a set of three points contains both (M) and (N), then,[ begin{array}{l}S_{triangle M AC} = 1 - S_{triangle N BC} - S_{triangle M CD} - S_{triangle M MV} = 1 - frac{3}{5} S_{triangle triangle B C} - frac{3}{5} S_{triangle A CD} - frac{4}{25} S_{triangle A BD} = 1 - frac{3}{10} - frac{3}{10} - frac{2}{25} = frac{8}{25} > frac{1}{4}.end{array} ]Therefore, ((M, N, C)) is not a good set.However, (S_{triangle M NB} = S_{triangle M ND} = frac{3}{25} < frac{1}{4}), thus, there are exactly two good sets ((M, N, B)) and ((M, N, D)).Therefore, the minimum number of triangles with an area not greater than (frac{1}{4}) is 2.In the five points (M), (N), (B), (C), and (D), there are exactly two good sets.In fact, ((B, C, D)) is clearly not a good set. AndIf a set of three points contains exactlyLet it be (MNPQR), as shown in Figure 7, at this time[ S_{triangle M QR} + S_{triangle M NQ} + S_{triangle N PQ} leq frac{3}{4}. ]Thus, ((M, Q, R)), ((M, N, Q)), and ((N, P, Q)) contain at least one good set. Since ((P, Q, R)) is in rectangle (OHCF), it is of course a good set, so there are at least two good sets.Figure 7Figure 8(ii) If the convex hull of (M), (N), (P), (Q), and (R) is a convex quadrilateral, let's say it is (A_1A_2A_3A_4), and the other known point is (A_5), as shown in Figure 8, where (A_1 in {M, N, P, Q, R} (i=1,2,3,4,5)).

Therefore, the sum of each group of four consecutive terms (beginning with the first term) is,begin{aligned}n^{2}-(n+1)^{2}-(n+2)^{2}+(n+3)^{2} & =n^{2}-left(n^{2}+2 n+1right)-left(n^{2}+4 n+4right)+left(n^{2}+6 n+9right) & =n^{2}-n^{2}-2 n-1-n^{2}-4 n-4+n^{2}+6 n+9 & =n^{2}-n^{2}-n^{2}+n^{2}-2 n-4 n+6 n+9-1-4 & =4end{aligned}ANswer: (E)"},{"problem":"7.008. frac{81^{frac{1}{log _{5} 9}}+3^{frac{3}{log _{sqrt{6}} 3}}}{409} cdotleft((sqrt{7})^{frac{2}{log _{25} 7}}-125^{log _{25} 6}right)","solution":"## Решение.frac{81^{frac{1}{log _{5} 9}}+3^{frac{3}{log _{sqrt{6}}}}}{409} cdotleft((sqrt{7})^{frac{2}{log _{25} 7}}-125^{log _{25} 6}right)==frac{9^{2 log _{9} 5}+3^{3 log _{3} sqrt{6}}}{409} cdotleft(left(7^{frac{1}{2}}right)^{2 log _{7} 25}-5^{3 log _{5} 26}right)=frac{9^{log _{9} 5^{2}}+3^{log _{3}(sqrt{6})}}{409} timestimesleft(7^{log _{7} 25}-5^{log _{5} 6^{frac{3}{2}}}right)=frac{left(25+6^{frac{3}{2}}right)left(25-6^{frac{3}{2}}right)}{409}=frac{625-216}{409}=1.Omвem: 1."},{"problem":"3.

Determine the minimum possible value of varphi(6 n).","solution":"Solution: The answer is 8 .Solution 1: Recall that if a positive integer m has prime factorization p_{1}^{e_{1}} p_{2}^{e_{2}} ldots p_{t}^{e_{t}}, where p_{1}, ldots, p_{t} are distinct primes, then the number of positive divisors of m is varphi(m)=left(e_{1}+right. 1) left(e_{2}+1right) ldotsleft(e_{t}+1right)left({ }^{*}right). Note that each term in this product is at least 2 .Since 2 n is an even positive integer with 6 positive divisors, 2 n=2^{5}, 2^{2} cdot p or 2 cdot p^{2}, where p is some odd prime number. Therefore, n=2^{4}=16,2 p or p^{2}. Therefore, 6 n=6 times 16=96,12 p or 6 p^{2}.Note that varphi(96)=varphileft(2^{5} times 3^{1}right)=6 times 2=12.If p=3, then varphi(12 p)=varphi(36)=varphileft(2^{2} times 3^{2}right)=3 times 3=9 and varphileft(6 p^{2}right)=varphi(54)=varphileft(2^{1} times 3^{3}right)= 2 times 4=8.It remains to show the case when p>3. So far the minimum value obtained for varphi(6 n)=8. If p>3, then 6 n contains at least 3 different prime divisors. Then by left({ }^{*}right), the number of positive divisors of 6 n is at least 2 times 2 times 2=8. Therefore, varphi(6 n) geq 8 for all positive integers n. As we have shown, n=9 yields varphi(6 n)=8. Therefore, the answer is 8 .Solution 2: Note that four positive divisors of 2 n are 1,2, n and 2 n. Note also that n=2 does not satisfy varphi(2 n)=6. Therefore, n geq 2 and consequently, 1,2, n and 2 n are all distinct.Since 2 n has 6 positive divisors, there are two other positive divisors a, b of 2, n, with a, b>2. Then the set of positive divisors of 2 n is {1,2, a, b, n, 2 n}.Now consider the positive divisors of 6 n. Note that the set of positive divisors of 6 n contains those of 2 n. Further note that 3 n and 6 n are positive divisors of 6 n, which are not positive divisors of 2 n. Hence, the set of positive divisors of 6 n contains {1,2, a, b, n, 2 n, 3 n, 6 n}. Therefore, varphi(6 n) geq 8.We will show that this minimum can be obtained. Since {1,2, a, b, n, 2 n, 3 n, 6 n} are the positive divisors of 6 n and appear in increasing order, a cdot 2 n=6 n and b n=6 n. Multiplying both equations and dividing both sides by 2 n^{2} yield a b=18. But since {1,2, a, b, n, 2 n} are the positive divisors of 2 n, a b=2 n. Therefore, 2 n=18, from which we can conclude that n=9 is a candidate which yields varphi(2 n)=6 and varphi(6 n)=8.This can be easily verified, since the positive divisors of 18 are {1,2,3,6,9,18}.

(The case where the roles of the two points A and B are swapped is obtained by interchanging these points.)Thus, we haveangle A C M = angle M C W = angle W C H = angle H C B = 22.5^{circ}By definition, angle B H C = 90^{circ}, so due to the sum of the interior angles in the triangle triangle B H C, we haveangle C B A = angle C B H = 180^{circ} - angle H C B - angle B H C = 67.5^{circ}Due to the sum of the interior angles in the triangle triangle A B C, we then have angle B A C = 180^{circ} - angle A C B - angle C B A = 22.5^{circ}. Thus, the two remaining interior angles of the triangle triangle A B C are uniquely determined (up to swapping), provided such a triangle exists.Now, let us consider a triangle triangle A B C with angle B A C = 22.5^{circ}, angle C B A = 67.5^{circ}, and angle A C B = 90^{circ}, and let the points H, W, and M be defined as above. Then, due to the definition of the angle bisector, angle A C W = angle W C B = frac{90^{circ}}{2} = 45^{circ}.By the Thales' theorem, C, A, and B lie on the circle centered at M passing through A, so |A M| = |B M| = |C M|.

Therefore, (z = bi + frac{6}{5} + frac{8i}{5} = frac{6}{5} + left( b + frac{8}{5} right)i).Now, let’s analyze each statement:A: The real part of (z) is (frac{6}{5}), not (0), so (z) cannot be a pure imaginary number. Therefore, option (A) is correct.B: If (z) is a real number, its imaginary part must be (0). Setting the imaginary part equal to (0), (frac{8}{5} + b = 0), we find (b = -frac{8}{5}). Hence, (m = -frac{8}{5}i), which means option (B) is incorrect since it misstates the value of (m).C: The magnitude of (z) is given by (|z| = sqrt{left(frac{6}{5}right)^2 + left(b + frac{8}{5}right)^2}). The minimum value of (|z|) occurs when the imaginary part is (0), i.e., when (b = -frac{8}{5}), yielding (|z| = sqrt{left(frac{6}{5}right)^2 + 0^2} = frac{6}{5}). Therefore, option (C) is correct.D: If (z) lies on the line (y = x) in the complex plane, then the real and imaginary parts are equal. Thus, (frac{6}{5} = b + frac{8}{5}), leading to (b = -frac{2}{5}). Therefore, (m = -frac{2}{5}i), and option (D) is correct.In summary, the correct options are (boxed{ACD})."},{"problem":"3.

The condition of the problem means that the system (21) must have a solution with respect to (a ; b), that is, all three circles must have at least one common point.Let the circles bounding omega_{2} and omega_{3} intersect at points C and D (then triangles A B C and A B D are equilateral). The intersection of circles omega_{2} and omega_{3} is a figure F, representing the union of two smaller segments of these circles, bounded by the chord C D.

We need to determine the maximum value of g(x) on this interval to find the minimum value of m that satisfies the inequality for all x in [0,1].Observing the behavior of g(x), we note that it is monotonically decreasing on [0,1]. This is because the derivative of g(x), which is -e^{-x} - 1, is always negative on [0,1].

A number m is called [i]good[/i] if there are m or more numbers that are the same after each iteration, no matter how many or what operations are performed. Find the largest possible good number.","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Problem Understanding:   - We start with 1000 ones.   - Each time we choose a number (a) and replace it with three numbers (frac{a}{3}).   - We need to find the largest possible number (m) such that there are (m) or more equal numbers after each iteration, regardless of the operations performed.2. Formulation and Summation:   - Let (a_i) be the number of times (frac{1}{3^i}) appears on the board.   - The sum of all numbers on the board remains constant and equals 1000.   - Therefore, we have:     [     sum_{i=0}^{infty} frac{a_i}{3^i} = 1000     ]3.

Therefore, in the table, no two adjacent numbers can be taken simultaneously, meaning that only one number can be taken from each column, and exactly one number must be taken.Let the number of ways to take one number from each column of a 3 times n number table, such that any two adjacent columns (including the n-th column and the first column) do not take numbers from the same row, be denoted as x_{n}.Taking one number from the first column has 3 ways. After the first column is determined, the number taken from the second column cannot be in the same row as the first column, leaving only two different ways. Each subsequent column also has two ways, resulting in a total of 3 times 2^{n-1} ways. However, all the ways where the numbers taken from the first column and the last column are in the same row do not meet the requirements. In this case, these two columns can be considered as one column, i.e., the number of ways for n-1 columns, so x_{n} + x_{n-1} = 3 times 2^{n-1}. It is also easy to see that x_{2} = 6.Rewriting x_{n} + x_{n-1} = 3 times 2^{n-1} as (-1)^{n} x_{n} - (-1)^{n-1} x_{n-1} = -3 times (-2)^{n-1}. Let y_{n} = (-1)^{n} x_{n}, then y_{n} - y_{n-1} = -3 times (-2)^{n-1}, and y_{2} = 6. It is easy to solve that y_{n} = (-2)^{n} + 2, thus x_{n} = 2^{n} + 2 times (-1)^{n}.Therefore, x_{8} = 2^{8} + 2 times (-1)^{8} = 258, meaning the total number of ways that meet the requirements of the problem is 258."},{"problem":"The function f(x) is an even function defined on mathbb{R} and is monotonically increasing on [0,+infty).

Assertion and Initial Condition:   Let ( P(x, y) ) be the assertion of the given functional equation:   [   f(xf(y) - yf(x)) = f(xy) - xy   ]   First, consider ( P(x, 0) ):   [   f(xf(0)) = f(0)   ]   This implies that ( f(0) ) is a fixed point. If ( f(0) neq 0 ), then for any ( x in mathbb{R} ), we would have ( f(xf(0)) = f(0) ). This would imply that ( f ) is a constant function, which contradicts the original equation unless ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x ). Therefore, we must have:   [   f(0) = 0   ]2. Evaluating ( P(x, x) ):   Consider ( P(x, x) ):   [   f(xf(x) - xf(x)) = f(x^2) - x^2   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   f(0) = f(x^2) - x^2   ]   Since ( f(0) = 0 ), it follows that:   [   f(x^2) = x^2   ]   This implies that ( f(x) = x ) for all ( x geq 0 ).3. Considering ( f(a) = 0 ):   Let ( a ) be such that ( f(a) = 0 ). Consider ( P(a, y) ):   [   f(af(y) - yf(a)) = f(ay) - ay   ]   Since ( f(a) = 0 ), this simplifies to:   [   f(af(y)) = f(ay) - ay   ]   For ( y ) such that ( ay geq 0 ), we have ( f(ay) = ay ) (since ( ay geq 0 )). Thus:   [   f(af(y)) = ay - ay = 0   ]   This implies ( af(y) = 0 ). Since ( f(y) neq 0 ) for ( y neq 0 ) (as shown earlier), we must have ( a = 0 ).

Behavior for Negative ( x ):   Consider ( P(x, y) ) for ( x < 0 ) and ( y < 0 ):   [   f(xf(y) - yf(x)) = f(xy) - xy   ]   Since ( f(x) = x ) for ( x geq 0 ), we need to determine ( f(x) ) for ( x < 0 ).

Then:   [   f(-f(y) - yc) = f(-y) + y   ]   If ( y < 0 ), then ( f(y) = -cy ).

Sasha chose a natural number N>1 and wrote down in ascending order all its natural divisors: d_{1}<ldots<d_{s} (so that d_{1}=1 and d_{s}=N). Then, for each pair of adjacent numbers, he calculated their greatest common divisor; the sum of the resulting s-1 numbers turned out to be N-2. What values could N take?(A. Kuznetsov)","solution":"Answer: N=3.Solution. Note immediately that d_{s+1-i}=N / d_{i} for all i= =1,2, ldots, s.The number d_{i+1}-d_{i} is divisible by the GCD left(d_{i}, d_{i+1}right), so the GCD left(d_{i}, d_{i+1}right) leqslant d_{i+1}-d_{i}. For i=1, ldots, s-1, let r_{i}=left(d_{i+1}-d_{i}right)- GCD left(d_{i}, d_{i+1}right) geqslant 0. According to the condition,left(d_{2}-d_{1}right)+left(d_{3}-d_{2}right)+ldots+left(d_{s}-d_{s-1}right)=d_{s}-d_{1}=N-1andGCD left(d_{1}, d_{2}right)+ GCD left(d_{2}, d_{3}right)+ldots+ GCD left(d_{s-1}, d_{s}right)=N-2.Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get r_{1}+ldots+r_{s-1}= =1. This means that r_{k}=1 for some k, while all other r_{i} are zero.Thus, 1=left(d_{k+1}-d_{k}right)- GCD left(d_{k}, d_{k+1}right). The right, and therefore the left side of this equation, is divisible by GCD left(d_{k}, d_{k+1}right), so GCD left(d_{k}, d_{k+1}right)=1 and d_{k+1}-d_{k}=2. This is possible only if both numbers d_{k} and d_{k+1} are odd.Since d_{k} and d_{k+1} are two consecutive divisors of the number N, then frac{N}{d_{k+1}} and frac{N}{d_{k}} are also two consecutive divisors of the number N. Therefore, if frac{N}{d_{k+1}}=d_{m}, then frac{N}{d_{k}}=d_{m+1}. In this case,begin{aligned}operatorname{GCD}left(d_{m}, d_{m+1}right)= & frac{N}{operatorname{LCM}left(d_{k}, d_{k+1}right)}=frac{N cdot operatorname{GCD}left(d_{k}, d_{k+1}right)}{d_{k} d_{k+1}}=1, which is possible only when k=m (and, consequently, s=2 k).Thus, d_{k+1}=frac{N}{d_{k}}, meaning the number N=d_{k} d_{k+1} is odd. But then d_{s-1} leqslant frac{N}{3}, from which GCD left(d_{s-1}, d_{s}right) leqslant d_{s-1} leqslant frac{N}{3}. Therefore, 1 geqslant r_{s-1} geqslant frac{2 N}{3}-frac{N}{3}=frac{N}{3}, i.e., N leqslant 3.

Observing that the coefficients in f'(x) lead to a positive derivative for x in (-infty, -2) and that the derivative changes sign at x = -2, we infer that the function is increasing in (-infty, -2) and decreasing in (-2, 2).- For statement A, the function is not strictly increasing on the entire interval (-infty, -1) because it starts decreasing before -1. Thus, A is incorrect.- For statement B, the function is strictly decreasing on some part of the interval (-infty, -1), but not the entire interval. Thus, B is incorrect.Next, we examine statement C. Let b = -6, and compute f(-2):f(-2) = (-2)^3 - 12(-2) - 6 = -8 + 24 - 6 = 10.Since f'(-2) = 0, the point (-2, f(-2)) is a horizontal tangent point of the graph of f(x). The tangent line at this point is y = f(-2) = 10.

Computing f(2):f(2) = 2^3 - 12(2) = 8 - 24 = -16 < 10.Given the shape of a cubic function and since f(2) < 10 and f(x) is increasing again after x = 2, it will intersect the line y = 10 at one point to the left and one point to the right of x = 2, hence more than once.

Understanding the Function: The function y=2^{|x|} increases as |x| increases. The base of the exponentiation is 2, which means the function grows exponentially away from x=0. The absolute value ensures the function is symmetric about the y-axis.2. Determining the Domain: The domain given is left[a,bright]. This means we are looking for the values of x (i.e., a and b) that make y fall within the range left[1,2right].3. Analyzing the Range: The range left[1,2right] tells us that 2^{|x|} must be between 1 and 2. This gives us two critical points to consider:   - When y=1, 2^{|x|}=1. This happens when |x|=0, or x=0.   - When y=2, 2^{|x|}=2. This happens when |x|=1, or x=1 and x=-1.4. Determining a and b: From the analysis above, we have two scenarios for the interval left[a,bright] that correspond to the range left[1,2right]:   - When x=0, this could be the lower bound of our interval, making a=0. For x=1, this is the upper bound, making b=1. Thus, one interval is left[0,1right].   - Alternatively, considering the symmetry and the absolute value, x=-1 could serve as the lower bound, making a=-1. The point where x=0 would then be the upper bound, making b=0. Thus, another interval is left[-1,0right].5. Calculating the Length of the Intervals: The length of an interval left[a,bright] is given by b-a.   - For the interval left[0,1right], the length is 1-0=1.   - For the interval left[-1,0right], the length is 0-(-1)=1.6.

In this case, the color of cell (n-2) must be different from that of cell 1, otherwise, cell (n-1) and cell (n-2) would be the same color. Thus, the first (n-2) cells have a_{n-2} ways of coloring. Since cell n must be a different color from cell 1, there are two ways to color it, so there are 2 a_{n-2} ways of coloring in total.In summary, we get the recursive equationa_{n}=a_{n-1}+2 a_{n-2} cdot(n geqslant 4)Solving this, we get a_{n}=2^{n}+2(-1)^{n} .(n geqslant 2, n in mathbf{N})For n positions in a circular arrangement, the solution can be derived similarly.

The key to solving this type of problem is to find the relevant geometric quantities. This problem examines our spatial imagination and our ability to apply formulas to calculate.Since the side surface of the cone, when unfolded, forms a sector with a central angle of frac{2pi}{3} and a radius of 3, we can determine the length of the cone's slant height, which is also the arc length of the sector. From this, we can find the radius r of the base circle, calculate the area of the base circle, and then use h = sqrt{l^2 - r^2} to find the height of the cone. Finally, we substitute these values into the formula for the volume of a cone to find the volume.SolutionGiven that the side surface of the cone, when unfolded, forms a sector with a central angle of alpha = frac{2pi}{3},The radius of this sector is r, and since the radius of the base circle is 1, the circumference of the base circle is 2pi. This is also the arc length l of the sector, so we have l = 2pi.Using the formula alpha = frac{l}{r}, we find that r = 3.Therefore, the side surface area of the cone is equal to the area of the sector, which is given by frac{1}{2}lr = 3pi.Hence, the side surface area of the cone is boxed{3pi}."},{"problem":"The derivative of the function y=xsin x+ sqrt {x} is (　　)A: y′=sin x+xcos x+ dfrac {1}{2 sqrt {x}}B: y′=sin x-xcos x+ dfrac {1}{2 sqrt {x}}C: y′=sin x+xcos x- dfrac {1}{2 sqrt {x}}D: y′=sin x-xcos x- dfrac {1}{2 sqrt {x}}","solution":"Solution: y′=x′sin x+x(sin x)′+ dfrac {1}{2 sqrt {x}},  =sin x+xcos x+ dfrac {1}{2 sqrt {x}},  Therefore, the correct option is boxed{A}.

However, then by substitution in (1) we get c=c+C x, for every x in mathbb{R}, i.e., c x=0, for every x in mathbb{R}, which is a contradiction. From the obtained contradiction, it follows that f(0)=0.Let us assume that f(a)=0 for some a neq 0. Then by substitution in (1) we get a f(y)=0 for every y in mathbb{R}, from which it follows that f(y)=0 for every y in mathbb{R}, which is a contradiction.

Thus, the lengths of C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}, ldots, C_{n}, ldots form a geometric progression with ratio q=2 / 3 and first term a_{1}=1, as follows.1, frac{2}{3},left(frac{2}{3}right)^{2},left(frac{2}{3}right)^{3},left(frac{2}{3}right)^{4}, ldots,left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n-1}, ldotsIn particular, the length of C_{n} is (2 / 3)^{n-1}."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.problem.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.solution.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},I={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},z=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function L(i,e,h,d,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",I,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),n(x,null,y(r.filteredPoems,(s,u)=>(a(),w(m,{key:u,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...s)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...s))},[o.isLoading?(a(),n("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",N,"See more"))],8,z)):v("",!0)])}const W=f(F,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-9c2f5022"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/42.md","filePath":"drive/42.md"}'),O={name:"drive/42.md"},H=Object.assign(O,{setup(i){return(e,h)=>(a(),n("div",null,[_(W)]))}});export{E as __pageData,H as default};
