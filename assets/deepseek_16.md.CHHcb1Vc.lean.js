Do you think there was any trauma to your right side such as biting your tongue or eating crusty bread? There are frenum attachments that secure your tongue in place.

He's been taking Vyvanse for about a year now.  He'll be 9 in a couple weeks.  He was started at 20mg but over time has been increased to 50mg.  It seems to work pretty well, but a few months ago the dr. added Strattera in addition to this.  We still supervise and assist with his tooth brushing in the morning and at night but his teeth are turning more and more yellow.  At his last dental checkup about 4 mos ago, they said they weren't concerned.  In fact, they said his teeth were in great shape.  But I think they've gotten more yellow since then.He's never had soft drinks, and drinks only water, milk, fruit juices and an occasional lemonade.  Could one of these medicines (or their interraction with each other) be causing this yellowing.  I'm afraid this is permanent.  Is this reversible?  What can we do?    Thank you for any help you may be able to provide.-- Sheryl","Doctor":"Hello,Adult teeth often appear darker than the baby teeth. There is a large pulp chamber with blood vessels and nerves in the center of these teeth. the inner layer of the tooth called dentin gives the teeth color. Medication and stress on your body can cause transient and permanent change. You describe all the recommended techniques for keeping the teeth clean and keeping up with your routine dental exams. Dry mouth is a common side effect of Vyvanse. This can dry the plaque on the teeth causing yellow appearnce and make daily removal harder. Step up daily techniques. Stattera, also causes dry mouth. If there is associated stomach upset, this can cause an acidic condition and affect the oral environment. More plaque build up, thicker consistency and color change may be apparent. Concern for a higher rate odf decay should be noted. Increase home care and definite supervision. I suggest an  increase frequency of professional cleanings as an option. The combination of these medications may accelerate the side effects. Consider consulting with the drug manufacturers about the side effects when these drugs are combined. Keep well hydrated, proper diet, balanced vitamins and make sure to include brushing the tongue. There are whitening techniques that can be done. Inquire with your dentist about age appropriate whitening techniques. Essential oils in rinses may be helpful. Popular, is oil pulling with coconut oil. Many people report lighter color teeth after using this popular technique.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope my suggestions are helpful.

Before moving here we lived in chicago where we saw amazing dr's.  She is having a hard time dealing with this at her age. Pls help","Doctor":"Hello,This is being a  genetic disorder offers an explanation of why she may have certain dental conditions. This makes treatment more difficult and involved. If she has missing teeth, extra teeth, undersized teeth, delayed eruption, an overbite or underbite, these conditions are best treated by an orthodontist. A child has the advantage of the jaw growing and offers the opportunity to guide jaw growth as well as tooth position. As an adult, surgery would have to be considered to realign the jaw if severe overbite or underbite is present. Definitely consider an orthodontic evaluation. Multiple opinions are recommended for involved treatment. Consider visiting a dental school where many specialists and resources are available. Considering this to be a rare genetic condition, you may have a difficult time finding doctors with previous exposure to this disorder.Poor enamel formation, defects and notching may require restorative treatment prior to orthodontics. Bonding or crowns may need to be placed. If teeth are too weak or not suitable for movement, then consideration for other options such as implants, bridges or dentures need to be considered. Sometimes a temporary stage of tooth replacement is necessary.The assistance of other specialist such as an oral surgeon and periodontist most likely should be considered. Often multiple specialist work together. Your general dentist coordinates and communicates between all specialist. Shape of her palate, quality and quantity of her gums and any growths such as papillomas may affect treatment considerations. You will have a greater challenge, but with coordinated care ther will be options to improve your daughter's smile. Thank you for your inquiry.

Oh I just looked in her mouth and her gums are black any idea on what causes that ? her next appt: is on the 19th should i try to push it to an earlier date?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for posting here.Your dentist tried to repair the dentin avoiding the root canal.However,infection spread already to the pulp of the tooth.So, he has no other choice to  do a root canal now.Root canal is basically cleaning the infection in the tooth and filling it with a sterile material.Children do have less pain perception than adults.However, children do not co-operate for the treatment because of fear.They avoid doctors mostly out of fear,not because of pain.Do not panic.Root canal in children are common treatments and can be safely done.Inform your dentist if she suffers any other general health problem,wheezing,asthma,epilepsy or cold etc.Root canal is done to save the tooth.Doctor will not remove your daughter teeth.Okay, i also advice you to ask the dentist about fluoride and sealant application.This is to prevent further decay and cavities.Black gums can be familial or even calculus.Calculus can be removed easily.There is nothing to worry if it is familial.No treatment is necessary unless she is concerned esthetically.She must be on a course of antibiotics and it is better to start the treatment as early as possible.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have been dignosed w a salivatory gland stone by one doctor, second dr sent me for a cat scan where it was inconclussive, he said it could be a stone, a or an old infection that calcified, he reccommended i remove it asap.. said an needle biopsy are not usually accurate.

I have gone through your query thoroughly. I will provide you with my best possible advice.First of all I would like to tell you that always discuss problems with your doctor because it will help him/her to make more accurate treatment plan.Blood in the spit may arise due to many causes. But the most common cause is gingivitis(gum inflammation) or periodontitis(pyorrhea).Usually it gets corrected after scaling.Meanwhile I am advising few things-     * Use ultrasoft toothbrush and brush your teeth twice daily.     * Use gum astringents like stolin/dentakind-L 3-4 times a day for 15 days.     * Eat more green leafy vegetables and have diet rich in protein.     * Warm saline gargle 2-3 times daily.Hope this will help you.

Apthous ulcers are common and associated with repeat episodes.Try some anti-inflammatory medication such as tylenol and advil. Benedry is an effective anti-inflammatory antihistamine. Warm salt water rinses are suggested. Antimicrobial mouth washes such as those containing chlorhexdine gluconate  may accelerate healing. An anesthetic based gel such as quadragel may offer a protective coating and some relief if applied to the affected areas. Prescription medication such as a steroid available as a lozenges will be more effective and consider a rinse such as magic mouth which can be customized to your particular symptoms with anti-inflammatory, pain relief and anesthetic medications combinations.You are correct to take vtamin B and make sure you do not have any deficiencies. Make sure you have no other deficiencies such as iron and magnesium. Blood tests may be helpful to detect deficiencies. Keep well hydrated, good dental care and proper nutrition. Be sure to rule out any sharp areas from your teeth, dental appliances or habits that cause repeat episodes. Remove all irritants such as smoking, alcohol, acidic and spicy foods. Rule out any allergic reaction. Keep tract of your diet and timing of each occurrence. Look for triggers. Reactions to toothpaste ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulphite has been reported. Stress can induce episodes as well. These are steps that you can try to help with a possible diagnosis.Consider seeing an oral surgeon for a definitive diagnosis.

If you do not have Amoebiasis, metrogyl alone is of little value.Better get an Ultrasound Study done as well as routine blood test to rule out infection (Appendicitis), since Total count of WBC of more than 11000 with neutrophilia is indicative of infection. Of course a surgeon can also provisionally diagnose appendicitis by eliciting rebound tenderness at MCBurney's Point.It is prudent to avoid blind treatment. As far as possible a firm diagnosis supported by investigations is ideal, before starting any treatment, exception being relieving the patient's agony by immediate management of that agony.Wish you speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"I'm 25, weigh 155 am 5ft and am 32 weeks pregnant.

I tried a local urgent dental clinic but  they won't see me pregnant and I have no regular dentist...I dont' know where to turn next","Doctor":"Hello,You are describing signs of an infection that is spreading. This will not resolve by itself. Anti-inflammatory medications such as Tylenol may help control the spread of the infection but is not a cure to stop the infection. An antihistamine, Benadryl, can help reduce inflammation as well. Warm saltwater rinses may help. Continue to clean the area as best you can. I strongly suggest you see a dentist to evaluate the area. It is most likely an abscess from the tooth, but can also be a periodontal condition. The dentist may be able to drain the area or clean under the gum. Antibiotics may be necessary and you will need to decide along with your physician how to proceed while pregnant. You should have regular prenatal visits with your physician. Visit a hospital emergency room if necessary. Amoxicillin is the typical prescription antibiotic use for dental infections.Thank you for your inquiry. Please schedule an appointment soon.

This bacteria in the mouth gets out of balance. A  fungal infection occurs and you will need a prescription treatment such as nystatin. If your mouth is overly inflamed, ask for a prescription rinse which can have a combination of an antifungal medication, anti-inflammatory medicine such as a corticosteroid, and anesthetic.You should be rinsing with warm salt water and practicing good oral hygiene. Make sure to brush your tongue as a film may appear on the tongue with this condition. Keep well hydrated and follow a proper diet. Make sure you do not have any vitamin deficiencies.

Having a small cavity would not indicate a need for an antibiotic. If you are experiencing discomfort and any signs of inflammation around the tooth, discuss with your dentist the need to take pre-operative medication. Your dentist may recommend an anti-inflammatory medication to start shortly before the planned extraction. Antibiotics are not absolutely necessary prior to an extraction. It is important not to overuse antibiotics. Resistance to antibiotics are a risk.Blindness is generally not a risk with an extraction. Complications from an extraction, infection with the spread of inflammation, and an unusual nerve anatomy may result in some possibl conditions that may involve eye function. Paresthesia is a risk associated with injections and possible with extractions. This would be numbness remaining instead of wearing off as normally expected. Often with time this will diminish unless there is a tual nerve damage. Preoperative x-rays are taken to evaluate root proximity to nerves. You should review all possible complications and your medical history impact with your dentist prior to the extraction.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you feel better about having your extraction and that my comments have been helpful to you."},{"Patient":"Due to an auto accident I had extensive facial surgery about 7 weeks ago, including having my mouth wired, and plates/screws in my cheek area.

Is my maxillary nerve dagamed?","Doctor":"Hello,You had an unfortunate accident and complicated surgery. Are you still experiencing some signs of inflammation? There definitely may have been nerve damage. This should be discussed with your surgeon. You should expect a long healing time frame. You may experience areas with paresthesia. The nerve sensation may return to these areas gradually over time. A damaged or cut nerve indicates a permanent loss of sensation. Other nervesmay gradually add some sensation to an area.Trauma to teeth can result in nerve damage that requires root canal therapy and restorations. Your oral surgeon will refer you back to your general dentist for further evaluation. Depending on the extent of your accident you may need the services of an orthodontist and a periodontist.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you continue to heal and feel additional return of areas lacking sensation. Certain anti-inflammatory medications may assist healing. Prescription steroids can be used for more severe areas of inflammation. Your surgeon with x-rays, clinical exams and details of your treatment will give you a realistic prognosis and options to improve your condition."},{"Patient":"Hi I have had a tooth removed about 4 weeks ago because it had a abscess under it but now the Swelling has come back on the underside of my jaw bone and is getting bigger there is no signs of tooth pain just a warm feeling on side of face and this large rock hard lump growing under my left jaw line What should I do","Doctor":"Hello,Please schedule a follow up visit with your dentist. This may be a cellulitis as a result of the original infection. A pocket of pus may be trapped. Healing of the socket needs to be evaluated. This may be a reaction from a cyst or lymph node or the sublingual salivary gland may be a source. Further diagnosis most likely will  require prescription antibiotics and a possible incision with drainage. I recommend addressing this situation now. Do not wait  and see. Another tooth with an abscess, complication from the extraction and a growth are all other possible causes. You do not want to risk osteomeylitis.Please take some anti-inflammatory medication to help control swelling. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are common anti-inflammatory medications. The antihistamine Benadryl has anti-inflammatory benefits. If the swelling is increasing rapidly do not delay. Your dentist will determine which antibiotic is necessary and possibly prescribe a more potent steroid.Continue to follow the instructions given to you after the extraction.

Benadryl, an antihistamine, has anti-inflammatory benefits to reduce swelling and itchiness. Continue warm salt water rinses. Avoid irritants such as smoking, alcohol, spicy and acidic foods. Nutritional deficiencies can cause changes to the tongue such as texture and color. Make sure your diet is balanced. Consider suppliments for deficiencies such as vitamins especially vitamin B2, riboflavin, and vitamin B3, niacin.Hydration is important. keep well hydrated.Acidophilus may help balance the natural bacteria and prevent imbalances that can disturb your natural flora.Think of any recent changes made to your diet or dental care products.

This bacteria is known to cause decay in the mouth. High fevers and infections can cause enamel hypoplasia. Can you obtain the correct name? Did you loose teeth due to a high rate of decay and poor quality enamel? Periodontal disease and lack of bone support can cause tooth movement resulting spacing between teeth. Damage to cardiac tissue is of concern with a history of rheumatic fever and antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental treatment is recommended.Please make sure you understand the current condition of your mouth. There are many choices to replace missing teeth and fill spaces. First you must repair any broken teeth, address your periodontal health, be free of infections and have a healthy mouth. Removeable dental appliances can fill multiple spaces in one arch and hold on to your healthy existing teeth. These are usually the least cost, but have the disadvantage of coming out of your mouth daily. A fixed bridge uses crowns or caps to suspend teeth in missing spaces and is cemented over your teeth. This is usually more costlythan a rmoveable denture.Fixed bridges are charged per tooth and space involved in the replacement and enamel is removed on the abutment teeth. The advantage is that it stays in your mouth. The second option for a non-removeable replacement is an implant. This requires surgery to replace a missing root, healing time and then restoration with an abutment and crown precision fit to your implant. This is usually the most expensive per tooth, but eliminates any risk of decay and does not involve multiple teeth.A full denture is considered if all teeth are to be removed. If there is lack of a retentive ridge, implants can e placed to help secure a removeable denture.I am not sure of your location to give you an estimate on cost. You can always consider a second opinion with a clinical evaluation and review of your x-rays. Your overall health and dental health history must be considred as well.

Is my problem related to wisdom teeth? my bp / suger is normal. weight is 90 kg. i feel always fatigue.","Doctor":"Hello,Have you had your wisdom teeth evaluated by an oral surgeon? You  should not be suffering many years with wisdom teeth. If they have not fully erupted and do not function, the surgeon will suggest removal unless there are complications with the root position. This is in addition to the normal risk associated with an extraction. If you have constant infections due to the wisdom teeth, that may cause discomfort and inflammation. This chronic condition should be eliminated. May be then balance can be affected. Chronic inflammation within the jaw can affect the ear as with the spread of infection and pressure created. Antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication may be needed for infected wisdom teeth. rinse with warm salt water. Chlorhexedine rinses may be helpful.Thank you for your inquiry"},{"Patient":"I think I have infected teeth/ gums, went to dentist about upper last tooth I have left, giving me grief with infection. Xray showed nothing. Went to endodontist, he found nothing on top but said bottom end one I have left is cracked and needs pulled. I had it pulled. Think it is infected in that gum area and top above as I first reported. Went back to dentist who pulled the tooth and said I have infection, he said no it is dry socket. It has been two and a half weeks, still have what I think is an infection. I have noduals that appeared on gums under tongue, before tooth pulled, 2 on each side and my cheeks are swollen and thick, before tooth was pulled as well. I am concerned about the thick cheeks, would this be related to infected mouth or some other health issue. I am having thyroid trouble as well?","Doctor":"Hello,You need to start with a complete dental exam, full set of x-rays and cleaning. This will determine issues with other specific teeth as well the condition of your gums. Your periodontal health must be considered as well as tooth infections. A complete physical with blood tests will determine if you have systemic complications or deficiencies.  This will determine your thyroid function and if specific additional tests need to be ordered. Infections, once and if diagnosed, will need treatment and a possible antibiotic prescription. Reduce symptoms of inflammation with anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Motrin. Benadryl, an antihistamine, has anti-inflammatory benefits as well. Corticosteroids, by prescription, can reduce greater amounts of swelling and inflammation. Warm salt water rinses can help cleanse and soothe. Prescription chlorhexdine gluconate rinses are antimicrobial and benefit healing abilities.Maintain proper dental hygiene, good nutrition, balanced vitamins and stay well hydrated. Avoid irritants including smoking and alcohol.Noduals on the gums, under the tongue could be tori which should not cause any of your symptoms. Other causes include an abscess, growth, tumor or salivay gland disorder. Lymph nodes can be swollen when fighting an infection. Have you taken any antibiotics with your recent treatment? You may have a resistant infection and need a different antibiotic to be effective in controlling your symptoms. Viral infections can cause various oral symptoms and generally need to run a course to resolve. Allergic reactions are another possibility. This can range from food, medications to dental products.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you will continue to evaluate the source of your condition if your symptoms are not decreasing. I will gladly answer addtional questions."},{"Patient":"I recently (3 days ago), had a d and c. Two days later I woke up with severe stomach pain. I thought I was constipated, and called my doctor.

The needle was placed in my rt hand due to my tiny rolling veins.Today I noticed that the vein has turned black and there is swollen area at the base of my wrist.

What is causing","Doctor":"Hello,Bruising and bleeding from a punctured vessel is not uncommon when difficulty arises placing a needle. I do feel uncomfortable that you report pain and numbness after 2 weeks. Were you placed on an antibiotic?  Please return to your treating doctor or physician to evaluate your condition. If an infection has occured and is spreading you will require an antibiotic and medication to control the inflammation.A large hematoma may take time to resolve. Pressure, swelling and inflammation may occur. Was pressure applied after the needle was removed? Were there any complications with removing the needle? Do you have any bleeding disorder or difficulty clotting? Any other medical conditions?I suggest taking anti-inflammatory medication. Common medications such as tylenol, advil and the anti-histamine Benadryl can decrease inflammation and swelling. If your condition worsens seek attention immediately. This may be unrelated due to the time span and may indicate a separate condition or allergic reaction.Thank you for your inquiry.

Ihab","Doctor":"Hello,No brain leakage should occur from a root canal. You may have a fistula that has made a pathway into your sinus. This would allow nasal drainage of the infection and may appear as a nasal liquid. Antiobiotics such as amoxicillin should be prescribed to hel this to resolve. If there is a commuication into the sinus this needs time to heal and often will on it's own once the source of the infection is removed. Do not create stress or blow your nose. Limit bending. Gently wipe your nose. Decongestants and saline nasal spray may be helpful.  Anti-inflammatory medication such as the antihistamine Benadryl is recommended. Other anti-inflammatory medications include ibufropen  or acetaminophen. Consult with your dentist and inform your dentist of this drainage. Follow all instructions and take any prescription medications indicated.  Root canals usually require more than one visit to complete. X-rays can be taken to evaluate the root for any treatment complications. Make sure you have completed the procedure.Thank you for your inquiry.

When I looked in his mouth his tongue was white. Is his tongue white do to dehydration or could it be thrush? He is also complaining that his throat is soar.","Doctor":"Hello,Dehydration and thrush are definite possibilities. It is very imortant to keep well hydrated. Try only small amounts of liquid taken often( at 10 minute intervals) when nauseous. Try to replace electrolytes. Dehydration can be very serious if persists and cause stress to the entire body. Vomit is very acidic and irritating to the throat and mouth. Repeat, long term episodes can erode enamel.Thrush will need an anti-fungal treatment such as the prescription medicine Nystatin. Rinse with warm salt water. Keep up good oral hygiene. Make sure to be cleaning tongue. Try to keep up balanced vitamin intake especially vitamin B complex. Anti-inflammatory medicines, acetaminophen or ibuprofen, if tolerated, can reduce discomfort. The antihistamine, Benedryl, also is an anti-inflammatory medicine. Maintain proper nutrition as best as possible.Make sure you have thoroughly treated your son's condition. Did you have a diagnosis? Some conditions such as strep require an antibiotic which can disturb the balance of the normal oral bacteria. Thrush can be a typical response. oral compications with systemic viral and bacteria infections are common.Thank you for your inquiry. I am available to assist with additional questions.

It first started off with having a lot of saliva, it made my breath smell like ash even more (I smoke) and anything I ate would basically stay in my mouth... Then it looks like I have inflamed taste buds which are as big as small beads.. My mouth got really hairy and went brownish black... I got rid of the brownish black hairy likeness on my tongue and still have these blister looking things at the back of my tongue. Its also shiny red around the area. My saliva is now jelly like.","Doctor":"Hello,This is describes a condition possible for someone who smokes, has a fungal infection and needs better oral hygiene habits. The coating on the tongue is an irritation that can cause the papillea to elongate. These are not your taste buds. Brushing your tongue and improving your basic daily dental care can often help resolve this. You already have seen improvement. If the papillae do not return to normal, they can be trimmed to reduce them further by your dentist. Avoiding irritants  such as smoking is strongly recommended. The texture of the tongue changes to a smoother surface as you go further back. If you have inflammation due to an oral yeast infection or thrush, you can have swelling and redness. It often affects the surface of the tongue and your taste. Even with your initial reaction of extra saliva, now you most likely have less saliva and the consistancy has changed. A dry mouth is common. Treatment with Nystatin or other anti-fungal treatments can aleviate these symptoms. I recommend that you try these  steps. See your dentist for a prescription and definite diagnosis.Warm salt water rinses, keeping well hydrated with a balanced healthy diet and vitamins can offer relief. Acidodphillus may help rebalance your oral bacteria.You may have other medical conditons such as acid reflux or medications that have contributed to your symptoms. If your symtoms do not resolve other conditions should be considered and your tongue further evaluated. Make sure you are up to date with your dental exam and cleaning.I hope these steps are helpful to you and thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"Hello.

I ask if my daughter would need to be on antibiotics first and she said no. Should I get a second opinion?","Doctor":"Hello,I often prescribe an antibiotic when I extract a tooth, but not always. If the extraction was complicated or the patient's medical history raises some concern about healing ability, I will prescribe an antibiotic. I often prescribed an antibiotic prior to removal to control the spread of an active infection or for a very symptomatic tooth.  Pain medication and anti-inflammatory medication may be adequate. Should ofa painful situation arise 3 to 4 days after an extraction, I would be concerned about a dry socket and I would definitely prescribed an antibiotic.I would suggest a second opinion if your concern is whether or not the tooth should be extracted. There may be an option to save the tooth. You could ask the current dentist if there is any other option for this tooth.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope my answer is helpful to you. I would be glad to provide additional answers if you provide additional details or have more questions."},{"Patient":"Hello, I got my wisdom teeth out on thursday (4 days ago). Today I was treated for what they thought was \\"dry socket\\". They filled the hole with something, that tastes disgusting. This was about 6 hours ago. The pain is back, and my temple is swollen and causing a headache and earache. Is there anything more i can do?","Doctor":"Hello, Dry sockets can be very painful. You indicate symptoms of an infection and the spread of inflammation. You should be on an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory pain medication. I prefer to write a prescription for amoxicillin. Your dentist would decide the best antibiotic for your condition. I suggest requesting a prescription pain medication for use at night and to keep available if your pain increases. You can take nonprescription anti-inflammatory medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The antihistamine Benadryl also has an anti-inflammatory effect. Steroids by prescription also could be prescribed if needed.You may need to return for additional paste to be placed in the socket. Follow all instructions closely. Keep your dentist updated on your progress. Hydration, healthy diet and good hygiene are important.I hope you find my suggestions helpful. Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"I just noticed a hard lump that is down below my bottom front teeth on my gums - it is hard and about an inch in length and about 1/4 inch wide.  It doesn't seem to hurt and it doesn't move when I touch it with my tongue.  I read in another blog about salivary gland stones - is it anything to be concerned about.","Doctor":"Hello, You are correct that this could be calcified material in the salivary gland or duct. It may inhibit flow of saliva and back up causing pain and swelling. You are at risk of developing an infection. Removal is the recommended treatment. Someone with a dry mouth and thickened saliva might be at greater risk. Recommendations to avoid risk includes a nutritious diet with no vitamin deficiencies and keeping  well hydrated. Some medications such as antihistamines and high blood pressure may contribute to these stones forming.Other considerations may be a tori which is hard bone that would not move and only is painful if the tissue is damaged. The location is more often to the side of the front teeth rather than perfectly behind the midline. Tori are not of concern unless interferes with dental appliances planned, gets tissue damaged often or changes are noticed. Consider any recent trauma to the area that may have caused a reaction.  Some other type of growth,cyst or tumor is possible as well. An abscess can appear as a hard lump and should be ruled out. I recommend an evaluation by your dentist. Small stones may pass themselves or can be gently massaged out of the duct by your dentist. Other more involved procedures may need to be considered if it does not pass.Thank you for your inquiry.

My dentist put me on ammoxicillin but this is not getting better. I thought it was a tooth but the pain is just getting worse thru my whole mouth.","Doctor":"Hello,Additional bleeding and some inflammation may be a response to your new medication. Overall sensitivity may accompany this reaction. For this I recommend warm saltwater rinses and continue practicing good oral hygiene. Keep well hydrated and make sure you have proper nutrition with no vitamin deficiencies. Make your doctor aware of these symptoms. If improvement does not occur or the severity worsens, consider altering the medication. I place my patients on amoxicillin to help control infections usually related to an abscess from a single tooth. Amoxicillin can help control the spread of the infection which can give uncomfortable symptoms such as swelling, with pain. This will often occur near the site of the infected tooth for on the same side. What is the reason you were placed on amoxicillin?Do you have a respiratory, sinus, or ear infection? You may experience some throat and mouth discomfort with this condition while being treated.You may also experience a reaction to amoxicillin. This can be an allergic reaction or an oral yeast infection. Thrush may require an antifungal treatment to resolve your discomfort. Viral sores take time to heal and are also a possibility. I suggest taking some anti-inflammatory medication such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Benadryl, an antihistamine, also can help control inflammation. Chlorhexidine rinse is available for your use. This may stain your teeth but the stain will be removed at your next routine dental cleaning. Discuss your degree of pain with your dentist and possible choices to relieve your discomfort. Your dentist may Prescribe stronger pain relief medication, a corticosteroid, or a pain relieving mouth rinse. Nystatin may be prescribed as an antifungal medication.Thank you for your inquiry.

I do not recommend staying on chlorhexidine for a long period of time for my patients for this reason. If you find this is the only means to control your plaque, then you will have to go more often for professional dental cleanings.I suggest you use chlorhexidine for limited periods of time or try and use it in the areas where you have the most plaque only.Try to find out the cause of your difficulty with plaque. Do you have habits that contribute to plaque buildup? Dry Mouth can cause much thicker plaque to form with less saliva present. There are many dental products out there for dry mouth from rinses and toothpaste to gum.Make sure you practice good daily dental hygiene. Increase the amount of brushing, use interproximal cleaners, vigorous rinsing and you must floss.If you're periodontal condition is satisfactory consider Whitening your teeth. This can be done in the dental office or by using whitening products sold in stores. Many toothpastes incorporate a whitening ingredient. Whitening strips are popular and easy to use.

In some cases, I have had to administer an additional .5 carp.","Doctor":"Hello,There should not be a difference in efficacy between the Dentsply product and the Septodont product. Anesthetics are very sensitive to storage and temperature exposure. I would suspect it is a storage issue prior to arriving in your office. Make sure you purchase products from an authorized dealer. It is best not to order anesthetics in coldest weather months. Record the batch number and check with the manufacturer if there has been any issues with the particular batch. Verify the expiration date. Efficacy possibly lessens as you approach the expiration date. Of course, certain manufactures may vary on quality control and therefore consistancy in the products.

Previously I had a sinus infection with sores in my nose but no discharge. Ointments give relief but do not cure  thanks","Doctor":"Hello,With your history of the recent sinus infection and nasal discharge, I suspect this to be related to the infection. Possibilities include strep,  thrush, or virus. Your saliva or nasal discharge may carry the infection to the corners of your mouth.  If you were breathing through your mouth due to sinus congestion, saliva or drool especially at night can cause the irritation. Did you take any medication for your infection such as an antibiotic? Some antibiotics such as amoxicillin can throw off the natural balance of the oral bacteria in your mouth and cause thrush. If strep is untreated, you may need to address this to help the corners of your lips clear up. You can try various over-the-counter treatments and gels  to ease your symptoms. A light coating of Vaseline may offer a layer of protection to allow healing. Applying vitamin E can assist healing.There are anti-viral gels that can accelerate healing. You can consider a visit to your physician or dentist to help with a diagnosis if you did not see a doctor for your sinus infection.  Depending on your diagnosis,  a prescription medication or gel miay be available.Other causes include a collapsed bite and vitamin deficiency.  Your dentist can examine your bite. Your doctor can order blood tests to check for a vitamin deficiency. Make sure you stay hydrated, have a nutritious diet with balanced vitamins, and that your dental health is maintained. Take a decongestant if necessary to stop breathing by mouth. Avoid stretching your mouth open wide and do not wet the corners.I hope my suggestions offer you some relief.

The tooth that was extracted was impacted and cut from the jaw bone.","Doctor":"Thanks for using Health Care Magic.Read your query.The symptoms you have mentioned suggests that there is infection in the tooth removal socket .I would advice you to visit your dentist and get it checked for the removal of the pus from the socket and inititate the healing process.An antibiotic dose will also be required .Do warm saline gargling.Hope this was useful.Thanks and regards."},{"Patient":"I had a tooth removed Monday a molar next to me wisdom tooth that grew in sideways. the dentist only pulled the molar which was decayed and infected prior.. my question is shouldn't he have pulled the wisdom tooth also it feels sore and also should the extraction site have a bitter taste?","Doctor":"Hello,Removal of an impacted wisdom tooth is a more involved extraction. Oral surgeons     evaluate the position of the tooth with particular relation to nerves to assess the risk associated with a surgical removal.  X-rays, along with a clinical exam are important details needed for this decision. Surgery removing bone is most likely required to expose the wisdom tooth and you may not have the best circumstances for healing when another tooth has an active infection. Antibiotics, prior to and after the extraction, often are prescribed and help control the spread of an infection. Often a general dentist will extract erupted teeth, but refer impacted teeth to an oral surgeon for removal. Your choice of sedation options may be different for an impaction surgery as well. If your visit was more of an emergency, this may have been a factor. Yes, often multiple teeth can be extracted at the same time when treatment planned ahead of time and pre-surgical conditions optimize healing conditions. The advantage is one visit and healing on the same side.I am concerned that you report soreness with a sour taste. A condition called dry socket can be extremely painful, require antibiotics and a return dental visit for the socket area treated by your dentist. This may occur 3-4 days after the extraction. Some soreness is common as the socket continues to heal. Call your dentist to update your healing progress. Continue with warm salt water rinses and follow all post extraction instructions provided by your dentist including medications. Reduce soreness by taking an anti-inflammatory medications such as acetomeniphen and ibuprofen. Keep up with a balanded diet and adequate vitamins.I hope you find my comments helpful and feel better soon. Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"I have had a bad tooth ache all week. Thought I needed a root canal. Went to the dentist he thought maybe I had a high part on my crown and sanded a part off yesterday. Today hurts more, underneath my jaw very sore, very sensitive if I bite down. I have been taking ibuprofen, every 4 hours, still a lot of pain. I have some old pain medicine, from a previous root canal. The medicine is hydroco/apap 7.5-500 tab from 5/25/2011. It says it expires 5/25/12. Is it still effective? Should I just continue the ibuprofen?","Doctor":"Thanks for using Health Care Magic.Read your query.First , regarding the medicine you have asked whether to take , please do NOT take it as it is expired.

This was filled in and i was prescribed antibiotics and it felt like it went. After a week it came back and has been on and off since lasting for weeks at a time. It hurts the muscle linking my top and bottom jaw and sometimes my neck can feel quite swollen. I have trouble opening my jaw fully. and it feels like my ears are clogged and under pressure slightly. i can also hear what sounds like cereal popping inside my mouth which is presume is my TMJ? I went back to my dentist a month a go and they said it was not dental related and shunned me away quite quickly. Since then i have tried a longer course of antibiotics which have done nothing. however it went for a couple of weeks and has reoccurred. I am 21 male 6 foot 1 and work in a factory using headsets which doesn't help. I am going to go back to my dentist before returning to my doctor but wanted a second opinion.

Thankyou","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, i have gone through your query. The pain in the tooth could be because of the tooth infection. If the infection is from wisdom tooth this kind of pain can arise. Consult a oral physician and get a radiograph done and get the tooth root canal treated or removed. Antibiotics will help for a short period of time we have to treat the cause. Infection can cause limited mouth opening. The pain and clicking sound can be secondary to disc displacement in TMJ. You need to take radiograph like TMJ views and see the movement and position of jaw bone. Later you can start with piroxicam tablet. Do not open your mouth too wide. Take soft diet for 15days.you can give hot fomentation over the joint. I hope my answer will help you.

Is this cause for serious concern? As it was/is painless I hasn t seemed medical advice straight away as thought it may heal.","Doctor":"Hello,Is this lump in a location where you would have a wisdom tooth? A possibility could be a tooth starting to erupt or one tipped and not able to continue erupting. You may feel the soft tissue over the hard tooth structure. If  your wisdom tooth was already extracted, you may have some residual tissue that appears as a lump. A cyst can feel like a harder lump under the gum. The size description would make this a consideration. Look for any changes especially a rapid increase in size. An abcess or pocket of infection could be present and require dental treatment. A growth could be a tumor and should be further evaluated. Lumps that appear hard with thin tissue covering can be excess bone called tori or an exostosis. These do not tend to be sensitive, but often are noticed once damaged. How did you notice this area? Was there any trauma?More information would allow me to provide more suggestions. Anti-inflammatory medications can assist in reducing swelling and assist healing in many circumstances, but not necessarily with your description. Warm salt water rinses offer a cleansing effect. Keep up good daily oral care. Proper nutrition with balanced vitamins is recommended. Thank you for your inquiry. I would be glad to include additional suggestions with more details.

Please help me when will this pain be over im getting aggravated please help me.","Doctor":"Hello,You can try some anti-inflammatory medications in addition to your antibiotic. Cold works well initially to reduce inflammation such as swelling, but then you want good blood flow to promote healing. Try some moist heat to relax the muscles and improve blood flow to assist healing. Try to maintain a soft diet. Realize this is bone surgery and will take a long time to heal. Soreness is to be expected, but will gradually lessen. Continue to do your best to continue good dental care and rinsing.  Your first week will be the most difficult. Your second week should show improvement, but some if you had significant surgery and swelling, this inflammation needs time to resolve. Your TMJ could have been stressed. Your age and overall health can be a factor in how well you respond and the speed of healing. Your antibiotic needs to be at a certain level for a certain period of time to be effective. Follow your prescription as directed. If you miss a dose, do not double up, but try to get back on schedule as soon as possible.If you feel your antibiotic is not working and your discomfort is getting worse, contact your dentist. You may require a different antibiotic. Your dentist can prescribe additional stronger medications to assist healing, reduce inflammation and pain if necessary. You should have a followup visit. Do you have sutures that need to be removed? You may feel tightening as healing progresses. Should you continue to have difficulties with your jaw function, there could be a complication with your TMJ, fracture or delayed healing which would require further evaluation.I hope you can be patient and you mouth feels better with time.

IS THIS ALWAYS A NECESSARY PROCEDURE?","Doctor":"Hello,I would highly recommend that you keep the jaw wired as advised. The best condition to benefit long term healing should take precedence over short term discomfort. There are so many nutrious liquid diets, smoothies and vitamin drinks available for your son today that proper weight maintanance should be possible. If appearance is a factor, try to convince him to bear with it. If the jaw doesn't heal completely and a complication occurs, it could mean retreatment for a longer period. The jaw is under a great deal of stress and is powerful. Pressure of chewing or any grinding at night may cause a fracture to expand. Complications with the condyle healing could leave you with a lifetime of TMJ complications. Consult with the surgeon to see if an earlier removal would be advisable since he is experiencing some difficulty. Since you have a concern and difficulties adjusting, consider a consult with a second surgeon. Each fracture is unique and all details of your particular circumstances would need to be considered.

The upper tooth could be draining with a pathway to the lower arch and settle in the lymph node causing swelling. Antibiotics such as amoxicillin can help control an infection. You would need a prescription from your dentist after an evaluation. The upper tooth, if found to be the source, would need dental treatment such as a root canal or an extraction.Temporary pain relief and reduction of inflammation may be helped with anti-inflammatory medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen.Your symptoms may be unrelated and you need to address each condition separately. Do you have a condition such as a broken tooth or removable dental appliance that is causing irritation below the tongue? There is a salivary gland duct that could be clogged and causes a buildup of fluid. Your toothache can be due to large decay or inflamed gum and bone surrounding the tooth. Untreated decay will progress and cause an abscess if left untreated. Periodontal disease can result in infections and they will spread.You may have a wisdom tooth impacted under your gum and bone since you report discomfort near your ear. Your conditions are best evaluated by a dentist with a thorough exam and x-rays. Warm saltwater rinses may offer some additional assistance at this time.Your lymph node has the job of being the initial defense against infection. A dental abscess could very well cause inflamed lymph nodes. This could also indicate an underlying systemic disease which needs further evaluation by a physician. Blood tests may give you  valuable diagnostic information on your organ function and any nutrition deficiencies.Maintain a proper diet with balanced vitamins, keep well hydrated and follow good daily oral hygiene.Thank you for your inquiry.

My sense of taste has gone down some. My tongue also feels as though it is bigger and therefore I feel as I am producing more saliva. Can you tell me what this may be and how to treat it if possible? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hello,Common reasons include:-fungal condition such as Thrush-allergic reaction-mouth breathing with dry mouth-systemic reaction indicating disease or deficiency -side effect of medication-disease of the tonguePleases be sure that you maintain proper nutrition, balanced vitamins and stay well hydrated. Good home dental care and routine dental exams are important.The mouth has a natural flora and  an imbalance of bacteria can cause changes you describe. Acidophilus can help prevent or reestablish this balance. By prescription, your dentist may need to recommend Nystatin to treat an oral yeast  infection. A dry mouth can cause a change in the surface of the tongue and a burning sensation. While you are aware of the discomfort you may try to produce more saliva or this extra saliva may be a reaction to the feeling oh something more in your mouth. Are you aware of grinding your teeth or mouth breathing  at night? Stress can bring this on. Rinsing with warm salt water has a soothing and cleansing affect. Avoid spicy foods. Anti-inflammatory medications and an antihistamine such as Benedryl may help reduce signs of inflammation.A sinus infection with post nasal drip or acid reflx may cause more acid in the mouth. Irritants such as this, smoking or a sudden change in your habits could affect the tongue as you describe.Evaluate if you have made any changes in products used or diet that may be responsible for an allergic reaction. Stop the use and look for improvement.You may have trauma to the side of your tongue from it being in the way, pushing against your teeth or even biting the edge. any disturbance to the surface of the tongue may affect your taste buds.A dental exam would evaluate for abnormalities or growths. The back border of the tongue should be closely inspected for any suspicious changes to tissue that could be cancerous.A blood test can check the function of your organs and disclose deficiencies that may be responsible for some of these symptoms. Your over all health with conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes, gastric disorders or liver malfunction can be responsible for changes in the mouth.Thank you for your inquiry.

I very rarely get spots and I am wondering if  it could be related to the dental work. In addition if I put after shave on my face the area feels numb.","Doctor":"Hello,A rash reaction on your face would be a possibility. Is your rash around your mouth or limited to the side where your filling was done?  Do you notice any reaction inside your mouth? This could indicate a sensitivity to a material used at the dental office. Does your dentist office wear latex gloves? A rash on the face is a common reaction for latex sensitivity. Most dental offices limit the use of latex. Nitrile gloves or vinyl can be worn. Latex sensitivity should be noted on your medical history if you find this to be the cause. An allergist could confirm the sensitivity.A medical history with controlled diabetes raises some concerns with dental treatment. Surgical procedures may be at risk for delayed healing, but restorations and fillings, commonly, are not of major concern with diabetes. Uncontrolled diabetes can show stress on the tissues of your mouth and compromised overall oral health that would require greater attention. You may tend to have a greater amount of inflammation with your gums and tend to not resond as quickly to gum treatment therapies.I recommend discussing and describing your condition with your dentist to decide if you require further evaluation. Some trauma to the soft tissue of the face may be experienced during dental treatment and cause redness that should disappear fairly quickly. A true rash, Indicating an allergic reaction, should be investigated further. Additional exposures may elicit responses with increased severity and risk of anaphylaxis.Should your symptoms increase, consider a visit to your physician. This may not be related to your dental care and just a coincidence.I hope my suggestions are useful to assist in your diagnosis. Thank you for your inquiry.

In that case, you must get it treated first.Your dentist tells its all normal in terms of healing.Do you have pain while chewing on that teeth?If yes, then it is a dental issue.Get a orthopantomogram done on your jaws.You do have roots in your teeth.Only the last part of the root will be removed in apicectomy.Prolonged doses of painkillers is not advised as it can have side effects.I advice you to see a oral surgeon immediately.This can be atypical facial pain.However, i suggest you to rule out any dental cause.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi I have a sore/bump in my mouth and am not sure if I should be worried.

What do you think about your oral hygiene status is it really good? do you brush and gargle after every meal? Do you have bad breath?Its k whatever nothing to worry about just with a scaling and proper brushing along with flossing if necessary this can be rectified.

Then I got a few fillings on the other side under 1 week ago. I'm still having pain in my mouth. I can't sleep. It hurts to eat. I can't eat  anything out of the fridge without sharp pain in every spot I had fillings. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello,Youmay experience some sensitivity that would be considered normal. It should be with the teeth that had the new fillings and taking pain medication such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen should make you feel better. If you were told that a filling was particularly deep the sensitivity may linger especially to cold temperature. Try toothpaste for sensitive teeth and fluoride rinses for some relief to sensitivity. If your gums are sensitive and irritated from the recent dental treatment, rinse with warm salt water and use gentle techniques with brushing and flossing.There are conditions that will require you to return to the dentist for an evaluation.Does your body feel different than before you had the fillings done?You may need an adjustment to your bite. This means you have a high spot. Reducing a small amount of the new filling may relieve your symptoms. I suspect this may be your condition when you have an overall feeling of sensitivity, mainly cold sensitivity, and had more than one filling done recently,Is your pain increasing with hot sensitivity and pressure sensitivity accompanying your discomfort?This raises the concern of an infection. A very deep filling can be too close to the nerve which allows bacteria to enter causing infection. The tooth would require additional treatment such as a root canal.A less common situation would be an allergic reaction to the new materials in your mouth. Monitor your symptoms and update your dentist.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope my initial suggestions offer relief and you feel much better within a week to two weeks. If your symptoms slowly improve take care with a softer diet and avoid extreme temperatures. Continue to practice good oral hygiene and call your dentist for return visit if your condition does not improve shortly."},{"Patient":"My mouth is sore all on the inside, as well as my gums.  Inside of mouth almost feels \\"swollen\\", if you will.  There is a sense that my throat is closing, but I am not having trouble breathing.  My lips feel like they are swollen, but they are not.  They feel numb and dry, but they are not dry.","Doctor":"Hello,You may have an allergic type reaction or an infection of the soft tissue of the mouth. The onset of a throat infection such as strep can have this reaction. Breathing by mouth can cause a dry mouth and lips. This is a stress on your tissues and causes discomfort.First think of any changes to products used, medications or in your diet. Stop the use and evaluate. Take some anti-inflammatory medication such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Benedryl is an antihistamine that can reduce inflammation and swelling.Rinsing your mouth with warm salt water, keeping well hydrated, proper nutrition and continued good oral hygiene are recommended. Avoid acidic foods and liquids. Alcohol use can cause dehydration. Drink plenty of water.  Oral yeast infections can occur if you have recently taken an antibiotic or another medication that causes an imbalance in your natural bacteria. Lichen planus is an oral condition, often origin unknown, that can cause some of the symptoms described. Prescription antibiotics or comfort rinses could be recommended by your dentist. Schedule a dental visit for a clinical evaluation and review of your dental and overall health. Please seek immediate care if symptoms become worse or you feel the risk of anaphylaxis.If you have additional questions or provide more details, I will be glad to make additional suggestions. I hope my suggestions are helpful and thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"Hi doc,i am 46 y o, height 5' 7\\" & weight 72 kgs. As such i am in perfect health except that I have a case of hiatus hernia.i eat boiled food at night which includes boiled vegetables and boiled chicken almost daily. Ocassionally, maybe once in a month or twice, my gum bleeds slightly (No specific point but in areas where the dentures are joined in a hard to reach point). Is it common to bleed due to food particles getting stuck there? Also I used to chew tobacco but have given up completely for the last 5 months. Then beetle nut and tobacco would get stuck causing swollen gums and i used to flush out with tooth pick resulting in bleeding. Now i follow a good dental hygiene along with hydroxyl and listerine mouth wash. During the past few months my gums have become pretty healthy by the looks of it as compared to before.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for you inquiry. If you were to come to my office for an examination I would first check your tissue in the area you report bleeding. If possible check for the quality of the tissue such as texture, swelling, ulcerated areas and color. I would then check your denture appliance for sharp or broken areas and the fit of the denture. If material gets caught under the denture that indicates it may be ill fitting. That alone can cause an irritation. Your mouth may change with time and use. How old is the denture and does it show a great deal of wear? Tissue changes and loss of bone that can cause a change in the fit of the denture. Uneven wear on the denture can cause ill fitting dentures. I would I just the denture where necessary. Have you noticed a change in the fit or function of the dentures? Do you experience a dry mouth? Have you lost weight with your dietary changes?  A minor adjustment, reline or new dental appliance may be recommended.Chronic irritation can be accompanied by an oral infection such as thrush. That would require an anti-fungal treatment by prescription. Also, with your history I would check for any unusual areas that indicate cancerous tissue.Please make sure you inspect your denture for any damage such as cracks and build up on the denture itself. Plaque and tartar can build up on removable dental appliances. Take the denture out at night and thoroughly clean it. I recommend soaking overnight in an appropriate denture cleaner. Rinse your gums with warm salt water. There are some over-the-counter gels to place on sore spots with an anesthetic effect that you could try for some immediate relief. If the denture is ill fitting, try to use some denture powder or a very small amount of gel to help stabilize the denture. This will prevent the denture from rubbing  with movement. I hope my suggestions are helpful and will offer you some immediate relief. Please consider making a dental appointment with your dentist for a full examination. I would be glad to answer additional questions. I cannot tell from your description if you have a full or partial denture. Practice good oral hygiene and keep well hydrated. Make sure all vitamins are taken to avoid any deficiencies that could cause gum problems. Vitamin E can be soothing to the gums. I hope you feel better soon. Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hi all, I am having Ulcer problem since the past 1 year. Before 6 months I felt vomiting when i am getting hungry.

There is not much space in his mouth. Is there anything I can do at home to treat this?","Doctor":"Hello,The gum tissue can go through changes as teeth erupt. Keep up good oral hygiene. Flossing is very important to clean the tissue in between teeth. Gentle, stimulating brushing on the gum can increase blood flow to reduce inflammation. Vigorous rinsing with warm salt water is also recommended. The tissue may shrink and become firmer between the teeth. Be sure to use a soft or extra soft toothbrush. The teeth are moving and  your jaw continues to grow. This may resolve on its own. If you notice any changes to the tissue or it increases in size, be sure to contact your dentist for an evaluation and rule out infection. Crowding has an effect on the tissue. You may wish to consult an orthodontist to increase spacing between the teeth. This would require braces.Occasionally, part of a baby tooth root gets caught under the gum and can cause an irritation. Some excess gum tissue can also raise  concerns of a systemic disease or be an effect of a medication. If the situation does not improve, schedule a dental exam with your dentist. Your dentist can reshape or remove excess tissue if necessary.I hope you find my recommendations useful and thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"Hello Sir.

An increase in the size of your tongue due to inflammation can affect your speech. A growth or tumor is possible. Other disease states can have side effects that could affect the function of your tongue. I am glad that you clean your tongue daily. Be sure to practice good daily dental care. Warm salt water rinses have a cleansing and soothing effect. Be sure to keep well hydrated, proper nutrition, and balanced vitamins. You describe a change in the size of your tongue which could indicate swelling. You should rule out an allergic reaction. Think of any changes you may have made such as using a new dental product or change in your diet. Eliminate any possibilities and evaluate the result.You can try some anti-inflammatory medications such as acetaminophen and advil. An antihistamine such as benedryl may help, but can make you tired.  These may reduce your symptoms and offer some relief.There are oral rinses that may be helpful such as chlorohexidine gluconate which reduces bacteria in the mouth or betamethasone sodium phosphate which is a corticosteroid used to reduce mouth soreness.You should schedule a dental exam. A routine exam and cleaning will evaluate your dental health. Periodontal disease and dental infections must be ruled out. Your dentist will review your overall health. Antibiotics or precription medication may be needed. A diagnosis will be needed to decide the best treatment.

However,it will reduce microbial growth rate.You can use it thrice a week.You can use a antibiotic course to reduce the infection.You can take paracetamol for the pain.Please DO NOT take aspirin.If the pain is severe and still sustains after the antibiotic course, you can have a access opening done on your tooth to relieve the pain and infection.This can be considered. Do not get a X-ray done.Also,get the tooth out of occlusion(grinded) to reduce pain.hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, i have a swollen gum at the back of my teeth(molar). It all started after eating unripe paw-paw(its not the first time i'm eating that). Overnight, i woke up with a swollen gum, i took paracetamol after sometime the swelling went down and the pain subsided. Later on, it wasn't working. I started taking another pain relieving called labdic relief along side vit C, applying bonjela on the affected gum, and washing my mouth with diluted TCP. Later on, it stopped reacting to that treatment. Then i decided to take ampiclox which after taking i noticed another swollen gum beside the tooth after the molar(that is the second to the last tooth) now both swellings are almost covering up the molar(the last tooth).

There is still a small hole on the side where my tooth was removed, but has been checked and I've been assured everything looks fine. Still not fully recovered though and am wondering what needs to be done.","Doctor":"Hello,Healing will take longer than this time frame. A small hole is not a concern unless there is inflammation in the socket. Consider having the socket rechecked since you report sinus discomfort. Sometimes the socket area needs to be cleaned out and antibiotics may be considered. You may have a sinus condition or ear infection that is a seperate concen if the socket looks fine again. With assurance that all looks fine, you may still experience some discomfort with healing. Make sure you continue to rinse well and prevent anything from getting lodged in the hole. Take some anti-inflammatory medication, practice good hygiene and be gentle with your diet.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"Hey Sadia Here,Just had my first root canal treatment on my first molar and as the numbness wore down the pain began to come back, i took 2 diclomol and the pain has been relieved a bit, but will the pain come back before my next treatment or not ?Thank Youx","Doctor":"Hello,It is not uncommon to have discomfort while having a root canal since you are in the process of treating an infection. You are taking an anti-inflammatory medication which I recommend that you continue to take for relief. In addition, I place my patients on an antibiotic when discomfort occurs with root canal therapy. If you just have sensitivity after the visit, it may be a simple soreness from being work on that should settle down in 24-48 hours. If pain continues or feels worse, I prescribe Amoxicillin 500 mg. Please cotact your dentist to inquire about taking an antibiotic, dosage and length. Avoid chewing near the tooth. If you have a severe pressure building up, sometimes you need the temporary filling adjusted or removed to drain pressure inside the tooth. Sometimes your bite will be reduced to not allow any pressure to be placed on the tooth as well. Your treating dentist will advise you.I hope my recommendations are helpful. Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"My back molar tooth broke a while back but it does not cause me any pain what so every. I noticed several months ago that there was some tissue growing inside. Tonight, I noticed that the tissue is black. This happened a few months ago and I used some of my oral tools and poked it and it started to bleed. A few days later I noticed it was pink again. I noticed tonight that it is black again. I can't afford to go to the dentist right now. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello,Your description indicates that the tooth is decayed to the point that unhelalthy tissue has invaded the tooth. You now most likely have an unrestorable tooth that is infected. The infection is surrounded with hemmoraghic tissue that bleeds easily and a pocket of pus and blood may be released after you poke at the area. Drainage may prevent pressure buildup, but does not cure the infection. You need to evaluate the tooth with an x-ray to determine if it requires an extraction or can be restored. If a tooth has a fractured section untreated for a long period, sometimes the gum will cover that section and become inflamed, but with tooth restoration  will easily heal.  The longer you delay with dental care, the more severe problems occur and less treatment options. Since you are not sensitive, I believe the tooth to be necrotic. The nerve is not alive any longer, but now  infection will spread from the tooth. At some point you may experience pain, swelling and pressure sensitivity. Anti-inflammatory medication and rinsing with warm salt water may offer temporary relief. Try not to let debris block the tooth to allow drainage. Antibiotics may be required and dental treatment should be obtained as soon as you are able to schedule a visit.  Regular dental visits are recommended to check your overall dental health and rule out any other complications.I hope this helps you and thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"I just had my wisdom teeth removed a little over a week ago and ever since the surgery I can't nap. Every time I fall asleep during the day I will wake up nauseous and have vomited on occasion, but this doesn't happen in the mornings. Could this be something with lack of sleep? I am also worried this could be early signs of pregnancy","Doctor":"Hello,I would not expect you to have these symptoms over a week after the extractions. Are you taking medications with possible side effects? Many pain killer narcotics can be associated with digestive upset. Antibiotics are known to upset the digestive tract and can affect the balance of normal bacteria. You should follow up with your dentist to make sure healing is progessing well and that any medications you are taking are not causing problems. Delayed healing could have an infection present and need presription medication to treat. If you have inflammation present your throat could feel swollen and cause a gagging reflex.Make sure you practice good dental home care. Continue to rinse with warm salt water.  Try some medication to soothe your stomach. Avoid acid foods and drinks. Stay hydrated. Try to stay slightly elevated rather than flat on your back.If you have any concerns of pregnancy, visit your physician. Take a home pregnancy test. You benefit from knowing as soon as possible especially if you require any medications. If you do not have dental complications, your physician can look into other causes such as acid reflux (GERD).Thank you for your inquiry.

They don't hurt, but have a less smooth surface than other parts in my mouth. I felt them first about 2 weeks ago, but have grown since then.","Doctor":"Hello,A possible explanation would be trauma from biting your cheek. You could grind your teeth at night and catch your cheek. You may damage the tissue and have some bleeding. Any difficulties with your bite with sharp edges or broken teeth? Any recent changes such as dental work, change in health care products, diet that could cause an allergic reaction? Rinse the area with warm salt water and continue to monitor for changes. If you repeat the trauma, that could explain the increase in size. I suggest you consult with your dentist. A clinical exam would provide you the best diagnosis. The concern is to rule out a serious condition such as a cancer. There are other infections possible and once diagnosed, medication may be an option to improve the condition. Your overall health needs to be reviewed with your dentist as well. Changes to your health, medications, diet, dental health etc. all need to considered.

I have had fever for 3 days now and was seen ad a doctors office yesterday for hurting my back at work. I was given a muscle relaxer cause they said I was swollen in my lower back. But cannot understand why my gums are rEd and swollen and why this fever doesn't go away. I have taken aleve & ibuphrophen for pain.","Doctor":"Hello,You are already taking a fever reducing medication. Gums can react to various medications especially if your mouth is dry or you have gastric upset from the medications.I suggest a dental exam. If you have not had a regular dental visit, then a basic cleaning could help resolve your inflamed gums while the condition of your teeth would be evaluated and infections diagnosed. Infections in the mouth can cause these symptoms. A prescription medication such as an antibiotic may be necessary. Make sure you are well hydrated, keep up with good daily oral care and add salt water rinses to help soothe the gums. Proper nutrition and balanced vitamins are important. Vitamin E can be soothing.I appreciate your inquiry with HealthcareMagic. I hope my answer is helpful and you will schedule a dental visit as suggested. I would be glad to answer any additional questions. Thank you and I hope you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"Ive started to have pain on the left side of my mouth.....

Often an infection can make a tract threw bone and burst to drain. Pus and blood released would ease the pressure. You need to see your dentist for an incise and drain procedure. Anti-inflammatory medication can offer some relief, but antibiotics along with drainage will control the spread of infection. If you can massage and put some pressure on the area you may be able to get some release on your own, but I am concerned with the amount of pain you are experiencing.

Any ways after going through your mentioned issues you are 61 years old, which means aged along with you are a active marathon runner which is really appreciable. usually in the aged people there will be reduction in the disc spaces which results in compression of nerves causing back pain which often radiates to the shoulders or it could be spondylitis also.

It can be a deficiency or a medication or illness affecting the enamel structure that was not present when other teeth were forming. These tooth buds form diring pregnancy. These are teeth that come in first and if a baby if left with a bottle with milk or juice acids, the enamel can be weakened and destroyed. It can appear as you describe. The tooth will decay and appear dark. If left untreated, the teeth can become infected. Root canal and crown placement would be an option if enough tooth remained. Early treatment could be a bonding, but your description sounds like a full crown would be needed if possible. If teeth need to be removed, temporary removable teeth can be made. You should have your child seen by a dentist. A pedodontist specializes in dental care for children. It may be 4-5 years until the adult teeth erupt. The baby teeth are important to keep the correct room needed for the adult teeth and help keep the sequence in order. There are speech and cosmetic concerns. Options are best discussed with the dentist after an exam to diagnose your child's dental health. Other teeth may have decay no visible to you.Thank you for your inquiry.

First of all be relaxed,  I will be most happy if I could help you out.Gone through your query, it really sounds very unusual that the fracture didn't  heal in 5 year even after placing the plate. the offendin tooth/teeth should be treated to treat the infection. And the doctors also told you about the complications of extracting the teeth.If there is any expected complication, the tooth/teeth can be managed under general anesthesia.

I can assure you that this is simple problem and nothing to worry. Your query consists of two components. First component is black veins on the bottom surface of the tongue.  That is a benign condition characterized by dilated and tortuous veins on the bottom surface of the tongue, which does not require any treatment. Second component is different sensation of tongue. Tongue will have taste buds to identify the taste sensations. Taste buds can’t alter the taste sensation. In your situation, I would like to rule out any possible ulcer present in the oral mucosa and surface and borders of the tongue. In majority of the patients ulcer would be the main reason for varying of taste sensation ranging from more spicy to burning sensation. If ulcer is absent any possible stomatitis may be found.

I can assume the tooth was infected due to your description of pus, but do not know the general condition of his oral health. The infections affect the entire mouth and body.  Please follow up with a full dental exam if your father has not completed this. If this does not resolve the condition, other systemic deficiencies or disease possibilities need to be considered. Correct diet, needed vitamins and keeping well hydrated are important.I have concerns with the quality of his saliva and adequate flow of saliva. His medications may cause dry mouth. The daily plaque will become thicker and more difficult to remove. Tartar will develope and this can feel rough. An infection that was draining may have created a coating and caused a higher acidic content in the mouth. If your father had been placed on antibiotics, this may disrupt the bacteria balance in his mouth. Sometimes an oral yeast infection can occur and need treatment. The tongue can become red, sore and have a different feel or texture. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope my response has been helpful.

I noticed that I started having terrible headaches that make me dizzy and nauseus since I was told I had a gum infection. My gums are still sore and I feel pounding every now and then.","Doctor":"Hello,Periodontal disease can include infections that spread. Your system can react with these symptoms if the infection is severe. I do not know the extent of your periodontal disease or treatment provided. Are teeth loose and moving? Have you been placed on medications and have you ever had an allergic reaction to similar medications? Do you have habits such as grinding your teeth? Headaches and migranes can be associated with grinding or clenching your teeth. Often your bite needs adjustment with severe periodontal disease. I would suggest you discuss your symptoms with the dentist that diagnosed your periodontal disease.Toothpaste for sensitive teeth and fluoride rinses can help reduce soreness. You must keep up good dental hygiene. Warm salt water rinses may soothe healing tissue. Proper nutrition and hydration are important. Diet considerations may include a softer diet with reduced acidic, alcohol and spicy content. No smoking. Reduce irritants to your tissue. Pain and anti-inflammatory medications often help with discomfort and healing with periodontal treatments. Your dentist may prescribe a prescription rinse to assist healing and comfort.Thank you for your inquiry.

Actually radiation therapy causes this trush and improper taste, to prevent it you have to go for proper oral hygiene maintenance with regular mouthwash.And to prevent thrush and dryness of mouth you have to go for excess intake of water. And your taste will take 2 to 3 months to recover back.Hope it will help you."},{"Patient":"hello i went in this morning and had 10 teeth out under GA and all was fine but one of the stiches in the top left tooth that was pulled out has come out it bleed quite heavily at first and there was a flap of skin hanging down but it has stopped bleeding now do you think it will be ok ?","Doctor":"Thanks for using Health Care Magic.Read your query.Good , the bleeding has stopped.I would advice you to visit your as soon as possible and get it resutured .Since you have removed multiple number of teeth and to avoid any more bleeding and further infection,it is better to get it redone.Do warm saline gargling.Avoid forceful gargling as it may dislodge the clot leading to dry socket.Continue the medication as advice by your dentist .Hope this was useful.Thanks and regards."},{"Patient":"I have severe tooth decay for quite sometime and half of my tooth has already disappeared. However, I never had any special pain except a sharp pain whenever I used to drink hot/cold drinks. Last night suddenly I experienced the worst pain ever. It was so throbbing and I felt like stabbing pain is much, much better than the pain I experienced. It started from the lower jaw last tooth and extended to the back-portion of the brain-1; to the ear-2; to the throat-3. It was a shooting pain lasting for more than 10 minutes. I was just holding breathe, taking short breathes in order to control the pain. It was very severe. This morning I experience it again for 10 minutes and then after a gap of an hour I experienced the same pain. Now, every hal hour I get this pain. After immediately calling up my friend, I took NSAI. My question is--how long will it take the bacteria to enter the blood. I fear that bacteria entered the blood stream.  If that's the case, then is it fatal? I am bit tense.","Doctor":"Thanks for using Health Care Magic.Read your query.The pain suggest that there is a infection caused due to the carious tooth (peri apical abscess).I would advice you to take ibuprofen tab(if you are not allergic to any medication).you will also require an antibiotic ).Please consult your dentist and take it as soon as possible.Do not apply any hot pack to relieve the pain .Do saline gargling.Have a radiograph done and get the needful treatment done either root canal treatment or extraction.Hope this was useful.Thanks and regards."},{"Patient":"Hi,My daughter is 8 yrs old and her teeth have not yet fallen, there is no sign of the same as well.

Since he starting wearing his retainers last night he has had an increase in vomiting due to the retainers stimulating his gag reflex.  Is there anything he can do to help this problem?","Doctor":"Hello,I am sorry to hear of this difficulty with the retainers. Having something on the roof of the mouth can take getting used to and stimulates salivary flow. There is a breaking in period. Rinsing with an astringent mouth wash may reduce the sensation. The extent of the retainer reaching to the back of the mouth should be adjusted as to reduce size and keep as thin as possible. There are other designs for retainers that do not sit on the roof of the mouth. An option may be one that sits on the teeth with clear acrylic. The clear retainer is often preferred by patients. Many orthodontists prefer the Hawley type on upper teeth especially if the upper jaw has been expanded. Please discuss this with your orthodontist. There may be some longer term options for a bonded retainer if the vomiting cannot be controlled. You do not want to have the teeth move after completing orthodontic treatment for lack of wearing a retainer. Thank you for your inquiry.

Apparently a regular dentist can't help me, I need to go to a hospital with a specialist. I seem to be getting a nose bleed every couple of days now, a very stiff jaw and intense headaches.","Doctor":"Hello,You have already been referred to a specialist. Is this an oral surgeon to remove the wisdom tooth? I am unsure if it is impacted since you refer to the wisdom tooth as damaged. Does it have decay causing an infection? Your stiff jaw and headaches could be from pressure with the spread of an infection. Typically, nose bleeds are not due to wisdom teeth. I would be more suspect of sinus issues. Dry tissue in the nose, dehydration and increased blood pressure could cause nose bleeds. If an infection has created a fistula and developed a pathway for an infection to drain, the nose may experience what appears as bleeding. A growth or tumor could cause bleeding.Rinsing with warm salt water, nasal saline spray, proper hydration, and anti-inflammatory medication may help you get some relief until you schedule a visit with the specialist. Were you given an antibiotic? This may be necessary to slow down the spread of infection until you remove the wisdom tooth. I hope you will seek care and that these suggestions are helpfu.

You may have bitten your tongue or have a serious condition such as a cancer. Rinse with warm salt water, avoid spicy and acidic foods. Once you bite your tongue, it may swell and repeat biting can make it difficult to heal. Raw or cut tissue can be sensitive enough to cause a sharp pain when touched. An ulcerated sore may be present. There are rinses that your dentist can prescribe to help reduce the discomfort. Pain and anti-inflammatory medication can offer some relief.

You sound like your condition is spreading and this indicates an infection that needs treatment and the source diagnosed. You may have a dental condition such as an infection of a tooth or the gums. You may have a sinus infection or a resistant infection such as strep throat. Sometimes saliva carries the infection causing agent that can be wiped on the face and cause a skin reaction. Diagnostic tests are needed. Visit your dentist for an exam especially if you have not had a recent checkup and your doctor to evaluate respiratory and throat infections. This will determine if antibiotics are needed and your needed treatment.I hope you find my answer helpful and will act on my recommendation to feel better soon. Some anti-inflammatory medication and warm salt water rinsing may help you feel better until your visit.

The dentist has said otherwise teeth and gums are healthy but offered no suggestions as to how this can be rectified - as it is affecting my son's confidence....  thanks","Doctor":"Hello,There are some cosmetic procedures possible. Fluorosis is a common cause for this condition. The pulp chamber of the teeth may decrease in size with age and affect the color of the overall tooth. Some severe cases of mottling are at higher risk of decay. Cosmetic concerns can be very personal and today's procedures offer many options.-Whitening or bleaching procedures can make the spots appear more blended. There is no guarantee on the amount of change, but if result may be  satisfactory. This procedure can be repeated and does not prevent trying any other procedure. Whitening toothpaste can be a first step and helps to maintain the shade. There are take home methods and in office treatments available. Your son, being young, would need to be evaluated by the dentist. Age, large nerve chambers (pulp), and sensitivity are concerns. This is best for mild case and can be repeated.-Micro and Macro Abrasion removes a layer of enamel. The teeth are polished. This procedure can not be reversed and is best for mild to moderate conditions. This does not need to be repeated.-Bonding or veneering teeth is a procedure where a composite material that matches or is lighter than the natural tooth shade is layerd on top of the tooth. This can be a thin, additional layer covering the entire tooth, which would be reversible by a dentist or may include some removal or reshaping of enamel which would make it not reversible. Fracture is a risk or wear can occur requiring replacement. This is best for moderate to severe cases.Porcelain veeners are a stronger, more color stable material that cover teeth and can provide multiple shade selections. Thin to thicker veneers are possible with varing amounts of enamel alteration performed. This is the most expensive option. Veneers may fracture or need replacement. This can be best for severe and weakened enamel.I hope this offers you a solution for your son and you find my suggestions helpful. Please do not hesitate to ask additional questions.

If the swelling is in one area, this may indicate more of a growth, cyst or tumor and should be investigated further with a clinical exam by a dentist or a specialist, an oral surgeon.Try to think about any changes you made about four months ago when you first noticed this problem. Has the amount of swelling changed in the four months? This should include medications, dietary changes, and tooth care products such as toothpaste, rinses, etc. Have you had recent dental work? Materials used or a change in your bite could be a factor.And untreated fungal infection could have an effect on you tongue. The swollen tongue could cause you to rub the tongue against your teeth and cause indents which could then turn into sore spots. Being uncomfortable with your tongue may encourage you to develop some habits. Certain viruses can cause swelling and ulcerated irritations that can recur.  Mouth cancer on the tongue can occur, often along the back border, near the molars. An occurance here with rapid changes would be of urgent concern. A clinical exam by a dentist would be recommended to evaluate your condition. Medication may need to be prescribed.I hope this answer is helpful and gives you some direction.

I have never had any trouble with my teeth (no fillings etc.). My gums have been a little sore since which is to be expected as she gave them a thorough clean. However, I am getting a pain at a particular point on my gums. It is at the back of my mouth next to my back wisdom tooth. The tip of the gum has gone a little black in the past couple of days and when pushed a little, I can separate the gum from my tooth. Having looked at google, it could be Pericoronitis? I have a feeling she may have 'drilled' into the gum accidently when cleaning and caused some trauma? Any views welcome.","Doctor":"Hello,Yes, you could have a condition of pericoronitis. You are describing a difficult location to clean and you may have had some tartar along with inflamed tissue there. Do not chew on this side of your mouth to avoid getting anything caught in the pocket between the gum and the tooth. I would suggest vigorous rinsing and continue gentle cleaning. Warm salt water used multiple times a day is an excellent choice. You can take some pain relief and anti-inflammatory medication. Tissue is more fragile if inflamed, so it can be traumatic with scaping of this unhealthy tissue causing bleeding and possible slight ripping. This shoud resolve if you keep the area clean to allow it to heal. If the tissue does not start to feel better and seem closer to the gum soon, you will need to return to the dentist to evaluate. If symptoms get worse, especially swelling, see the dentist. Antibiotics may be required. It is possible there is some tartar deep under the gum that could not be removed with a simple cleaning or something afterwards has gotten caught below the gum.  A deep scaling while numb may be required to clean deeper into the pocket. Probing the area determines a measurement which will help determine if the area is able to heal, tissue needs to be removed or extraction of the wisdom tooth should be considered. If your wisdom tooth is in the process of erupting or you do not have room for the tooth to fully erupt out of the tissue, you have a situation that can reoccur. I hope this answer is helpful to you. I would be glad to discuss your situation further if you have any additional details or questions.

His pediatrician said the severity of his enamel dysplasia could cause major health issues, namely with hiws heart if it wasn't taken care of. is this true?","Doctor":"Hello,I would think the pediatrician is warning  you that there is a high risk  of infection without the shield of strong enamel. Decay can advance quickly in the dentin layer. Once into the pulp, bacteria has a chance to travel in the blood stream. Describing a 17 year old needing to pull teeth is a very severe situation. Placement of bonding or crowns to replace enamel and protect the teeth might be an option. If the recurrent decay rate is high, continued restorative care may be problem better treated with extractions and implants placed.

Only last for about 2-3 hrs then the throbbing is back. I do have some endone in the house, took 5 mg last night but did not help, am I safe to take 10mg. I am 110kg & really over the pain.","Doctor":"Hello,I am sorry to hear about your painful situation and that you have no opportunity to see a dentist. The pain being intense indicates an infection or nerve exposure. Please go to an urgent care doctor or emergency room for an exam. Antibiotics can act as your better pain killer until you treat the source of the pain by seeing a dentist. Antibiotic, by prescription, can control the spread of the infection and avoid a worse scenario.You should be taking endone only by prescription and doctor recommending proper dose level for this condition. Controlling pain levels can require a higher dose. This drug also requires to be taken at regular intervals to be effective. If you increase the dose, the pain will still return after a few hours. Use the lowest possible effective dose of  medications. You should be aware that this is a narcotic with possible side effects and can be addictive if not taken properly. You now have taken two different narcotics that only offer relief for a few hours. I can recommend you try taking an acetominepin and ibuprofen combination at regular intervals to relieve pain. This assumes your medical history allows you to take these medications. Please seek care at an available pratictioner's clinic. I hope this is helpful and you are able to feel better soon. Than you for your inquiry.Both Panadiene and Endone can be addictive. Codiene is a narcotic."},{"Patient":"Hi. My girlfriend is normaly Ibuprufen tolerant.

I have another dentist that would like to try I have 2 united concordia dental programs that would cover %100 of procedure.  What is your opion if my bridge does not meet the requirements of antie's law?","Doctor":"Hello,Fixed bridges used to replace missing teeth need strong abutment teeth to support the empty span. How long is the empty span? The straighter these abutment teeth are and good bone support are important factors.  Your overall bite stability is a factor as well.  Keep in mind that most insurance will have a period of time, often five years, that they will not pay for a replacement bridge again. This is a question to ask your treating dentist. I need more details, such as location, how many missing teeth, condition of remaining teeth, your gum and bone condition to give you a better opinion. Have you given consideration to implants? If you are not replacing a bridge or the teeth near the empty area do not require crowns by themselves, I would encourage you to discuss this option. You are wise to get multiple opinions. You may ask the dentist to show you models of your teeth and go over any concerns with bridge placement. This will help you visualize your bridge. I do think Ante's Law is an important factor. This will generally determine how many abutment teeth are needed to be included in the bridge. Your bite and the stress on your bite all factor into how well the bridge will work for you. You should include an additional tooth now if there is doubt about  how well the bridge will last. I would be glad to assist you with additional questions. I hope my opinion has been useful and assists you with your treatment decision."},{"Patient":"I just came from the Oral Surgeon and he examined me for a small (no pain) smooth white spot in the vascular ducts on the underside of my tongue. He advised me to just continue to watch it and return in 3 months for reevaluation. I am trying to recall the name that he used to identify this spot. (something like Phibolist) He said it was a calcium deposit similar to a kidney stone. Do you possibly know the name of this stone?","Doctor":"Sialoliths may be the name mentioned to you. Have you been told that your salivary gland duct is blocked? Calcium deposits under the tongue are not uncommon. Your salivary flow is important to the health of your mouth. Salivary flow reduction can cause dry mouth, bad breath and even an infection in the duct. Wharton's  Duct  is located under the tongue. You can try to stimulate the flow of saliva by sucking on something sour such as a lemon. increased flow can push out calcium deposits and prevent the need for surgical removal.A Phlebolith, by definition, is a calcification in a vein or blood vessel. Vascular malformations may present with these. Sometimes, although present at birth, these may become prominent or increase later in life.  Swelling may become evident. The phleboliths may be seen on an x-ray. Additional studies including ultra-sound and MRI may be required to determine vessel involvement. Hemangiomas are common with swelling, but less common with a phlebolith association in the mouth."},{"Patient":"My wisdom tooth has cavities and my dentist suggested that i have it extracted.

Is it because of the tooth or something else?","Doctor":"Hello,In my opinion you need a dental exam to determine the source of your discomfort. Decay will get larger with time and can cause an infection. The spread of an infection can make other teeth hurt. All fillings will wear and decay  can get underneath.  Pressure sensitivity can indicate a problematic tooth. Infected teeth can rise and cause a change in how you bite. This could give you a headache."},{"Patient":"Hello.

I had so much pain then I go to another oral surgeon he finds the 2 roots in there and the first doctor never tells me till i find out thru a cat scan.the second doctor takes it out and he hits a nerve and i didn't feel after the intial operation for hours numbness in my lower left lip and chin, He said it will come back it has been 2 yrs and still no feeling in lip and chin. will this stay forever? did he hit the nerve ? and he left the other root in because it was right on top of the nerve not even a hair of a slip if he remove it i would have a drop jaw and also he dislocated my jaw and gave me tmj problems after he did the operation. tell what i should do.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome to HCM.Injury to the mandibular nerve is common complication of third molar surgery.Your first doctor must have thought it is better to leave the roots instead of attempting to removing them.Because,they were very close to your nerve.Your second doctor also left a root.This small piece of root will resorb by itself in the process of healing your extraction socket.Do not worry about it. It may take some time for the root to completely resorb.Okay,so your second doctor did not hit the nerve.Your tooth root is right on top of your nerve.So,when he moves this root, it will disturb the nerve as well. In some patients, the roots do not touch the nerve. But, in your case they are right on top of the nerve.Take Renerve plus for a month. This regeneration of your senses in your lip and chin might take anywhere between 6 months to 2 years.Take care while chewing.Regards."},{"Patient":"I had a crown beak off over a cracked tooth that i had a root canal on. It didn't hurt when the crown broke off. Gums were a little sore when I chewed firmer food but otherwise good. I then went to the dentist to get the tooth extracted so it wouldn't end up getting infected if food got in it. He numbed me up enough we thought but when he went in for the pull the pain went beyond pressure to total mind bending pain. He refused to work on me further since the pain was too much and abnormal. The dentist referred me to an oral surgeon so i could be put under because he felt I couldn't handle the pain that shouldn't be there in the first place with local anesthesia. And he prescribed me an antibiotic, clindamycin because of my allergy to amoxicillin, because he thought i might have an infection that was causing the severe pain during the procedure. Please tell me there is some alternative to this awful antibiotic. And tell me if i need an antibiotic at all if I only felt pain in my tooth when the procedure was happening. I'm scared. I had a tooth extraction before and it went just fine. Should I see a different dentist that just does normal extractions or see the oral surgeon and be put under? Thank you","Doctor":"Hello DearThanks for your query and of course  thanx for writing in detail. I will be most happy if I could help you out so no need to worry much. I will be discussing all one by one.   *Since your tooth was root canal treated, it is less likely to have infection in it.     But the anesthesia doesn't worked so the possibility of any infection and     inflammation can't be ignored.(Clinical along with Radiographic evaluation is     required)      *Dental extractions need more than one nerve to anesthetize, so in your        case it might be possible that one of the nerve couldn't get anesthetize       due to any technical mistakes or anatomical variations (more common in       lower jaw).• I will advice you to get an appointment with a general dentist/oral surgeon with whom you are more comfortable as early as possible so that he/she can do thorough clinical examination and will take the radiograph (X ray) to confirm whether there is an infection present or not and start the needful treatment. (Procedure+Medication).Coming towards the medication, since the dentist tried to extract the the tooth, there should be a wound due to instrumentation.So antibiotic coverage may or may not be required depending upon the wound. You can't discontinue any medicine if its awful,  but if you are not feeling any type of pain/swelling/pus discharge or any other discomfort in that area you may discontinue the antibiotic. I hope You will get the appointment in a day or two.Till don't forget to Rinse your mouth with Betadene/Viodine/Betakind gargle (contains povidone iodine solution) easily available in medical stores, twice daily.Hope this will help you. If there is any more query or question regarding this in your mind, you are always welcome.Take CareRegards"},{"Patient":"my teeth have always bled a little, but the last week its gotten worse.

I DO and have had clotting problems in my lungs for years and am on Coumadin with INR levels checked regularly. The mouth clotting is new, however, and I have been to an Endodontost and a periodontist, no one even had a clue what it was. I figured it out. The only thing that helps is bursting them with q-tips while using Lidocaine (prescribed). Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hello,This sounds like a change has occurred in your system. First, has the fungal condition been cured and time given for tissue to heal? Seeing dental specialists to rule out gum conditions and infections is an excellent and recommended step. Proper hygiene and nutrition is important. I would expect an exaggerated response and increased bleeding from your history when any oral disease is present. From your description, you seem to have evaluated your dental health which does not make me think common dental conditions that cause bleeding will apply to your complaint. My thought is a blood disorder.Second, what is the source and diagnosis of your high amount of clotting? Have you looked into blood disorders? An increase in the amount of red blood cells produced could require an additional medication to control red blood cell production and even removal of excess blood. This would be in addition to taking Coumadin. I would recommend consulting a specialist with a complete medical history review. There may be additional testing recommended. Consider the possibility of a rare disorder or a later onset change to your body that needs to be diagnosed and treated.  Bleeding elsewhere in your body, medicines, genetics, infections, all need to be looked into. Platlelet insufficiency can cause leakage and blood clots form as you describe. Pin point blood spots to larger blisters are a common symptom in the mouth. There are many causes and this would be a common deficiency to evaluate, if you have not considered blood disorders. Bone marrow function maybe compromised. An autoimmune disorder may be diagnosed.Thrombocytopenia, a platelet disorder, commonly causes clotting in the cheeks.Consider the source of the clotted blood in your mouth may not be from your mouth.  Is it coming from the throat or gastrointestinal tract? Sinus? Ulcers can cause bleeding. Tumors may be possible. Any acid reflux? You refer to popping the clots which would make me think more blood disorder or vessel wall being compromised. I do not generally like to ask so many questions, but I am trying to be helpful in giving you some direction and  suggestions. There is a wide range of possibilities. I am glad to discuss your concerns further and am available for additional questions. Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 3 1/2 years old.

The treatment will be obviously as per the causes. It may be Local decongestant and antibiotic for the nasal bleeding, cauterization or packing and then the investigations like CT scan and all and treatment as per the findings.The lump at the rib cage may need just an anti-inflammatory medicines and local rubrafacients.X-ray and ultrasonography may help to find or rule out the causes and gives a plan for a treatment"},{"Patient":"Hi doc, im 29 years old. 2 days after my period i had a brown discharge for about 4 days, after it went away we had sex and 2 days after that i started getting a milky white slimy discharge, dull pain around my ovaries, now and then a shooting pain in my uterus and it has been going on for a week. last nite i feld my servix is swollen and hard and when i sit down normally it feels like a stumping pain right through into my uterus. please advise on what this can be. thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,thanks for query.This is suggestive of some fungal or bacterial infection in your genital tract.Please visit a gynecologist for examination and diagnosis.You need a course of antibiotics for this,please do not ignore this.Avoid sex also till this gets cured.Take analgesic for pain and visit your doctor.bye."},{"Patient":"I am 66 and my touge swells up at various times without any warning, Mostly this happens at night and wakes me up. but it has happened in nthe day time too.

This is a very embarrassing situation.  Extraction was last Thursday and office closed fri,sat and sun.  Any ideas.  I am 45 years old and having to wear diapers.  I can not always tell when or where this is going to occur and often can't tell I have been incontinent  Thanks in advance for addressing this personal situation.  I take Creon and Lomotil 2 pills of each 4x/day.  Typically it works.  Now, the lomotil has been totally ineffective.  Thanks in advance for any insight or recommendations.  Kim","Doctor":"HiWith your query, as such antibiotics like amoxycillin will also take away the normal/useful intestinal flora which results in diarrhea. Natural remedy is always have yogurt/fresh cued/yakult which is a probiotic which will defnitely help you and also have adequate food moreover, always take antibiotics 30 mins after food. you can also use probiotics like darolac/bifilac/lactobacillus spores otherwise you can also ask your pharmacist amoxycillin which comes with lactobacillus spores with reference from your doctor/dentist.Hope this is helps you."},{"Patient":"I started Aldera ointment 2 weeks ago for BCC areas on my nose.

You have not mentioned that all the 6 teeth were extracted on the same day or in multiple visits.You signs and symptoms can be usually due to few reasons-     - Discontinuation of the antibiotic before the complete eradication of the infection. Allergic antibiotics should have replaced by other antibiotic to cure the infection and inflammation completely. Allergy along with the infection worsens the condition.     - Bigger the wound greater is the chances of spreading the infection, so it should be covered by proper medication till the complete cure of the infection.I think lack of complete medication+drug allergy+big wound contributed in worsening the condition.

I will try to give my best possible advice to you.If someone with same symptoms arrives in my clinic I must ask few questions     -Are you undergoing any type of medication nowadays??     -Are you using any mouthwash nowadays??     -Are you feeling any type of burning or altered sensation on tongue??On the basis of the description you have given in the query,it is bit difficult to reach to the exact diagnosis but still I think that your problem may be because of any medicine or the hormonal changes during the last few weeks.  - There are a number of medicines e.g. metronidazole which secrets through saliva causing metallic or bad taste. I mentioned metronidazole here because this medicine is oftenly used after medical termination of pregnancy to prevent infection.- It may also be possible that the bad taste may be due to hormonal changes in the body during menstruation and pregnancy. Gum tissue responds very quickly to the hormonal fluctuation which can cause significant changes in the microbial flora of the oral cavity and subsequently causing the changes in the oral cavity. As a result, you may see symptoms appear in your mouth.- Use of chlorhexidine mouthwash also sometimes causes metallic taste.I advice you to get an appointment with your doctor/dentist so that the exact diagnosis can be made by clinical examination, medical history and investigations and then treatment can be initiated.Meanwhile you should take preventive measures to avoid such problems.• Try to be even more diligent about brushing twice a day and flossing daily right before your period to keep your gums as clean as possible.• Discontinue mouthwash for few days if using as it may also be a possible cause.Hope this will help you.

Last month went to dentist, got an excellent report.  Always feel like gums swollen . Dentist gave special mouthwash, just caused teeth to discolor.  Very confused.","Doctor":"Hello DearThanks for writing in health care magic. I would be happy to help you.one thing you which you have not mentioned that for how long time you are experiencing metallic taste and  oral ulcers. I am asking this because sometimes use of chlorhexidine mouthwash also causes metallic taste.Azelect medicine also tends to cause dryness of mouth in few cases which further causes increased microbial activity inside the oral cavity which can be a cause of your swollen gums.Now coming towards oral ulcers. It is usually apthous stomatitis or herpetic stomatitis. But it may be due to other reasons also.Usually it heals without any treatment within 7-10 days.Here I am advising few things that may fasten the healing process • Avoid hot and spicy food and beverages for few days.• Eat more green leafy vegetables.• Rinse your mouth with Betadene/Viodine/Betakind garhle (contains povidone iodine solution) easily available in medical stores, twice daily.• Apply topical gel like Metrogyl-Dg Forte or Rexidine-M gel (commonly chlorhexidine and metronidazole combination). Use it thrice daily for 7-8 days.• Take Vizylac capsule (lactobacillus sporogenes) twice daily for 5 days.Most probably symptoms should start subsiding soon.If not, then get an appointment with your dentist and discuss about the other investigative methods by which accurate diagnosis can be made and treatment plan can be made.

The simplest answer is to stop smoking and see the response of the uvula. Smoking can change your natural flora in the mouth. This can give you an opportunistic infection with an overabundance of certain bacteria. This could affect the uvula and require antibiotic treatment. Something such as strep throat could cause inflammation at the uvula as well. Dry mouth, mouth breathing, sleep apnea all cause some throat irritation and you could experience an inflamed, swollen uvula. There are other medical conditions such as a growth or tumor that are possible. Even an allergic reaction can be a possible response. It is wise to stop smoking and see if you feel better. I would expect a quick improvement. Your vocal cords should be happier too. If you do not feel better within a week to two weeks seek the opinion of your doctor. Anti-inflammatory medication and rinses with warm salt water may offer some immediate relief. Proper diet, no vitamin deficiencies  and good hydration is a must. I hope this is helpful to you and that the simplest soltution will work out.

In the last 3 months, I have been having an issue with irritation/pain on the left side of my tongue just in one spot.  Sometimes it feels like my mouth is burning.  There are no evident lumps, bumps, lesions, sores, or anything else all that noticeable, except that this side is annoying me and is sometimes painful for no reason.  I can speak and swallow fine and my tongue is otherwise pink and healthy.  I have been seeing a dentist for gum cleanings, but don't know if that could have something to do with it.  I was also perscribed medicated mouthwash for the scaling/deep gum cleaning procedure, but have since stopped using it.  Food and liquor don't necessarily bother this side of my tongue, although it could be..hard to tell.  I also used to smoke, but stopped a year and a half ago.  I occassionally started back for 3 months then quit again, so doesn't seem to be a cigarette thing.  Was never a heavy smoker to begin with, but I will say that since this sore spot has come about, the cigarette smoke made it feel worse, so it was easy to stop again.  Haven't had another cigarette since, but the sore spot still there.  Confused, as I know there are a lot of tongue-related issues out there...seems the older I get, the more stuff starts to go wrong.  Any advice?  My dentist told me he didnt feel as if this was anything alarming, but considering I still have these symptoms, I think it's worth looking into again.

There are several causes that can create such type of problem so It is very much important to diagnose the actual cause/causes. It may be due to any nerve injury at that perticular spot which failed to heal or it may have something to do with your previous smoking habit or it may be due to any type of infection or may be due to continuous mechanical irritation to that part of tongue or due to any other reason.So I advice you to firstly get an appointment with your dentist and discuss about the other investigative methods like biopsy, culture or any other methods by which accurate diagnosis can be made and treatment plan can be made.• Hope this will help you.

We were referred to a paediatrician.  He was prescribed sandomigran for a while.  He eventually had a barium meal to see if there was something wrong with his gut.  He is now 13 and has grown out of all of this. Anyway both his baby teeth and now his adult teeth on his bottom right of his mouth have come through with very little enamel.  Is this anything to do with the vomitting or the medication?","Doctor":"Hello,Enamel can be damaged by acid in the mouth. The stomach acid included in vomit with repeat episodes can easily damage the enamel on teeth. This would occur after the teeth are errupted and have been exposed to the acidic environment. This could then be the case with the baby teeth.Now you state the adult teeth have weak enamel. This could be a genetic weakness. Nutrition and medication taken while the teeth are forming will affect the quality of the tooth structure. Baby teeth can be damaged if baby sleeps with a bottle with milk products coating teeth and causing decay. Flouride can be given with children's vitamins to strengthen the formation of the tooth while developing. As adults the addition of flouride is not recommended because teeth are already formed. Instead, topical flouride can help strengthen formed tooth enamel. Too much fluoride taken as a child can have the reverse effect of weakened enamel forming. Often white spots are seen and indicate too much fluoride. The antibiotic Tetracycline is known to darken the layer under enamel and cause grey to brown banding if taken while teeth are forming. No concern with this type of discoloration when taken as an adult.The medication, Pizotifen, does not report any significant dental side affects concerning enamel. This is not available in the United States, so I am not familar with this drug for my patients. Drugs can have interactions and you can question your pediatrician with this concern. Can you tell me why as a child, this medication was recommended? Were migraine headaches determined to be the cause of his vomiting? I am glad to hear he is feeling better. Enamel is precious. Avoid an acidic diet and abrasive brushing techniques. Regular dental exams will check for enamel weakness as these areas will be more prone to decay. Rinsing with flouride may strenghten enamel. Restorative procedures maybe recommended such as bonding or crowns to replace damaged enamel. I hope my recommendations are helpful to you and I will be glad to provide additional answers if you have more concerns. Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"back in feb I had 4 wisdom teeth removed and still have tingling burning and numb 2/3 tongue altered taste like metalic.Both sides of jaw including chin and bottom lip numb.Hard to find the right mri image for nerve damage.I believe its from injection in the corner of my jaw because if you touch this area feels like glass shooting through my tongue.Dentist says he may have streatched the nerve.Does he know something he really not telling me?","Doctor":"Hello,  Read your query, as you have numbness in tongue, altered taste, after extraction of wisdom tooth there is nothing to be worried so much this happens when there is nerve injury or you can say stretched nerve this happen when there is traumatic extraction also , for this you can Do warm saline gargle two - three times a day,  you can take Neurobion tablet and vitamin B supplements with folic acid  by consulting with your dentist for month , You can take supplement protenix also .

Antibiotics can calm down the infection, but if a tooth has abscesses more treatment is required such as removal or a root canal with a restoration. Anti-inflammatory medications can help to control discomfort, but this will be a temporary treatment as well. You can rinse and try to improve your daily oral care. Diet and vitamins good for your health helps your body overall.If your bite is causing trauma to your gums then maybe a simple adjustment and smoothing could help solve your immediate situation.  Teeth will continue to erupt if there is no opposing tooth to keep the bite stable. Braces or removal would be options yo condider. Broken teeth with sharp edges could damage your gums. Different infections or medical conditions can cause changes in the gum that I can not rule out.Your description makes me concerned that you are in greater risk of an infection. You should look for a clinic and find a dentist to have an exam. Dental problems get larger and more painful if left untreated. You put your entire body at risk with an infection that is spreading. You may need to go to the hospital emergency room if pain becomes severe or extreme swelling occurs.  Please try not to delay in making plans for a dental visit."},{"Patient":"I am currently taking 20 mg of citalopram at night to help with sleep & mood, but for the past few months have realized that I am now grinding my teeth at night (which causes facial exhaustion & headaches in the morning) and high number of disruptive dreams. I am exhausted all day and am desperate to re-gain my former energy levels. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello dear,Thanks for the query. I will try to provide you my best possible advice.I have thoroughly gone through your query, Since you are taking citalopram tablets for the anxiety relief, I think that in your case possible reason for Bruxism (grinding of teeth) is stress,anxiety and disruptive dreams.As we all know that curing the cause cures the disease. -Try to be calm and relax because it is only you who can fight with your mental stress and anxiety.-Maintain a healthy lifestyle to help manage stress — eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly and get enough sleep. Having a healthy lifestyle will help you manage periods of high stress.-Avoid alcohol as it tends to intensify the bruxism.-Avoid grinding in in the day and train yourself not to clench knowingly.-Do the works that make you happy, visit the places where you find peace of mind and happiness.-Give your mind a house full dose of joy everyday and I am sure in few weeks you wont need any medicines to reduce anxiety or to sleep and also wont have any disruptive dreams again.-Drink plenty of water and other fluids as it will help to re-energize you.And I also suggest you to visit a dentist so that he/she can provide you the suitable treatment e.g. night guard or selective grinding of teeth or any other.Hope this will help you.

I have small bowel disorder also and recently hospitalized 1mo ago for obstruction that was resolved without surgery but still have problems with digesting certain meds that will slow the gut down....want to make sure antibiotic will not cause problems","Doctor":"Hello DearThanks for your query. First of all be relaxed,  I will be most happy if I could help you out so no need to worry much.I have gone through your query thoroughly.First of all I would like to tell you that in most of the dental problems medicines play role as a supplemental aid along with the treatment. Source of infection which is deep inside the tooth must be removed to get complete cure. So I advice you to get an appointment with the dentist as soon as possible so that he/she can start the needful treatment. Most probably a Root Canal Treatment will cure and save the tooth.Now coming towards FACTIVE (Gemifloxacin mesylate). It is not a drug which is routinly used in this condition since the bacteria which is commonly associated with the dental abscess are not much sensitive to this medicine.Instead you can take Augmentin-625/Megamox-CV 625/Tresmox-CV 625 twice daily for 3 days till you get  appointment with the dentist. Usually this medicine doesnt slow down the gut.You can take over the counter anti-inflammatory tablet for example ibuprofen 1 tablet thrice daily for 3 days.• Please consult your operating doctor before starting the medicine.• Do not apply any type of pressure or hot packs on the affected side, Instead you can use a cold pack.• Try not to sleep from the affected side for few days.Hope this will help you.

Our dentist office is closed now. What should he do?","Doctor":"HiThanks for your query with healthcare magic, as you mention continous bleeding from the gums will not happen after scaling yes, it happens after the immediate scaling but not after that also. anyways are you sure he is not having any bleeding disorders i mean did he remember when he fell or cut  or a wound at that time does the bleeding stopped stopped or? if it stopped immeditely then its fine.then probably i assume your husband is suffering from periodontal disease where the gums are severly inflammed with pocket formation leading to bleeding from the gums.I would suggest your dentist if everything looks normal then it is better to have blood tests done.For now don touch the gums for a while leave then for 30 mins with observation and apply pressure with your fingers so that control of bleeding can happen otherwise you can also use ice over the gums as temporary treatment. If bleeding severe then consult another dentist but dont delay. Hope this is helpful."},{"Patient":"my son had an abscessed tooth and pulled it himself since he does not have insurance.

This can range from sore gums that require a simple cleaning to an infection that may cause swelling, severe pain and require treatment such as a root canal or extraction. I am concerned that you referred to a feeling of numbness. Do you feel swollen? Are your gums bleeding? At home you need to be brushing, flossing, and rinsing. Warm saltwater rinses may help you feel better. You may also take pain relief medication. I recommend anti-inflammatory medication such as Acetaminophen or an ibuprofen. Your dentist can prescribe antibiotics to help control any infection after you complete an exam. I advise you to visit the dentist especially if it has been a long time since you have had any type of dental treatment. Your dentist can advise you if you need to see another physician and this is not a dental problem. Numbness can indicate a nerve problem or another medical condition.Cost will vary depending on your location. I suggest you ask the dental office what expenses to expect on your first visit.

She did a sloppy job and i went to another dentist to attempt to smooth it out with a drill. My right tooth is depleted of enamel. I have light sensitivity. I wonder can still have porcelain veneers?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome.Thanks for sharing your concern.As per the history posted here I would advise you to visit prosthodontist(dentist who deals with crowns and veneers exclusively),so that he/she can analyze the thickness of remaining enamel or dentin and suggest you the treatment accordingly.A diagnostic x ray is also required to see the condition of supporting structures of teeth and the periapical pathology(near the roots).Therefore please see the above said dentist in this regard.Hope it helps.Thanks.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, over the past week I have experienced severe pain in the back, left of my mouth. After a couple of days, I was able to see a small \\"bubble\\" like structure forming on my gum in the very back. I never have teeth problems, and I have had no tooth pain, the pain was only with my gum in that region where the \\"bubble\\" formed. After looking up my symptoms online, I found \\"gum boil\\" and \\"gingival abscess\\". Are root canals necessary for this? It has already drained. It's still somewhat tender to the touch, but otherwise no pain. I have an appointment tomorrow just to be certain, but do you think that just a good antibiotic therapy treatment would kill off the infection? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome.Thanks for sharing your concern.Please do not worry.Gum boils occurs due to infection.It could be due to gum infection or teeth infection.In case of any boil(abscess),firstly it should be treated by antibiotic therapy and later on if required incision and drainage.Root canal is suggested only if it occurs due to decayed tooth/teeth.In that case a  diagnostic x ray is required and after evaluating the x ray treatment is planned.Therefore I would advise you to visit your dentist soon.Hope it helps.Let me know for further doubts.Thanks.Take care."},{"Patient":"Over six months ago a substantial part (about 1/4) of my back bottom left tooth broke off due to a cavity. Due to financial reasons and other dental proceedures need I have not had it removed yet. This morning (May 28, 2014) I brushed my teeth and since then my tooth is aching badly. Very sharp pain, specifically when I such my cheek in (habit to keep hot or cold off the tooth) what could be causing this? Is it possible that I dislodged something that was covering a nerve ending? I know I need to get in to see my dentist immediately, but is there anything I can do while I wait to get in?","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for consulting with HCM.As you are mentioning that your tooth was broken six months ago, it means the tooth was infected at that time only.Now the pain in the tooth denotes that the infection has spread to the apex of the tooth and formed an abscess.You have to visit your dentist now as this problem can not be solved only by medication or something else, as a root canal should be done in the tooth to reduce the infection.Till then you can start with some painkillers to relieve pain for sometime.Hope it will help you."},{"Patient":"I fell on my mouth, split my lip, and my front tooth was hurting a lot.

What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for consulting with HCM.When you have fallen there might be trauma on your front tooth also, that is why it was hurting at that time.Now because of trauma there might be some infection in the apex of the tooth which is causing this abnormal feeling.You must visit your dentist and get an x-ray done of the tooth, as it will show the infection and its area, according to which the treatment will be done.Hope it will help you."},{"Patient":"i have a tooth ache on my entire right side, upper and lower. i have poison ivy,oak or sumac on my face on the same side. i have been to the convenient care and taken antibiotics and a steriod pack. i had the rash in my mouth on my lips and in my eye. it began to clear up after the meds and now a week later it is still on my face and around my eye and is very sensative and itches bad. now every tooth on the right side top and bottom hurts. could the tooth aches be related to the poison ivy,oak or sumac?","Doctor":"Hello,I will try to offer you some assistance concerning your mouth. I do not believe your teeth have been affected by your exposure. You  are suffering from a severe reaction that has caused a great deal of inflammation. This may affect the soft tissue inside you mouth if exposed to any oils of these plants. Simply, inflamed tissue can equal sensitive teeth. Pain medication may help while the amount of inflammation is great. First, make sure you are not getting continued exposure to these plants and oils? Change your toothbrush and anything you may have touched which may carry the oil. There are some benzocaine gels or rinses that you could try for your mouth. Switch to a toothpaste for sensitive teeth. These have a chemical that blocks the tubules on the roots of your teeth to reduce sensitivity. Avoid an acidic diet. I believe there is a relationship between these plants and some foods: mangos and cashews. You need to give this time to heal. Rashes can easily last two weeks. Return to your doctor if you feel your symptoms are getting worse to see if you need more medication. Benadryl which is not a steroid can be taken and reduce uncomfortable symptoms. Topical solutions for your skin are available that can help you reduce the itchy feeling. I hope you will find some of these suggestions useful and I wish you a quicker recovery. Please keep your doctor updated on your progress and plan to see a dentist if your teeth do not start to feel better for a clinical evaluation."},{"Patient":"On the left side of my gums, towards the back between the two back teeth, I have this bump that has formed.

An abscess can cause swelling that could appear as bumps and cause pain.  Some swellings can drain and cause irritation. The teeth can be evaluated by a dentist. X-rays can help diagnosis infections. If the bumps are hard and located on both sides of the mouth they may be tori. This extra bone that is of no concern and should not cause symptoms. A dentist can diagnosis this condition.You may have been treated with antibiotics and sometimes this disturbs the bacteria balance in your mouth. Your  gums can feel sore, sensitive and be red. This condition can require anti-fungal medicine.You may wish to check back with your treating physician since you report throat discomfort and voice change. Some viruses can reoccur or be resistant. It is a good idea to rule out a dental infection with a dental visit. Infections can put stress on your entire body and you can experience general discomfort if left untreated. Infections can be very serious. You are wise to question why you are not feeling much better. Continued mouth breathing causes throat irritation. Are your sinuses clear?I am more concerned with your dental health if you have not had a recent dental exam and are not current on your regular recall visits. As always, practice good oral hygiene: brushing, flossing and rinsing. Keep well hydrated and healthy diet with balanced vitamins.You would need the mole looked at by a dermatologist if changes are occurring and pain continues.I hope you find my suggestions helpful and that you follow my recommendation to see a dentist and your doctor. You need to review your complete medical history with all treating doctors. I hope you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"i recently found out that i had an 8 year low grade infection due to an abcess on a tooth that had a root canal.

I have thoroughly gone through your query and found that you have not mentioned few things, so it is difficult to reach on any diagnosis on the basis of these two signs(dry mouth+skin rashes).If someone with same symptoms arrives in my clinic, I must ask few questions- Since how long time the problem is occuring??- Are you having any problem like dryness, redness or burning sensation in eyes??- Do you also feel pain in joints ??Now if we combine all these signs and symptoms i.e. dry mouth+skin rash+dry eyes+joint pain, it may take us to a condition known as Sjogren's Syndrome, which is an autoimmune disease and only symptomatic treatment can be provided.The problem may be due to any other reason also.

I have had a bad head ache and mouth pain since the work was done.  My jaws seem to be clenching - my tongue feels as if it were placed in a vice grip and I am very sensitive around the site of the injections.  Could I have a blood clot at the site of injection - or possibly damage to a nerve - or something else?","Doctor":"Hello,I am happy to give you some suggestions. You may experience a few days of discomfort after an injection.  Anesthetic liquid can get into a blood vessel and cause swelling or a hematoma that will take time to dissipate. It is common for the side of your tongue to get numb when given lower anesthesia. You may have bitten your tongue and this may cause some discomfort on the side of the tongue. Headaches raise the concern of your bite. Do you feel like you bite the same as before you had your dental work completed? Sometimes you need to revisit the dentist for a bite adjustment and smooth a new filling. You may also experience some soreness from holding your mouth open for a long period of time.  Please take some pain medication and anti-inflammatory medication. This would be Acetaminophen and ibuprofen. I Would need more information on the dental procedures that you completed to give you a more detailed opinion. If your gums are sore, consider  rinsing with warm salt water and continue good oral hygiene. I hope this advice begins to help you feel better soon.

Did you take a prescription anti-fungal medication?Make sure you are gently cleaning your mouth including brushing your tongue. Raised areas are common with thrush. The tongue may take time to heal and for your sense of taste to return. Continue to rinse. Warm salt water is ok and a healthy diet with proper vitamins will help your recovery.Do you have any removeable appliances that go in your mouth such as a partial denture?  This may require treatment with an anti-fungal medication and if untreated could cause a reoccurrence or hamper your recovery. Your dentist can prescribe a powder to mix with water to use as a soaking solution for dentures. Full dentures can require an anti-fungal paste to be placed inside the dentures to assit healing while continuing to wear these appliances.I hope this is helpful and I would be glad to assist you further.

It is painful, as aforementioned, and my tonsils are in pain consistently; never-ending. I recently had a root canal and I took some Hydrocodone and I'm not sure if its a side effect to the drug.  I am also experiencing runny nose from time to time, seemingly when the temperature drops or i take some clothes off.  My main concern is my pain when swallowing and my tonsil pain.  I'm a healthy 21 year old, or at least I was save for a few weeks ago.","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome and I hope to assit you. Having the need for a root canal indicates that you had an infection. Your body needs time to heal and can suffer from the effects of an infection spreading. Did you take a prescription antibiotic since you had a prescription for pain medication? The antibiotic is effective in controlling the spread of the infection and not just a few hours of relief. To be effective you must complete your antibiotic prescription. Pain medication only treats your uncomfortable situation for a specific time. You should not need the pain medication for a very long time if you have completed the root canal. Please check with your dentist concerning an antibiotic and update your concerns with your dentist. Make sure you have all your teeth checked and keep up with good routine dental care as well.I would not consider your reaction a side effect of your pain medication. Medications can irritate the stomach and throat. Dry mouth is more common than exra saliva. You describe symptoms of a sinus infection. You may have post nasal drip which can irritate your throat. Tonsils are one of your first lines of defense to fight infections. A sore throat accompanied by inflammation can cause difficulty when you swallow. So you may have a respiratory infection. This may require a trip to your physician to treat seperately from the root canal. Rinsing may offer some relief. Please discuus these concerns with your dentist. Your dentist will assist you in determining if you need to see an additional doctor.Thank you for your inquiry. I am glad to be of further assistance should you have additional questions or information to share with me."},{"Patient":"hi. im a 20 years old female. i recently got my braces removed and now wearing retainer but only at night. i ve been wearing retainer for three weeks now. recently i found a protuberance under the floor of my mouth. its some kind of swollen tissue (i was thinking sublingual gland). on palpation, it is hard, not movable and mildly painful. this lump is only at the right side. im afraid if this is cyst or cancer..or anything i should be worry about?","Doctor":"Hello DearThanks for your query.

My dentist who prescribed it told me that it was not a dental problem. Now a Homeopath has diagonosed it as Pyorrhea and has given some medications and I am finding that I am getting better. What do you suggest?","Doctor":"Hello DearThanks for your query, I will provide you with my best possible advice.First of all on the basis of only bad breath and white coating over tongue we cant say that its periodontitis (pyorrhea). Bad breath may be an associaed symptom of periodontitis.Bad breath or halitosis can occur due to several cause like more commonly from periodontitis, smoking, poor oral hygiene, alcohol consumption, and less commonly from gastric upset, foods like onion and garlic etc.As in your case you told that after taking 'unienzyme' tablet, you get relieved. At one end it is looking like gastric upset is causing the problem but  at the other end it seems that peridontitis is causing bad breath to you because recently a homeopath doctor has diagnosed it as periodontitis.• So in my opinion, it will be best to visit the dentist to have proper diagnosis and traeatment because if the problem is due to the periodontitis, you have to undergo complete treatment to solve the problem.Hope this will help you. If there is any more query or question regarding this in your mind, you are free to ask any time. Thank You and Take CareRegards"},{"Patient":"I had my wisdom teeth removed five days ago now.

Now I have to go back and finish the root canal--remove the packing and put on temporary crown before a final is placed--my problem is I am afraid the dentist will now say there is not enough tooth left for a crown and will want to do an implant.  I have already spent too much money on this tooth.  I wish I would have just pulled it --it is #19 back molar and they did not recommend it because it will cause other teeth to shift,etc.  But it has turned into one major expense--I hardly have not tooth left after all this--it is just a hole now---can they still do a crown since the dentist said he would re-do it for free?

Rinsing, gentle brushing and flossing to reduce plaque buildup is important. Warm salt water rinses can cleanse the area. Make sure nothing gets lodged in the gum area. Do not chew on that side and consider a softer diet. keep hydrated and take vitamins. Anti-inflammatory medicine such as acetaminophen can offer relief. If pain or swelling increases this indicates the spread of an infection and antibiotics may be prescribed by your dentist. It is then more urgent and you should contact your dentist to be seen as soon as possible and be placed on an antibiotic. I hope this advice is useful and that you will have relief soon."},{"Patient":"Hi, I seem to have what appears to me to be a skin tag on the inside of my cheek. It looks kind of like a pimple, but the reason it seems like a tag is because I can lift up part of it with my tongue. Part of it is has a flap that I can lift. What bothers me is that it's been there for at least a month...it doesn't change size but it doesn't go away either. Do you have any suggestions? I am seeing the dentist soon. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello,The best for you to do is bring this to the attention of your dentist on your visit. My initial question is how does it compare to the other side of your mouth? Your description could indicate the duct to the salivary gland. If this is irritated or blocked, it can appear large. Take a look on the opposite side of your mouth to see if you can locate a duct on both sides. Rinsing advised with warm salt water and avoid trauma to area.Trauma such as biting your cheek can cause something like this. This can reoccur because it is bulky and gets in your way again.  A tag that does not go away can be removed and your dentist can advise you on the various methods if needed. If you grind your teeth at night, you may damage the cheek and not be aware of cheek damage. If you chew tobacco this can happen as well. Tobacco has a known relation to cancer and any abnormal areas should be checked.A cyst or tumor can occur. This is of greater concern if it seems to be getting larger, painful and changes color or texture.Please be sure to complete your dental visit and monitor for any increase in symptoms. I hope this is helpful. Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"A week ago I had a large bump under my tongue along the skin ridge connect tongue and mouth.

My initial question to a patient in my office would be as to the source of the bump? Was it trauma? If so, it sounds like the pocket of blood was formed and you drained it. Now you need to give it more time to heal. Rinse and keep the area clean. Warm salt water may help. If it continues to be an annoyance to you, you can have the extra tissue reshaped or removed. Dentists can use lasers, electrosurgery machines or a scaple.If you are concerned that this may not be healing or have not had a recent dental visit, this would be a good time for a dental check up. A clinical exam would give you the best information on your situation. I hope you find this helpful.

Jaw function difficulties and trauma injury seem to indicate a dental exam should be considered.Dental infections that result in an abcess draining can cause a bad taste often described as metallic. Inflammation and swelling can cause discmfort and difficult function in the jaw and even eye. A dental exam and xrays can help you diagnosis an infection. This would need treatment. Antibiotics can help control the spread of an infection. The source must be treated. root canals or extractions are treatment options.You indicate trauma or an injury. Was there any damage to your head? You could have fractured a root or broken a tooth.  Other damage and conditions are possible that now need evaluation. The facial nerve can affect the eye as well as jaw function. Bell's Palsy can have  a one-sided effect with difficulties that you mention. Your heart medication may have side effects. If you have a dry mouth your taste can be affected."},{"Patient":"I have been prescribed a five day course of 500 mg zinnat. Two days in I feel better but my guns appear to be worse.

Thank you","Doctor":"This medicine is cefuroxime which is in the cephalosporin group of antibiotics. it is a broad spectrum antibiotic. The antibiotic needs to be completed to have the full benefit. You need to be rinsing, brushing and flossing with gentle, but effective care. Warm salt water is an effective rinse. Often some increase in sensitivity can occur as the gums heal. I do not know the condition of your gums when you started the antibiotic. I suggest you discuss this with your doctor. Have you had a cleaning or are you scheduled for more cleaning or a deep under the gum cleaning? Puss on the gums is a sign of infection. You may need an additional perscription. Rinse such as chlorhexidine may be needed to help tissue healing. Please consult your dentist. Some anti-inflammartory medicine may help healing and make you feel better."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am going into surgery in 2 days to get my 2 lower wisdom teeth removed because they are impacted.

Is this the first time you are noticing the teeth? Rinse the area, keep it as clean as possible and take some pain relief, anti-inflammatory medication.Do you think you have been grinding your teeth? This can be a reaction that causes some stiffness and discomfort similar to your symptoms. With tooth movement, this can change your bite and cause grinding.If the teeth have been present and are starting to move, then you must be careful and evaluate the situation for an infection. Are the teeth dark with decay? Is the gum covering part of the tooth and creating a pocket where something got caught? You can develop infections around the tooth (periodontal) or inside the tooth affecting the nerve. Spread of infection is dangerous and I do not recommend that you wait. Simple treatment and medication such as an antibiotic may control the situation untl you arrive home, but would require you seek professional help now.  My advice is to see a dentist or oral surgeon specialist and explain you would like to delay treatment such as an extraction until you arrive home.Please answer some of my questions to help with your decision. I am glad to assist you with any additional questions and hope you will feel better soon."},{"Patient":"I started with what seemed like a cold yesterday, runny nose, sneezing, congested head.

Extraction of wisdom teeth is not mandatory for all the cases.Since your dentist has told you to go for extraction just for anaemic reasons we dont go for extraction under GA.Usually extractions under GA are done for the persons who are allergic to local anaesthetics, handicaped, mentally retarded, in some pediatric patients and some extreme unexceptional situations.I beleive you dont have any of these and you are young too.For any surgical procedure on must have minimum Hb% is 9 you can acheive this by some heamatic drugs or syrups along with good nutritious food you can see the difference in a week in your blood.Hence i suggest you to find out the correct reasons for performing under GA. If you are willing to go extraction of all the teeth i mean 4 wisdom teeth at a time,or you have any discomfort with those teeth then yes it has to be done under GA.otherwise if they are interfering with the other teeth then go for extraction of two on the same side at o nce and remaining two on the other side at once that is better hardly it may it make 1 month to finish it.

In my opinion that white, stringy, filmy stuff may be the thickened saliva rich in mucous(thick component of saliva).

It let my life so hard.2008 when my classmate told me and she noticed it to me, that I have bad smell, coming out of my mouth, because I see a lot of people covering their nose, At first I could kind of smell it myself but not anymore. many of my friends telling that I am stink and ugly, this is the most painful happened in my life, and I'll never forget in my life until I'm getting old, smelly and ugly someone else said to me! I overhear people saying I don’t brush my teeth and other rude comments. I need to stay away from the others that don’t feel good. I’m paranoid about having H (BB). I am suffering severe bad smell in my breath due to some problem in intestine. I have already consulted to dental specialist but they say there is no problem on my teeth, every 6 months I go to the Dentist to cleaning my teeth. I am shy talk to people; I brush my teeth four times and floss, I have bought every possible mouthwash in the stores. Some of my friends telling me that you’re such a stink and dirty at my back. Everyone nearby teased me a lot that I’m bad smell or H (BB) no one can talk to me face to face...! I have a bad odor that comes from my nose, and a strong smell from my mouth that smells like waste. When I talk about this to my mother she gets angry proving that she didn't smell anything but I saw sometimes covering her nose when I get close. I think she's just afraid to spend money if I go get seeking specialists. I insisted to find a job to support myself.  Before I know it, I don't know what caused it. The only thing I can think of is with my teeth…maybe because I eating “isaw or street food”! So I try to avoid these types of foods. I Show gum nothing happens. I am not aware of a bad smell myself but I have been told by others that I radiate this bad smell off me and it smells awful like a poo smell. I was a social person, going out with friends and talking to people. When I open my mouth and ready to talk, some of my friends or other people started to away from my area. I isolate myself so I would not be embarrassed when people hold their nose when they are in my face or around me. I was so afraid I didn't know what to do. 2010 When I already work to Enchanted Kingdom as a cashier, some of my co workers have also told me that; you have a bad smell, as well as my visor, she knows me about this. At that point, I don't even need to open my mouth for it to smell bad, I want to cry….! I feel like I lost my job behind this. The smell come out with my mouth is one of the big problems for me. I stay away from people because of my condition. I can smell it when I yawn, cough, clean my nose and sometimes while eating. Due to my mouth so stinky I have no friends, and no social life. I asked God to do a miracle for me and have my H(BB) go away. Because I've been treated they way I smell, like poo. My Neighbor often talks about me on my back. People hate me, also my relatives they know it about my condition, and my family also. I just started brushing, flossing, and gargling with Listerine constantly. That didn't work.  It brings me down even more.  I didn't realize how rude and inconsiderate people can be.I didn’t wish to come to be like this.","Doctor":"thanks for your query i have gone through your query. i personally feel sorry for your problem. the cause for your bad breath or halitosis could be respiratory tract infection or Gastrointestinal disorders or secondary to diabetes. the most common cause for halitosis is gum infection or food lodgement between teeth or fissured tongue. since you are telling you have already consulted dentist, the possible causes could be respiratory or GI problems. consult a pulmonogist or gastroeneterologist for complete examination and needful. be bold in your life. your problem can be solved. i hope my answer will help you take care."},{"Patient":"I have such a dry mouth at night ; even with my mouth closed.

I have begun a warm water rinse earlier this evening, but the pain is so bad that if there is actual relief it can't be measured. I am in between dentists so I'm in a bind...","Doctor":"Hello dear,First of all dont worry and be relaxed. I Have gone through your query thoroughly. I will provide you with my best possible advice.As your symptoms suggest and on the basis of your description, you may have a carious tooth(cavitated) in upper left quadrant of the jaw. Pain as you have described is a radiating type of pain. and numbness may be due to inflammaion and infection. Simply taking painkillers like MOTRIN will not solve the actual problem.If someone with same symptoms arrives in my clinic I must ask few questions- Do pain increases on biting or chewing?- Is there any specific time (day or night) when he experiences more pain?You have to undergo the complete treatment(procedure and medication) most probably \\"Root Canal Treatment\\" of the offending tooth to recover completely.If i were the treating dentist, on the basis of your given informations I would advice these- Get an X-ray done of the offending and near by teeth.-Try not to sleep from left side for few days.- Do not chew from left side for few days.-Do not give any type of pressure with hands or with anything else.- F0r better pain relief take tablet of tramadol-50mg diclofenac-75 mg combination (marketed as durapain by Abbott Healthcare ) if not allergic to it twice daily for 3 to 5 days.And do visit the dentist for further treatment.Thank You and Take CareRegards"},{"Patient":"I just discovered a red bump on the outside gum of my 4 year olds daughters tooth.

Maybe the antibiotics didn't work. The sweating, chills, pain on the sides relate to a possible infection of the kidneys called Pyelonephritis. Visit the Urologist, get your Urine tested for again and request for a Ultrasound KUB (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder)."},{"Patient":"Hello.

Do not eat or drink anything for 30 minutes after rinsing mouth with betadene gargle.• Multivitamin tablet once daily for 1 week.- Apply topical gels like metrogyl-DG forte or Rexidine M gel over the skin tags thrice daily for 3-5 days.Most probably symptoms should start subsiding by 2-3 days.Hope this will help youThank YouTake Care"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 26 year old male.

I want to extract  my tooth but im scared if these will have a bad effects to my baby. What should i do for these uncomfortable toothache?","Doctor":"Hello,A severe toothache brings up the concern of an infection. You need to treat an infection. Please check with your OB-GYN physician and update your doctor on this condition. Any complications with your pregnancy or allergies may affect your choice of dental treatment. This needs to be discussed with your treating dentist and your dentist would be glad to discuss any findings with your doctor.Minimal treatment would be to numb the tooth without epinephrine, establish drainage and put temporary medication covered with a sedative filling. An abscessed tooth could  then be treated with a roor canal or extraction at a later date. Medications for painful and symptomatic infections usually include Amoxicillan and pain or anti-inflammatory medications. Tylenol is usually ok with OB-GYN doctors. Amoxicillan is prescription and should be discussed. I advise my patients to limit dental treatment and if needed try to do treatment during the middle trimester. Routine cleanings are advised to reduce inflamed gums. Dealing with an infection is a stress on your pregnancy and needs to be treated.  X-rays give information about your tooth not seen with a clinical exam. This is a personal choice you will need to make about being exposed to a small amount of radiation while pregnant. I suggest an exam with a dentist to get a proper diagnosis and determine a safe treatment option. I wish you luck on your pregnancy. You need plenty of rest and to maintain a healthy diet for yourself as well as your baby."},{"Patient":"Hi I was flossing my teeth and cut my gum.

Now today there is pus...What should I do?","Doctor":"HiIn regard to your query,while doing flossing extreme care should be taken not to hurt the gums.Sice you have mentioned you have good oral health your pus formation might be a gingival abscess which does not lasts for more than 48 hours and it gets bursts by itself heals on its own.If symptoms persists please consult your periodontist for further help."},{"Patient":"i have used tobacco for a few years.  there is a small lump inside my cheek, between the very back molars about 2mm in size.  it is the same color as the rest of my mouth. i have noticed it after chewing tobacco for the first time in a long time, and has been there about 10 days unchanged.  should i be worried :(","Doctor":"Hello,The best advice is to STOP chewing tobacco. This is a habit with a known risk of mouth cancer and you admit to being worried. You are safest to be seen by a dentist and have a clinical exam. If needed, a biopsy could be taken.The location on your cheek could be from biting your cheek while chewing. The cheek can swell and you can remain inflammed. Look to see if you see a bit of a line following where your teeth meet. You could have a small cyste or even have located your salivary duct. Ducts sometimes get clogged and could present this way. You do not mention a sore or border. Any change or notable increase is of concern. I advise to be checked by the dentist!"},{"Patient":"I am suffering from severe toothache from a broken tooth and suspect that the nerves are exposed.

Secondly, after the root canal treatment tooth will be non vital which means no life in the tooth so i think you might be having pain rather than sensitivity.I would strongly recommend you to stop using drugs and please visit your dentist.For sensitivity you can use VANTEJ tooth paste than the regular one this might be helpful."},{"Patient":"My wisdom tooth is currently growing in and I m suffering with so much pain in my mouth.

The pain is horrific.","Doctor":"Hello mam,As you have mentioned that you have undergone several radiographs and no underlying cause is diagnosed. So as far as your problem is concerned, i think that the pain(or pressure) which you experience may be due to hormonal changes in the body during that time. Gum tissue responds very quickly to the hormonal fluctuation. As a result, you may see symptoms appear in your mouth in accordance with your menstrual cycle.Yet it is not very commonly occuring problem but its existence can not be ignored. But usualy gingival tissue(gums) are affected (also known as menstruation Gingivitis) due to which you may also experience pain or pressure like feeling upon biting or chewing.So you should take preventive measures to avoid such problems. • Try to be even more diligent about brushing twice a day and flossing daily right before your period to keep your gums as clean as possible.• You can also apply gum paint over the gums twice daily.Hope this will help youThank You Take CareRegards Dr Akash Abhinav"},{"Patient":"I M 19 YEARS OLD FEMALE WAT PRECAUTIONS SHD I TAKE AS I FOUND PUSS CELLS IN MY URINE..I ALSO HAVE PAIN ON MY SIDE NEAR RIBS WHY IS IT SO?","Doctor":"Hello shumaila; welcome to HealthcareMagic Pus cells in urine is a sign of infection in urine ;if the pus cells are 2-4 then it is fine if they are more than 6 you have infection.But it is also necessary to see if you have any symptom like increased frequency of urine or burning in it.As for pain in abdomen please consult a doctor nearby to find the reason;he will examine you and prescribe the necessary medicines.

By this time I got in touch with my Dentist (who had done the filling earlier) and was told that if it didnt trouble me much I could wait till I could come home. (I am living abroad.) I am not using the side where the filling was done. There are days when the pain becomes too intense. My question is (1) Is it ok to prolong for sometime till I see my dentist? (2) Is there any tablet that will numb the toothache?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome to HCM.You can prolong the treatment,but there is always a risk of pain,swelling which can shoot up.You can temporarily be on a course of 5 day antibiotics and analgesics (amoxicillin500 and ibuprofen) to subside the infection.It is acceptable if the waiting is for a couple of weeks to months,but not as long as a year.There is no tablet or medication which can numb the tooth.Pain in the tooth after a filling suggests there is irreversible pulpitis. You must get a root canal done.As you mentioned you had a temporary filling done, i suggest you to wait to come home to get the treatment if it is few weeks away.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am a 17 y/o female & I have been diagnosed with gastritis a few months ago.

Should I be concerned? I tried to squeeze it but have irritated it. Should I be concerned? My grandfather had jaw cancer from smoking. and had part of his jaw removed and has since passed. I am not a smoker.","Doctor":"Any bump in the the mouth is of concern. Inflammed tissue can require simple treatment such as a cleaning or be an indication of a more severe condition such as a cancer. A visit to the dentist for an exam and cleaning or a limited exam with a possible X-ray of that location is advised.Suggest you rinse area and gentle dental care. Avoid area when chewing with a soft diet. Anti-inflammatory medication may help.Common conditions:Inflamed gums- Swollen, red tissue, sensitive, tender. Action required professional cleaning, plaque and tartar removal, evaluation of periodontal health.Irritation under gums - swelling, pain, broken tooth under gum, something caught between teeth, periodontal abscess. Dental cleanng with numbing under gum, remove object, possible medications include anti-inflammatory, pain and antibiotic, rinsing.Exotosis, tori or excess Fibrous tissue - hard bump, not moveable becomes sensitive if subject to trauma. Thin tissue covering bone is prone irritation. Treat with warm salt water rinsing, avoid area, non irritating diet. Allow time to heal. No action required and may have been present prior just never noticed. Condition is just extra normal tissue. Only concern if distinct, abrupt change or interfers with daily function or dental treatment planned.Infection - swelling localized to a tooth may develop from bottom of the root. pain from pressure and spread of infection is common. Tooth can be very sensitive to pressure. Bubble on gum with tract from tooth may develop and release pus. Action by dentist may include drainage, antibiotic and further treatment options of a root canal or extraction. Anti-inflammatory medications helpful to reduce discomfort.Infection - swelling large with hard feeling tissue may be prone to spreading to face and neck. It can indicate a systemic reaction that can become severe. It may still be a reaction to a single tooth that requires antibiotic treatment, but you need to control the spread of the infection. Seek Emergency Room care if dental office not available. Stronger anti-inflammatory medications may be required.Cancer - bumps, sores, pain, areas that do not heal with irregular borders, history of smoking, chewing tobacco, high alcohol beverage consumer, family illness history all can be signs of concern. Certain locations are of greater concern. Further testing can include a biopsy and referral to a specialist. Ulcerated areas can often be viral and need a short time to heal while patient can rinse, avoid area, and keep to a non-irritating diet. Biting your tongue or cheek can also cause bumps. Healing time and rinsing area again will help this condition to resolve. A dental exam is recommended if questionable areas are noticed in the mouth.In my office, I commonly see teeth with infections causing swelling. The initial complaint is often described as a lump on the gum. If the area is moveable and does not appear to be attached to the bone, it is often the initial stage of an infection starting to spread. Schedule a dental visit to put your mind at ease and prevent your condition from getting worse. Hope you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries?

Your gall bladder has a definite impact and could well be the main factor. Your medication may contribute as many of the products contain sugar. Additional zince combats against coated tongues due to zince deficiencies which should be an advantage of your medication. Staying well hydrated is important as well. Try to keep an easily digestible diet, lower in sugar and yeast products. Remember to include care of your tongue in daily care. Brush your tongue and consider use of a tongue scraper.

Does this sound like an allergy?","Doctor":"thanks for your query, i have gone through your query. the bumps inside the mouth could be secondary to burn caused by the soup or allergy to the contents of the soup or it can be mucocele or herpes virus infection. consult your oral physician to rule out these conditions. you can observe for two-three days and see. if it breaks and forms ulcer then you can use topical anesthetics and analgesics that will clear the issue. if it doesnt disappear then consult your oral physician for further."},{"Patient":"I have severely crowded teeth and I have a tooth that sits directly behind on of my front teeth. The gums surrounding that back tooth are very swollen and it bleeds daily. I have also noticed pus lately. Is is possible to just get this tooth removed?","Doctor":"Hello:)Welcome to HCM.Crowded teeth are responsible for your infection of your gums. Get a complete scaling(cleaning) done.I strongly recommend, get a consultation from a orthodontist for straightening your teeth.Straightening your teeth will reduce crowding and improve gum health in your case.He will check your x-rays and will decide if the tooth can be removed.You did not provide your age either.Gargle warm salt water twice daily. This will help maintain your gum health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have a toothache and gum / cheek soreness .  Went to dentist 2 weeks ago and he said I need root canal.

Should I have the root canal while I feel so sick, or keep waiting till I feel better?","Doctor":"Hello:)Thank you for trusting  HCM.I suggest you to explain this to your dentist as well.Root canal treatment can be done in multiple sittings(two or three) depending on infection,pus etc.I suggest you to take the first sitting done.This will eliminate pain, so you can feel better.This first sitting will take as long as 20-30 minutes.You can take the second sitting after a week or 10 days,mean while you can get well from flu as well.Too much of antibiotics is not recommended.

This evening I checked my gum and pressed on it and out came a thin 5mm long deep pink colored piece of tissue I suspect is a worm? … this thing was 1 to 2mm wide and deep pink in color.  I will alert my doc tomorrow since he suspects my canal has cracked and I'm to go to a specialist in month. I have frozen the little worm like thing.

Would Rocephin work for my abscess?","Doctor":"Hello:)Welcome to HCM.Prolonged intake of antibiotics is not appreciated.Rocephin is not necessary as it acts on the same organisms as penicillin.I suggest you to take amoxicillin and metronidazole for 5 days.Also take Neutrolin B plus before food for 5 days (as you are already on antibiotics for long).Take  a OTC painkiller if necessary.Get the treatment done as early as possible.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am a very worried mom, looking for answers. I have a 20month of little girl, who goes in or dental surgery on the 19th of this month. She was a premiee, born at 36wks, weighing in at 5lbs 4oz. A very healthy little girl. Her name is Eleni. As I said, she is 20mos old. She didn't start to get teeth until about 8mos. She started off with just the 2 bottom teeth until about14mos. Then all the sudden was getting two at a time. About 2months ago we noticed some brown spots on her two upper front teeth. Within about 1 to 2wks of this discovery, a piece of one of the teeth had broke off(the enamel).  We took her to a pedatric specialist, who said that he would try his best to cap the teeth, but, it he wasn't able to he would haveto pull them out. She will be having this procedure done at franklin square hospital in Marylad. They will be putting her under general anestesia. I have two other children 9 & 10, neither have ever even had a cavity. Now my eleni has 3. The doctor never gave us any reasoning on why his was happening. She is a good brusher, even at this young age. Eleni is very smart & loves to brush her eeth. My husband and I are very concerned about all of this. Just so unsure about putting such a young child under anestesia. Can you add any insight on this matter? Thank you fr your time!!Very concerned mom, Amanda.","Doctor":"Hello:) Welcome to HCM.It is safe and common for a child to be on general anesthesia as they generally do not cooperate with the procedures.Do not panic.Eruption of milk teeth at age of 6 months is common, at times they get it at 8 months.This is not abnormal.You must discuss with your dentist why these cavities/brown spots appeared on her teeth.Discuss with your hygienist about preventive measures.This will also help you prevent cavities in future.Comfort your child regarding the procedure.Prepare her with a positive attitude.Do not stress yourself or scare her.Check the levels of flouride in your drinking water.Higher fluoride can make her teeth brown.Gargle after every meal.She must brush before bed, never sleep off while having milk/sugar syrups etc.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I just had all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed on Tuesday, It is now Thursday.

If you mean bad breath then it could be of many reasons  like systemic or oral health causes. Usually when a aperson has any lung problems like emphysema, pleural abscess, diabeties, kidney diseases and liver diseases will also result in bad breath. poor oral hygiene with adverse habits like tobacco chewing or smoking also results in bad breath.I would suggest you to explain about the place where you live along with the type of work you do and what sort of materials one can expect where you live when you meet your physcian and dentist.Hope this helps you"},{"Patient":"i got my braces of 2 months ago, and while im glad how my smile is much nicer, im not happy with the fact i have a gummy smile.

I have been suffering with gum problems from about a month after I had mine fitted. Had xrays done at the dentist with no results. I know some women get gum problems during pregnancy because of hormone changes. Can this be the case for the mirena coil as well?","Doctor":"Hello,I understand your concern. Hormone fluctuations often do affect the gums and may require additional attention to oral hygiene habits. Make sure your home care routine includes brushing multiple times per day, daily flossing and vigorous rinsing. Interdental cleaners may help and come in many varieties. Motorized toothbrushes often can help patient's with removal of sticky, resistant daily plaque formation. Gums often have an exaggerated response to plaque. Gums can be a very reactive tissue and respond to any stress or change you are experiencing. Please give your body time to adjust. If your symptoms are mainly bleeding gums, work on daily care and plan on returning to the dentist for a cleaning in 3 months. An increased cleaning schedule may reduce inflammation and prevent severe periodontal problems. I recommend an increased cleaning schedule for pregnant patients seen in my office.If you are having other symptoms, please discuss this with your dentist and physician. I, also, would be glad to answer additional questions. I hope this will assist you and that you feel more comfortable with my recommendations."},{"Patient":"hello basicly i have a sewage taste in the back off my mouth yet iv changed my diet i am eating like alot of fruit and vegetables but i aint eating alot either like one meal a day today iv decided to eat breakfast and lunch but its the sewage taste im worried about","Doctor":"Hello,The condition of your mouth including tongue, teeth and gums can be a factor. Have you had a recent dental exam and cleaning? Be sure to practice good oral hygiene including brushing your tongue. Infected tissues can change your taste. Infections under the gums can drain and these can give you a bad taste. Drainage fom the sinus to the back of the throat such as a post nasal drip can affect your taste. A dry mouth, again, affects taste. Other habits such as smoking or recently stopping a habit such as smoking affects taste. Medications? Any recent antibiotic treatment can affect the balance of your oral bacteria. The back of your throat may collect debris prone to attack by bacteria. Tonsils have crater like areas for debris to get caught. Tonsil stones or tonsilloliths are unpleasant. They can be foul smelling and require removal. Have a doctor check this area. You may be able to see some debris yourself and can try vigorous rinsing. A foaming, peroxide rinse may offer some assistance. Professional treatment may include removal, antibiotic treatment and removal or reshaping of the tonsils.I hope you are able to remedy this situation soon. Additional questions are welcome."},{"Patient":"Hi I went doc about a week ago because of swelling in my jaw and neck. I was advised to have an ultrasound and it was clear and doc said the cause of swelling was likely due to an infection of throat or some dental problem and had prescribed me with antibiotics for 5 days. So I went to dentist too see if everything was ok and I did my normal routine cleaning and I had 3 fillings. Dentist had taken an x ray and mentioned that my upper wisdom tooth had erupted and I would have remove it since it was overlapping with my other tooth and also since the bottom wisodom tooth had not erupted yet the top two was actually touching my gums  which causes infections and bacteria. The next morning after I had gone to the dentist I had a terrible headache followed by fever and a bad cough . So I had 3 days of temp and bad cough and felt week so had gone to another doc and mentioned that I have bronchitis and need to take a course of antibiotics. My concern is how long I have to wait to remove my wisdom tooth and if there would be any complications?","Doctor":"Hello,I understand your concerns and am glad to assist you. Am I correct to assume that you have started the antibiotics for the Bronchitis? You should be getting relief and symptoms decreasing. Where  you diagnosed with a viral and bacterial condition aside from tooth complications?  Is the swelling no longer spreading? Any pus, swelling at tooth location? Keep your mouth clean and rinsing daily. Your medical history is a factor to determine when the tooth can be extracted. You can not consider many types  of sedation if your lungs are not clear. Are you going to an oral surgeon for the extraction since the dentist did not take the wisdom tooth out?Since you had a dental exam, what was the treatment plan to remove the wisdom tooth? Being on antibiotics does not mean you have to wait to have the tooth out, but other medications promote bleeding and should not be taken when planning an extraction. A common pain, fever reducing medicine, aspirin, must be stopped before extractions or you can risk excessive bleeding.  Please follow your medication directions, update your dentist and physician on your condition and proceed as doctors advise. Consulting now with an oral surgeon is to be considered. The surgeon needs to determine how complex an extraction will be especially since one wisdom tooth seems to be impacted under bone.Providing more answers may allow me to provide more direction for you. I am here to help and hope you are feeling better."},{"Patient":"i got my 3rd molar filled last month. Now, i have a tender spot on my face near the bottom corner of my nose. Below the eye.

Now i just have the slight sore spot nex to my nose. about the size of your finger tip. That side of my face is the same size as the other. No swelling as of yet.......should i be worried? Or should i just ignore it and let the 2012 apocolypse wipe us all out?","Doctor":"Hello,Sensitivity after a filling is common. Avoid any stress to the new filling for a few days is always a good idea. When getting numb, you sometimes don't bite down the same way as when not numb.  Call your dentist to check your bite and have a high spot reduced if needed. If the fling does not appear in tact or rough, also, get it checked.Symptoms of greater concern that may require an X-ray to look at the root include a reaction to pressure where you can't chew on that tooth, more hot than cold sensitivity, bubble or swelling on gum near tooth, pain medication does not working, and increase in discomfort.Having your mouth and lips held open can cause soreness or result in slight irritations. The third molar is an awarkward location. Large decay areas with deep fillings can be sensitive for quite sometime. The concern is with an infection and needing to have a root canal on the tooth.  I will warn patients of this concern when treating decayed teeth. You may wish to give the tooth more time and monitor for the conditions above or make a dental visit to check on the filling.

Please suggest what i need to do or to whom i need to consult, is it Oral CA, but i also found on internet Oral CA Ulcer come on side not every where.","Doctor":"Hello,Mouth sores that reoccur are often viral.  Stress can bring on an episode and repeat. Have your mouth sores been tested? Simple swab, biopsy, etc.? See a specialist such as an oral surgeon. Visit a dental school or a dentist with a greater interest in oral pathology.  You seem to still need more diagnosis. Systemic conditions are known to be associated with mouth sores such as HIV/Aids.  Testing is critical to determine normal ranges and overall health. Your genetic history and family illness history may offer clues. Are you compromised? There are auto immune disorders. Students stressed can have Mono. Travel lately? Unusual exposure or diet change? Keep asking many questions.A history of Measles can later appear as Shingles. Mouth sores can be included in Shingles. Virus exposure history helps diagnosis.Having an association with another carrier of a virus such as Herpes can cause repeat reactions.Changing routines, limiting exposure and getting rid of items that might carry a virus are all good actions. You seem to have tried many actions. One other consideration is an allergic reaction to your dental care products and make sure you have ruled this out. Try changing toothpaste or rinses. Flavorings and other ingredients  are known to cause reactions. Symptomatic treatment with pain medication, rinsing warm salt water, avoid irritants and time passing is the best advice for now. I try to provide questions to help you think  and you have the option to visit other doctors for continuing clinical evaluation."},{"Patient":"hi my age is 28 and i am suffering a lot with wisdom tooth pain and having loose motion also. is there any relation between the development of wisdom tooth and loose motion. the wisdom tooth is visible at the backside of my molars. can i have some other remedy other than extraction.","Doctor":"Hello,You seem to be having trouble with the function of your jaw and cannot open well?My concern is that you have an infection. You should be seen by a dentist to determine if the position of the wisdom tooth is causing any interference. If you can keep the tooth clean and it will be in function, you can keep the tooth. If the tissue around the tooth is infected, the tissue can be cleaned out and sometimes needs to be removed. If the infection resolves, yes you can keep the tooth. The tooth may cause discomfort while errupting. Do you know if the opposing wisdom tooth is present and erupted to allow the teeth to be in function? If the tooth has decay or an abscess has developed, you would need to treat the tooth further with a filling or root canal. It may be best to remove the tooth. If the tooth is tipped or can't errupt fully, it may flare up with an infection over and over. This indicates that it is best to remove the tooth. You do not want an untreated infection to spread or get worse causing more pain.Other options rather than extraction may be available. Plan a visit to the dentist to discuss your situation and make an informed decision. Rinse the area and take some anti-inflammatory medication to feel better before your visit."},{"Patient":"My daughter is almost 4 and last night I thought she had some food in between her teeth when I tried to remove it I noticed it was like a skin between her teeth which is easy to see.

Some history.  I recently got my braces off after having them for 2.5 yrs.   about a year ago, this same toothe started bothering me when I would bite down.  At my regular dental checkup, I told my tent it's and he checked the bite and said it was off, so he file the tooth down just a little bit.  It was fine after that.  Then about 6 months ago, while I still had my braces, the same tooth started hurting again.  Only that time much worse than before.  It came on very quickly, and felt like the tooth had raised up over night, so that every time I closed my mouth it hit the top teeth.  The pain was horrible.  I couldn't bite down on anything.  I went to the dentist and he checked it, and again my bite was off.  He filed it down, and I had immediate release, however, it wasn't 100%.  He did X-ray it and and mentioned a brown spot on the root, but sati that it could be because of the orthodontia work, so said he'd monitor it.  Since then, I've tended to avoid eating anything on that side for fear of it hurting.  Sometimes I would try it just to check and it felt okay, but not perfect.  More recently, it has been more sensitive to cold.  I've experienced this off and on through my life, so it didn't concern me until this past month when heat started bothering me.   This was a mild irritation until last week.  Now, it hurts dreadfully, And not necessarily in response to temperate changes.   It can be fine one minute and the next I feel like crying it hurts so bad.  At first it was just the tooth and then gum around the tooth.  Now when it hurts, it's like it's throbbing around several teeth and in my cheek.  I went to the dentist this morning, and he took an xray and said it looked fairly normal.   But because of my symptoms, he could see som areas where it may be a problem, so he referred me to and endodontist.  Well, now it's been throbbing off and on all day.  The whole lower side of my mouth hurts and so does that side of my tongue and neck.  And for some reason, a spot in the roof of my mouth is sore.  Why is my neck, my tongue and that spot in the roof of my mouth hurting?   Is this typical?","Doctor":"Hello:)Welcome to HCM.Repeated episodes of heat and cold sensitivity suggests you have a pulpitis on the tooth.Also, the dark spot around the root suggests a peri-apical infection.Dental pain can be radiated to the neck ,ear,head, and whole jaw as in your case.Do not worry, take a Novamox 500 for 5 days b.i.d.Also take Imol plus (analgesic) t.i.d for 3 days.(Make sure you are not known allergic to these medicines,not asthmatic).I suggest you to get the x-rays done and go for a root canal on this tooth.

Your tooth broke and you say completely fell out, but a back tooth has multiple roots and part of the tooth may still be uner the gum. I would suggest you see a dentist, take an x-ray and most likely start antibiotic treatment to control the spread of infection. You would need to extract any remaining root under the gum. If you damaged the gum area, salt water rinses would help healing and I would not expect you to explain increased discomfort with your throat.  Do you see an indent or hole in the gum? Do you feel anything hard, moving under the gum?

There is a disc that can be not moving correctly or damaged in this joint. Stress on this joint can occur from trauma, grinding one's teeth or an unusual use.  if it persists or gets worse, consult an oral surgeon for a panorex X-ray which will show the jaw. This is my suggestion to start unless you can provide additional details and symptoms. I would be glad to help you further.

You may have an infection, bit your cheek or something caught under your gum. You can rinse with warm salt water, but schedule a dental visit. There may be more problems than just inflamed gums. The teeth stabbing your gums may be a wisdom tooth errupting. If you do not have enough room for the tooth to errupt, an extraction should be considered.

Opinions are not appreciated, although suggestions are welcome.","Doctor":"HiWith your query, STRICTLY CONSUMING TOBACCO IN ANY FORM IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH.

I did have some soda though, could that be it?","Doctor":"helloi have gone through your query.A black tongue discoloration is most commonly caused by organisms such as yeast and bacteria growing on the surface of the tongue. These bacteria and yeast produce blood cell pigments called porphyrins which give rise to the black color characteristically seen. The overgrowth of bacteria can also cause cells of the tongue to be shed more slowly, causing the tongue to take on a hairy appearance, known as a black hairy tongue.maintainig a good oral hygiene is the best way to treat black hairy tongue. Gently brush your teeth twice a day with a soft toothbrush. Also, brush your tongue. You can use a tongue scraper to make sure you're thoroughly cleaning the area.If you smoke, quit.having soda wont cause this.antibiotics or an antifungal drug can be used to get rid of the bacteria or yeast.

This seems to have discoloured her teeth: they appear more yellow. I was wondering if the teeth will return to their original colour. Many thanks, Sharon","Doctor":"Hello,Discoloration of teeth is not a common side effect for this antibiotic. Tetracylcine given before age 8 is a well known antibiotic that can cause yellowing or dark bands to form in the underneth layer of a tooth. Flucloxacillin is not in the same family of antibiotics. If you notice a coating on your daughter's teeth, see if this can be removed by proper cleaning. I would suggest a dental exam and dental office cleaning if you are unable to remove the film.  A secondary infection can occur in the mouth leaving a white film on the tongue. The gums will often be sore and red in appearance. This would be oral thrush and can be treated by your dentist. Antibiotic treatment can cause an imbalance of the natural bacteria and an excess of certain bacteria can take over. A change in the color of the gums could make the teeth appear a different color as well.  Are these adult front teeth or still baby teeth that you are concerned about? Are there any other medical concerns or medications being taken? Yellowing of the skin or eyes indicates a complication with the liver that would need to be addressed by your physician. Teeth are made up of tubules with the center pulp containing blood vessels and nerves. This layer is what mainly affects the color of the tooth and could exhibit a transient change. Teeth subject to trauma or root canal can darken from the inside.  Changes to the outer layer of enamel such as decalcification, decay and too much flouride can cause a color change. I am trying to cover some situations that may be possible from your description. I would be happy to answer any additional questions with more details. Having your daughter make a visit to the dentist would give you the best answer and allow necessary treatment."},{"Patient":"I ve been having gas, indigestion and cramping the last 3 - 4 days and my breats are very tender, I feel like I want to throw up but I can eat just fine.

I have been researching for a couple of hours. I looked at canker sores and mouth ulcers and it seems most like a gum boil. I have had this place on my top right gum for about a month. One day I tasted blood badley and it felt like maybe it was from that. I have accidently drained the pus out of the pocket. I was trying to see what it looks like and felt like just to figure it out. once i did that I tried to get all the pus out. Then it looked like a flat piece of skin that was hanging from the gum but very small in size. It has been about 20 minutes and it seems to be getting larger again, maybe with more pus, im not sure. I have never had anything on my gums or mouth before. However I have had a root canal before that I never got the crown for due to financial difficulty. My dentist referred me to a specialist about a year ago, but I have been unable to go, about 5 months ago the rest of my tooth that never got crowned came out it pretty much all broke off. I know I need to get this fixed but I havent been able to. But the tooth that had the root canal and then broke off is on the same side of my mouth but it on my bottom teeth. The pocket or place is above my right teeth at the very top of my gum. I am the type that washes my hands continually and now every time I touch my mouth. I am also afraid because I have two children that sometimes come behind me and drink after to me. I have told them not too especially now since there is something going on in my mouth. Can you please give your advice? I am so afraid of it being a canker sore or something or even this I dont know whats worse. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello,You need the care and advice of a dentist to address this situation. X-rays are needed to address your current condition. Infections can make a pathway called a fistula to drain. This pus needs to escape. It can reoccur. This may appear as a gum boil when getting ready to burst. Other mouth sores can be viral in nature and not related to a tooth infection. An exam would be best to determine what condition you have.Root canals treat infections, but if you delay restoring a tooth, you risk fracture. You now need to determine if the remaining tooth can be restored or needs an extraction. Once you complete the root canal, a tooth will often not be painful, but tooth structure can continue to decay. I am unsure which specialist was suggested to you. You seem to be discussing multiple teeth. Please schedule an exam with your dentist.

Pain relief pills may help you temporarily, but do not address the source of the pain. Your dentist should determine if you need a prescription for pain relief and if an infection occurs that requires an antibiotic. If you have no room for the wisdom tooth, it will not be able to function. It has already caused a painful situation and from the information that you provide sounds like it should be removed.

It could be fairly labile, but I am and had been walking around at 170/120. I am a PA and had some good friends, but everyone I saw would say Depression or Stress and I argued over and over that I am neither, that I am anxious 24/7. Insomnia beyond anything imaginable and eyesight started getting worse and worse. Last April my mentation(very confused, always manic, yet overwhelmingly fatigued) worsened, as were my s/s of insomnia, which was VERY bad, HTN skyrocketed , HR 140+, and I ended up in the ER (my s/s really had begun in November just after I got the swine flu - and I had it bad). They found hyperthroidism, and further labs always reveal a low cortisol, low potassium, low calcium, and low testosterone. No cause of thyroid issue foound on MRI s scans etc (including pituitary). Hyperthyroidism resolved on it s own a month or so ago. I though, am ashamed, yet did not really know what I was doing, last Dec-March stole from and urgent care employer I was working for out of our onsite scripts some soma and vicodin. I confessed and lost alot - no criminal, but board. I had been going and going to the doctors trying and trying to find out and theONLY thing ever found was when I was in the hospital in Lubbock for heart and BP in late 2008 and they found an enlarged heart. The cardiologists PA saw me one night on rounds said I needed to have my thyroid checked and the doc said no, that s not it... and never anything found. My heart pounded so hard at night and my head always felt like it was going to explode, I thought at any moment I was going to have a stroke. I functioned on my subconscious, but I was always confused cognitively - i had been a great student, good grades, never stole ANYTHING in my life, have no speeding tickets, no malpractice, no complaints and yet I did this stupid thing while sick. Some background. The very severe s/s hit in Nov/Dec 2009 after I had the swine flu, but they all had been there. In 2008 I had 3 concussions, fell out of a tree putting a swing up for my 6 kids, in a rollover MVA and earlier fell doing pull ups when the bar came down. Had CT but ok. Also one AM late 2008 wife heard me fall . I remember being in front of the mirror feeling fine..and then nothing. I woke up 8 hours later with no memory. Small town EMS came out, told my wife my BP was okay, and did not take me to hospital . I could only mumble to EMS - sounds post ictal but nothing since. Dizzy, nauseated, sometimes, still insomnia, but not as bad, headaches and STILL very high and labile BP, BUT I am incredibly mentally clear since thyroid normalized. Also for these 3 years had flu every year - even with shot - and get sick for a week if I even have a cold. I think my drug issue was mostly a psychosis, but I am manning up and doing what I need to do to make sure it NEVER happens again. But the illness, very perplexed. Gluten test negative. Maybe I have a pheochromocytoma? Have a younger brother with PAGETS dx and dad is 63 and healthy. I was the only athletic one, and incredibly active in sports to this day. Never even held a cigarrette and except for my stupid foray never ever used any drugs, legal or illegal (narcotics I should say). On clonodine, a BB but we have to change the dose on the BB due to the HR dropping into the 40 s, and an ACEI. Kidney tests okay, but last time did have some proteind and microalbumin for the first time. Glucose test negative. I do have a documented hx at the docs of hypoglycemia, meaning I would eat lunch, came in 1 hour later and sugar was still 60. Though I felt okay. Repeated this many times and always low after a meal Ugh...where do I go. Have a beautiful wife - even after my syupidity - and 6 wonderful kids.

Did that about 20 days ago. At this time, I went yo the gym twice and worked out on machines maybe too hard, but on machine I felt were fairly safe and would t hurt me. My muscles started started tightening up on my whole body and kept tightening, like torquing, to excruciating pain with 7-9 days. I used to take 200 mg of Metformin a day before the cancer, so when I started again, I took only 1000 mg. When my body was torquing me so bad I cut it to 500 mg. I also took 10 mg of baking soda as I sensed I was acidosis, and the next day, I took no Metformin because I just was in too much pain, but I took 30 mg of baking soda to try to turn by body alkaline. I was in so much pain through my lower back, hips, all side of my legs, knees, lower calves, a little torguing in my arms and hands with elbow and knees burning. I ended up in Emergency at the hospital. They did several blood test, and no, I didn t have Lactic Acidosis. They felt that maybe the baking soda had made my ph normal. I left the hospital with all the pain. Suffering one week until I see a doctor, they also did test, everything came up normal including Vit. D. So I at a loss, I take Actaminophen 325 mg. Either two of these or one of these and one Advil, but I also have to take one Oxyecotden? (I take 3/4 of one pill) to finally cut into the pain to make it bearable. Doctors have no answers. They say do I want to make an appt with them or not. Their suggestion is to up my Gabapenton ( nueropathy in my feet and ankles from the chemo). That is their answer to my overall pain going on in my body. I also want to mention I was only a lot of homeopathic tablets which I went of when my muscles were torquing so bad and have no been on them for over a week. I also tested the one high blood pressure med, Lozartan. I went off for one day just testing that, and no all the pain was still there, so I went back on because I know I need to be on that. And so there is my problem.","Doctor":"Hello,Possibilities of your aches are post chemo break down of muscles. Restart of exercise usually leads to aches and pains. Metformin may aggravate acidosis caused by reintroduction of exercise. You will have to get ph when you are off the baking soda. Get CPK levels done for muscle break down and readings of blood sugars should be from 80 to 140. I think these steps will improve your aches. Meanwhile, you take help from paracetamol 1g  thrice a day.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. Acetylsallicylic acid is widely used for a great range of reasons, and one of the most important is cardiovascular disease, whether in primary or secondary prevention, with great benefits in preventing heart attack, hospitalizations regarding cardiovascular disease etc. This composition has many brand names, which I will not mention here, but aspirin and disprin cardiocare are the same composition and it does not really matter which is taken, to achieve the aim described above. Therefore, my opinion is that it is safe to take one or the another. As for the other part, cardiac stress test is a very sensitive test to determine whether there is a coronary artery blockage anywhere in your coronary arteries, but has low specificity to determine to which artery is the culprit and has the blockage. Therefore, coronary angiogram is recommended, to precisely reveal that which artery may have the blockage, and further strategies of treatment that should be undertaken, at the moment or later. I hope to have been of help.

How long can we expect hime to have to hang on thru all of this. thankyou","Doctor":"Greetings! Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. I am assuming he had a major heart attack, or at least, a prior heart attack and a second, mild, heart attack happened now. A heart functioning at 15% is accompanied with a poor prognosis. This means that heart pumps only 15% of its content, and this is not sufficient to provide enough oxygen and nutrient supply to the end-organs. Kidney is suffering from this phenomenon, because, as a compensatory mechanism, the organism \\"sacrifices\\" other organ supply to keep the brain going. Also, the pressures in the pulmonary circulation will be very high, since the pulmonary veins cannot drain their blood supply to the left heart chambers, because of the high content of blood in the heart, which is already there (the remaining 85%). This can easily produce life-threatening situations, such as pulmonary oedema. At this point, all the measures to prolong his life are mandatory, such as careful adhering to the treatment, which should include, among others, two diuretics, oxygen and an angiotensinogen converting enzyme; totally withhold salt from the diet, and confine to only minimal ambulations within the house, to perform necessary duties.

My chest is sore, my left arm is hurting more than my right side. My pulse rate is around 86 but my heart feels like it is going to jump out of my chest. I am so tried. What should I do.","Doctor":"Greetings! Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. First, providing your age would help in the differential diagnosis. However, I am going to try to address your concern. During panic attack and forms of anxiety, there is a spike in adrenalin and noradrenalin levels in the system, a spike which is accompanied by rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, hard and forceful heart beats, sometimes dizziness, blurry vision etc. There are also times when the constant stress caused from the panic attack makes one to sense even real symptoms, and other times that certain areas are tender and sensed sore because of spasms of arteries caused by above mentioned agents. For the moment, as a cardiologist, I would recommend an EKG, to rule out any present and acute damage to the heart muscle. As for the other part, I would encourage you to discuss this problem with a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist, because generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks is not a disease but requires treatment as long as it affects your quality of life, work or sleep. Also, discuss with your psychiatrist about a possibility of combining a sedative from the benzodiazepines class with a anti-psychotic drug, to prevent these episodes of panic attack and to stabilize the mood. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"Recently ( two days ago), I am having tachycardia (100 to 130 pulse rate) with palpitations. I was prescribed concor cor 2.5 mg. I am wondering what is the underlying cause of this condition. I am diabetic (recently diagnosed- 2 months). Also had a disc hernia on January 10th and still trying conservative approach, suffering from pain and sleep deprivation. Consumed a mix of drugs during the last 3 weeks. But now off drugs.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Heart rate, standardized as normal for the worldwide population, is 60 to 100. There are many changes that happen in the human body during a day that can change this parameter, such as physical activity, hormonal changes and psychological factors. Now, even insomnia or sleep deprivation can cause heart rate to speed up, mainly because of the changes to hormonal peak and nadir levels. There are also caffeine-containing beverages, that can increase the heart rate. Anyway, I am assuming that bisoprolol was prescribed for the blood pressure and to reduce the heart workload, as a measure of prevention. While a safe and effective drug, it does not have marked affect on the heart rate. My recommendation is that you should discuss with your cardiologist for an alternative drug, which also affects the heart rate, by slowing it down. I am referring to other beta-blockers, such as atenolol or metoprolol (although with caution, since you are a diabetic patient) or a drug from the class of calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil or diltiazem). I hope I was helpful. Kind regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I've just been diagnosed with AFIB. I've been prescribed Metoprolol Succ ER (25mg) by my doctor. I'm 5'2, 112lbs and don't take any meds. I seem to react quite strongly to medication so I'm worried about taking this. I've been reviewing peoples side effects and am even more worried about taking this. Is this really the lowest dose possible for a beta blocker? Any tips on when/how to take to minimize side effects? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Every single drug has side effects, just like every procedure in medicine. But, they are only confined within a percentage of probability. Metoprolol succinate, taken 25 mg a day, is really the lowest dose we can prescribe. Atrial fibrillation is a benign supraventricular arrhythmia, if properly rate-controlled and anti-coagulated. It is not specified is this a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (in which case metoprolol was prescribed to control the rate and to prevent episodes of A-Fib) or this is a chronic atrial fibrillation (in which case metoprolol was prescribed to control the rate and prevent rapid conduction to the ventricles). Whichever the case, I would also recommend you this kind of treatment. However, there changes in treatment can be mode and any drug that controls the conduction pathway via the atrio-ventricular node, by slowing it down, can be used. For this aim, we can use beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol), calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), digitalis (digoxin, digitoxin), adenosine (which is reserved only for acute cases) and various antiarrhythmics (propranolol, amiodarone, flecainide). If the drug you are using is really worrisome to you, then you can discuss with your cardiologist about the above listed alternatives. I hope this helps.

Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I read your query. Well, yes, of course, you can go to another hospital or doctor for review and control. I am glad that you have followed doctor's advice with a great discipline. The procedure of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with stent placement requires a good discipline by the patient and careful controls, at least for the first 6-12 months, period during which, the probability for within stent narrowing is the highest. In our clinic's experience, we recommend to post-PTCA and stent patients that clopidogrel 75 mg should be taken once daily for at least 6 months (in cases of bare metal stents) and 12 months (in cases of drug-eluting stents); to discontinue smoking, if they are smokers; and periodical controls with a cardiac stress test after 1, 3 and 6 months from the procedure. Also, if the stent was placed in a terrain of acute myocardial infarction, an echocardiogram is required three to six months from the procedure, to evaluate if there is any gain in left ventricle function after the urgent procedure. Wish you all the best. I hope I was helpful with my answer. My regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"my mom has a history of heart disease.

She is on one tablet of 40 mg Lasix daily, she has been going for walks for the past 10 days. However, her lower legs, particularly her ankles and feet has swelling - like a water pillow. How soon will her feet  get back to normal?- Thank youNandini","Doctor":"Greetings! Welcome to HCM and thank your for your question. I understand your concern. Well, if there are not any other diseases, especially kidney disease, then this clinical sign is produced by an enlarged heart, probably because of a long-standing suffering from aortic valve disease. If this phenomenon is still present, and also is the left ventricle enlargement, then it is recommended an echo cardiogram to be obtained one month after the surgery. New valve and other valve functions have to be assess, also the function of the left ventricle, its size and motility, after the valvular replacement. The dosage of furosemide, and route of administration (intravenous or orally) should be decided in function of leg swelling and other clinical signs of increased systemic pressures, caused by an enlarged heart. If intravenous route of administration is warranted, to abolish this symptom, then hospitalization for a few days is required. If no shortness of breath is present, then you could simply try to double the dosage of furosemide, and see the results. Also, large amount of time spent on standing or sitting up position should be avoided, because of the fluid pooling in the lower limbs due to simple phenomenon of gravity, and salt should be reduced to minimal levels on her diet. I hope I was helpful. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I am 33 years of age and I undergone through CABG in dec 2012. Earlier I used to smoke and my diet was not at all balanced.

I have quit smoking but I use to take onle beer around 650ml that is too alternate day. I want to know that how many years I can live with the same life style. Is it true that CABG can give around 10 years of life span and after that the problem reoccur??","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. That is true. About re-occurrence nothing could be told, but it is true that there are certain probabilities for bypasses to close. The probability for a saphenous vein graft, used for bypass, to be found close is 50% after ten years. Whereas, for the arterial grafts (left or right internal mammary arteries) is around 8-15%, depending on various studies. Anyway, I do not think that these figures should worry you. The most important thing is that the surgery went well and you can live a normal and healthy life now. Even if the re-occurrence happens, there are other alternatives to treat the coronary arteries, such as stent implantation into a certain native coronary artery, bypass of which can be found narrowed or closed. As long as you are free of symptoms, there is nothing to worry about, however 6-monthly controls should be done. There are heralding symptoms, such as angina or shortness of breath, that speak for a narrowing or a new blockage within a graft vessel. In that case, coronary angiogram to control the native arteries and the patency of the grafts should be performed, and a strategy for treating new eventual blockages should be constructed. I hope this is helpful. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I Have been having chest pain on the left side of my chest. Today is the third day and it gets worse when I eat.

Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Clearly, you were preoccupied by this new event or sensation you were experiencing. In various stressful situations, both physical or psychological, heart rate and blood pressure are parameters that increase.Your age is not very consistent with a coronary artery origin of this pain (i.e. a blockage within the coronary arteries - arteries that encompass the heart as a crown, hence the name, and supply the heart muscle with oxygen and important nutrients). However, angina is more like a squeezing or heaviness felt in the mid-chest which radiates to the throat and jay, and left shoulder and left arm, starts on exertion, is not related to the food intake, and is relieved when the exercise is ceased. I am assuming you are an active and healthy 27-year old, so this kind of pain would be sensed by you during moderate physical activity. There are other origins of this kind of chest pain. And if it is food-related, then the highest probability is that it has a digestive tract origin. I would recommend you a consult with a gastrohepatologist (digestive tract and liver specialist) to further examine whether this pain is coming from a possible oesophageal spasm (the tube that connects the pharynx with the stomach) or it is coming from an abnormal process in the stomach or the early part of the small intestine. An upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy may be required for properly assessing these issues. I hope I was of help with my answer.

My opinion is that you may wait until October to see your doctor for a careful physical exam, a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes, etc.), to exclude other possible secondary causes of high blood pressure. You should discuss with his doctor the possibility of starting an antihypertensive therapy, if his blood pressure values are still at these levels, even with the lifestyle modifications.

You should know that all the pre workout supplements have shown to increase blood pressure and cause cardiac arrhythmia. But also other secondary causes of high blood pressure should be excluded too. I would recommend consulting with a GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray study and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, cortisol plasma levels, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, etc.).

If all the above tests result normal, the main cause of your symptomatology would be just anxiety. In such case, you should consult with a specialist of the field to help you manage your anxiety.

I agree with your doctor on the fact that your symptoms don't seem to be cardiac related. A prolonged chest pain is not characteristic for any cardiac disorders. From the other hand, I would like to know if your symptoms are modulated by respiration or body movements. This pattern would go in favor of a musculo skeletal disorder. A back bone disorder (like chronic degenerative changes of the vertebral column), could mimic this clinical scenario. Are your symptoms related to eating? A gastroesophageal reflux or esophagitis could cause similar symptoms with heartburn and burping. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, etc.). A fibrogastroscopy for possible esophagitis or gastritis and a cervico-thoracal x ray study may be needed to exclude the above mentioned disorders. If all the above mentioned tests result normal, I would recommend taking some painkillers (ibuprofen, acetaminophen), which would help in case of a musculoskeletal pain.

You might feel that your heart begins running fast and hard suddenly for some seconds and it goes away. This tachycardia s might happen because of simple emotional stress, anemia, hyperthyroidism, a congenital heart anomaly ect.it is quite known in cardiology that Jung ages experience this kind of palpitations and they are nothing serious.So, my opinion as a cardiologist is that you should do an electrocardiogram, an echo-cardiograph and a holter monitoring just be be sure.Mean wile avoid caffeine  products because they rise heart frequenciesHope I was helpful.

Originally the doctor treated me for pneumonia but upon results of a chest x-ray they found no pneumonia and no fluid on the lungs. I was sent to a cardiologist because an EKG came back abnormal and my heart rate was elevated to 123. The cardiologist ordered an echo, he says it came back normal. He doesn t beleive there is an issue with my heart. My family doctor has called and requested a follow up appointment due to an elevated alkaline phosphate level. My other symptoms include shortness of breath upon any kind of excretion, something as simple as walking into the next room leaves me out of breath to the point that I feel like I am suffocating. When this occurs my legs get weak and my arms become like jelly and I feel light headed. I am having trouble sleeping since this has started, most nights I m not tired but when I am I cannot lie flat because I can t breathe. I spend most of the day dozing off due to lack of sleep but am not actually resting.","Doctor":"hi,    you have  not mentioned your age and sex. possibility of pulmonary embolism has to be ruled out, u can get doppler study of your leg veins and arteries also pl get done ct scan of thorax,along with some blood tests for kidney thyroid lipids etc."},{"Patient":"My son who is 11 came out of bed just now and was having a bad nightmare.

Yesterday, a couple weeks after this incident, she was watching a film in a movie theatre - heart began to race, dizziness, same tightness.  She went to the ER in an ambulance.  The EKG showed no abnormality.  It was called an arrythmia -- but I had the impression the Dr thought it was \\"anxiety\\".  She was not anxious at the time of the incident.

I'd be grateful.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that a comprehensive differential diagnosis between anxiety and cardiac arrhythmia should be done. You should know that even the trauma she has gone through (foot breaking) could be related to anxiety and heart palpitations. I would recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination , a resting ECG and a chest x ray. Some blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, thyroid hormone levels, cortisol plasma levels, fasting glucose and blood electrolytes) are needed to exclude other possible metabolic causes like chronic anemia, thyroid or adrenal gland dysfunction. An ambulatory 24-48 hours monitoring and a cardiac ultrasound may be necessary if suspicions of a possible cardiac arrhythmia are raised.

It is normal to have some similar symptoms when using oral contraception pills. But at your age, the most concerning thing is high blood pressure.

What about your past medical history?I would recommend you to consult with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some lab blood tests: - complete blood count- PCR, sedimentation rate- kidney and liver function tests- fasting glucose- thyroid hormone levels- cortisol plasma levels- blood electrolytes, etc. to identify the possible cause of high blood pressure. From the other hand, oral contraception pills can exacerbate high blood pressure and increase your cardio-vascular risk (besides high blood pressure). You can try a different contraception method instead of oral pills. I would recommend consulting with your attending physician on the above issues.

Based on your symptomatology, the fact that you symptoms disappeared while on antibiotic therapy and reappeared, means that this is a chronic infection. Have you been tested for both antigens and antibodies of Lyme disease or only just antibodies?Sometimes the antigens can persist in the blood for years, indicating a chronic infection, even though the antibodies don't show this.

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern.

This is very important if we are dealing with a young person, because in this category secondary hypertension is very common. It means that it is a secondary disease or factor causing hypertension. It might be a renal problem, an endocrine or congenital problem.So first of all, my opinion as a cardiologist is that it is mandatory to do a full chek up beginning with a blood analyses, an electrocardiogram, echo-cardiograph, thyroid  hormones.After this, we might judge for others.The first thing to do when treating hypertension is lifestyle modification. If i was your treating doctor i will recommend to stop every workout drinks. In general, they have caffeine, taurine and stimulant factors that rise blood pressure values.Your boyfriend should reduce alcohol and salt intake in daily eating. They booth rise blood pressure.He should stop smooking if he smokes and have a low fat diet to reduce blood lipids if they are high.This are just the simplest and the first thing to do.

My resting heart rate, or overall heart rate is ALWAYS elevated. Between 99- over 100, even when I first wake up in the morning. I've had this since I was little, and it always affected me when I played basketball. I would get light headed, see \\"tunnel vision\\" where everything starts to go black, and I see stars.

I've been struggling all these years and I just want answers.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM. I carefully read your question and i totally understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion.You should not worry for your electrocardiogram report. First of all, you should not read what the paper says, because it is just a computer explanation. The electrocardiogram should allways be interpret by the doctor, not the machine. If it is the doctor that gave this interpretation, again you should not worry. Sinus arrhythmia might be normal at your age. Re polarization disturbance is just an electrical term that means nothing at your age.What we should worry are your symtoms during this years. As you explain we are dealing with a rhythm issue.Someone might experience fast heart beats for very different reasons and pathologies. It might be simple  sinus tachycardia to other arhythmias like supra-ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation ect.This are caused from different problems from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthiroidism or electrical conduction system anomalies. The aberrant subclavian artery does not cause this symptoms but might rise a suspicion of any anatomic  variation on your electrical conduction system of your heart.So my opinion is that now its time to meet the cardiologist and do all the thinks that you have planed to do. The most important the holter monitoring, preferably for 48 h. This will help to see what are this fast heart beats.In mean time avoid caffeine products because they rise your heart frequency.Hope I was helpful.

For the last year i have been having swelling in my feet and ankles and have sob from time to time. 2 weeks ago i had to go to the ER for the 1st time ever i was having spasms all over my body pain like i have never experienced. They did a ct and said i had pneumonia in left lung and fluid in both with groundglass like opacities in both lungs and a small amount of pericaridal effusion. they gave me pain medicine abx and sent me home and told me to follow up with my PCP. Can anyone tell me more about dextracardia i have never had any issues before?","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome.I appreciate your concern for the causes of Dextrocardia.Dextrocardia is a rare condition in which your heart is located in the right side instead of being in the left side of your chest. It is a congenital condition, meaning that you are born with this abnormality.The exact cause of Dextrocardia is unknown. The heart may form in the right side of the chest during fetal development and function normally. In other words, the heart’s ventricles, arteries, and other structures are all arranged in a mirror image of normal heart structures.Sometimes defects in the lungs, abdomen, or chest can cause the heart to develop on the right side of the body. You are more likely to have other heart defects and problems with other vital organs in this case. The signs and symptoms of swollen feet and ankles, shortness of breath, accumulation of fluid in both the lungs, pericardial effusion are suggestive of heart failure which is a complication of this condition.People with isolated dextrocardia are sometimes affected by a condition called “situs inversus.” Situs inversus is a situation in which your liver, spleen, or other organs are also located on the opposite side of your body.Most of the people with isolated dextrocardia are likely to live a normal life.Reduced function of the cilia in the lungs are responsible for the recurrent pneumonia.Males with cilia problems may be infertile due to the resulting decreased ability of the sperm cells to propel themselves forward and fertilize the female egg cell.You are advised to undergo further evaluation by a physician to rule out the possibility of situs inversus.Wishing you best of your health."},{"Patient":"What is the medical term for a rapid heart beat?

Just wanted to know the proper terminology when speaking with my doctor.","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome.It depends upon the situation.The rapid heart beat which is regular and not due to any abnormal conduction in the heart and not associated with any ECG changes is referred to as sinus tachycardia.On the other other hand a rapid heart beat which is irregular, associated with abnormal conduction and ECG changes is referred to as arrhythmia.Hope I could answer your query."},{"Patient":"Hi.....I went to a new patient appointment a week and 3 days ago to establish a PCP that spealize in treating hypertension.

If I'm already diagnosed with hypertension","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome.I appreciate your concern for the quantity of the blood drawn for the lab tests.Well, it is mandatory for a case of hypertension to undergo certain lab tests like blood glucose, lipid profile (to know the cholesterol and other fat levels), kidney function tests (to check whether kidneys are functioning normally in the face of hypertension), cardiac enzymes (to detect any heart disease), etc.Hope to have clarified your doubts.Wishing you best of your health."},{"Patient":"Started taking Coversyl 2mg. one month ago and started having frequent heart palpitations, especially at night. I am  also on Apo-Hydro 12.5 mg, Synthroid 75 mcg. As a result of the palpitations my sleep is now extremely poor, so poor that the doctor put me on Apo-Trazodone 50mg. The latter prescription did not help with the sleep loss, only made me feel somewhat stoned. I have elevated cholesterol, maybe due to genetics or hypothyroidism , definitely not my diet.","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome.I appreciate your concern for the heart palpitations while taking Coversyl.After having gone through your problem described in your query it seems to me that the heart palpitations and lack of sleep could be due to high dose of Synthyroid. The dosage of Synthyroid should be adjusted in such a way that the TSH level should be in the range of 0.4 - 4 as long as you take Synthyroid for hypothyroidism.I therefore advise you to consult your treating physician to check the efficacy of Synthyroid by doing thyroid function tests like TSH and to take treatment for high Cholesterol in the form of Statin medicine.The prescribed medications Coversyl, Apo-Hydro are unlikely to cause heart palpitations and lack of sleep.Hope I could answer your query.A feed back is appreciated."},{"Patient":"My daughter age 29, very good health, very active, lhas developed over several readings at doctor's office high blood pressure, all blood work came out fine.   she has been on birth control pills for 12 years.

It is known to cause drowsiness, an increased heart beat, constipation, dry mouth, blurring of vision, etc.Since its use is associated with increased heart beat, hence it should not be used to treat running nose or watery eyes in presence of rapid heart beat due to the use of Albuterol inhaler.Steam inhalation or the nasal decongestant are the best alternative.A non sedating anti histamine which is less likely to cause increase heart beat like Levocetrizine can be another right choice.Hope I could answer your query.A feed back is appreciated."},{"Patient":"Husband ahd quadruple bypass srgery in December has lost 65 pounds.

So a heart pressure between 110 mmHg is quite normal, it is our goal. It is normal that if its just the beginning of this values it will take a little time to adapt. He might feel dizziness but you should not worry.It will pass.Only if you catch lower blood preasure values, below 100/60 mmHg every day, we might consider to reduce any antihypertensive agent.My opinion as a cardiologyes is that this values are quite normal for the moment and that your husbant should continue this way.Hope I was helpful.

I have been on the pill for 10 years, I take antihistamines intermittently  for allergic  rhinitis . That's all the medication I'm on. I drink alcohol socially . What do you think is the cause?","Doctor":"Greetings. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Sometimes human heart produces ectopic beats or extrasystoles or, more popularly known as \\"skips a beat\\". It can happen literally to anyone that engages in physical activity, undergoes a lot of psychological stress and consumes caffeine-containing beverages, such as coffee or energy drinks. Alcohol, also, has its effect on the heart conduction and electrical systems, producing tachycardia and, sometimes, extrasystoles. Extrasystole is an ectopic beat and is call so because it is generated from elsewhere in the heart muscle, not in the natural pacemaker of it, the sinus node. Almost inherently, sinus node takes the control after an ectopic beat and produces a more forceful beat and this is sensed by the person - palpitation. Generally, they are totally benign and related to the above origins I described. There is a cut-off number that they can be called pathological, i.e. over 10.000 a day, registered in the 24-hour monitor, and this is a number that mandates treatment. Otherwise, they are benign and nothing to worry about. I, also, would recommend you to withhold or, at least, reduce caffeine intake, so you can reduce or stop these phenomena from happening.

It is normal to feel your heart beat through your stomach, when you are resting (the heart beat vibrations are transmitted through the diaphragm and you can experience the feeling of a heart beat in the stomach). This is certainly more obvious in sensitive persons. Regarding the numbness and chest discomfort, I would recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a cardiac ultrasound  (to examine better your cardiac function)  and a chest x ray. The face numbness (including the neck and left arm) may be also a sign of a neurological disorder. A neurological consult, coupled with a cervical spine x ray study are needed to exclude any nerve compression. Some blood lab tests like (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, etc.) should be done for the exclusion of possible metabolic causes, contributing in this symptomatology.

The light headedness and tachycardia when you stand seem to be related to an orthostatic hypotension or a postural tachycardia syndrome. Are you taking any medications lately? (These symptoms may be related to drug adverse effects too.) I recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray, a head up tilt test (to confirm the above diagnosis) and some blood lab tests: - complete blood count- PCR, sedimentation rate- thyroid hormone levels- blood electrolytes- fasting glucose- immunological tests (anti ganglionary antibodies), in case of confirmation of postural tachycardia by head up tilt test.

Even anxiety could mimic this clinical scenario. I would like to know the type of surgery you have gone through. Was it a small intervention? Did you need blood transfusion during the intervention? Had you had any fever in the days after the intervention?I recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG and some blood lab tests:- complete blood count (anemia and infection)- PCR, sedimentation rate- kidney and liver function tests- thyroid hormone levels (thyroid gland function)- cortisol plasma levels (adrenal gland function)- blood electrolytes, etc. You should closely monitor your blood pressure in sitting and standing up position. A decrease more than 20mm Hg on your systolic blood pressure while standing up, compared with sitting position, may indicate orthostatic hypotension. A head up tilt test is needed to rule in/out this possible diagnosis. If all the above tests result normal, the most probable cause of your symptoms would be anxiety.

Could this be serious?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I read your question carefully and would like to explain that his symptoms seem to be related to radicular pain, caused by a displacement of the thoracal spine disks, leading to irritation and inflammation of the nerves that originate in this region of the spinal cord. I would recommend consulting with the neurologist for a careful physical examination, a nerve conduction study and thoracic spine MRI or CT scan to examine better for possible compression of the spinal cord. Divalproex is usually helpful in nerve pain. This may be a reason why he has not had any problems since the fractures. I recommend performing valproate plasma levels, to see if he is being treated in therapeutical doses. Regarding the treatment, I recommend discussing with your doctor the possibility of increasing divalproex dose (based on the plasma levels results), or adding another antiepileptic drug (pregabaline or gabapentine) to your therapy.Hope to have been helpful!Greetings!Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 55 y/o female and last nite I mowed the lawn, yes, in the heat.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. My opinion is that it is probably nothing to worry about. However, facing a tachycardia at your age, can come from various reasons, which probably are physiological, like the psychological stress you went through during your electrocardiogram (EKG). Although, I suppose, your doctor's suspicion was minimal, my opinion is that some doctors find it reasonable (which is not wrong) to an echocardiogram, just to be in the \\"safe area\\", and not miss anything pathological that could be the origin of that tachycardia. Two-dimensional echocardiogram is an exam which allow us to precisely evaluate the size and the function, also the totality and integrity of heart structures. By heart structures I refer to any structural problem that the heart might have, like problems from birth or any damage in the structure of heart valves. These are suspicions that we, cardiologists, might have and seek, in a 21 year old individual. I would continue to state that my opinion is that there is nothing to worry about. Judging from the data provided by the symptoms which led you to do an EKG, in the first place, and the EKG itself, if you were my patient, maybe I would have found it appropriate, also, to request a 2D echocardiogram. I hope this answers your query. Take care. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"My chest feels tight, having trouble breathing? i feel the constant need to take a deep breath, but i cant.

Does he have any bumps or swelling in his knees? An immunological disorder affecting the joints and the heart could mimic this clinical scenario. I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some blood lab tests: - complete blood count- PCR, sedimentation rate, fibrinogen- liver and kidney function tets- thyroid hormone levels- anti streptolysine O titer - blood electrolytes.

Is your chest pain modulated by respiration or body movements?In such a case the most probable diagnosis would be a musculo-skeletal pain ( possible costochondritis).Regarding the problems with your vision during standing up, it may be related to orthostatic hypotension.You should measure your blood pressure during sitting and standing up position. If there is a decrease in your systolic blood pressure more than 20mm Hg during standing up, compared to sitting position, this would be very indicative for orthostatic hypotension. A head up tilt test is necessary to rule in/out this disorder. I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination (including head up tilt test), a chest x ray, a resting ECG and some blood lab tests ( complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, inflammation tests), to exclude other disorders related to chest pain and this symptomatology.

A chronic anemia could also mimic this clinical scenario. Have you measured your blood pressure during these episodes?I recommend to closely monitor your blood pressure during sitting and standing up position. A decrease more than 20mm HG in your systolic blood pressure during standing up position, compared with sitting position would indicate an orthostatic hypotension.

Anyway, I would recommend performing some tests (a resting ECG, a complete blood count for anemia, thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction and blood electrolytes for possible imbalance). An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring would help examine your heart rhythm trends for a prolonged time and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause of your skipped heart beats. In the meantime, I would recommend reducing caffeine and alcohol intake.

It may be a simple sinus tachycardia.This mean that your heart beats over 100 beat for minute.Its  normal range should be between 60-100 beat for minute in resting situation.It may happen for different reasons from simple emotional stres to different pathologys like anamia ,hyperthyroidism ect.This pounding sensation might happen because of extrasistoles.This are electrical impulses that generates from different parts of the heart different from that of a normal sinus rhythm.This couses an ectopic heart beat that you feel like a skipped beat or as a palpitation Extrasistoles might happen for the same reasons as sinus tachycardia.All sow thay might be frequent in ischemic heart disease or in patient after an heart attack becouse of changes of the heart muscle.In fact,you take medications to prevent this rhithm problems.

It may be  a simple sinus tachycardia that means that the heart is beating  regularly over 100 beats for minute. Its normal resting rate is between 60-100 beat for minute. You may experience palpitations because of extra-sistolyc beats. This are electrical impulses generating from parts of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm.

Its maximal frequency should go 220 minus your age and it should slowly go down. But you describe a long history of palpitations and a suddenly heart jumping just for some seconds, immediately dropping down. So, I think that we should see what are this rhythm fluctuations.

Our total body is in war with the microorganism that coursed the infection. All our immunity system in mobilized wining this war. All our body needs more energies to win this battle, so our heart needs to fulfill the body necessity for more energies, more blood.

Nebivolol is a beta-blocker that has effective and safe effects on lowering the blood pressure, but exerts minimal effect on the heart rate. Although most beta-blockers do have an effect on heart rate, nebivolol and some other drugs from this drug class do not. However, all beta-blockers have a great effect on reducing the heart workload. That is why I think nebivolol was prescribed, in the first place. On the other hand, olmesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and is as effective and safe to use for blood pressure-lowering aim. In various individuals, there may be the need to switch between equally effective drug classes to see which one works the best. I think this is the case, where an ARB works better than a beta-blocker and, also, has the same effectiveness and safety in usage, by providing even lower, within normal range, blood pressure. Regarding this topic, I think there is nothing to worry about, since we aim controlling the blood pressure by setting the bar at 140/90 mmHg. Every figure under those provided, and above 100/60 mmHg, is considered normal. If I were her doctor I would continue with nebivolol or another beta-blocker, but I do also agree with switching to olmesartan. It is an individual choice of the attending doctor, and, as long it is safe and effective, I agree with him. I hope this helps. Take care.

Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Well, our main concern, as doctors, as the side effects of general anaesthesia. It is commonly known that a large amount of risk in perioperative period can come from side effects of anaesthesia. My opinion is that this is the case. You see, during general anaesthesia all the organism is controlled basically by machines and vital parameters are controlled externally. It is more than understandable that there will be a slight disturbance in organism equilibrium after weaning off from anaesthesia, such as blurry vision or speech, high heart rate or low saturation, due to intubation applied during anaesthesia. I am glad that surgical removal of the lesion went fine. The other effects may be easily attributed to general anaesthesia, and normal gain of function is just a matter of little time. My opinion is that there is nothing to worry about and these symptoms will abolish in no time. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. If this pain did not go away with your antibiotic therapy then probably it was not a sore throat. Angina, pain originated by a blockage in your coronary arteries (arteries that encompass the heart as a crown, and \\"feed\\" it with oxygen and nutrients), usually manifests as a mid-chest pain radiating to the throat and left arm or shoulder. However, sometimes it can have atypical forms of manifesting and, since you have this sensation during carrying out physical activity, such as climbing stairs, my opinion is that you should have a cardiac check-up to, at least, exclude the cardiac origin of this pain. This is what I recommend you to do. First, to consult a cardiologist and have an EKG and an echocardiogram, to assess your heart electrical system and conduction system, and also assess the motility and function of heart chambers and valves. If seen appropriate, proceed further with a cardiac stress test, do more sensitively and specifically depict any problem in your coronary arteries. With your symptom, if the latter test comes back positive or inconclusive, then a coronary angiogram is appropriate, to assess if there are blockages in your coronary arteries and, if there are, to be treated as recommended. I hope I was helpful. Take care and good luck. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I've got dilated cardiomyopathy probably thru too much alcohol.

Well, I would recommend you not to drink any amount of alcohol, no matter what is the case. The heart takes up to 15-20 years of regular, moderate amounts of alcohol intake to enlarge (dilate). The positive thing is that there is a great chance of the heart assuming its regular chamber size, after discontinuing alcohol. If this does happen, it is only then when it would not matter if you have a drink or two in a family convention. But, if you are in a state where the heart is still enlarged and, with enlargement, the function is reduced, then any substance or activity that increases the heart workload can also result in heart failure decompensation, which, in turn, may produce some very serious, acute, life-threatening syndromes or conditions. To sum up, there is a great chance that after discontinuing the alcohol, the heart will return to its normal size, but until then, the dropped function that resulted from the heart enlargement, is not a safe scenario for drinking alcohol. Of course, I am doctor, I only give recommendations to what is the best choice. The ultimate choice is always up to you. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care.

It's not faster just harder. I'm sure it's my body telling me to go to bed. Should I be worried since I can't.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Well, madame, who else then us can understand better the nature of your job? It is that the certain amounts of time in standing position and performing various duties, varying from easy to really hard, puts the organism and heart, especially, to a hyperdinamic state. To overcome this state and the load on it, the heart has to do more to cope with this load. Therefore, harder or \\"pounding\\" heart beats are produced. Also, adding to this, every time we engage to moderate to strenuous physical activity, assume certain positions for a long time, undergo to a lot of psychological stress and demanding duties, and lose the normal cycle of sleep which is a characteristic of all shift jobs and which is accompanied with changes in normal diurnal and nocturnal hormonal levels, are all factors that are superimposed to this stressing event to the heart. I would recommend you a period of a week or two weeks of holidays or going to a spa, where relaxing programmes are readily available. I hope this answers your query. Take care. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"My mother is on oxygen and has congestive heart failure.  Does people with 20% heart functioning usually have to go on oxygen or could there be other problems with her.  She can barely get around without getting out of breath.  Oxygen is the only thing that seems to help her.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I carefully read your query. Supplemental oxygen always helps in congestive heart failure patients. Some of these patients need it with higher percentages of ejection fraction and some with lower. A congestive heart failure patient with a 20% function of the left ventricle is advised to be confined only to every-day duties and not various strains of a healthy heart or a slightly decreased heart function. A 20% functioning heart means that 80% of its content remains in the left ventricle (normal being 30-45%) in every cardiac cycle. This means that blood coming from the pulmonary circulation does not have space to empty, and all of this is interpreted as a raised pressure in this circulation. This produces fluid build up in lungs and difficulty to breath (dyspnea). Therefore, the lower the heart function percentage, the higher and the more often the need for supplemental oxygen. Besides oxygen, a good support to lowering the above mentioned pulmonary circulation high pressure, are the diuretics, and in these figures, I would recommend a loop diuretic and a potassium-sparing diuretic to her therapy. No salt should be used in her diet, whatsoever, because it retains the water and further raises the pulmonary pressure. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"When just falling off to sleep, my heart starts racing and pounding, spasm sensation to right of sternum.Arms, hands, legs and feet are hot, BP feels elevated. Left side of head, face feels numb and hot,Arms look redder. Just can't cross over to sleep without this happening.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Most of the people sense the heart beat as normal and understand this and accept it as a normal, physiological phenomenon. Some people, like yourself, sense this as a pathological phenomenon. I understand that. Every minimal change in perceived \\"physiological\\" or normal functioning, is interpreted like pathological things. This is a cause for anxiety or fear (situational anxiety) in these people and may or may not be followed with a panic attack due to one questioning him/herself \\"am I going to die?\\" \\"what is wrong with me?\\" etc. Every time we assume a lying down position, our heart, that beats by vibrating our chest wall, comes closer to a certain area of the ribcage. If lying on the left side it is so close to the chest wall that can even vibrate the bed you are lying on. All the other symptoms you mentioned are triggered by the anxiety attack you have, because all types of anxieties have one thing in common: flush of adrenalin and noradrenalin in the system, which then produce the symptoms you perceive. Every thing you feel is real, but it is not pathological. Therefore, if the heart rate is regular, every symptom is attributed to the anxiety, which I depicted above. If this is the case, then there is nothing to worry about. But, if this phenomenon affects your quality of sleep, by reducing its hours, then I would recommend a consult with a psychiatrist about the possibility of being put on a trial with sedatives for one to two weeks. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care.

I feel better today.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Pain in the chest can have different origins, which include also the locomotion system, i.e. muscles, joints and ribs. Now, every time we work out, even if we do not include the between rib (intercostal) muscles, suffices that we have heavy breathing and this can cause intercostal muscle soreness, which is mostly reflected as pain. If you try to cough, and you get the pain, then it is probably this diagnosis. As all other episodes with muscle soreness, no special treatment is required, as it goes away in few days. According to your age, my opinion is that cardiac and pulmonary origin of this pain is less likely. However, just to be secure and \\"in the safe\\", I would recommend you to do an EKG, as there sometimes are inflammations of cardiac lining (pericardium) which do not have an age predilection and can happen in all ages, especially after an episode with flu or other forms of infection. Just to be clear, my suspicion that this is the case is very low, but I recommended the EKG to securely exclude this as an origin of your pain. As about the waves of dizziness, I would be more comfortable answering this question if I had more details, because dizziness is a symptoms that may have various origins. It probably is, in this case, from over loading of physical activity and, in this case, no further examination is required. I would recommend you to take two to three days off from working out, and see if these bouts of dizziness happen again. I hope this helps. Take care. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I'm eighteen years old and have a family history of high cholestrol/health problems related to blood pressure. I sometimes get random spasms in my left thigh and arm that are in rhythm with my heart rate. The spasms feel as though my blood is pumping through those areas very intensely, and can very often see my pulse in these areas with ease (moves the skin so much). Should i be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I carefully read your query. Your young age and your family history about health problems are not in correlation with each-other, as risk factors for cardiovascular problems. This positive family history about health problems may be reflected later in your life, but I am almost sure that this is not the case at the moment. Clearly, these episodes of simple muscle cramps or twitching have become very worrisome to you. I understand that. This sense of fear to \\"what is happening to me?\\" produces higher than normal, pounding heart beats. If you have experienced any startling for any reason during your life, you could have had this feeling as well. As for the muscular spasms or cramps, if you get them very often every now and then, I would suggest you to run a blood level of calcium. Also, in some occasions, there is an obstruction of blood flow in a certain limb, due to assuming different positions while sitting or lying down, that obstruct the blood flow to a certain area. There, the pulse becomes more pronounced and, because of this temporary obstruction, other phenomena like muscle twitching and sensing the pulse, may be perceived. My opinion is that there is nothing to worry about. A low calcium level would explain muscle cramps, if they are becoming more and more often as episodes. Simple calcium supplement would correct the calcium levels, and the cramps would be gone. I hope this helps. Take care. Kind regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"Name: Diane Deaton Email:Comment: My dad is 88 years old and just admitted to hospice with congestive heart failure.

Me and my dad have grown closer in the past two years and I am not ready to let that go if there is any hope at all. Thank you so much.Phone: 859-912-1154","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM, madame. I carefully read your query. If you are referring to a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), they are usually used as a bridge to heart transplant. I am not sure how this works in your country, but I am quite confident that an 88-year old is not a candidate for transplant and, I am afraid, does not pass in the heart transplant committee. However, there are other precautions that can be undertaken in cases of congestive heart failure with low ejection fraction. It would be helpful for me, if you had provided the ejection fraction of the left ventricle, assessed with an echocardiogram. Nevertheless, the therapy should be strict and adhered to. Besides other drugs, a good outcome accompanies the addition of an angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or an angiotensinogen II receptor blocker (ARB), a potassium-sparing diuretic (spironolactone) and a loop diuretic (furosemide), to both oppose the compensatory mechanism which, when acting longer than needed, are dangerous to the organism, and, also to reduce the heart workload. Besides this, salt should be totally withheld from his diet, because it is estimated that 1 g of salt retains 10 g of water. Also, you can discuss with his cardiologist about the possibility of implanting an ICD (implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, to automatically convert the potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, should they happen, which have a high predilection in the damaged heart muscle) and of a CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy, basically a biventricular pacemaker, which helps both ventricles to contract closer in time). I hope this helps and answers your questions. Take care.

In 2003 I was heart operated (by-pass) I was fine and enjoying happy life, but for last few months I was feeling stress and high blood press suddenly. Please help me","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. It is normal for the blood pressure to fluctuate for some times a day. There are various physiological mechanisms running in the human body that can cause this, such as physical activity, sudden or chronic psychological stress and normal hormonal level fluctuations that happen throughout a day. I can see you are already on therapy for hypertension. Now, if the blood pressure, for the vast part of the day, remains under 140/90 mmHg, then it is called a controlled blood pressure. But if the blood pressure remains higher than these levels, for most parts of the day, then another drug addition to your therapy would be in order, at this time, because higher than above mentioned blood pressure figures can cause and trigger end-organ damages, especially in organs such as the eye and kidneys, which are rich in small-calibre arteries (arteries that are fragile to high blood pressure figures). If the reason you are having these \\"jumps\\" in blood pressure, as you provided, is the psychological factor, then I would recommend you first consulting with a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist, to evaluate the possibility of a 10-14-day trial of treatment with benzodiazepines. Because, on the other hand, if we add blood pressure-lowering therapy, we risk that, in moment with no psychological stress, we can produce lower than normal blood pressure levels, which is also undesired and not our aim. As for the symptoms of weakness, drowsiness and dizziness, I would recommend, first, a complete blood count to assess the levels of hemoglobin. If there are normal levels found, then I would recommend a consult with an ear-nose-throat (ENT) doctor, to understand if these are symptoms coming from the inner ear or common ear infections. I hope I was of help. Take care. Kind regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I have the flu at the moment and my heart is beating 110 beats per minute! But I also have dilated cardiomyopathy which I have medication for! And Atriil fibiration! When I rest it seems to be ok but when I get up and move around my heart beats quite fast??","Doctor":"Greetings. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Usually, during flu and other infectious issues in the organism, that are accompanied with fever, there is a hyperdinamic state and the organism has to regulate itself to cope with this strain. One of the compensatory mechanisms in hyperdinamic states is the rapid heart rate. Furthermore, the centre of temperature regulation in the human body is settled in the hypothalamus, the highest regulator in the brain. Due to this engagement, also the heart rate goes up. As for the other concern, that heart beats fast when moving around, in case of dilated cardiomyopathy, it is accompanied with heart insufficiency. This insufficient heart cannot cope as easily as a normal heart with a workload put onto it. Therefore, also here, the heart rate compensates as much as it can, for the strain put onto the heart. To illustrate it more figuratively to understand it more clearly, imagine the heart is a donkey, and an enlarged heart is like an old donkey, and it is clear that the two donkeys cannot cope in the same way with the same loads put on their back. As about the atrial fibrillation, I would need further information to address your concern, because with the information provided, I am not clear if these is paroxysmal or chronic, under medication or not, rate controlled or rhythm controlled, arrhythmic heart rate. However, if this is an enlarged heart caused by ischemic reason, then an antiarrhythmic such as amiodarone, would be appropriate to treat or prevent this supraventricular arrhythmia.

They were able to induce it while I was lying down and that surprised me. I see the neurologist on nov. 20. YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern, and would explain that your symptoms seem to be related to epileptic seizures. You should know that hyperventilation is one of the EEG techniques (besides photostimulation), to induce excitability of the brain cells and gain more information on the brain cell work under extreme conditions. Hyperventilation causes a decrease in partial CO2 pressure on the brain cells, which induces a excitability of the brain cells and even seizures. This episode should be coupled with pathological paroxysmal activity in the EEG in order to confirm the epileptic activity of the brain cells, responsible for the fainting. So it is very probable that your syncope may be related to seizures. I recommend also performing a head up tilt test, to rule in/out a possible orthostatic hypotension, which could be responsible for some of your syncope while standing (not related to the seizures). Hope to have been helpful!Best regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I am a 17-year-old female who has recently began experiencing some mild, but worrying cardiac symptoms. My heart is oversensitive to physical activity (not from being out of shape, as this started quite suddenly) and beats slightly faster than normal at rest. I get out of breath very easily and have palpitations when I lay down. Also, I sometimes get very dizzy. In other words, I just haven t been feeling right . After two months of these symptoms and a long-anticipated visit to the doctor, I had an ECG done and it came out completely normal, as did my blood tests. The doctor listened to my heart and said he heard nothing abnormal, except for a skipped beat when he had me perform the Valsalva maneuver which brought up the slight possibility of mitral valve prolapse. Although I was deemed completely healthy, I still want a second opinion and I want to know if it would be safe to go on roller coasters because I m going on a trip to Cedar Point soon. I know people with heart conditions should avoid rides.","Doctor":"Hi,  yes it's perfectly safe to go on a roller costeria ride at your age and the probabilities of different cardiac conditions you may have,  so enjoy your vacation and don't be apprehensive,  as anxiety itself will push your heart beats to higher side because of adrenaline pushed into the circulation.  Now At your age the most common possibility to cause the symptoms, if at all its cardiac in origin,  is mitral valve prolapse,  which may cause extra beats,  cause some breathlessness and anxiety attacks.  However because because cardiac examination was normal,  no murmur or click heard so in all probability it must be very mild and hence no treatment is needed as it's completely a benign condition and 1 in every 4 human will have some form of prolapse.  Now to confirm this do get a 2d echo done at convenience and  a 24 hour holter to know the frequency of missed beats if your symptoms persist.

An ambulatory 24-48 hour ECG monitoring and a closely monitoring of your blood pressure are necessary to exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia.

However she should be strict with the time of medication and shouldn't miss any.  The whole purpose of key hole surgery is so that the patient can get back to normal as soon as possible.  However on final note the surgeon who did the surgery would be the best to take a call.

I understand your concern and would explain that your diastolic blood pressure is below the normal limits, which is indicative of low blood pressure (your symptoms confirm this).   This changes may be related to your antihypertensive therapy, though all these drugs act in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. I recommend consult with your attending physician to perform a physical examination, a resting ECG and a cardiac ultrasound (to exclude any possible cardiac related cause of low diastolic blood pressure). If your cardiac ultrasound is normal, you should discuss with your doctor the possibility of making some changes to your antihypertensive therapy, to  avoid further diastolic blood pressure decrease. Meanwhile, I recommend taking plenty of fluids and laying down.

The dizziness lasted quite awhile.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I read your question carefully and understand your concern. It is necessary to perform a comprehensive differential diagnosis between different disorders related to your symptomatology. The main disorders to take into consideration as possible responsible for this clinical scenario would be an inner ear disorder and a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the vertebro basilar system. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose etc.). A doppler ultrasound of the cervical vessels would be necessary to examine the blood flow to the brain. If all the above tests result normal, I recommend consulting with the ENT specialist for a physical examination and labyrinthine tests to rule in/out any possible inner ear disorder. Meanwhile I recommend to carefully monitor your blood pressure and avoid straining physical activity.

He has good dental  habits, takes bp meds.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that this symptomatology may be related to a seizure. But anxiety and low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) can't be ruled out as other possible causes responsible for this clinical scenario. The slightly elevated blood pressure may have been just a physiological reaction to the event. I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some blood lab tests (fasting glucose, complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes,etc.). An EEG is necessary to examine the brain activity to rule in/out the possibility of a seizure. A brain CT scan may be needed in case of abnormal EEG findings. If all the above tests result normal, anxiety would be the most probable diagnosis.

Your blood glucose test (post postprandial and fasting) indicate a low tolerance towards glucose and probable diabetes. I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG and some lab tests : - HbA1c (which indicates the mean blood glucose values during the last 3 months)- kidney and liver function tests- thyroid hormone levels- blood electrolytes,- urine analysis,  etc. An endocrinologist consult is needed to start the proper therapy, besides diet modifications (diabetic diet) and physical exercise (including loss of weight). Regarding your cholesterol levels, I would recommend performing also HDL, LDL and triglycerides levels. You should know that total cholesterol is not a pure indicator of cardio vascular riks. The most important indicator of cardio vascular risk would be Total cholesterol/ HDL ratio (and decide if you need any therapy).The increased cholesterol levels may be related also to the diabetes, but some lifestyle modifications (diet, physical activity and weight loss) are helpful, besides possible need of statins.

Your symptoms seem to be related to high blood pressure and migraine. I would exclude any possible stroke related to your symptomatology. You should know that high blood pressure can cause vascular type headaches, mimicking migraine attacks. The sore spot on your head is related to a temporary dysfunction and vessel constriction in that area from the vascular headache and high blood pressure. I agree with your doctors that the best therapy to control your symptoms would be aspirin (for the prevention of possible vessel occlusion related to the constricted vessels) and arrangement of your antihypertensive therapy. Regarding the palpitations (heart fluttering) that you have been experiencing I would recommend performing a careful physical examination, a chest x ray, an ambulatory 24-48 hour ECG monitoring and some blood lab tests like: - complete blood count- thyroid hormone levels- kidney and liver function tests- fasting glucose- blood electrolytes , etc, to rule in/ out any possible cardiac arrhythmia and investigate for any metabolic cause, related to this clinical scenario.

I recommend consulting with your attending physician to consider the possibility of making some changes to your antihypertensive therapy, to avoid such low values of blood pressure (a decrease in the dosage or stopping any of the drugs).

Whenever there is infection of the lungs,   even viral,  the surrounding lung covering which are called pleura gets inflammed,  henceforth during deep breathing or cough .  The lungs would touch the inflammed pleura,  giving rise to shock like pain.  So not to worry about the same as it's self limiting and will resolve as soon as the cough and cold subsides. Pleurisy is a clinical diagnosis and no test will help to diagnose ,  however if symptoms persist so get a chest xray done to make sure you haven't developed pneumonia,  You may take simple paracetamol for the pain,  warm compress may help.

She had been experiencing increasing frequent occurrences of a racing hear and chest pain which lasts for days.  They are not always coincident.  She had an EKG and they said it was fine.  What could this be?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern, and would explain that her symptoms may be related to a metabolic disorder like hyperthyroidism, which is a dysfunction of the thyroid gland. High triglycerides can also be related with pacreatitis, and a hormonal imbalance (like ovarian cysts). So a comprehensive differential diagnosis should be done to establish the possible cause of her symptomatology. I would recommend consulting with her GP for a careful physical examination, a chest x ray, and abdominal ultrasound and some blood lab tests: - complete blood count- thyroid hormone levels- blood electrolytes- amylazemia- fasting glucose- cortisol plasma levels- kidney and liver function tests , etc. An ambulatory 24-48 hour ECG monitoring is needed if suspicions of a possible cardiac arrhythmia are raised.

I would like to know if this pain is modulated by respiratory or body movements? In such a case, the most probable cause of this symptomatology would be a musculo-skeletal pain. How old are you? Do you suffer from back pain? A thoracic nerve compression, causing irradiated radicular pain could mimic this symptomatology too. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some blood tests (complete blood count, inflammation tests, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, etc.)A thoracic spine x ray would be needed to rule in /out a possible vertebral column disorder, leading to radicular pain.

An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring is necessary to rule in/out a possible cardiac arrhythmia. Further tests like a cardiac ultrasound should be done if the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia is confirmed.

In such a case, I would recommend to consult with the GP for a careful physical examination and a routine check up (chest x ray, resting ECG, blood lab tests such as : complete blood count, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, thyroid hormone levels, blood lipid profile, etc.) to exclude other causes of high blood pressure. It is important to make some modifications to her lifestyle: - diet modifications (reduce salt intake and caffeine)- physical exercise (aerobics, walking)- lose weight if she is overweight. If these modifications are not effective in reducing blood pressure, I recommend discussing with her attending physician the possibility of starting an antihypertensive therapy such as enam (and find the proper dosage with slow tapering).

Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. If a diagnosis of high blood pressure (hypertension) is now established, and treatment, as above mentioned, is installed and adhered to, then it may be also for a lifetime. You see, blood pressure figures have to be controlled, if you are diagnosed with hypertension. Every long-standing, constant finding of high blood pressure figures, higher than 140/90 mmHg, is accompanied with slow, gradually progressive, but certain damages to all organs in the organism, starting from the heart which has to pump, for a long time, against a increased resistance in the periphery. There, of course, are a lot of drugs that can control hypertension effectively and safely. One of them is the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, which you are already on. No matter what medication is used, the final aim is to keep blood pressure figures under 140/90 mmHg. Also, I would recommend you to quit smoking, as it affects blood pressure, have a healthy physically active lifestyle, i.e. 60 minutes of physical activity every day, and limit your salt intake in diet, as much as you can. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Wish you a good health. kind regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I had a mammmogram today and right after the appt I used an electronic BP machine. My BP was 130/81 and pulse was 104. My BP is typically 110-120/60. I'm 45 yrs old. 5'3\\" & weigh 115 lbs. Could the results been high because I was nervous or because my arms are so small in the machine??","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. First, good luck with your mammogram. Blood pressure is a highly variable component of the human functioning system. It can go up and down again within few seconds. These extreme changes can be detected especially when one is having fear, a lot of psychological stress, physical activity, or hormonal and neurohumoral substance flushes in the system. So, basically, fear is a type of anxiety, and all anxieties cause the adrenalin levels to spike, and the rest - dizziness, high heart rate, high blood pressure, shortness of breath - are all symptoms of its effects on almost all organ systems in the organism. My opinion is that this is the case, where the fear of a result from an important medical test, also results in higher than average blood pressure figures and heart rate figures. Furthermore, my opinion is that there is nothing to worry about, and this is only physiological high blood pressure, not a pathological or abnormal one. Take care. I hope this helped.

I was wondering what you could tell me about this.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Coffee and other caffeine-containing beverages, like tea or energy drinks, have a stimulatory effect on the heart rate and it can run really rapid and produce pounding heartbeats, due to laboured work of the heart. My opinion is that the panic you went through, only made things worse or \\"put petrol to fire\\", because it is well-known that also fear, anxiety, panic attack or any other psychologically enhanced situation can increase the heart rate and, subsequently, produce shortness of breath, more fear, dizziness etc. Therefore, I would recommend you to avoid large amounts of caffeine and try to have a normal 6-7-hour sleep cycle, mostly from 11 pm to 6 am. Also, be physically active and recognize this as a very healthy behaviour, for at least 60 minutes a day. My opinion is that these are all the measures that should be undertaken, and no further action, at the moment. If you find this episode worrisome, and it is repeated with no known cause (because you recognize that this one is because of the caffeine), then an EKG would be in order, and, if judged appropriate by your attending doctor, further evaluation. I hope I was helpful. Take care. Regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"My mom had a heart-attack and is still in the hospital. The doctors say she is stable but her EF is only 15%. Since the heart-attack happened mid air and lot of time was lost, the heart muscles were significantly damaged it seems. There was a block, which they removed. Again, she is doing fine now; just resting and getting stronger. The doctors said ICD is an option; not now but once she is strong. Age: 56 Here are my questions: 1. I know the EF is very low, but is it dangerous? What can we do about it? Is there a way to improve that at all? 2. What complications will she have with EF of 15? I am sure her life-style needs to change but what does it really mean? 3. She is currently in a hospital in India and is planning to come back home to California. How long should she wait before she can travel safely? She had her heart-attack last week. Your response is greatly appreaciated.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern and let us take everything step by step together. A 15% of functioning heart, means that this heart is only pumping only 15% of its content in every cycle, and is keeping 85% of it. While a normal heart pumps 55-70% of its content during one cardiac cycle. This can produce problems, because this insufficient and \\"impotent\\" heart cannot fulfil the periphery's need for blood (oxygen and nutrients) and also does not create an environment for blood coming from the lungs to have enough space to empty in cardiac chambers. This raises pressures in the lungs, and the risk of them filling with fluid is always imminent after a load is posed to this insufficient heart, such as minimal physical activity or salt intake, or fluid retention. Now, is this EF very low? Yes, it is, for the above mentioned reasons. Only precautions can be taken, such as restricting the daily activity only to everyday daily duties and restricting salt from the diet, because 1 g of salt retains 10 g of water, in the human body. If the PTCA and stenting was carried out within 6 hours from the onset of pain, then there is expected benefit of this muscle to return some of its function, not entirely, because it takes 6 hours minimally for consolidation of this damage of heart muscle cells, going from transitory injury to a permanent damage with non-functional scar tissue placement instead of healthy, normally functioning cardiac muscle cells. Besides the standard medication, in her therapy should also be included two diuretics and a angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I). I would not be a bold doctor and tell you that it is safe for air travel, at least until she is stabilized and seen if any benefit to the heart muscle has been brought on by revascularization. An enlarged heart, after an infarction, is a subject for ventricular, potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, because of the scar tissue formation. Implanting an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a good choice in a second time, because it would substantially prevent death from at least these malignant arrhythmias. Should they happen, this device will convert them automatically, by delivering a programmed electric shock. I hope I was thorough with my answer. Take care. My regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I'm 60yo male. Generally fit without significant medical history Heart rate at rest hangs in the 40's and occasionally have palpitations. This has gone on >20 years. Had colonoscopy recently and rhythm strip showed rate of 43 and somewhat irregular. Do I need further evaluation.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Normal heart rate accepted in the worldwide population is from 60 to 100 heart beats per minute. In highly trained athletes and people that some time in their life were highly physically active, even heart rate in the 40s is acceptable and considered normal. Normally, heart rate, during a phisyologically and psychologically delicate procedure such as colonoscopy, tends to go higher and not remain in the 40s. The palpitation you are sensing is probably because of an occasional extrasystole (premature ventricular contraction - PVC) which is an ectopic heart beat, that comes from elsewhere in the cardiac muscle, not from the original pacemaker of the heart - the sinus node. These are almost always not worrisome events. This long-standing bradicardia if not accompanied by symptoms - dizziness, blurry vision, dark vision, near-fainting episodes etc. - then is probably nothing to worry about and no further treatment is warranted. However, I would recommend you to be put on a 24-hour rhythm monitor, to register the heart rate in a whole day, and see if there are even lower heart rate figures registered. If yes and if the extrasystoles result more than 10.000 in number, in the 24-hour registration, I suggest you to discuss with your cardiologist, about the possibility of implanting a definitive pacemaker. I hope this helps. Take care. My regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I just woke up and when I was simply turning over in bed, my heart started beating fast and kind of hard.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Yes, this is everyone's problem, both for patients and for us, doctors. Oral anticoagulants, such as acenocoumarol, interact not only with other medication in the treatment regimen, but also with certain food and meteorological changes. On the other hand, the other delicate problem is that the international normalized ratio (INR)'s target window is very narrow (2.5-3.5 in case of post-mitral valve replacement). Plus, the other problem is that acenocoumarol will only take effect 48 hours after starting, and the INR you get in your hand, actually reflects the dosage taken two days before. In our clinic's experience, we use the hospitalization period to adjust the right dosage by measuring INR once in two days, and be safer with the dosage when we discharge the patient. Every time that there is a disturbance in the standard dosage, we then measure INR every three-to-five days to readjust the dosage. I know this costs, but the reality is that we are in very narrow borders that separates us from clot formation on one side, and from excessive blood thinning, up to dangerous INR figures sometimes, on the other. I always prefer to adjust the disturbed dosages, by measuring the INR in three-to-five days periods, until a stable dosage is achieved, than taking the risk of leaving the patient without anticoagulation (INR under 2.5) or thinning the blood more than it is needed (INR above 4.0).

It is almost impossible for anyone, healthy or not, to constantly take deep breaths. It is one's organism that do not allow to do this, because of the organism balance disturbance that results from hyperventilation. Well, when this becomes worrisome to \\"Why can I not take deep breaths\\" an anxiety feeling is what comes after, and can also produce the tingling and numbness. My opinion is that you should try really hard not to give much attention to the deep breaths and/or try thinking about something else, when you capture yourself thinking about deep breaths. As for the loss of equilibrium, more information would be welcome, so I could precisely assess this symptom. Anyway, if it is coming after your briskly switch positions, such as from lying down to briskly stand up, the quick redistribuition of fluids in the organism, can cause dizziness and loss of equilibrium for few seconds - it is called orthostatic hypotension, not harmful, and is triggered by a sudden drop of blood pressure and attributed to the fluid restribuition explained above. It also can come from problems in your inner ear, a small organ responsible for our balance.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Well, depending on the kind of operation, there are differences in atrial fibrillation percentages accompanying the perioperative period. One thing is for sure, atrial fibrillation or flutter is the most common arrhythmia found in perioperative stage, and always expected to happen. It usually self-converts to normal sinus rhythm, by controlling the heart rate with digoxin, beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, and by eliminating the electrolyte disturbances, especially potassium disturbances. If the situation persists more than 24 hours, then medical, pharmacological or electric shock measures should be undertaken to restore the normal sinus rhythm.

She is asian.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for asking on HCM. I understand your concern. All right, besides the problems with high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which of course mandate treatment and control, the problem as you describe it may be related to the gallbladder and any obstruction in the normal flow of bile through bile ducts. I am assuming a gallbladder wall chronic or acute inflammation by gallstones, since the pain is mild in intensity. Combining the female gender, the age of the madame, the type and localization of the pain and the presence of the fever, the main diagnosis that should be confirmed or excluded is gallstones and gallbladder inflammation. Therefore, I recommend to do an abdominal ultrasonography, to check for gallstones in the gallbladder or any reason for obstructing the bile ducts, such as gallstones or a phenomenon in the head of the pancreas. Also, some blood tests should be run: a complete blood count (CBC), liver profile (AST, ALT, GGT, bilirubin, ALP). I hope I was helpful with my answer. Wish you a good health.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Well, the added symptoms like insomnia are coming from the fear that something weird is happening to you. Everything can be explained by your anxiety, you are experiencing from these episodes. Psychological stress is a major factor one producing high blood pressure, which in turn produces the pressure headaches, and the anxiety, which is accompanied by a flush of adrenalin, can cause extrasystoles. Extrasystoles are extra heart beats, not generated by the normal pacemaker of the heart, but from an ectopic \\"beacon\\". The normal heart beat that comes after extrasystole, is more forceful and produces the feeling like heart is pounding out of the chest or throat - palpitation. Anyway, every single phenomenon you described has a logical and physiological explanation. However, even though my suspicion is low, regarding a possible cardiac origin of your problem, I would like to recommend some tests, to exclude the cardiac origin with the highest certainty, or confirm a possible heart problem:- echocardiogram - to evaluate the function and size of heart chambers and valves - 24-hour blood pressure monitor - to see if these high figures happen one time a day, during stress, or if they are constant throughout the day, in which case proper and immediate treatment should be started to control blood pressure and keep it under 140/90 mmHg. - EKG- cardiac stress test, if seen reasonable by the cardiologist that assesses the above mentioned tests. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"my mom has atrial fibirllition and her heart beat reaches 120 every day ..her Dr keeps admitting her to the hospital trying so many bills on her it gos down but when she goes back home it goes up again , i am pissed off that no one know what to do i am scared that she will die by a strock","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. An established diagnosis of chronic, persistent atrial fibrillation, mandates rate control and anticoagulation. During atrial fibrillation, the reason people have strokes, are the thrombi (clots) formed in a fibrillating, non-functional atrium. But this problem is solved with a proper anticoagulation and keeping the international standardized ratio (INR) between 2.0 - 3.0. On the other side, rate control can be achieved with various drugs that exert this effect. First, the heart rate should be kept under 90 beats per minute. It is not the risk of strokes when the heart rate goes up, but the risk that every atrial fibrillation beat (which goes up to 400-600 beats per minute) may be transmitted to the ventricle and such a rate for the ventricle produces life threatening ventricular arrhythmia. That is why drugs that inhibit this effect, due to their effect on the atrio-ventricular node, are used for rate control (digoxin, most beta blockers, and verapamil and diltiazem from the calcium channel blockers). If these drugs do not work, there is also the class of antiarrhythmics that work with the aim of rate control in atrial fibrillation. I recommend you to discuss these options with her attending doctor. I hope I helped with my answer. Take care. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"Dear Dr. PrabhakarI have been taking Aritel 40 for about a yr.Lately I am having lot of dizziness.The ECG shows missed beats .say between 10 and15 per minute,and also IVCD.Occaisionally ,the heart rate drops to 46 per minute on standing up.Could this problem be due to Eritel?ThankyouRM","Doctor":"Hello,  Eritel per say doesn't affect heart rate,  however many a times if your blood pressure is over treated you may have dizziness when you suddenly get up   this is called ortho static hypotension.  However if your ecg shows so many missed beats (considered significant when more than 10 beats),  and IVCD is too non specific, the missed beat may be the reason for dizziness in all probability.  Do upload the ecg or visit your cardiologist with the same for accurate diagnosis. The next test is 24 hour holter Also don't worry just a medication would be the treatment,  it's just titration of dose of the medication can be done easily after final diagnosis is made.  Regards Dr Priyank Mody"},{"Patient":"For about 2 years now I have been having symptoms of fluttering heart and heavy heart beat but have not given any attention to it because it would only occur once very couple of weeks or so. Recently the symptoms got worse to the point that I was gasping for air when the fluttering occurred. I went to a cardiologist and the doctor diagnosed me with MVP by using ultrasound and having me squeeze down. When I did this, the mitral valve bent backwards. I explained that when I have the symptoms that I am not squeezing down, but the doctor said that I might be doing that and just don’t know it. Does this sound right? I am on a heart monitor right now because the symptoms do not occur at specific times. Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Arrhythmia as very much common in MVP and they can of many different types,  so you must have been put on monitor to surely determine which type of arrhythmia it is.  If the symptoms are in frequent a event recorder is best as you may activate the system when the symptoms occur.  If the symptoms are disabling,  you should start on a medication which  will prevent the symptoms as well as delay the progression of disease.  It's beta blocker,  however I would like you to consult a local doctor for dose titration and determine the need.

Most of the big studies to prove it's effect have found it to be clinically u non significant,  even the smaller trial garlic supplement could decrease the upper systolic Max to 3-4 mm hg and lower diastolic to 2-3 mm hg.

How can I controle this fear and calm myself in the hospital environment and bp monitor? I try so hard .","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern, and would like to explain that this is a common syndrome affecting up to 2 % of patients. If your blood pressure is high only when monitored by the medical staff or in a medical institution, there is nothing to worry about.White Coat syndrome is a benign type of episodic hypertension, which doesn't cause any higher cardio-vascular risk compared to normal persons and as such no treatment is required. It is really difficult to control your anxiety, but psychotherapy and anxiolytics can help you manage better this situation. I recommend to closely monitor your blood pressure at home different times during the day and perform some tests like: a resting ECG, chest x ray, blood lab tests (complete blood count, fasting sugar, blood lipid profile, thyroid hormone levels, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, etc.), to exclude other possible causes of secondary hypertension.

I am drinking some vitamin water now and that has helped the light headedness, but my chest still feels a little funny.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Alcohol consumin, recreational or, with higher probability, binge drinking, has various effects on the human organism. Also, some of its effects are exerted on the human heart, especially the electrical and conduction systems of it. There is a great possibility that alcohol intake in excessive amounts can result in various cardiac arrhythmia, dependin also to how damaged this heart is. Assuming that you have a normally functioning heart, this may be a supraventricular arrhythmia - atrial flutter or fibrillation with highest probability. Furthermore, this is now known and established syndrome and is called \\"holiday heart syndrome\\", which is charachterized by patients running to the emergency room with this arrhythmia, on Mondays, in most cases, after having a weekend with alcohol intake in abundant amounts. I recommend you to go to the emergency room, and an EKG should be done to confirm this diagnose, and, later, an echocardiogram, to assess the size, motility and function of cardiac chambers and valves. If this diagnose is established, then pharmacological or elctrical means should be undertaken, to convert this arrhythmia into normal sinus rhythm. I would recommend you to reduce your alcohol intake to a maximum of 30 g ethanol a day (a beer or a glass of wine). I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care.

I carefully read your query. Lightheadedness, and especially loss of equilibrium, has some origins, but I would recommend to confirm or exclude only two of them. First, it can come from the heart conduction system disturbances, and usually are accompanied with darkening of the vision, and episodes of near-fainting or clear-cut fainting. I recommen you to do an EKG and, then, if judged appropriate by your consulting cardiologist, a 24-hour rhythm monitor registration. Second, this is a common symptom of inner ear disturbances, where is located a small organ responsible for balance. I recommend you to consult an otorhinolaringologist (the ENT doctor) about this or first try a course with betaserc 24 mg x 2 tb/d for 10 days. This drug helps also in differential diagnosis, i.e. if the episodes do not occur while under this drug, then we can confirm, with highest probability, that these epsodes' origin is in the inner ear. As about the high blood pressure, the figures you provides are within normal range, as worldwide population standard normal blood pressure figures are 100-139/60-89 mmHg. Therefore, my opinion is that there is nothing to worry about regarding this. Wish you a good health. I hope I was helpful.

What kind of doctor do I need to see?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I read carefully your question and understand your concern. Your symptoms may be related to different disorders: - Thyroid dysfunction ( Hyperthyroidism can mimic this clinical scenario)- Anxiety - A chronic infection affecting different systems (like Lyme disease)- Cardiac arrhythmia- Seizures (seizures can be closely related to cardiac arrythmia)I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some lab tests: - complete blood count- fasting glucose- kidney and liver function tests- blood electrolytes- thyroid hormone levels- inflammation tests (PCR, fibrinogen, sedimentation rate). Further tests may be needed to establish the cause (like an ambulatory 24 hour ECG monitoring, an EEG, infection disease screening tests). Regarding your blood pressure, it is a borderline high blood pressure, and some modifications to your lifestyle would be helpful to reduce it: - diet modifications ( less caffeine, less salt intake and carbohydrates, more fibers and omega 3)- a lot of physical exercise- lose your weight if your are overweight.

I would like to explain that Chol/HDL ratio is a more confident indicator compared to total cholesterol or LDL. A ratio above 4.5 in men, indicates a high cardio vascular risk. That is why I agree with your doctor in starting therapy with statines to reduce this independent risk factor for cardio vascular disease. Regarding his glucose levels, I would advise to perform further tests like : - glucose tolerance test- HbA1c to examine better his glucose metabolism and rule in/out possible diabetes.In case of an initial diabetes, diet modifications would be more appropriate than medical therapy, to reduce high blood glucose levels. Some other tests are needed to exclude other metabolic disorders: - a resting ECG-thyroid function tests-cortisol plasma levels-blood electrolytes-kidney and liver function tests.

Whenever I feel it I usually tells myself to calm down, keep still it will pass. In my sleep I like to think I control it up to 3 seconds or minutes I cant tell because most times I fall back to sleep. If I jump up the pain will be more severe and I tend to lose consciousness maybe for a minute.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, your symptoms may be related to anxiety. You should know that it is a big psychological stress for the brain to wake up from sleep( which is total relax) to alert state, especially from an alarm clock. It causes an immediate increase of catecholamines in your blood, which induce sudden tachycardia and even ectopic beats and difficulty breathing. A phobia from the alarm clock (may be related to an event in the past), may cause such reaction. But a cardiac arrhythmia can't be excluded, especially when mentioning the lose of consciousness (it can happen during a panic attack too).I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray and some routine lab tests (complete blood count, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests). An ambulatory 24 hour ECG monitoring may be necessary to exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia. I would also advise to avoid the alarm clock, or to change its sound. You can use the radio for this purpose. If you don't have any symptoms when avoiding this stimuli (the alarm clock sound), it is probably just anxiety.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Chest pain can be elicited by many origins. It can come from the coronary arteries, from linings within the rib cage, from lungs, the oesophagus, the stomach etc. Without further details, I would like to describe the angina. Angina (pain originated by blockages in coronary arteries) is more described like a heaviness or tenderness or squeezing sensation in the mid chest, rather than clear-cut pain. It then can spread to the jaw, left wing, shoulder and arm. This is more triggered by physical activity, but, when the blockage reaches critical measures and/or the atherosclerotic plaque is unstable, the it can happen in more frequent episodes, with less physical activity and, even, at rest. Furthermore, angina is the way of the heart to \\"scream for help\\" because it is not getting enough oxygen and nutrient supply. This kind of pain, if it is angina, happening at rest, demands a coronary angiogram, to quantitatively assess the possible blockage within the coronary artery, and to plan a strategy for treating it (with stents, merely medication or coronary artery bypass grafting). After carefully assessing and discerning about what kind of pain is this, and if it would sound like angina to me, I would also recommend a coronary angiogram as soon as possible. Of course, we only give recommendations. The choice is up to you. Good luck. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care.

I would like to provide you only with the medical side of your concern, as I cannot speak about other administrative things. There is a window period after a heart attack that is accompanied with the highest risk of complications. A after heart attack patient, even at his best looking condition, can produce these complications, because the damaged part of the heart muscle goes through some gradual changes which start to happen 30 minutes after the attack up to six weeks, when this process is completed, and, finally, the previously normal tissue of the heart is replaced with non-functional scar tissue. This window is known to be 7-10 days counted from day one of the heart attack. These complications are sometimes serious and potentially life-threatening. Therefore, as a cardiologist, I would strongly recommend that he should be hospitalized in a specialized intensive cardiac care unit for further monitoring and treatment. Everyone can always take the risk and go home the day after the heart attack. But, it is a risk I would not recommend to anyone, both as a person and, especially, as a cardiologist.

Do I need to start taking meds to bring it down???","Doctor":"Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. The standard and normal blood pressure in population worldwide is from 100 to 139 mmHg systolic and from 60 to 89 mmHg diastolic. Every prolonged and long-standing blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg is not dangerous acutely and per se, but it predisposes to other organ damages and, especially, those that are comprised by arteries of very small calibres or arterioles, which are present in great amounts, such as the eye and kidneys. Constant figures like those provided by you, require treatment as soon as possible, and the strategy of attacking these blood pressure figures depend on your cardiologist's most reasonable approach. If you were my patient, I would start with a beta-blocker, since, besides blood pressure-lowering effects, they have the property of decreasing the heart workload. If counterindicated, for the same aims, a calcium channel blocker (verapamil or diltiazem) could be started. There are also other classes for lowering the blood pressure and they are all almost equally safe and effective to be used. After medication is started, blood pressure figures should be monitored by some measurements a day, with the main aim to keep them under 140/90 mmHg. I hope I was helpful. Wish you a good health.

Then went to the ER and my blood results were ok and they sent me home. I had to take a plane back to the U.S. And even though I was very dizzy I did ok in the flight.( July 5) Doctors in Mexico though it was related to the high altitude in Mexico (8,000ft) and once I got to lower altitude it would get better.

Your symptoms may be related to low blood pressure or low intracranial pressure. You should know that from the heat in jacuzzi the blood supply to the skin is increased, leading to a slight decrease in other organs, and a low blood pressure. After cesarean, due to the spinal block, the tearing of the meninges in the place of the spinal tap, could cause chronic leakage of the spinal fluid, leading to headache and nausea that are relieved by laying down. A decrease in the blood flow, could exacerbate low intracranial pressure. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a head up tilt test and some routine lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes). A brain MRI and a spinal tap may be necessary to exclude the above disorders. Hope to have been helpful!Greetings!Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"My 76 year old friend had a double by pass surgery last Thursday. This morning he expereinced rectal bleeding. He is still in the hospital and was expecting to be discharged to go home today.  Can the blood thinners be causing the rectal bleeding?  What type of tests should be done?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. With your description I am assuming that you are referring to clear red blood in the stool. When this phenomenon happens, the problem is probably in lower \\"floors\\" of the digestive system, which means, in most of the cases, it can happen from hemorrhoides. In this aspect, I would suggest you to consult a general surgeon and a digital rectal examination should be performed. If you are referring to aspirin and/or clopidogrel, when you mention blood thinners, then they can cause bleeding from upper \\"floors\\" of the digestive system, such as the stomach or the duodenum (the most proximal part of the small intestine). In such case, in most of the cases, this bleeding is reflected by giving the stool a dark brown to black discolouring. However, I would suggest that a general surgeon should be consulted first, and then other diagnosis sought. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care. Regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I had two stents put in seven years ago . I am 63 years old . I have not had any problems at anytime . The last month I felt a little strain in my heart area . The last three days I have been experiencing sharp pain in my left arm in my bicep area .is there any connection ?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. First of all, I believe that you know what does a chest pain originated from coronary arteries feel like. This is called angina, and is more like a severe heaviness or tightness in the mid chest and which spreads to the left arm. Sharp pain with highest probability does not reflect a pain originated from a blockage in the coronary arteries. On the stent side, since it has been seven years you underwent stent implantation, I assume that the stents are patent and working well, since the highest probability for them to narrow is within 6 to 12 months after implantation, depending from the stent placed. However, once you had coronary artery disease, although treated at that time, you have a independent risk factor to develop coronary artery disease again. I would recommend you to undergo a cardiac stress test, based on the above mentioned fact, and the strain you felt in your heart area. As for the sharp pain in your left arm, my opinion is that it is not connected to coronary arteries. I hope I was of help. Kind regards. Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"in january of this year i woke up one morning and i noticed my chest was hurting right away then i starting developing a large almost knot feeling or a lump on my right breast plate it was very tender i couldnt even hug people because it hurt so bad now ive noticed im having chest pains alot more often and at time the lump isnt very vissible and doesnt hurt but other times it sticks out of my skin so bad that its vissible without even having to touch it and it when it becomes larger thats when i start having the bad chest pains. im not sure that it would be a cyst because it isnt squishy at all and it doesnt move it has stayed in the same place for 6 months. what could it be?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query.Thanks for using HCM.Your description of pain and lump in right breasts needs evaluation .you must consult a surgeon for physical examination.we need to find out whether it is cyst or a mass.local examination gives lot of information of its size,consistency etc.Then you may need mammography to establish diagnosis and mat need further tissue diagnosis.I request you to go for early check up.My best wishesDr.Rajesh Teli,MD."},{"Patient":"My dad, 46 years old, known hypertensive for the last 5 years, complained of numbness on one side of his head.

After the incident, my ribs & back hurts, my left rib cage is hurting more than the right. I m having a hard time getting up or even looking at the back, it s like my upper body couldn t even rotate sideways. My heart is also hurting whenever I bend down and I lose breath. Whenever I laugh, cough or sneeze, there s a sudden pain in my back and ribs. Should I have it diagnosed? Or it s just normal for people who fell down the stairs?","Doctor":"Ho,  due to the fall there has been an injury to the rib cage,  a sprain or maybe fine hairline fracture.  However be reassured,  for rib fracture is always treated conservatively and it heals on itself so the pain will go of it some days.  You may take an OTC analgesic if needed,  however don't overdose and don't take it for long periods.  Lastly if there is severe backache,  do get screening test of spine done,  as that is something we should not miss.  The pain on bending down is nit cardiac and due to rib only as in this position all the ribs come near to each other aggravating pain.

Amiodarone hydrocloride added to control AF prescribed by AF doctor. The nex step if this doesnt work is putting a quarter size coin in my heart. However I am currently taking riveroxaban 20mg. It is my understanding that one of these meds would preclude surgery (i.e. coin in heart ) due to the fact that it stays in the blood stream for up to two years. So may need heart surgery but AF has me on an anticoagulane? This is all through the Heart Science Centre, London, Ontario. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello,  Let's individually address the problem.  1)   in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,  the angina is due to  increased muscle mass leading to imbalance in oxygen demand and supply. Secondly due to continued existing coronary artery disease.  So here increase dose of beta blocker to max tolerating dose (would help in AF as well),  add diisopyramide after beta blockers If you are above 40 check  for coronary artery disease and treat like wise  2) about atrial fibrillation.  You are on rivoraxabn for anti coagulation so a blood  clot doesn't form in the heart.  However you may  be put on alternative meds for that  and a coin machine ( a cardiovertar / defibrillator)  to prevent sudden cardiac death can be planned, no need to wait for 2 years for the same. 3) the heart surgery depends on the gradient,  also atrial fibrillation may persist even after surgery,  more likely if left atrial volume is increased  If you can send me all the reports and meds you are taking,   I would be able to help you further Regards Dr Priyank Mody"},{"Patient":"I am taking cardizem CD for hypertension.

Mum sometimes cannot swallow her food properly and has some pain when she does this.  Can and angiagram help her to have a better life?","Doctor":"Hello,  as you said that the leaky aortic valve,  so simultaneously in most of the patient s the proximal aorta,  the main artery supplying the whole body would dilate over time.  This dilated portion may compress upon food pipe leading to earing difficulty she faces,  also it would lead to chest pain you describe.  After ruling out by other factors by less Invasive tests she may require angiogram with aortogram.  However due to her age she can avoid it if symptoms are not very debilitating as aortogram is just for diagnosis and treatment would still mean surgery or less Invasive plasty.

Regarding your concern, I would explain that hemophilia is not relate to heart attacks (which are thrombotic events) but to repeated episodes of hemorrhage.This disorder affects coagulation factors, resulting in an imbalance of coagulation, leading to spontaneous hemorrhages in all the parts fo the body. Some studies have suggested that hemophilia is a protecting factor against coronary artery disease, but many studies have concluded that hemophilic patients have the same cardio vascular risk as other healthy persons. So there is nothing to worry about a heart attack at your age. Your symptoms may be related to anxiety.

An ambulatory 24 hour ECG monitoring is necessary to rule in/out possible cardiac arrhythmia. If all the above tests result normal, the most propable cause of your troubles would be anxiety. In such a case you need to consult with your psychiatrist to start psycho therapy or a medical treatment (like an antidepressant).

I understand that this can come as a concern and a worrisome event to non-medical community, but there are a myriad of reasons that cause the blood pressure to fluctuate from day to day, even from hour to hour. These blood pressure-fluctuating factors can be physical activity, psychological stress, extreme temperatures (when it is hot outside, arteries dilate, hence low blood pressure), physiological diurnal and nocturnal changes in hormone levels etc. Blood pressure is not a credible component if it is measured separately, after some activity, after caffeine-containing beverages, and in the doctor's office (white coat syndrome). Also, blood pressure can be considered low when under 100/60 mmHg.Ramipril is a safe and effective drug in high blood pressure control. It has rare side effects, predominantly with dry cough, and is counterindicated when there is damage to the kidney function. Dosage of 2.5 mg/day is a good dosage, if it controls the high blood pressure. I hope I was of help. Take care.

I am going to see my dentist today to see if I have and infection in my teeth but after reading some information about jaw pain I am now concerned about a heart attack. Should I go to the ER ? I .no longer have the chest pain","Doctor":"Greetings! Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Combining the chest pain (angina - heaviness of moderate to severe intensity in the mid chest, radiating to the jay, left shoulder and left arm), jaw pain and cold sweats, we may have the scenario of a heart attack, indeed. But, before the dental procedure, I would suggest you to go the emergency room, and an EKG should be done and blood troponin and CK-MB (blood markers of heart cell destruction) should be measured. If they come back normal, a heart attack will be ruled out. Even with these tests normal, we cannot rule out the coronary artery disease. But, you may proceed with the dental procedure. After the dental procedure is done, I would recommend also an echocardiogram (to evaluate the heart muscle and valves, also the volumes of the heart chambers; particularly to see the movement of the heart muscle, which may be normal, or with decreased motility, in which case this can be a sign of a remote or recent heart attack) and a cardiac stress test, which help us determine if there is a coronary artery condition or not. I hope I was helpful. Take care. Regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"Does an EKG that shows some enlargement of the left ventricle mean it is definitive, or are further tests required to determine if it is true. The EKG is being compared to last year's EKG which didn't show any enlargement.How serious is this at this stage?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. EKG can detect enlargement of the left ventricle, but not with specificity. Furthermore, there has to be a cause to the enlargement, such as a heart attack. My opinion is that the EKG showed hypertrophy of the left ventricle (thickening of ventricle walls, which mainly happens due to hypertension). Let this aside, this conclusion can be further evaluated with echocardiogram. So, I would recommend you to proceed with an echocardiogram, where can precisely be seen and evaluated the motility and function of the heart muscle, and the diameter and volume of all heart chambers. Also, valvular apparatus will be evaluated, and a possible valvular cause to this enlargement, if there is one, be sought. There can be also seen if there was a remote or recent heart attack. I hope this helps. Take care.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Well, you are young to have coronary artery disease, but this is not the rule of thumb. It is not impossible do have this disease even at your age. This chest pain, should it come from coronary artery blockages, has to be described like a squeezing feeling or heaviness with moderate to severe intensity, starting in the mid chest, then propagating to the jaw, the shoulders and the left arm, triggered by exercise and stopped from ceasing it. This chest pain is called stable angina. Now, in my experience there is positive, non-conclusive and negative result of a cardiac stress test. After my description, if you have had typical angina, your cardiac stress test is positive and you have a risk factor such as smoking, history of myocardial infarction or sudden death in your family, or high cholesterol levels, I would recommend you for a coronary angiogram. Although the index of suspicion is low at your age, I would suggest you to undergo this procedure and, at least, the coronary artery disease is excluded. There is no cardiologist who would ignore angina + a positive cardiac stress test, although mild. There are relatively novel studies that can serve as bridge between cardiac stress test and coronary angiogram, but none of them can be more precise in confirming or excluding coronary artery disease, than coronary angiogram. I hope this is of help. Take care and good luck. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"My Father just died of a massive heart attack. He has suffered from defribulation in the past but thats all.

I had a problem when I was born with my heart but it got cured with threatment for 4 years. is this the reason why im having prolems now?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Your symptoms may be related to a cardiac disorder. Your past medical history is really concerning for a cardiac disorder. I recommend consulting with a cardiologist for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG and a cardiac ultrasound, to examine your cardiac function. You need to perform some blood tests ( a complete blood count, kidney and liver function test, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes, cortisol and thyroid hormone levels), to exclude other metabolic causes which may mimic this clinical scenario.

I had done MRI, CT scan with contrast, several xrays of my chest, back ribs--everything shows normal. I also have a small hitial hernia and reflux. I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy last year. all normal, no hpilori, just showed a small hernias and minor gastritis and reflux. I had bone density, ok, mammogram ok, several lab test ok. I am 70 yrs. old. overweight like 20 pounds. the pain on my ribs and back has intensify. doctor said could be costocondritis. what could help. I don t want to take pain killers cause of my stomach problem. please help----ana","Doctor":"Hello Ana!Thank you for asking on HCM!I read your question carefully and understand your concern. Your performed tests can exclude any possible cardiac disorders, column disorders, aorta disorder related to your symptomatology. So if the gastro enterologist excludes possible implications of endoscopic findings ( small hiatal hernia, reflux, gastritis) in your symptoms, the most probable diagnosis would remain a costochondritis. This is inflammation of the ribs and sternum joint. I recommend performing a complete blood count and inflammation tests (fibrinogen, sedimentation rate, PCR) besides a physical examination. This disorder usually recovers spontaneously. But painkillers are helpful , due to their anti inflammatory effect. Regarding your stomach problem, I would recommend trying suppository of indomethacione, diclofenac or ibuprofen, which avoid gastritis exacerbation.

In some studies, Candesartan treatment has been associated to coordination problems and gait difficulty (called ataxia).Neither simvastatin, nor metoprolol have any similar side effects. I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination and perform some lab tests : - a complete blood count- thyroid hormone levels- fasting glucose - kidney and liver function tests- blood electrolytes- Vitamin B12 plasma levels, to exclude other metabolic disorders related to this symptomatology. I would also recommend performing a nerve conduction study to rule in/out possible peripheral neuropathy. A brain CT scan may be needed if suspicions for a cerebellar disorder are raised during physical examination. If all the above tests result normal, I recommend consulting with your cardiologist to consider the possibility to switch into another ARB, different from candesartan.

She has been having these spells that started at the begining of summer at first she would get hot and her heart rate wold go up to around 130-160 resting. Now she also has shortness of breath and one she had the other day her legs were twitching. Her blood pressure and stuff is normal and her heart rate only stays elevated for 5 minutes from 130-160 resting for 5 minutes or so. She also gets very dizzy and lightheaded, once she has these all she wants to do is sleep. Do you have any idea what may be wrong. We have seen a cardiolgigst and they ran all kinds of stuff EKG s echocardiogram she was on a event monitor for 30 days and they ruled out her heart and told her she would have to deal with it since her heart rate didnt go over 170 resting. Please HELP. I don t know what to do and since we have been to the doctor so much lately I don y have an extra 15.00 to pay. But I really need an answer, I d like to know what s going on with my daughter. If I pay th 15 thats less food I get to buy this month. Could you please email me at YYYY@YYYY I know you proably can t but if you could email me and point me in the right direction even if you don t give an answer. Also my brother, her uncle, has stills diease if you know what that is and if its helpful at all,","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I read your question carefully and understand your concern. I agree with her doctor in the fact that based on her cardiac tests, we can exclude a cardiac disorder related to this symptomatology. I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful physical examination and a prolonged EEG, coupled with ECG. These symptoms may be related to epilepsy seizures. You should know that epilepsy seizures are commonly related to tachycardia. The twitching in her legs may be another sign of the seizures. Even the fact that she feels tired and wants to sleep after these episodes is another argument in favor of seizures. Further lab tests (complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, thyroid hormones, calcium plasma levels, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose,inflammation tests, etc.) may be necessary to exclude metabolic and inflammatory disorders that may cause a similar clinical scenario.

The fact that you are taking Potassium supplements with these two drugs, can cause high levels of potassium leading to different symptoms. From the other hand lamotrigine can increase the side effects of paxil, leading to serotoninergic syndrome (causing uncontrolled high blood pressure, flushing, mental changes, etc). Regarding the gum damage, it may be relate to lamotrigine intake. I recommend consulting with your doctor on the possibility of making some changes to your therapy, taking into considerations these potential interactions and your medical condition (you may need to switch into another anti-epileptic drug other than lamotrigine and lower Benicar dose) I also advise to perform some lab tests (blood electrolytes, complete blood count) to avoid high blood levels of potassium.

Regarding your concern, I would explain that losartan and nebivolol both increase potassium levels in the blood.I recommend performing blood electrolytes levels, to monitor potassium levels and avoid any abnormal increase, which may lead to bradycardia. The decrease in your weight is another factor contributing in lowering your blood pressure. This is a good way to control your blood pressure. If your blood pressure gets lower, I recommend consulting with your doctor to consider the possibility of lowering bystolic dose (which also contributes in a low heart rate).

I would explain that the total cholesterol plasma level is a weak indicator of cardio-vascular risk. It is more important to perform Total cholesterol/ HDL cholesterol ratio in order to calculate your cardio-vascular risk. I recommend consulting with your GP on the above issues and consider the possibility of starting a statine or just continuing with a diet modification : - avoid chocolate - take a lot of soya food and nuts- take a lot of omega 3 and olive oil, including salmon fish- use a lot of carrots in your diet- Green tea and matcha tea- Flaxseed and Hemp Seeds etc. Hope to have been of help!Best wishes, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I've recently (over the last week or so) began experiencing heart palpitations. My initial doctor visit resulted in all normal test results (EKG, BP, thyroid) and I'm currently waiting to have a Holter monitor fitted.

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would like to explain that acetaminophen and ibuprofen are just painkillers with an antiinflammatory effect. They have no effect on cardiac arrhythmia and palpitation. I recommend to closely monitor your heart rate and your blood pressure. If you feel chest pain and your chest pain is modulated by respiratory movements or body movements, your symptoms may be related to musculo-skeletal pain. In such a case ibuprofen and acetaminophen would help to relieve your discomfort. If you have tachycardia or ectopic heart beats, you should go to the ER for a resting ECG and a careful physical examination. In that case acetaminophen or ibuprofen wouldn't help. I strongly recommend performing a 24 hour ambulatory ECG monitoring to exclude possible arrhythmia.

You should know that during physical exercise the levels of catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) raise in your blood, leading to tachycardia and even ectopic heart beats. These levels fluctuate during physical exercise (the balance between the production and metabolisation) , leading to modifications of the heart rate.
