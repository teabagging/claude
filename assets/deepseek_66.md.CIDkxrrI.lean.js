Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, If you have had a series of tests already which have failed to show any definite pathology in the stomach or related organs and you have been examined by a doctor who wishes to perform an endoscopy then. By all means have that particular test completed before anything else. However, if this is also unable to demonstrate any pathology then, I believe you may wish to consider that anxiety and stress may be to blame for the symptoms. Abdominal pain, bloating, gassy feelings can be brought about by such psychological pressures and it may be worthwhile speaking to someone on how to perform relaxation exercises and on how to use breathing techniques to feel more comfortable both physically and mentally. You may wish to become part of a gym and get into a workout routine as well as this can also divert painful vague symptoms away from the referred area and improve your ability to relax once you've exerted yourself a bit.

I went to the clinic and found out it was due to tension reflected from my job in the office and bad posture. I have been maintaining my posture and with workspace assessments I have been slightly relieved from these tension headaches. Often I do get them back strong my head with a very hot tempurature. The swelling is what concerns me because 5 months ago I landed on my ribs from a 2nd story balcony. Just under my left armpit. It put pressure on my ribs where it connects in the middle. I have been to emergency room for chest pains associated with my headache. Everyday aches and pains in my neck and shoulders some tingling in my face and a crunching sound when I turn my head. Difficulty breathing some feelings of vomiting recently. Is this all anxiety? That is the answer I got from the emergency room. The Doctors somewhat laughed at my situation. Felt a little betrayed by the healthcare system. There s nothing wrong with my bones it s an issue with my tissue. Is this seriously all just anxiety?","Doctor":"Hello, Your symptoms could be related to anxiety.

Today last night I had gotten a little talkative with my son and his friend. I went to my room and started cleaning up and I have some things happen back far in the past that for the last two years I would once a month and sometimes a few days and sometimes a little longer except in the beginning. I have done all the research that would put a organization on blast to the world. I go in to hyper focus most of the episodes and others I get memory after memory that I see a lot clearer today than when it happened. So I want to use the one time of what I thought was so scary kinda because it was everything I would say and something I wanted to do with most of the really intelligent way I was saying these findings or whatever I would at the end of this statement or finding something was a whole different because I never got to finish because I went completely blank and could not remember what I was even talking about. I just looked at something while I was thinking and remembering things I would go blank. I said at least thirty times throughout this going on with me. I think it was around 1:30am and I didn t notice when or why it just stopped but 5:34am is the only thing I remember from that time this morning until I went down and ate something and I came and this was on my iPad when I opened it and I remember what happened to me and how worried I got. I said earlier about the example for maybe you will see the degree of how fast I would forget what I wanted to say or do. I got a number I needed to hurry up and right down so I didn t forget because I all of the sudden had it pop in my mind. I picked up a index card and pen and before I even got it half way off the dresser I said I completely forget the number like it was never even thinking about writing down at all. That happened again a few hours later. I jumped from something I was thinking, to a complete different thought or subject as if the first thing I was thinking never existed. So, I don t know if you hear how much this was a concern because of the complete loss of any thing I just had been saying to myself and then I was completely lost and could not remember what I was even thinking to get to the end of all the thoughts or numbers and whatever I was doing, I could have been almost to the end of a well known story and before I got to the end to finish the story it was a complete mystery to me what I was even thinking about. Hopefully my very long and sorry for that, explanation of what was happening will give you a good idea of what I was going through. I thank you for your time and your opinion on what you think or say about this.","Doctor":"Hello, First of all, you should measure your blood pressure, and if it were high you should receive a medical treatment, take Aspirin twice per day after meals and do an ECG and an ECHO on your heart, besides decreasing salt and fat intake every day. If you are a woman and you take oral contraceptive pills or hormonal replacement therapy, you should ask a gynecologist for help. Second, you should take vitamin B complex once per day after meals and Benfotiamine 40 mg twice per day after meals. Vitamins B complex are essential for memory.

She, unfortunately, she has been given a TERMINAL prognosis of these tumors which are obviously no longer surgically amenable and sound as if they are growing rapidly. I believe an important question the patient will want to ask the doctor is how much additional time do they think she can extend things by going on chemotherapy.

If your doctor has advised against driving then, I believe it is a very reasonable request and you should certainly follow that advice.  As far as not doing \\"any\\" physical activities. I would talk to the physician again because I don't restrict my patients from ALL activities.

The type of perceptual delay of tactile stimulation really has no organic basis in terms of neurotransmitters, neuronal circuit abnormalities, or cortical pathology that could reasonably explain such a \\"trapping\\" if you will of sensory signals and only transmit them at some point in the future. Nevertheless, I would do a basic chemistry workup on you to also include things such as Vitamin B12, D, B1, B2, and folate.  I might also check thyroid function studies such as TSH and FT4. If these come back normal then, your symptoms are more likely than not related to anxiousness, stress, or variable severity of depression. Hope I have answered your query.

There are a variety of approaches to your pain but mostly they involve looking for medications or cocktails of different medications.

It s almost like I m fainting, but only the right side. For about a year now I ve felt like the right side of my face is pulling down. It s not a visible sign but it feels funny. I went to the doctor because I thought maybe I had a sinus infection, but they said no. Are these two things linked and do you know what is wrong?","Doctor":"Hello, Actually, your story is told by many others who describe \\"sinking brain\\" feeling. We believe this is a very special case of VERTIGO that somehow is generated due to aberrant electrical signals possibly arising from the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear which are then, processed by the part of the brain responsible to telling the person that they're in motion as well as the direction (up, down, side to side, etc.). My suggestion is that you speak to a neurologist (epileptologist most likely) and get tested with an MRI of the brain (with gadolinium) and an EEG (at least 2-3 since only 1 may not be sensitive enough to pick up abnormalities). There may be an underlying epileptic or epileptic-like syndrome that can be controlled with medication. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

For example atherosclerosis, smoking, drinking, endocrine disorders and kidney diseases can cause headache and leg numbness. Second, he should measure his blood pressure and if it were high, he should receive a medical treatment and stop eating too much fat and salt. Third, the women who take oral contraceptive pills or a hormonal replacement therapy can suffer from vascular problems, so they should ask a gynecologist to adjust the dose.

The doctors are now saying that her brain is not responding to her body..what are her chances of survival right now, and why is she having seizures? She has never been seizure prone..but is a diabetic.","Doctor":"Hello,That is a difficult question to answer without having more information. Typically a person does not just start having seizures without a reason, especially later in life without a history of having seizures. It would suggest that something happened during surgery such as lack of oxygen to the brain and stroke. I'm not exactly sure what the doctors mean when they say that her \\"brain is not responding to her body\\", but typically just two grand mal seizures should not cause any significant problems in the brain, unless she was having what are known as \\"sub-clinical seizures\\" in which she was still having seizures but was not having any externally observable movements - if that continues for a prolonged period it can begin cause damage.The answer really depends on whether there has been brain damage, and how extensive it is. Two seizures in and of themselves does not. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

But the one complication that I don t think my Mom or my Dad have really told their doctors is as serious as it is is his chronic constipation. He went for his annual physical in Dec. and had lost another 16 lbs....this makes a 30 lb weight loss in 2 years. My mom has to give him enemas usually twice a month. Recently, he had an actue episode that has now led to hernia surgery next week. I went to the doctors with them and was floored to learn that his primary doctor really did not understand how chronic the constipation has been. My dad had not been taking milk of magnesia until he thought he was in trouble and he was not taking a stool softener at all. We got him through the last constipation episode but now just learned that he has not had a bm in 3 days. He is not eating well or much these days either. So, was wondering if we are in some sort of late stages of this disease and now what are the signs we need to be looking for to tell us when my mom really can no longer be his care taker (by the way, she has COPD and has had acute issues herself this year...they just diagnosed her with an IgG deficiency that we are now starting to deal with).

The pain lasted for about 30 secs. My wife helped me to sit-up, but then I had two more bouts of severe stabbing pain in my back. The shaking was severe and lasted for about 10 mins.

However, passing out spontaneously for the past year absolutely deserves testing and indepth medical analysis. I would recommend speaking with your parents and asking them to take you to a doctor for a good examination initial testing to understand why this is happening. Probably not nearly as overwhelming and then, at least someone will have had a chance to speak with you and listen to your heart, lungs, etc. in order to recommend next steps.

When I got pregnant with my daughter two years ago I started to have severe dizzy spells that were followed by vomitting. This not only lasted thru my first pregnancy but I had experienced this for over 2 years in between pregnancies. I had brought it up many times to my doctors and was ignored because they didn t see an issue. I call these episodes dizzy spells because that s the only thing I can compare it to... It is more of a physical feeling that starts in my stomach and works its way up to my head. It has always been random, sometimes multiple times a day and other are months apart. The feeling is so intense but only lasts a few minutes and is usually ending with vomitting. In between pregnancies it seemed like when this would happen I would stay seated and really still with my eyes closed and it would help stop the vomitting from happening. I ve done my research and understand most of the causes but I ve seen midwives, my Pcp, my obgyn and multiple other doctors with no luck for answers. Is there anything I should be worried about or does this seem to resemble anything medical? I d just like some sort of answer so I know whether I should be worried.","Doctor":"Hello, To me, your actual dizzy spells are related to pregnancy. That's normal. Now, if you'll experience again when not pregnant, then this is to get further investigated: - do monitor your blood pressure and record the results for reference especially when you have the spells - do monitor your blood sugar levels to rule out hypoglycemia - have your meals regularly - check blood count to rule out anemia If nothing, then thyroid to check together with upper endoscopy for possible stomach problems. However these are to get tested after giving birth if dizzy spells will continue. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Bacterial infections severe enough to cause coma are generally fatal by that point even with the best care. Likewise infection with amoeba are usually fatal by the point of brain edema.

On Dec. 20th & Jan. 3rd I had cataract surgery. First the left eye, then the right eye. In the last few weeks I have had a return of my trigeminal neuralgia. It had been under control with 800mg of carbatrol. It is particularly severe on the right lower side of my face. I increased my dosage of carbatrol to 1200mg 2 days ago with no result as yet. I have been prescribed Percocet which I will start tomorrow morning. My question is did the surgery adversely effect the trigeminal neuralgia?","Doctor":"Hello, It is really not possible to give you a firm answer to that question since there are literally numerous things that can trigger exacerbations of trigeminal neuralgia which has been under control and surgical manipulations of any part of the face or structures of the face are definitely recognized as possible causes. But so is anesthesia, other medications that could have been given to you for pain management or control or inflammation. And so, knowing for sure if surgery caused or led to loss of control is not possible to say with any certainty in my opinion. Your best bet is to speak with your neurologist and once again begin the search for a medication to help. Over the past 15 years there have been developments of many newer (and sometimes better) medications to control neuropathic or neuralgic types of pain so this could be a good time to try something a bit more updated than carbatrol.

When I press on my lower spine it is very tender and sore to the touch. I have had (3) cervical fusions in the last 4 years on wonder if this could be related to my medical history with my surgeries. I know this isn t a normal feeling of pain and worry this could be serious?","Doctor":"Hello, I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that the pain represents anything SERIOUS based on the little information you've provided but the fact you've had several cervical fusions could mean you are prone to developing more than average osteoarthritic degenerative problems which would explain the back pain.  However, going for an evaluation with a doctor is always the best first step in solving such problems. It will likely be necessary to get an imaging study of the back but it is also very likely (based on probability) that your pain in the back and legs can be adequately managed using conservative means at this time such as PHYSICAL THERAPY, AQUATHERAPY, and APPROPRIATE MEDICATIONS.

Since you didn't say anything about nausea or vomiting I'm assuming that's not an issue and that is good news. However, if she is unable to stand or move due to the dizziness and she continues to have these symptoms even when lying down then, I think it best she be seen by a doctor in an Emergency Room. Make sure you give her plenty of fluids to drink if she is not able to easily get up, call her doctor and then, follow their instructions.

No particular medication does better than any other except for BOTOX which improves symptoms of dystonia in about 70% of patients properly injected. Homeopathic treatment is unlikely to help with this problem. Unfortunately CURABLE is not the right term to use for this condition since we don't fully understand what causes it in the first place but it is something that can be managed.

The phlebotomist/nurse, (not sure of title) applied the tourniquet and then proceeded with filling out paperwork. I d say it was atleast five minutes before she attempted to draw blood. Normally, when you are having blood drawn, you feel the prick of the needle. Well, I didn t because my arm was numb at that point. She says that the vein rolled and she was having trouble finding it, as she is moving the syringe around in my arm. As with the initial prick, most folks would feel pain. I know that in the past, it has hurt pretty badly to have this done. But, guess what, I didn t feel it due to numbness. Now, once the tourniquet was removed, I felt immediate pain. I knew that she did not follow the correct procedure, but I figured the pain would subside within a few days, a week at most. As time went on, the pain (along with numbness and tingling) radiated through my arm and became quite unbearable at times. The pain extended from the draw site (left arm; outside edge of the bend at elbow) down the top side of my arm and into my wrist, top of my hand and into my fingers at times. At one point, maybe three weeks after, the pain moved into my bicep and into my shoulder. Well, it has been just over three months since I had the bloodwork done and I am still in pain! I do not have much strength in my arm and if I attempt to use it (pick something up, push or pull something) the pain is so bad that I have to stop or drop what I m doing. Even picking up my cup of coffee is painful! I can not even straighten the arm without cringing in pain. I have tried using analgesic pain creams, massaging the area and applying heat, as well as ice. Nothing seemed to help. I even tried wearing a wrist brace, thinking maybe my carpal tunnel was acting up. That seemed to only make it worse. Mid November, I finally came to the realization that something was wrong. Really wrong. My doctor sent me to a neurologist to have a nerve test done. It came back normal. My doctor sent me to have an MRI of my neck done (just to see if maybe the pain stemmed from there). It, too, came back normal. I now have an appointment scheduled with an orthopedic specialist to see if they can determine what the problem is. All I know is that the everyday pain is aweful and not having the full use of my arm is quite irritating.

You've not really said much about how you are currently doing but my guess is that things are stable. After 7 years from a stroke the paralyzed portions of the body will have reached a stable point of recovery. Medication wise, it would appear that your doctor is covering you for the correct and adequate items that could cause problems in the future such as cholesterol and it also appears he is giving you some type of supplementation for good health of the brain tissue itself. I might recommend your doctor look into your B12 and Vitamin D levels in the bloodstream. Those 2 things are very important to good nerve health following a stroke. I would talk to the doctor about doing blood work and looking for B12 levels that are no less than 450 and D levels that are 60-80. Otherwise, the balance of your medication list appears to be quite reasonable and I'd suggest it continue. You may also benefit from some form of personal REHABILITATION EXERCISE therapy depending on how paralyzed the right side may be and if your speech and language have been affected you may be able to benefit from speech therapy as well if you never had any in 2012.

If the doctors are hopeful that they are able to support her until she is \\"ready to come out of it....\\" well, that is certainly good news, isn't it? The other thing (not medication related) that can have a definite POSITIVE IMPACT on her recovery is if people from the family and friends to to visit with her, talk to her, read to her, tell her about current events that are going on, stroke her hands, arms, forehead, cheeks.  These types of sensory inputs will travel to parts of the brain that can then, send relay electrical messages to the central WAKING UP center of the brain which is located in the brain stem but ultimately stimulates a structure called the thalamus which then, causes generalized CORTICAL STIMULATION.

A normal number is usually between 40-60 whereas yours is about 140 (i.e. 180-40). That's extremely high and could be caused by several things such as iron deficiency, aortic stiffness or atherosclerosis, or HYPERTHRYOIDISM. Your 2nd mentioned blood pressure of 200/90 also demonstrates a very high or wide pulse pressure of 110 (i.e. 200-90). Any one of the above mentioned problems which can cause these types of blood pressures could lead to stroke or ischemic brain disease which is likely what your doctors are referring to as \\"central facial palsy\\" which has its origins typically in the brainstem.

The normal value of the ejection fraction is 52-70. When the effectiveness of the heart muscle decreases, the autonomic nervous system compensates this deficiency by increasing the heart rate.

MS cannot be diagnosed based on your symptoms. More history, age of the patient, neurological examination are necessary for that type of diagnosis. Mild microvascular ischemia can be seen in people who have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, heart disease, and other things. 20% of normal subjects also have MRI's that show microvascular ischemia as well so its presence is not necessarily a bad diagnostic or prognostic factor. \\"Increasing\\" gliosis doesn't really make sense to me unless they have serial images of you AFTER the stroke of 2010.

I went to ER, they said it was normal, nothing to worry about just some inflammation. They said to call my surgeon today and maybe they would try to get me in, well I didn t call. Tonight, not as sore but still as big as golf ball at the incision site. They seem not to care, so I have just resolved its the way it is?","Doctor":"Hello, Postsurgical swelling can occur.  The importance of the review by the ER doctors is that they likely determined that it was neither an important bleed nor infection. It sounds benign.  Everything else goes away on its own and the assurance of that is the fact that the area is not as sore as 24 hrs. ago. If it starts to get red, warm to the touch, pus developing or oozing, or clearly painful to the touch or light compression then, something is not right and it will need to be looked at.

She isn t overwt, doesn t drink or have any other diagnosis. Her cholesterol has always been WNL s. She was to her primary care provider because of headaches for the last 2 months.","Doctor":"Hello, Microvascular ischemia is a radiographic finding that shows as very small \\"dots\\" or \\"spots\\" on the image of a brain scan which is usually an MRI. Such a condition is NOT UNCOMMONLY seen in normal subjects without any history of medical problems or complaints just based on normal aging (20-35% in HEALTHY SUBJECTS). It represents the aggregate result of microscopic blood vessel deterioration causing the tiniest amounts of deprivation of oxygenated blood to brain tissue. This is generally NOT A PROBLEM and is not likely to lead to what most people understand as SERIOUS STROKE unless being caused by things which can lead to strokes if not truly controlled such as HYPERTENSION, DIABETES, SMOKING, etc. There are multiple associated conditions with this entity (aside from what I just mentioned) such as high cholesterol, aging, atherosclerosis, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and the list goes on and on. There is no definitive treatment.  Neurologists tend not to get terribly excited when this read is made since treatment is generally directed at RISK FACTOR CONTROL or the condition is SEVERE in its amount of brain territory covered (which the radiologist will usually say in the report). I try not to prescribe anything for the most part since there are risks to taking things such as aspirin, Plavix, or Aggrenox (the most commonly used agents) and again, if the person is otherwise healthy and the finding was incidental I simply educate the patient as to what it means and how best to control associated risks as those listed above.

Are all theses symptoms related? havent done HLA before. ANA negative, ESR and CRP raised. IS this present controlled situation temporary? sued to tak SAAZ, but now not under any drugs. Is this risk?? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, It is very unlikely that the breathing difficulties, pulse rate, and frequent vertigo that have developed have any DIRECT relationship to your spondyloarthropathy. What could be happening is that your low back pain is causing your pulse rate to elevate during those painful periods of time? This can make respirations rapid and shallow which you notice as difficulty breathing.  Vertigo could then, come about as a result of hyperventilation leading to dizziness. If the symptoms are NOT related to actual bouts of pain in the back then, it may be from anxiety generated by the condition or some other situation(s) that could be going on in your life. You will need to talk to your doctor about these symptoms to see which theory seems most plausible in order to develop a treatment plan. Hope I have answered your query.

Im lost on what this could be and need help","Doctor":"Hello, If this condition has been present and progressing for several years very slowly and nothing else going on then, it is probably a benign process but the only to know for sure is to see a doctor who can palpate and examine the lesions and ultimately send you for an appropriate imaging study to define them more precisely. They could be calcified NODULES or fatty tumors called LIPOMAS.  If they are particularly painful or cause burning/shocklike sensations when moved or compressed they could be NEUROMAS (less likely than the other 2 possibilities). Another possibility is that you may be suffering from the beginning phases of a SCOLIOSIS to the left.  An X-ray will easily define that entity without much difficulty.

Your doctor may be able to actually such therapy for you that insurance should cover but I will give you an exercise that you may do ON YOUR OWN without even taking formal therapy and it is, in general, an AMAZING exercise for the vast majority of my back pain patients such as yourself. It is called WATER JOGGING and no simpler exercise exists in the pool for back pain. Simply find a pool (public or private) with water that is approximately waist high or even a slight bit above and start JOGGING IN PLACE for segments of 5-10 seconds each with rest periods as necessary. Depending upon your stamina and specific situation with respect to other medical problems. I recommend doing at least 5 min. of this type of exercise daily for 1 week then, slowly increasing the # minutes week by week until you are capable of sustaining 10-15 minutes of water jogging every other day with 1 day of the week as your OFF day. You can combine land based exercises along with this recommendation. However, keep this exercise going for a minimum of 3-4 weeks before either increasing the total overall duration of the exercise of going from 5-10 second intervals out to 15-20 seconds with rests of at least 2 minutes in between sets. This is such a great exercise to do because it allows a full range of motion with very little interference from gravity which means the RANGE OF MOTION of the hip and leg joints is much fuller and causes much less pain than by doing the same exercise on land. It's remarkable how my patients tell them they feel after just 1-2 sessions of this exercise.  You will find it absolutely mind boggling! Hope I have answered your query.

It presents with loss of consciousness which is temporary and last for less than 1 minute and amnesia. Headache may happen in any head trauma even without concussion but if this is severe or associated with nausea, vomiting and dizziness then you need to visit ER and do head scan to rule out more serious injuries. It occurs post an impact to the head or after a type of whiplash injury that causes the head and brain to shake quickly back and forth. If the concussion is causing headaches, we recommend over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Also, you need to avoid lights, noise and smoky areas for several days. If there is no improvement you can see doctor but in most cases this is not required. Hope I have answered your query.

ALso mentioned was mild facet arthrosis from the L4-S1. What does this mean? I am 30 years old female. THanks.","Doctor":"Hello, The radiologist's interpretation is that your spine is showing some minimal initial signs of an osteoarthritic process. Nothing to worry about because actually, disc bulges can be found in up to 40% of MRI's of spines for which NO COMPLAINTS at all are present. I'm assuming you got this scan because you have some back pain.  Disc bulges can possibly contribute to pain symptoms but it depends on what those symptoms are and what the neurological exam shows. DESSICATION simply refers to a \\"drying out effect\\" which will happen as you get into your 30's, 40's and beyond. So again, normal process of aging on the spinal column and its components. Facet arthrosis is another way of saying that you have a little \\"wear and tear\\" on the connections between the vertebral bodies of L4, L5, and S1. Again, mildly arthritic types of changes.  This MRI does not demonstrate anything to worry about. With this type of picture I would likely recommend back exercises to strengthen muscle columns, encourage stretching movements (yoga, ROMWOD's, static stretching), and I wouldn't take anything more than an OCCASIONAL Tylenol for pain after a workout or other physical labor if the back is hurting.

Z-packs are felt to be overused these days for simple infections and are recommended not to be prescribed for simple infections.

She returned to the ER on Saturday with severe neck pain - unable to move up/down or left/right. After IV pain meds, she was told that possible fluid leaked from puncture. Today (Monday) she is still in much neck pain and is now experiencing pain in her arms. Do I take her back to the ER for a third time? The pain meds she is taking is not helping with the pain. Are these symptoms normal post lumbar puncture? Thank you very much.","Doctor":"Hello, Yes, fluid leaks after LP's are not uncommon and as a result, acute pains as you describe can occur although typically they are localized to the LOW BACK (so long as that is where she received the tap). If on the other hand, she is running any type of FEVER (>100 degrees F), experiencing stiffness in the neck where no pain or stiffness existed before, becoming sensitive to noise and light, or having headaches of a significant variety that are different from the ones you normally see, then, I believe a visit to the ER is definitely warranted. If she doesn't have the signs of a bacterial or meningitic infection with normal temperature, heart rate, BP, and so forth then, put a call in to her doctor who did the puncture and get advice. Also, she should HYDRATE, HYDRATE, HYDRATE, reduce up and about activity for the time being and you should take a look at the area where she had the LP performed if it looks unusually swollen, red, feels hot, or EXQUISITELY TENDER.  If any of those are true then, BACK to the ER. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Is it DEFINITELY and beyond a shadow of a doubt the GENERATOR of your seizures? There are ways to determine this with virtual precision and accuracy.  Are there ANY OTHER focal generators for your seizures (perhaps not even able to be SEEN by MRI or CT scan?)? If in fact, there is a single solitary focus or generator to your seizures THEN, yes the focus can theoretically be removed surgically.  However, that depends on a number of factors.  Typically EPILEPSY SURGEONS will not agree to operate on someone UNLESS their seizures cannot be controlled using medication. If you are under very good or near-perfect control. Then, surgery probably represents more RISK than benefit in terms of excising the lesion and if I were your neurologist I would NOT recommend surgery at this point. If, however, your seizures are uncontrolled and there has been a success at using multiple and varied medications and/or other approaches to bring them under control then, YES surgery is indicated and should be reasonably considered.

You must speak to the doctor about the REASON he is having such problems. Sometimes it is possible to retire the medications if he has been seizure-free for a period of at least 2-3 years. It doesn't sound like this is happening.  Stopping the fits means your doctor should be able to tell you EITHER the underlying cause to his episodes OR the doctor needs to find another combination or another DOSING regimen of medications that can control his episodes. Also, you can help your husband by making sure he is well HYDRATED at all times, DOESN'T skip meals, TAKES his medications as ordered by the doctor every time and ON TIME.

He will not remember anything happened during hospitalization and the period of coma, for sure. Anyway, if after stopping the drugs, he does not gain conscience, this means that he may have had irreversible changes (damages) to his brain.

The literature certainly does contain a number of citations and reports of individuals who have suffered from incidents such as spontaneous SUBARACHNOID bleeding or rupture of unburst aneurysms who have just completed flights. It is unclear though on any standard of practice.  The majority of the recommendations seem to point to a waiting period (without well tested or grounded data) of no less than 2-4 weeks in the case of someone who just HAD a bleed in order to fly vs. up to 6 weeks of waiting in someone's who had a craniotomy to evacuate a blood clot who wants to fly. If it were my patient I would likely ask them to wait 4 weeks if possible to fly AFTER a bleed. 8 weeks after a surgical procedure to evacuate any blood from the head. As far as the risk of flying WITH UNRUPTURED aneurysms there are no agreed-upon numbers therefore, in my opinion whether someone KNOWS or DOESN'T KNOW they have an unruptured aneurysm in their head (or any other organ of the body) it doesn't alter the risk factor (if there is even one to actually talk about) element so to me there should logically be NO TIME CONSTRAINT on when a person could or should fly after finding out they have aneurysms which are inoperable, etc. That needs to be more an individual's feeling of comfort zone action as opposed to a doctor trying to counsel them according to scientific evidence that it is or isn't safe because there's nothing along those lines.

It s really strange, painful and uncomfortable. It only started with the tonsilitis, but is it related and what is it?!","Doctor":"Hello, If this shooting pain to your spine only began when your tonsils became inflamed and swollen then, it is possible that the shooting pains are as a result of painful swallowing actions that cause pain to radiate because of tonsillitis. Drink lots and lots of WATER, stay away from caffeinated beverages, stay away from ICE COLD drinks or foods for now (don't know if that's just a wives' tale but I think it makes sense), and take your medication you've been prescribed and you should be making headway in just a few days.

Now I am confused whether he is suffering from epilepsy or fabryle convulsion. Please enlighten me , because whenever he has a tendendency for convulsion his body temerature rises after 1/2 hours the tendency of convulsion","Doctor":"Hello, In FEBRILE seizures children tend to run a fever which is typically defined as >100.4 F (>38 C) in the absence of an infection of the CETNRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (brain/spinal cord/meninges). There could have an infection elsewhere but just not of the nervous system to be considered a febrile convulsive episode. Sometimes NO FEVER is detected PRIOR to the seizure but then, it shows up afterward within 15-30 min. These episodes are typically seen in infants with an average age up to about 2 years old. They can be seen in children up to 6 years by definition but at this point they should be getting less and less as time goes on. I recommend you speak to your doctor about the medication issue since the most current information DOES NOTsupport the use of DAILY ANTI-EPILEPTIC MEDICATION (e.g. Valparin) unless the febrile episodes are prolonged (>5 minutes) or children live in remote areas with poor access to healthcare facilities. Children can be given rectal suppositories of diazepam to stop febrile seizures if the episode or convulsion is lasting LONGER THAN 5 minutes.  But nothing need be given in the majority of cases of true febrile seizures if the diagnosis is not epilepsy. Check with your doctor and get them to give you a fair explanation as to the child's actual diagnosis and rationale for the medication if indeed they are making the definitive call of FEBRILE SEIZURE DISORDER.

Once that's done and I'm convinced the patient is free and clear of any physical cause and once I know that epilepsy does not run in a blood relative I feel comfortable recommending the patient go on medication for at least 2 years after which we can withdraw the medication and see how they do. If seizures return then, I would once again perform a thorough evaluation to once again try and find something we may have missed the first time but the patient would be returned to medication and again placed on for another minimum of 2-3 years. I might at this point also send the patient for genetic consultation to see what might be considered since there could be a known mutation you could be carrying that causes this in which case we then, know you must remain on medication for life. If not then, again, at the end of the 2nd 2-3 year period and with proper physician supervision and vigilance to often include EEG testing after medication withdrawal along with symptom monitoring using a seizure diary the patient could be removed.

He only eats once a day and its a very small amount he gets full fast so I can t see how his belly got so big???","Doctor":"Hello, This enlarged belly seems to be something quite new and abnormal in terms of USUAL body shape and size.  It sounds like he is producing an awful lot of gas resulting in ABDOMINAL DISTENTION. One reason could be the presence of H.Pylori which is a common infection in the stomach and is easily tested for and treated with certain antibiotics. The elevated neutrophil count may be signaling some type of infection.  The elevated ALP (alkaline phosphatase) levels could indicate some type of liver or gall bladder issue and this could also account for the increased amount of gas being produced in the GI tract. If he has diarrhea and vomits daily and doesn't eat very well then, my concern is for dehydration that can set in quickly. If the doctor's office is not willing to some how get an appointment for him then, I would recommend 2 choices. An URGENT CARE CENTER which may be able to at least make sure he's well hydrated and stays that way until the doctor's appointment OR ER where again they can make a decision whether he needs some immediate treatment with antibiotics, IV's, or some other diagnostic testing to tell what's going on with the liver and gall bladder to start with.

I have been to a neurologist for my migraines who did an MRI w/o contrast. It did not show anything so she referred me to a headache specialist at Emory University. He treeated me unsuccessfully for my migraines. Last week, I made an appt. with my eye doctor due to a veil that has been interferring with my vision. I have had three episodes of complete vision loss over the past 12 months. She observed that my optic nerve was enlarged (inflamed?). Since I had not had an MRI with contrast, she ordered one with and without. The MRI showed periventricular white matter lesions. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 2006.

I developed seizures. The symptoms are pressure in chest, weakness of left arm, sensations in head, fatigue, heart racing and ofcourse panic/fear. Had like 10-15 of them since the summer, 4 of them were severe. First one happened when I was running (Shortened sight, heart racing, high blood pressure with extreme pressure in chest, started with a sensation in the left arm, was hospitalized and the Doc said it was panic attack, EKG ok) after that I had 7 days head pressure in the back of my head with spaced out feeling like I was not there, without pain. The head pressure returned after a month and it lasted longer, then went away and again came back etc. Since december I have developed a new symptom, now I have pressure on just one spot in the head without spaced out feeling, its like a small spot on the left side of the back of my head few cm from the left ear, it s a feeling like someone grabbed the spot and is not letting go. I have seizures now and there with the same symptoms but less severe, they usually pass and my body is very fatigued after them.

It is important to always discuss possible effects of medications with the doctor who is prescribing to make sure they don't think something else could be happening.

Potassium is not going to be an issue.  Certainly, hydrating yourself is never really a BAD thing (as long as not taken to extremes) but rarely does that alone or the eating of bananas or the other folklore about Gatorade, etc. ever really work.  These kinds of pains can come in people not suffering from any imbalances metabolically in anything.  As I said, if calcium or potassium were a problem to the extent that the calf muscle suddenly had a spasmodic pain radiating to the knee then, the expectation would be many more muscles would be involved.  This sounds to be musculoskeletal, circulatory, or something unknowingly post-traumatic in terms of either a blunt or a stretch injury of a tendon, ligament, or muscle belly tear which can occur in folks with very severe OSTEOARTHRITIS- not so sure that your FM is playing a role due to the location. Send more questions to www.bit.ly/drdariushsaghafi and I'll be happy to answer. At any rate, have your primary doctor do a good physical examination on you, correct any metabolic issues they may find, and then, consider stretching or physical therapy types of focused activities for that particular leg and see where that takes you.

If you would like to know more about how these headaches come about and such write me to www.bit.ly/drdariushsaghafi otherwise, even though no CT scan of the head was obtained I believe at this point your best bet is to get him baseline tested and seen by a NEUROLOGIST (one has either an interest or experience with TBI patients (traumatic brain injury).  There are many other LONG TERM issues that can come about and should be watched for in terms of his school, academics, behaviors, potential development of psychiatric aberrations, etc.  But first is the need for a good baseline assessment and also to make sure he is following an approved CONCUSSION PROTOCOL which virtually all public schools and colleges are following nowadays when it comes to these kinds of injuries.  He needs to be taking regularly scheduled testing that will give doctors a better idea of when he is ready to go back to play than just waiting a week or 2 or asking how he feels, etc.  There are more objective measurements that are looked at these days for sports related concussions."},{"Patient":"i was in a car accident two years ago recently in the past 6 months ive stated passin out, memory loss, throwing up but its only when im sleepin and i starting to read numbers one way and saying them in a total different order i never had these problems before hat could it be","Doctor":"Hi, Since the car accident was 2 years your symptoms would not be directly related to that incident. If you are exclusively having the symptoms of vomiting that wakes you up at night then, an examination is warranted though this could also be due to stress and anxiety as well if symptoms are only present nocturnally. As far as the problem of seeing numbers differently from saying them again, a neurological examination is not unreasonable but given your PERFECT GRAMMATICAL form of writing that is evident in this question I also think this could be a symptom secondary to stress and anxiety since problems involving numbers but NOT letters/words would be less likely to be an actual BRAIN problem.

I agree with your doctor that your symptoms could be related to a pinched nerve or a bulging disc in the cervical vertebral column.

The pain is not too much but creates difficulty.So, as consulted from an M.D, I got an X-RAY done. The report says LOSS OF LORDOSIS. What exercises or consultations should I take.....?","Doctor":"Hi, The X-ray report states that there is a LOSS of NORMAL curvature of the spine. Typically, there are 4 curves to the spinal column in the human being. When a lordotic curve (or lordosis) is altered or \\"lost\\" in a person it is usually taken to mean that there is some kind of muscle spasms present in that region which is causing a STRAIGHTENING of the spinal column thus resulting in a LOSS of its curvature. Things to do would be to get an EVALUATION by a PHYSICAL REHABILITATION SPECIALIST OR EVEN a PHYSICAL THERAPIST.  Either one of those specialists should be able to come up with a series of stretches and exercises to help muscles to relax in the column and thereby release the pressure on the low back.

However, such claims are not necessarily evaluated for validity of any governmental regulatory or oversight agency such as the FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION or similar entity overseas so my guess is that for your father's case of CVA the prescribing physician is simply trying to order something for your father that may be of some nutritional utility but by no means is such a preparation considered the primary or preferred treatment strategy for a STROKE involving the MCA or ACA arterial distributions. For this type of stroke other approaches and measures should be undertaken to discover why someone as YOUNG as your father is having these types of strokes to begin with and if POSSIBLE treat this cause such as atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, or HYPERCOAGUABLE state due to an inflammatory or autoimmune type of disease.

Ubi q is an antioxidant whose biochemical properties allow it to support energy production chemical reactions within cells.  However, this is not in and of itself a way of stopping or reversing the chronic neuro-degenerative process.  We do not understand how or why this process begins in the first place.  It is not an unreasonable pharmaco agent to use but there is nothing any more specific either so I think you can continue using it. The major side effects of this medication are the following: Gastric discomfort loss of appetite diarrhea nausea skin rash, and heart burn If are not suffering from any of these side effects...or even if you are and the symptoms are mild or tolerable perhaps, it would be reasonable to ask your doctor whether or not you can INCREASE the dose. to see if more effect can be realized.

My recent MRV shows it completely effaces flow related signal and enhancement from a segment of the superior sagittal sinus. It measures a little greater than 3.5 cm in length. There is prominent bilateral cortical venous collateralization coursing posteriorly over the mass to converge with patent sinus at the vertex. There is no cortical venous hypertension. Major dural sinuses otherwise are widely patent. I have done a lot of research over the years and understand quite a bit but I would like an interpretation of what this means.","Doctor":"Hello, In the simplest terms, the interpretation of an MRV study as it relates to your meningioma is a way of trying to detect whether or not there is outflow obstruction to blood entering from the opposite (i.e. arterial) side of the mass. In your case the number of collateral veins (additional anatomical veins not usually present in people WITHOUT meningiomas) that have developed over time is sufficient and their pathways appear to properly drain into the STRAIGHT SINUS so there is no BACKUP or CONGESTION of bloodflow simply on the part of the meningioma. There is a REROUTING of venous blood in the area, however, of the mass lesion itself (and that's expected) which is what the \\"effacement of flow\\" means in the 3.5cm trajectory of the superior sagittal sinus (i.e. no significant blood flow is found in that part of the egress channel). In other words, your meningioma is trucking along peacefully without really disturbing the OUTFLOW or egress of the blood from its location such that oxygenation, nutrition, and metabolic waste can still be properly exchanged and executed as if it weren't there.

I know they are not good for you but I would like a sunbed once a week but am worried they might trigger my seizures off again.Could you please answer this question.Thank youCarole","Doctor":"Hello, Sunbeds have the POTENTIAL of triggering a seizure (especially in someone with known epilepsy. Even if well-controlled) due to 2 major things about the beds that patients may not realize or think about. 1. Sunbeds sometimes possess FLICKERING LIGHTS that flash on/off and give a strobe effect. This will trigger anyone with what we call PHOTIC DRIVING (sensitivity to flashing lights). This is rare but it can happen. 2.

Sounds like you're doing the right things. The cervical bulges/disk herniations are entirely unrelated to how the heart maintains its rhythm or speed.

CT scans are not terribly sensitive imaging studies to look at the posterior fossa of the brain. In other words, a CT scan is not a great way to evaluate structures in that region of the brain which is essentially the back portion of the head where the spinal cord attaches to the base of the brain and brainstem which is then, attached to the cerebellum. An MRI of the brain is much more sensitive to that area of the brain. 2. Secondly, the cystic area which is hypodense in that region is probably something on the order of an arachnoid cyst which is generally believed to be congenital anatomic variations that are benign and need no further treatment. Because of the fluid-filled cavity contained in such a cyst then, the cerebellum in that area may not actually be suffering from any true abnormalities and the description of hypoplasia (immature development) of the cerebellum may be an artefact as a result of the cystic area obscuring a portion of the cerebellum. All in all, I'd say that the scan is benign until proven otherwise (which means you gotta wait till the radiologist gives you an official reading or your doctor who sent you decides to call you and let you know results) and that in all likelihood the findings need no treatment and no worry.

Your writing, grammar, and syntax are all quite good from what I can see so my assessment of your language skills in that sense demonstrates there is really no evidence for a florid dementing type of illness. If I were your neurologist I would do a very thorough HISTORY of your condition followed by an examination to include some mental and memory screening tests such as a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Depending upon how you scored on that test (and my guess is that you would score fairly high) I would then, look at some biochemistry profiles to include thyroid testing, Vitamins B12, B1, B6, and D. I would also make sure your liver and kidney functions were good, check other routine blood chemistries, and perform a urinalysis...sometimes a very mild infection can cause memory or other cognitive issues. CT of the brain is not nearly as sensitive as MRI and depending upon your age some atrophy of the brain is expected so I don't see that as much of an issue at this point.

Should I just consult with my doctor to take one of those medications or do I possible need both of those?","Doctor":"Hello, I think that your description of how you feel with your medication is very good to carry with you to your next appointment with your doctor. I always like to encourage patients to speak frankly with their physicians about medicines they've been prescribed and to tell the doctor without fear or hesitation if something seems to be making a difference or not. He/she is the best one to determine your need for different doses, dosing schedules, or the inclusion of adjunct medications. It is especially important to realize that some of these medications used for depression and ADD can have dramatic effects on both the body and the mind if they are suddenly stopped, changed, or combined with other drugs unknowingly. Never stop or change a prescription you've been given without checking in with the prescriber. In this case, I highly recommend keeping track of how you feel in a daily diary and to also jot down if you took your medications or not that day (hopefully, you take your medications EVERY DAY!) AND very important. What time you took them AND also very important, did you take them with food, on an empty stomach, or in the company of other medications?

Sadly she died on 29th Nov 2010, aged just 43.Vikki had been very fit and active until she developed Pnuemonia, or so it seemed, but at the inquest it was revealed that she had an extremely rare horrible disease called Vagus Vasculitis. The Doctors had never come across it and said it is so rare, they are unlikely to come across it again in their life time. Do you have any more info on this disease please?","Doctor":"Hello, So sorry for the loss of your daughter in law.  I believe what you are referring to is a specific finding of NERVE FIBER DAMAGE to the Vagus nerve which was likely found at the level of the innervation of the diaphragm. More globally this sad case illustrates what we call CNS vasculitis and this is not frequently seen in practice but an autoimmune process begins attacking elements of the central nervous system such as cranial nerves (which the vagus nerve is one of 12 pair of such nerves), brain, and/or spinal cord. What happens is not well understood but swelling and inflammation of the blood vessels in the nervous system (in this the vagus nerve) cause damage to the point where the function is lost or altered. In your daughter-in-law's case the damage to the vagus nerve likely made her diaphragm compromised in being able to properly contract which would've eventually resulted in pneumonia since she couldn't get good solid breaths enough to move secretions from the lungs up and out the bonchi which then, became a focus for infection to set in. The following is a very nice link to the Vasculitis Foundation's website and specifically discusses CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM vasculitides which include the vagal invasion you talk about. They are an excellent group to consult and you may find more information and answers to questions regarding your daughter-in-law that can be of use to the family especially if there are children she's had who may be experiencing odd symptoms such as colds or allergies that don't seem to really go away or are not easily treated with standard medications/precautions. I've spoken at some of their local chapter meetings on CNS vasculitides and what we look for when someone comes to us with \\"oddball\\" sorts of symptoms in the context of a previously active and healthy person.  The devil is always in the details of such cases my dear.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Almost daily, he will randomly experience waves of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, and body aches. He vomits usually a few times per week and has gone to multiple doctors. They ve tested things like WBC count and looked at the possibilty of diabetes. Everything has come back normal. He works a lot, chews, and has a history of neurocardiogenic dysodinomia. The way he is always exhausted even after a week off work to rest and the fact that he throws up so often can t be entirely normal right? Any advice would be helpful as we have no clues right now!","Doctor":"Hello, Typically, the symptoms of cycles of nausea and vomiting suggest problems directly in the GI tract, HORMONES that may be cyclically abnormal, or a Central Nervous reaction to some metabolic or physical derangement. When I say hormones I'm not just talking about THYROID products.  In his case, I would be checking BLOOD SUGARS before and after meals and directly measuring for insulin levels which can be way too HIGH and cause these symptoms. There is something called POSTPRANDIAL HYPOTENSION which could be mistaken for some type of cardiogenic dysautonomia as well or at least make it difficult to tell them apart at times. I would also recommend provocative ADRENAL GLAND FUNCTION TESTING and look at catecholamine levels (biochemical products of hormones released from the gland) to see if we are creating some sort of adrenalin storm/rush that can also drive some of his symptoms or NOT ENOUGH which could explain the unusual amount of fatigue. As far as the GI tract is concerned has he had either an UPPER GI SERIES using barium to clear for things such as ulcerative conditions in the stomach or duodenum or even mass lesions (he chews which puts him at risk for cancers)? This doesn't look like IBS (Irritable bowel) but on the off chance that he could react in an allergic fashion to something he's ingesting. Has he changed his brand of chew recently? Eating some sort of different diet? Are these cycles at all tied to the period of time just before or shortly after meals? Has he tried removing things such as GLUTEN, ARTIFICIAL SUGARS, and FOODS/BEVERAGES containing large amounts of caffeine such as MONSTER or RED BULL? As far the nervous system is concerned, you've already mentioned a diagnosis of cardiogenic dysautonomia. How about something a bit more global to tie in the GI symptoms as well such as an autoimmune process that specifically targets the autonomic nervous system such as Sjogren's disease, lupus, or alcohol abuse? All of these can target and dramatically affect autonomic system function leading to cyclical vomiting spells. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Because the brain could create other nerve pathways to compensate for the lost ones. To help the brain creating other pathways You need to take daily some vitamins such as B complex, folic acid and vitamin B12. The exclusion of hypertension and diabetes is important in your case, besides modification of your diet by increasing fish and vegetable intake and decreasing saturated fat intake, because Omega 3 fatty acid and flaxseed oil may help the brain to build new pathways.

Can you give some light as to what happened?","Doctor":"Hi, Unfortunately, some complication either from her condition or from the surgery occurred. Your friend will need to speak with the surgeon to get more information but oftentimes, when surgeries are stopped abruptly either there was a complication with her cardiovascular system, unexpected bleeding that could not be controlled rapidly, or oftentimes the surgeon, may look at what is going on and decide that they simply cannot proceed or that it may not be worth the risk to proceed with the procedure. The complication of being in the coma may or may not be a direct result of the surgery.

With this report, I would encourage you to speak to your doctor about getting started in a PHYSICAL THERAPY program that encourages movement and stretching exercises (even though it will likely be a little uncomfortable) since these will be very good for you in the long run. From what you've presented I do not see you as needing any type of surgery at this point. I also am not a provocative fan of \\"back injections\\" since their effects are highly variable and of relatively short duration in the patients that I see in my office and hospital practices.

I would not encourage you to do epidurals, facet injections, vagal stimulators, or surgical procedures at this juncture but would very much promote exercise, good diet, weight loss and conditioning to strengthen core and back muscles, stop smoking (if you do), and maintain learn about keeping good posture while sitting, standing, and even walking.

This means that it is possible that the medications he's taking are not really the best type for his type of stroke he's experiencing. Your father should undergo what we refer to as a \\"stroke in the young\\" workup which involves a number of blood tests that are a bit specialized and not usually obtained during routine followup visits. I would recommend finding a neurologist who is specialized in stroke and if possible stroke in young patients such as your father so he can be thoroughly and rapidly worked up to discover either a CAUSE for these strokes or to get on a reasonable regimen of either anticoagulant,  antiplatelets, or perhaps some type of Antilipid/cholesterol set of medications. Your father would also likely benefit from tests such as electrocardiogram (12 lead) along with a 30-day EVENT MONITOR as well as an echocardiogram study with bubble study and then, in addition, a transesophageal electrocardiogram (TEE) to check for the presence of blood clots in the left atrial chamber of the heart. This is not an uncommon presentation and concern in the face of the number of strokes your father is having despite being on medication. Hope I have answered your query.

Back in earlier December I started having this painful and scary pins and needle sensation in my back and then traveling to other parts of my body. Could it be caused by the lisinopril? If so should I stop taken it all at once?","Doctor":"Hi, Well, this is the month of July...I don't know when you wrote your original question or whether your symptoms have since resolved. However, there are some patients who do get tingly feelings throughout their body who are on lisinopril. Therefore, it is possible this could be a side effect of the medication or it could be coming about as a result of an interaction with another medication. It is generally NOT a good idea to stop taking medications (of any sort) cold turkey unless you've spoken with your doctor about the symptoms you're experiencing. There can be other causes to explain feelings of pins and needles. But in case, your doctor feels these uncomfortable sensations are due to the medication he/she may prefer you slowly taper the drug off while starting or replacing your drug with another since the goal is to keep your blood pressure under control.

During the last 5 seconds or so of each episode the noise affects my eyes whereas they seem to jitter ever so slightly. This is very distarcting while I am working at my computer terminal.

This past Saturday around 1 in the morning I got home and found Chris napping on the couch. He woke up and walked into the kitchen. I noticed on the coffee table there was a box of cookies and a glass of milk sitting there that he probably ate some of before I got home. When he walked into the kitchen, I looked at him and he had this dazed look on his face. I shouted his name and he started to fall backwards, hitting his head on the kitchen cabinet. I ran to him and broke his fall by easing him to the ground when he suddenly started seizing in my arms. His body was rigid, toes on both feet curled inwards. He was unconscious because he was not answering me when I was saying his name and he convulsed for less than 30 seconds. Rescue came immediately and tested his blood sugar, it was 50! The doctors at the hospital suspected he did have a concussion from hitting his head but they feel it was the hypoglycemic episode that caused the seizure, and not the concussion. 2 years ago Chris had gastric bypass RNY surgery and lost approximately 160-170lbs in the past 2 years. He s maintained the same weight for the past year. He and I are both registered nurses and he works an exceptional amount of hours, working doubles and 12 hour shifts all the time for extra money. We were told that along with the low blood sugar and probably being so sleep deprived that that s what caused the seizure. In the past he s had instances at work and home where he s thought he felt low . He does not have a history of diabetes. When he would feel that way he would have a snack and feel fine. After this recent incident, and doing some of my own research I presume he could have reactive hypoglycemia related to his gastric bypass surgery. He is following up with a neurologist (as he s never had a seizure before) and an endocrinologist. The lab work came back normal when he was in the ER, however he s having more labs drawn tomorrow, fasting. Also his CT of his head came back negative. I guess I m writing this because being a nurse makes this situation harder for me because I understand so many (but not all) medical diseases and terminology. I am curious to see if maybe I m going in the right direction thinking this could be reactive hypoglycemia and maybe what else if you have any suggestions or thoughts of what this could be and what else we can do. I m very concerned because seizures are extremely scary, and even though he s out of work for the time being, he s eventually going to have to go back and start driving again, which scares me way more than him. I would appreciate any input you have on this situation. Thank you so much.

What can I do or give for headaches will magnesium help","Doctor":"Hi, A nonverbal child can be challenging in terms of treating for headaches but you should start by doing your best to identify that it is actually their head that is hurting. Being this is your son it is likely that you know exactly when his head is hurting and when it's hurting bad...so that much is easy for you. Now, did you know that Oxtellar causes a headache as one of its major side effects? In 16-20% of users headaches of both a major and minor intensity were experienced so please discuss with your doctor any suspicion that could link the drug to the headaches. If it comes to treating the headaches and it's been clearly determined that he is definitely not dehydrated, not hypoglycemic, not overly fatigued or exhausted (all of these states place him at risk for headaches) then, see if you can pinpoint the time to when he started having these headaches. Was it just about the time he started taking the medication...or perhaps after the dosage was increased since usually most youngsters start around 600-1200mg. daily. If he's up to 2400 mg./daily then, there could be a thought to lowering the total daily dose to see if that makes a difference. If that's not the answer then, decide on the use of something like Ibuprofen or Advil/Motrin. This medication is actually considered a better choice in children than Tylenol or acetaminophen. Don't use Ibuprofen more than 3x/day depending upon the severity you detect of the headache and not more than two days per week at the most otherwise, he may fall into a phenomenon called medication overuse syndrome. Also, careful about using aspirin or aspirin containing compounds if your son is under the age of 15. This will increase the risk to develop Reyes syndrome. Also, encourage drinking lots of fluids (especially sports drinks or something with water that contains some sugar content. This will reduce swelling of the blood vessel circulation to the brain and its sensitive areas. Try to get the child to take a nap after taking the medication. If that doesn't work or if your son still has a headache upon awakening then, look at things that may distract him mentally from thinking or focusing on the pain such as books, toys, and games. If none of these measures seems to work then, seek out a headache specialist and preferably for children since there are quite a few of important and distinct differences between how headaches are generically treated in adults (or at least big kids! compared to how they are treated in children. If headaches are more frequent than once weekly then, you'll want your doctor to consider giving him some type of prophylactic (preventative) therapy or approach. You do not want to choose things which come under the heading of electrolytes since these can be tricky in terms of dosage. Too much could trip off unwanted electrical stimulation and excessive discharges in the brain whereas too little will not quell any of the pain and the child will remain in pain. I would not give him magnesium unless your child is known to be magnesium deficient and even then, I would follow your doctor's advice to the letter. Electrolytes such as magnesium can cause heart rhythm problems as well as interfere with both voluntary as well as involuntary muscle control such as in the GI tract, sphincter controls.  Do not give electrolytes except under a doctor's direct supervision. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

What can be done, my mother seems to not think that this is reason for concern. He has also been permanently catheterized for over a year. What can I do to help??","Doctor":"Hi, Immobilization will be his enemy since vascular dementia is likely keeping him physically inactive. Phlegm and coughing suggest that he either has a pulmonary infection such as bronchitis or worse yet pneumonia. He really should stop smoking and become more active by either moving about the house or taking him outside if he can tolerate walking. This will help his clear secretions more easily.

Also in October he had an accident where he was knocked unconscious is it possible these things are related?","Doctor":"Hi, If your son suffered a traumatic brain injury (and that is certainly what it sounds like with him being knocked out) then, the dizziness is more likely than not due to the aftermath of that blow to the head. He could be suffering from what we refer to as a postconcussive syndrome.  I don't know that the nosebleeds can necessarily be tied together with the TBI but certainly, if he has PROFUSE nosebleeds and he is anemic as a result of the blood loss then, that can also be an explanation. He needs to get blood work which can easily detect the presence of anemia or not and if he's not been seen by a TBI specialist or at least a pediatric neurologist for the TBI you should take him to one for evaluation and interim review of his case.

After 8 years my neuroIogist said he felt my form was Benign.I do not see benign listed as a form and I was able to see that at the time he told me that. Is that no longer recognised as a form of MS? Thank you, XXXX","Doctor":"Hi, The term benign multiple sclerosis has been in the literature since the 1960s (possibly even before) and refers to an activity level of a person's MS that fails to progress over a prolonged period of time or fails to cause major disability from the time of diagnosis. It is a controversial term but in general, is used by clinicians when referring to a non-aggressive form of the disease. Whether it should be contained in the vernacular or not continues to be debated at meetings and symposia since our belief as an autoimmune disease is that whether or not MS's progression is apparent or not to the patient, treating doctor, or radiologist, we believe that the immune system is not just sleeping. Simply stated, it's just not doing \\"its thing\\" out in the open or in places of the brain whether major clinical changes can be appreciated. I personally don't use that terminology with my patients and stick with the more conventional classification systems in current use of primary and secondary progressive or relapsing/remitting (though remitting, in my opinion, is a bad choice of terms for the reasons stated above).

There's nothing wrong with encouraging lots of fluids (especially water) but I wouldn't give medications to lower temperature if it were my son. Using another example which I believe everyone is even more familiar with would be the person who feels cold or whose hands are clearly colder than anybody around them....yet they do not have lower body temperature on this basis. The only thing you'd typically recommend to someone like that is if they feel cold, put a sweater or blanket on, right?  There's no medicine that's going to correct that situation, right?

I was swimming backwards and ran my head into the side of the pool. I went to the doctors 4 days ago, and he said I probably have a concussion, and things will get better. I have occasional head aches, more tired than normal, I can t put thoughts together very well, and my memory is somewhat lacking, especially short term memory. I don t want to get a cat scan, because of the excessive radiation, and after a week everyone including the doctor says I am most likely fine, just have to give my brain time to heal. What do you think, am I probably fine? What advice would you recommend? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, Your symptoms do appear to be consistent with what is generically called a POSTCONCUSSIVE SYNDROME (PCS). As the name implies it is a constellation of symptoms which can occur together or at separate times after a person has suffered a CONCUSSION to the brain. Most symptoms are selflimited which means they typically resolve on their own without any specific treatment in a matter of a few weeks to few months but there can be protracted cases of PCS lasting much longer....just depends on the individual. I can understand your reticence in getting a CT of the head (and agree that it is a lot of radiation) but following an injury to the brain of that force (though it may not SEEM that much of a bang....just look at your symptoms and how you felt before running into that wall at \\"ramming speed!\\" HA!) it is always advisable to get an MRI of the brain. In that case no CT would be needed but you are free to do as much or as little as you'd like. If you're having memory issues then, it may also be advisable to get a NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL battery of tests done so that a nominal baseline of capacities can be concluded. This will serve as a basis to know how things are progressing in the future especially you are still not feeling 100% over the next few months. Since I'm a neurologist I'm always worried about damage flying under the radar after concussions....BECAUSE IT IS VERY COMMON....\\"feeling fine\\" and \\"appearing fine\\" are easy things to do if you were perfectly healthy to begin with....but the idea of getting tested and examined by people WHO ARE SPECIALISTS in those areas (TBI medicine) is so that a solid baseline can be developed for your current brain function JUST AFTER the accident and then, to follow that serially (at least every 3-6 months) for 1 year (which is typically what I do) since some dysfunction can be very subtle and not appear for a bit of time due to the nature of how nerves die and nerve connections decay in the brain. Docs who are not deeply rooted in the discipline do not always see it that way and of course, everyone likes to feel fine and be told that they're fine but wouldn't it be nicer if someone could genuinely say that after going through a standard workup? Then, you'd really have a good REASON to say you felt fine, right? Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I initally went to the doctor because it felt like a bug in my ear and was dizzy. He found the retracted ear then. However, it has been a few days and now my finger tips are having shock like or prickly feelings in them. They are tingling as i type.","Doctor":"Hi, Retraction of the eardrum is usually a sign of some type of space-occupying lesion that may be causing the eardrum to pull inward a little more than normal. It can also be as as result of increased NEGATIVE PRESSURE within the middle ear since there is a connection between the place behind your ear drum and your EUSTACHIAN tube which opens up into your NASOpharynx which is literally the uppermost portion of the BACK of your mouth (high up). The ENTRANCE of that tube you see in the picture anatomically connects to the middle ear and here is a GREAT picture of that. See where that AUDITORY TUBE is in that picture?  It connects with the opening into the NASOPHARYNX....that is the EUSTACHIAN TUBE which equalizes the pressure between the middle ear and the outside world (your mouth). Look at the 2nd picture and you'll see what looks like a big WHITE LAMP SHADE called the TYMPANUM or TYPMPANIC MEMBRANE. That's the eardrum. See where it's connected?  And see how it naturally bows INWARD toward the space in that middle ear.  Can you see where something in that space could conceivably cause that TYMPANUM to draw in a little more.....OR...what I believe is also a possibility is that the AUDITORY TUBE (Eustachian Tube) may not be working properly which could cause NEGATIVE pressure within the cavity. Things that cause Eustachian Tube dysfunction in that regard could be a mild infection with swelling of the middle ear lining, allergy reactions to things in the air during allergy season, or even pharyngitis which can cause the Eustachian to be blocked or swollen on the OTHER end where it opens into the nasopharynx. Generally speaking, these processes are all easily treatable either conservatively with good hydration, maybe some nebulizations with steam to open up the nasal passages a bit, etc. and the problem will resolve. Or if there is evidence for an actual infectious process, antibiotics, etc. However, the symptoms of the ear as you've described and especially if there is tympanic retraction does not really explain prickly feelings or shocklike symptoms in the fingers. Those may be due to a bit of a flare of your OCD and anxiety. You may be applying more force typing than you realize and should consider doing some deep breathing exercises and think in terms of letting the muscles in the hands and arms DECONTRACT or RELAX....That is going to go much farther for those sensations than anything else at this point. You may also NOT have eardrum retraction since that's not always an easy thing to see unless the doctor was an ENT specialist. Sometimes if the light source used is not powerful enough or if for some reason the patient has a slight anatomic variation of the external auditory canal where there could be an extra little curvature or different placement of the ear apparatus it could appear as if the tympanum had traction on it when in fact, it's really NOT retracted....best way to verify that would be to have a specialist look and see what's up.

I have since stopped all Sudafed, all 5 he, and mountain dew, I have not had any partial focal nor grand meals since the last one over a month now. All reg, MRI, cat scans and blood work are normal. Is there anything else I need to do? I went to go, they said come back in 3 months, but no driving for 6 months and no need for referral to neurologist, unless I want lot. What would a Neuro do for me? Not excited about meds. Am I being too lacadazical about this?","Doctor":"Hello, It is very possible that the trigger for your seizure was an ingredient in one of the items you mentioned (ephedrine from the Sudafed, excessive caffeine from the 5 hr. energy drink, and of course, nobody really knows what's in Mountain Dew or why it glows in the dark! Therefore, I would avoid those substances in the future.  It doesn't sound as if your seizure is under that good of a control and therefore, I highly recommend you see a neurologist and get on to medication to control these episodes. Otherwise, you are highly likely to continue to have them and they will become more frequent and more lengthy in their duration, and if nothing is done about them more difficult to control or get rid of. I absolutely recommend seeing a neurologist or even epileptologist if one is available in your area.  You may benefit from a good detailed workup to see if a cause can be found and addressed. Again, THAT is what a neurologist could do for you. Look for things that could be triggering these seizures and making sure you are fully protected. I agree with the no driving for yours and everyone else's safety on and off the road.  You SHOULD KEEP  A SEIZURE DIARY which the doctor should check on your next visit. A good neurologist will insist on a diary and check it over with you to discover things of importance or events that have happened. Hope I have answered your query.

I never smoked really heavily but I sometimes would go through a pack in a few days or a pack throughout a week or too. I just did it socially and I regret doing it now. When I was 15 after starting to smoke a little more often, and after a while when I smoked I started receiving slight pains in my chest. It started on the left side, it felt kind of like a pressure or something and sooner or later it had moved to both sides of my chest. It s hard to describe the feeling I got but it hurt a lot after smoking even 2 drags of a cigarette, but i also got pains even after I had quite smoking cigarettes. I haven t smoked many cigarettes at all since then but I had started to regularly smoke marijuana on a day to day basis. I usually smoked before bed because it helped me fall asleep but when I woke up my lungs would feel dull and achy and it would become somewhat hard to take deep breathes and stuff. This achyness as well as the chest pains have been happening for probably 2 years now. Along with this, I would always get pains in my head - another dull achyness that would happen it various places on my head, and somtimes experienced a sharper pain to the front of my head. Also, I got my medical card for smoking marijuana and increased my smoking of marijuana, rather habitually. A lot of times after a smoke I will stand up and my vision goes black and I get shaky for a few seconds and feel super weird. This happens quite often. It also has happened when i use my inhaler and hold it in (by the way, i tried telling my doctor and all they did was give me an inhaler). I black out so often now that it worries me that i m going to die or something. I have done research and figured out it is because I am not getting enough oxygen to my brain - is there anything I can do to fix this while still being able to smoke marijuana? If I stopped smoking marijuana will the damage that i ve been feeling happen to me for the rest of my life? If I stopped smoking for a few weeks (would be the first time in 2 years that I have stopped smoking for longer than a week) would it allow my lungs and my head to feel better and healthy again? And with my other symptoms - could I have any serious damages to my health that I won t be able to fix? Or any that I could fix? And how. Please help me. I ve been crying this whole time writing this because I m extremely worried about dying.","Doctor":"Hello, I am sorry for your condition. Have patience & do not panic. Do not lose hope. You have a history of smoking cigarettes & marijuana. From your past history & your present symptoms, it appears that you are suffering from hypoxia & experiencing blackouts. You are suggested to visit ER, see a GP & get physically examined. Get Spirometry, Aerial blood gas, Lung function tests, CBC, Chest X-Ray, CT, few more imaging tests if required. Get your lungs assessed at the earliest for the degree of damage. Hypoxia results due to lung damage. Get the lung treated for the cause/factor (fluid in the lung, COPD, emphysema,etc) causing the discomfort. Sometimes, not only the lungs but also the heart gets affected. Get a cardiac check up done to rule out syncope & any developing CAD(coronary artery disease), this is just to stay on the safer side. However, even if you have smoked for many years; you can reverse the effects of proper treatment & quitting smoking (tobacco & marijuana). Treatment may take longer since its gone chronic. Take nutritious food as medicines are strong & will be effective if you are on healthy food diet(high protein, rich in minerals (Zinc, magnesium, calcium, vitamin B & whole grains). Stay away from oily junk food. Quitting smoking(tobacco /marijuana) is challenging. Get connected to a detox center(medical facility). Once your treating doctor starts reducing the dose of addiction your body will experience withdrawal symptoms(both physical & psychological). Your symptoms will need treatment & medical support. If you are taking the help of a detox center(Evaluation, detoxification, treatment, aftercare)  they will be monitoring your symptoms & help you stay comfortable. You will need proper care, adequate sleep & healthy diet along with exercises. As you detox & get symptomatic treatment, your treating doctor will be treating your lung damage on the parallel. Your treatment will depend on the severity of the damage. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Also is it ok that I continue walking and moving around?","Doctor":"Hello, Coccydynia (or \\"tailbone PAIN\\") can and usually is an EXCRUCIATING pain that comes about through trauma to the base of the spinal column. I would limit the amount of ibuprofen since this could be contributing to nausea and see if you can get an appointment with a PAIN MANAGEMENT DOCTOR since more potent medications are available for pain control at least through the first 2-4 weeks after the injury. Nausea as an isolated symptom does not raise any red flags in my estimation.  Pain is the mainstay of therapy in such cases.  You may be able to switch to HEAT THERAPY now that you'd had at least several days with icing. Again, I would limit ibuprofen since this can be rough on the stomach. Hope I have answered your query.

In the last day, the twitching has moved to my buttocks and the back of my upper legs. Although the back of my thighs feels strange, I really don t feel any weakness or anything.

Of course, it is always proper protocol to do a metabolic workup making sure that there are no signs out of line parameters such as a high or low thyroid profile, excessively low or high electrolyte balance or deficiencies in calcium, B12, or Vitamin D.

All test that they have ran have came back normal. She also has Down s syndrome.","Doctor":"Hello, Non-epileptic seizure disorder is the term given to things that look like seizures but turn out not to be generated from the brain due to any electrical aberrancy. The fact that she has detailed memories of things occurring during the event makes it more unlikely that these are true electrical disturbances of the brain. This is because typical seizure patients have little to no recollection of anything that happened during the event and even just before and after can be a blur. Anybody who can describe what is going on before, during, and after, is registering memories due to intact consciousness and this by definition cannot be part of anything such as an absence or grand mal type of event. I would recommend a VIDEO EEG MONITORING situation which can be done in a hospital for several days if her attacks are frequent.  This is usually the best way to rule out the true epileptiform activity. There is also a device called an AMBULATORY EEG recorder which can be worn at home for several days then, brought back to the doctor for analysis which will monitor her 24/7.

This is one type of BALANCE TEST that can be done usually when someone complains of dizziness, wooziness, or disequilibrium. Other tests that also assess the integrity of the inner ear mechanisms include CALORIC TESTING, POSTUROGRAPHY, NYSTAGMOGRAPHY, and others. Specifically, a VEMP assesses 2 items of the inner ear.  One is called the UTRICLE and the other is the SACCULE.  Information is also gathered in this test about the VESTIBULAR NERVE (superior connection to the UTRICLE and inferior connected to the SACCULE). The test found an abnormality present in BOTH inner ears (Right worse than Left). However, the test COULD NOT determine exactly which component of the system was not working properly. The abnormality picked up by the test was that of the SACCULO-COLLIC REFLEX (SCR). This is one of MANY postural reflexes the body utilizes which keeps head and the body aligned against acceleration forces.  In this case the SCR is stated to be abnormal. This reflex keeps the head and body aligned against forces of movement or acceleration in a VERTICAL PLANE to the body. As an example, if a person were to be in a free fall situation because they jumped off the rooftop or from a ladder, the fact that the head and body don't go FLAILING while in the air is because of this REFLEX's ability to make instantaneous adjustments to the muscles of the neck and torso so that everything stays aligned. Once the person hits the ground then, anything can happen but while there is an acceleration force in a vertical direction the SCR will automatically keep head and body from going crazy in the air.  Pretty nifty, yes? In the case of this individual the SCR was measured as abnormal on both sides (right side being worse than left). As a result of making that call the doctor went on to state that in their opinion either the SACCULUS or the INFERIOR VESTIBULAR NERVE connected to the sacculus were not working properly. The SACCULUS is the element of the balance system found in the inner ear that sends information to the brain on vertical LINEAR acceleration of the head (and body since the 2 are connected). The INFERIOR VESTIBULAR NERVE is the cable that ties the SACCULUS to the brain and transmits the data. Apparently, the utricles and superior vestibular nerves are A-OK.

Leviteracetam is a good drug for seizure and is one of the safest available.

You may increase the doasge to 300mg twice a day. Also, seizure requires a long term treatment.

Since you've had multiple ones I would definitely recommend being treated for them unless your doctor is not in agreement that it is the type of seizure that would respond to the conventional drugs such as Keppra, Tegretol, Lamictal, or Depakote.

I was masturbating, though I didn t make a conscious decision to do so. And during, I kept thinking if I just get there it will stop. But that was the only thought going through my head. It was a lot like a dream but it wasn t one, I can assure. After some time, I regained mobility and got up and went to the living room to tell my family that something was wrong.

THis past Oct. she became manic for about 2 weeks and I had her put in a psch ward or 10 days. She was diagnosed bipolar and given lithum. As we know people deny they have this and decide not to take meds... she has had problems with eating as well, being alergic to SO many different foods... up and down with the weight. She focuses on NOT getting heavy, as well. My question is could all or any of this be related to her GUT, intestinal tract?","Doctor":"Hello, I think your question is a good one in light of the more recent publications and discoveries/understanding of what is referred to as the GUT/BRAIN axis of functioning. Neurogastroenterology is an actual up and coming discipline with professional societies and journals that have been in existence for years though it is not one of the MAINSTREAM considerations by either NEUROLOGISTS or GASTROENTEROLOGISTS in patients such as your daughter. Therefore, to answer your question\\" could all or any of this be related to her GUT, intestinal tract?\\". I think the answer is a firm MAYBE and probably the easiest place to start investigating a question like that would be a find a SPECIALIST in that area since there are specific approaches and testing protocols that are in place which neither neurologists nor gastroenterologists are necessarily very familiar with since their interests and expertise lie strictly in one discipline or the other. I would check out the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and their web page at:  and see if there is a specialist in your area or somewhere you can take your daughter if you feel strongly that this could be contributory. The fact that her weight is not under a good control and she likely goes through periods of binging/starvation (or so it sounds), etc. itself suggests that there is something there which if addressed at least could make brain functioning better. Certainly absorption of her medications for her mental condition would be enhanced. So I think it's something different to look into which just could offer some ways to improve her situation.

In terms of the pain I'm going to give you this link to look into because I've sent this information now to several of my patients who are in chronic pain for other reasons and it is an interesting concept that may develop into something you could benefit from since you're so young. It's called the Orphaneet/Anesthesia global project. Also, KFS can be approached surgically in such cases if pain and immobility of the neck or if scoliosis became so painful or obstructive to daily activities that other measures simply don't function. Scoliosis can be corrected if you have that problem and again, you're young so I believe your healing capacity is going to be excellent assuming you don't have any significant comorbid metabolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. I think that with the right therapy program and support groups by your side you stand actually a much better chance at a very good quality of life that may not be completely full of chronic pain as you might think.  And just so don't think I'm trying to make things sound better than they are...

I thought I was having a stroke and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. Had an MRI & was told it was probably due to stress. I continued to have those episodes a couple of times a week, usually when I was sitting or driving but not always. A Neurologist said he thought it was due to the muscles in my neck. I had an ECG?? where they put the probes on my head but nothing showed up. I tried physical therapy, traction, injections, chiropractic to no avail. I thought maybe it was due to my cervical stenosis & discs that were impenging on my spinal cord so I had a double diskectomy in November 2011 which didn t help.

Even after regular medication the problem persists Please advise Regards SRP","Doctor":"Hi, It is a bit unusual for a 55-year-old woman to come down with early Parkinson's disease (PD). If she has been placed on what would be considered appropriate medication for the disease (typically Sinemet or Carbidopa-Levodopa or one of the dopaminergic such as Mirapex, or Requip) and there has not been a noticeable difference in her condition then, the diagnosis of PD should be questioned. If there are visible tremors occurring in the extremities then, a DAT scan can distinguish with fair accuracy whether or not the tremor is truly one caused by PD vs. something else such as essential tremor. It sounds to me as if her tremors may get worse with anxiety or changes in her physiological profile and this would be also consistent with something such as essential tremors for which different medications are typically found to be effective.

If that same person is going to use a sauna on any given day then, the amount of fluid hydration would likely double or even triple depending on the heat of the sauna, length of time in the unit, etc. Also, one would want to be careful and go into a sauna in a hypoglycemic state since elevated heat for prolonged periods of time could increase any symptoms you may already have due to low blood sugars. Be sure to have eaten your normal meals on time before using a sauna.  Otherwise, enjoy the room if that's your desire without any worry about your carcinoid condition or the fact that you are on Sandostatin.

Ｗｈａｔ ｗｉｌｌ ｂｅ ｔｈｅ ｒｅｃｏｍｍｅｎｄｅｄ ｔｒｅａｔｍｅｎｔ ？","Doctor":"Hi, I don't know your age which could be an important factor to what is going on nor do I know the work you do but if I use your description of things as they stand then, certainly postures of the head and neck can have a large impact on neck pain and soreness. In an individual who is above let's say 45-50 years of age, arthritic changes in the neck could always start taking over causing similar pictures of neck and shoulder pain radiating into the scalp muscles creating muscle tension headaches. Then, treatment is toward the cause which if postural means you have to analyze the correct way to maintain the head and neck in line and to take frequent from any job where the neck must be either held still or turned to unnatural/uncomfortable positions. Also, neck exercises to be done during off hours to strengthen muscles and give them more stamina. I do not recommend chiropractic manipulation of the neck for any purpose due to the high risk of damage to blood vessels that are easily injured by whiplash-like movements. Changing pillow to something where the head is brought in straighter alignment with the shoulders and body while asleep is also a better way to sleep than with a high pillow.

I found out almost 4yrs ago, when I was 24. Pain is excruciating in winter and constant stinging sensation 24/7. It was hard in the beginning but now used to it. Is it possible to treat it. What are the implications if I get pregnant. Will I be able to cope with it.","Doctor":"Hi, Although this is a less likely possibility because you are a young lady, have your doctors run any bloodwork on you for what is called an HLA B27 antigen in your blood? There is an associated condition with this antigen being positive called Ankylosing spondylitis which does affect younger individuals usually in the lumbar region. Unfortunately, treatment is fully supportive. No way to stop the process by surgery or medication at this point. Getting pregnant is going to place a lot of pressure on the lower back in the later stages of the pregnancy so you may wish to find an exercise trainer or physical therapist familiar with pregnant women and back pain issues that can start putting on a regimen of appropriate exercises to strengthen back muscles as well as teach them how to increase their stamina under long periods of engagement time. Aquatherapy may be found to be a more comfortable for of treatment for this type of condition, especially what we refer to as aqua Jogging in a pool which is typically done in place and is very good for low back muscle pain and strengthening. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Dariush Saghafi, Neurologist"},{"Patient":"Good afternoon sir, I am Partha from Calcutta, India, have been suffering back pain in hole body since 2000 and after all check up the doctors decided that it is Ankyoliosis Spondilities. Therefore I need your advise that What type of medicine and exercise should I take to relief ? Is it curable?","Doctor":"Hi, Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment or cure to this type of arthritic disease but there are a number of things you can do to help reduce pain and reduced mobility due to the fusion of the lumbar bones that typically occurs in this condition. My best recommendation I've seen in patients is that of Aquatherapy and water conditioning so that back muscles themselves become stronger and more efficient at working without getting fatigued.  Pain itself is usually treated with some type of anti-inflammatory medication such as Ibuprofen or Naproxen and can be of benefit to some people.  Also, the use of Lidocaine patches in the low back can be helpful in some cases but I don't recommend patches daily since the body builds a tolerance.  The most specific exercise from Aquatherapy I find most people really like and do more than any other for this type of arthritis (and many others) is water jogging. Nowadays they actually have underwater treadmills which is very fancy...but not necessary to accomplish the goal. You can go into a shallow pool and just start \\"jogging in place\\" for several seconds at a time to be with and do this for about 3-4 minutes to start.  As you get better at the maneuver you will be able to go 30, 45, 60 seconds at a time and will be able to complete more cycles with rest. Hope I have answered your query.

And i have had 3 concussions already on file at the local urgent care center","Doctor":"Hi, You suffered a concussion and 90 seconds of blacking out is quite a long head for dropping a relatively short distance. It is always best to get to an ER and get checked out after a blow to the head that leaves you dazed, disoriented, and especially unconscious for 90 seconds. You are now into what could be classified as a postconcussive syndrome and because of how you are feeling, I urge you to seek medical attention. A CT scan of the head should be done to rule out serious damage that could be causing the nauseous feeling. It's not likely to be a stomach bug. This is most likely related to the concussion. Be aware that it is much easier for you to have subsequent concussions (this being the 4th) after you've had one. You really need to be careful. Hope I have answered your query.

In the case of brain bleeding I believe a more plausible explanation would be that the blood lacks the necessary elements (because of the MM) to \\"NOT BLEED\\" into tissues because of low or deficient things such as clotting factors, platelets, etc. This is why bleeding occurs but the brain itself is not being \\"attacked\\" by the MM.

I also feel an burning sensation on the back of my head . Do I need to worry ? Ps: I went to ER on my first brain trama & CT scan show fine,","Doctor":"Hello, If these are newer symptoms that you're described compared to 5 days ago then, it might be wise to check in with your doctor to ask them what they think about getting another CT of the head just to be sure something hasn't cropped. But from you're describing I don't sense that there's anything to worry about at this point. 5 days after a head trauma causing mild TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY is not that much time so I wouldn't worry too much about not feeling all back to normal just yet. But if you develop serious symptoms such as sudden onset nausea, vomiting, or difficulty staying awake or alert to your surroundings then, I would definitely suggest a visit immediately to an ER.

Of the variety of parameters, they looked at, belching to relieve trapped gastric air after meals were not included although they did have several items categorized as \\"feeding problems\\" You can look up the article to see all the risk factors they did mention and measure.

However,  would first want to get a good history on how quickly these symptoms came on and if there's been any let-up. Next, a physical examination to include blood pressure and then, laboratory testing to make sure you're not suffering from thyroid issues, diabetes, or chemical imbalances of some sort (B12, Vitamin D, folate, electrolyte deficiencies). If an MRI is being scheduled I'm thinking that they are trying to be sure that you do not have any types of tumors, aneurysms, or even congenital intracranial anomalies which by your symptoms doesn't seem to be the case. Worry and anxiousness can also trigger these sorts of symptoms especially the tingling and floating sensations you mention. Is there anything of a stressful nature in your life right now that you'd rather be WITHOUT because often times if you can identify such a thing or things, get rid of them (legally!

Care to shed some light for me please?","Doctor":"Hello, Tremors after a head injury are indicative of TBI, traumatic brain injury or Neurological problems developing. She needs to get physically examined, get done EEG, MRI, CT, Neurocognitive tests & Nerve conduction tests, nerve biopsy. Get assessed & evaluated. Her treatment will depend upon the pathology detected. Damage to the mid brain may cause Parkinson disease. Closed head injuries cause tremors. She may be treated with medications, but if a response is not good she may require surgery. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

His heart rate has never dropped and stayed that low. it will occasionally drop if he is cold but as soon as we put blankets on him and make him warm his heart rate goes back to 50 s.","Doctor":"Hi, There are other reasons that heartrates can become low and fail to correct and perhaps in your stepson, one consideration would be an infection in the bloodstream from either a bladder, kidney, skin or pulmonary infection.  Low heartrates that do not correct may be signalling a situation where bacteria have gained access to the bloodstream and are beginning to affect his hemodynamics.

I do have SVT, for which I do not take any medication. I started taking Livalo a few months ago, but stopped after feeling muscle aches and stomach discomfort. However, my internist felt I should try it 3 x a week with COQ10 because my cholesterol rose from 190 to 304. The last few years have been very stressful for both my husband and me in terms of health issues and family - I m wondering if it could be due to anxiety, but how do you tell?","Doctor":"Hi, With your medical condition and worries happening at once it is sometimes difficult to tease things out, however, the right steps to always follow in such a case involve making sure to the extent possible that nothing organic is really going on. Therefore, I believe you should do what you can to control the SVT's.  Perhaps, this medication is causing intolerable side effects so you need to have a discussion with your doctor to see if another suitable drug can be chosen. Often times that solves a lot of problems. Second, I would check your orthostatic blood pressures (your doctor knows about this) and make sure any other medications you're taking are not potentially lowering blood pressure, you need to be well hydrated at all times, and not becoming hypoglycemic (i.e. skipping meals for weight loss purposes, etc.). Beyond that, if there are still problems your doctor may consider an ultrasound of the carotid arteries and do other blood work to guarantee there are no blockages in the arteries going to the brain and that you don't have an anemia that should be treated (especially since these feelings have now occurred during exertional activities).

But she claims to have relapses, a numb face, numb or burning sensations on her arms or legs, then will visit doctors and demand MRI s and blood tests, then post photos online of her at the hospital or getting a blood test done etc, so we all know. Her neurologist in town said she didnt want to hear from her again unless she was paralyzed. We went to another town 2 hours away for a consultation to talk about the latest MRI she had demanded 2 months ago. She said it was 100% clear, nothing at all to worry about and her NMO results came back negative. I have done a lot of research on TM because I have doubts into the sincerity of her condition. I read that 75/90% of cases are monophasic. She was never paralyzed, her arm was numb when first diagnosed but it hasnt been like that again, although she claims to have predictable relapsed all the time, usually around the time her current boyfriend isnt paying her enough attention.

If he had 2 concussions in a short amount of time then, there are at least 2 areas of the brain that are now trying to heal so that number could go up. It is not unusual for patients that last months with PCS before things start to calm down and in the more extreme cases (depending upon the severity of the concussions) they have been known to last 3 years and longer. I've got patients who have suffered from military types of head trauma (explosions, falls from significant heights) and their PCS can be protracted to be sure. I would advise that you try and get his headaches under control just as quickly as possible because if those become chronic (> 3months) then, they become VERY VERY difficult to treat and may possibly never fully resolve. Get him to either a concussion specialist or a headache specialist in my opinion and make sure he is not taking too much OTC medication or prescription medication and make sure he is documenting his headaches so that they can be optimally followed and treated based on his reporting in order to get rid of them ASAP.

Also my neurologist schedule me another appointment for a EMG in 10 days, because he thought if we did it any sooner it would not show anything. Is there anything else that should being done?","Doctor":"Hello, You may be suffering from an acute demyelinating event which would be most likely occurring in the brain (and sounds to be purely sensory in nature) by your description although the spinal cord would also be a possible location to look for problems. In my opinion, what you really need that would be obtainable NOW are imaging studies of the brain and spinal cord (MRI with gadolinium contrast) to rule out a type of demyelinating process in the brain or something such as transverse myelitis in the spinal cord. Frankly, I don't understand the purpose of the EMG since you say you have normal reflexes and no muscle weakness. Nothing will show on an EMG in 10 days from now that won't show up today BUT more importantly I wouldn't do that test anyways by the first intention simply because it is invasive (i.e. not very comfortable) and not likely to show anything more than you could diagnose with good clinical judgment if a solid history and examination were done. EMG/NCV studies are MOST helpful when muscles are WEAK or reflexes are severely altered not as helpful when only sensory changes are occurring. I would do the preliminary imaging studies, blood work is fine, waiting for a little time is fine as well but I don't think an EMG is something I would plan for unless you became noticeably weaker.

However, in today's environment I think it is very unlikely that a physician who is not familiar with your case will simply give you a prescription for medications of that type without requiring a full on visit, very likely notes from your previous doctors who diagnosed you with the condition, and maybe even a referral to a specialist depending upon how confident the doctor was of your diagnosis since there are many things that LOOK LIKE ADD but aren't.

Need your kind advice please.","Doctor":"Hi, I am happy to give you advice if you could specify exactly what you might be seeking from me if your doctor already ordered your medications as well as for instructions for dosing. Both medications are likely being used to relieve the pain and discomfort you are feeling with the herpetic lesions.  There is always a way to try and prevent these lesions from coming back by using Acyclovir or one of its cousins.  But for acute treatment of the pain and soreness of the lesions, you describe these 2 medications should give some measure of relief. Hope I have answered your query.

When i was 2 years old, an one night typhoid fever paralyzed my legs. many treatment was taken, but no one worked. Now my legs are squeezing, tendons are also squeezing. Is there any treatment that i will be able walk again?","Doctor":"Hi, You are likely describing an extremely rare complication of typhoid fever called Guillain-Barre Syndrome. The paralysis of the legs in this instance occurred because the bacteria (Salmonella Typhi) which originally caused the typhoid fever had protein material which your immune system accidentally thought looked so similar to the myelin coverings of your peripheral nerves that you suffered what is called an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Your immune system attacked the nerves controlling your legs and stripped the myelin sheaths which rendered the nerves useless and hence the paralysis. What usually happens after such an episode is that slowly with time the myelin begins to regenerate and with therapy function in the legs comes back. At this time, unfortunately, we do not have the means of restoring function back into the legs which have not had proper neurological connections due to this demyelinating event for over 20 years. There's certainly no harm in performing physical therapy or using braces for the legs if you may have any degree of physical movement in them at all in order to ambulate. But otherwise, there is no medication or device available to restore muscle function to the legs. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I also slept yesterday and couldn t wake up, BUT, I had a 2hr workout the day before. My body aches too. No idea what to do....help please!","Doctor":"Hi, You may still have remnants of an upper airway infection such as sinusitis which is why your teeth may be tingling. However, other symptoms could be due to the respiratory condition due to deconditioning or mild reactive airway problems such as secondary bronchitis precipitated by your sinus infection. Dizziness could be from lack of proper hydration and so you may try drinking plenty of liquids or it could be from any medications you may have been prescribed or taking over the counter. Body aches are typical of viral infections that accompany any type of cold or flu. You may try nebulizations for the breathing, generous hydration, and if the tingling in the teeth persists to see a doctor for a possible review of your sinuses. You may require a different approach to treating this if it turns out to be a bacterial infection. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

If you are having headaches that are not going away then, you should see your doctor for a more detailed story on the symptoms of the headaches which are likely treatable with simple measures.

To prevent it from affecting the body further you were started on anti-seizure medicine. Now since you did not have any further episode, recent studies have shown that medications can be reduced in a stepwise manner. This is possible only if MRI and EEG are normal, which is the same for your case. So I concur with your doctor and would advise on tapering the dose based on his advice.

Next step (which the primary can also do) is to screen you for what we refer to as ORTHOSTATIC problems meaning that your blood pressure may be suddenly be going down when you stand, get out of bed, or otherwise become active. If that's clear then, he will decide to send you either to a cardiologist or a neurologist looking for cardiac rhythm or valvular sorts of problems while the neurologist will likely be checking you over for what to be SEIZURE EPISODES.

I am now home again and have blood in my stool. Could this be related to the LP?","Doctor":"Hi, The headache is very likely due to the LP but not the blood in the stool. If you are actually seeing bright red blood in the toilet itself then, it is more likely than not hemorrhodial bleeding. If the blood is within the stool itself as a formed clot or if the stool is tarry in color then, it is still not related to the LP but does indicate the possibility of an upper GI bleed and if you received IV paracetamol I am wondering if that could've been a factor since that medication can cause GI bleeding.

The shots will not have caused your hips to deteriorate rather the same arthritic process. The nerve damage you perceive to be in your legs most likely is due to the same arthritis affecting the lower spine which is compressing lumbar nerve roots L4 and possibly L5.

Only your doctor can know which of these options is best for you to follow. You should not change the dose or dosing frequency of your medication without their approval. Another possible explanation to poor control of your seizures is, may be that you are not taking your pills the way they have been prescribed. You must take this type of medication exactly how it is told to you on the prescription. You cannot miss doses, you cannot run out of your prescription, you cannot skip meals or fail to drink adequate fluids daily, and you cannot be overly fatigued, or excessively tired during the day since all these things also put you at risk for seizure activity and less medication control. You cannot drink alcohol either.

For example, stress, anxiety, fear to name a few highly emotional states that can block thoughts and result in headaches. Organic causes of you're describing could be some type of aborted seizure disorder, migraine headache aura, or even medication side effect.

The lightheadedness is very light but notacable for sure","Doctor":"Hi, Why suggest a medication as opposed to looking for the UNDERLYING CAUSE?  There's virtually nothing more vague to assess and treat than the symptom of lightheadedness which is even sometimes hard to pin down from patient to patient as to what they exactly MEAN?  Make sense? If this is something that's recently started then, check out any new medications you may be on...especially antidepressants, heart drugs, and blood pressure drugs.  If any of those types of medications are recently prescribed since this symptom started then, there may be something there to go to your doctor about. If not, how about changes to your diet or hydration habits?  If you're skipping meals, going on crash diets, or not drinking enough WATER WATER WATER....then, these symptoms may be present as well.  Could you be having OCULAR problems, in need of a change of eyeglass prescription, or just in need in eyeglasses? Are you looking at a computer screen for too long per day...or at a time?  Then, there is always the wildcard of stress, anxiety, depressive mood disorders that could sometimes kick in without realizing.  Have there been recent changes in life events, financial status, job, or romance status?  Could these be impacting how you are feeling?

I have recently heard about coconut oil as helping dementia; is it safe to take this remedy with warfarin and should we find an alternative to warfarin because of the continuing damage it is doing?","Doctor":"Hi, The current state of the literature on this topic is in Flux.  What is almost universally agreed upon is that AF is highly correlated as a risk factor for Dementia. However, the data on the same correlation in using WARFARIN as an oral anticoagulant as a risk factor for dementia is not nearly as clear though it has been suggested. Take a look at this link which talks and calculates the amount of Vitamin K in coconut oil which is known to interfere with INR readings and decrease coumadin's effectiveness.  However, the amount of coconut oil needed to raise K levels significantly is so much that I doubt that judicious use would cause a problem. Coconut oil's ability to TREAT dementia is also a controversial point at best but it is a healthy type of oil so there's no downside to using it unless the person is ALLERGIC to coconut. Check out the link and then, ask your doctor for sure but I do not believe the use of coconut oil for the purposes of cooking etc can significantly impact Vitamin K levels in the bloodstream to make it strictly contraindicated in patients on coumadin. Just don't let him have 1285.71 teaspoons which is what one would need daily to get the USDA's recommended daily value of Vitamin K and he'll be fine! The trick to eating foods with Vitamin K (and coconut oil has Vitamin K) while on coumadin is that once a person gets to a stable INR the amount of Vitamin K actually ingested on a day to day basis should remain relatively the same in order to avoid problems to the INR.  Stability is the key. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Medications that may help with the pain include OTC things such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and acetaminophen taken according to labeling instructions. If the pain is not resolved with those agents your doctor will need to decide on next steps.  You may inquire about the utility of aquatherapy for your condition which is published as being very helpful in some patients after musculoskeletal injuries.

The left-sided body pain is not well explained by any particular common diagnosis. You may also check that your thyroid function is adequate by asking whether your FT4 (Free Thyroxine) and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) have been checked. If just the TSH has been checked you may consider a request for the FT4... it makes the thyroid screen more sensitive for problems as opposed to only the TSH which is the majority of clinicians choose for a \\"quick and flipping dirty screen\\" in most otherwise routine situations.

Thanks, Mom in SC","Doctor":"Hi, Anxiety can definitely be a seizure trigger. The absolute relationship between nosebleeds as a prelude to an epileptic event is not well known.  There are many people with known epilepsy who do relate having nosebleeds shortly or immediately prior to a seizure event. But also there are metabolic causes to be ruled out such as Factor deficiencies in the blood (Factor IX, the Von Willebrand factor). It is also possible that on those times she suddenly becomes anxious that in fact, she is manifesting prodromal symptoms of a seizure. It's too bad that she has these episodes so infrequently because she would otherwise be an excellent candidate for video monitoring. Does she lose control of her bowel or bladder as well, become very quiet, fixed stare?  Then, becomes exhausted? I think there are a number of ways to go on diagnosing your daughter.

Of course, there's the easy go to the diagnosis of nervousness and anxiety which you may have already heard either from friends, coworkers, or even you talking to yourself. However, there are organic reasons for the feelings of tingling and sensations of tightness. Anything from side effects of medications to low serum levels of vitamin B12, folate, B6, or Vit. D.

It is sore to the touch and she feels pressure from it. She does have headaches but none of them would be considered strong. It is like a sinkhole has started to the back of her head. She has not had any accidents to the head. She was taken to her general doctor and he was talking about pushing the skull back out and wanted an xray.

Your daughter is fine except she just discovered this now so things are little freaky. When our daughter when was born as a 26-week preemie we thought it was because of that... not so. My son also has it and he was born on time. I believe one of our other daughters also has something similar. I would not go through a lot of testing (unnecessary X-rays and CT scans which emit about 200x the X-ray radiation that a normal X-ray does) and maybe even suggest that the doctors counseling with all these elaborate things from hematomas to skull defects that need to be \\"pushed back the other way??\\"... are you serious on that one??....have them take a look at the following link and be ready for the next person who asks because as I said....it's not often reported or written about but it is so common that it's \\"quasi\\" scary. But...... it's a totally benign condition. I'll be happy to look at what your daughters look like and tell you if it's similar to my daughter or son.  No sinkhole is developing and your daughter shouldn't manipulate it or mess around it or press on it...that's a good way to get it irritated or scratched and infected....just know that it's there.

You will need to search on another platform for prescriptions. Your other option is to have your surgeon review what's going on since muscle spasms are not typically part of the common sequelae to this type of procedure unless there is a problem arising as a complication from surgery or the diagnosis is something different.

The headaches then changed to burst of pain that would blur my vision and cause such pain that I would be kind of out it for a few moments. They never lasted very long. Since the last burst which, thank God, has been over a month ago, my head is numb on the right side. I am having vertigo and numbness in my head, right side and back. At times I lose my thoughts, confusion sets in or forget in the middle of something what I was going to say or do. I even went to step out my door to my house which has a couple of steps down and its like my brain forgot to tell my feet to step down. I almost fell flat on my face.","Doctor":"Hi, Cluster headaches are awful...possibly worst headaches known to man.  The other headaches you are describing are most likely a form of dysautonomia as well and could be a slightly atypical hemicrania continuum since the numbness overhead seems constant. There are many things you can do for clusters and headaches in that family which are referred to as trigeminal autonomic cephalgias (TAC).  You need to find a headache specialist or a neurologist very well versed and who really makes it a passion to treat and manage headaches.  Do not settle for someone who really doesn't wish to really approach these to find out what's at the root of your headaches if possible and then, offer you legit treatments that have a chance of working.

But it really does sound like you can address this problem to a large extent if you develop a regular and strict bladder routine such that you can keep yourself from getting to points where you are actually overholding your urine which can not only cause discomfort but could cause some of the other curious symptoms due to autonomic charges being fired from trying so hard to hold that bladder. I believe you've had enough surgery for a lifetime... time to heal up and approach things from a nonsurgical perspective for a while in my opinion... otherwise, it's a never-ending circle.

PLEASE HELP ME!","Doctor":"Hi, I'm sorry that I cannot fully understand what you are trying to relate except it sounds as if you have a paralyzed right hand which suffers from itching which then, opened to expose underlying tissues. Obviously, your doctors are not able to figure this problem out therefore, you need to seek out a second opinion with a dermatologist or immune system specialist so that the proper tests can be run to discover both the reasons for the paralysis of the hand (possible small stroke) and then, the itching.  If the hand paralysis came about as a result of a stroke or even spinal cord infarct (highly unlikely) then, I believe itching is being triggered by a faulty autonomic nervous system and this is what has to be addressed so that you can avoid scratching the hand... which needs to heal for all the scratching you've done. Systemic steroids may be a reasonable stop-gap measure to control the severe symptoms of itching until a doctor can determine your working diagnosis which then, needs attention.

The other is that something in the brain could be causing this so I would recommend obtaining an MRI of the brain with GADOLINIUM contrast to see if there could be something intracranially causing these intense pains such as a mass lesion affecting one of the sphenopalatiine ganglia which would give off the trigeminal nerve responsible for sensation of the face (on that side). Also, imaging studies of the cervical cord may be necessary to look at the area of the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve to see if that is being compromised in some way.

There could be other things in the neck triggering migraine-like headaches that CT scan may not pick up such as nerve roots being pinched or even the spinal cord itself being impinged upon so that an MRI of the cervical spine may also be worthwhile looking at if she complains at all of the neck, shoulder, or arm pains that travel. If all workup is unrevealing then, I would simply treat her with antimigraine medications and try and break these before they become chronic. Hope I have answered your query.

Treatment often does depend upon cause such as vitamin B12, Vitamin D, or folate deficiency.  Demyelination can also come about as a result of an infectious process that then, triggers an autoimmune process such as Guillain–Barré disease or AIDP. Then, there are entities such as Multiple Sclerosis which is known to be primarily a demyelinating disease of autoimmune origin with no known single cause to date. Treatments for MS are multiple and depend on a variety of factors in order to make a choice. Your best course of action as the parent is to follow his doctor's advice for either a more thorough workup to identify the cause of this problem (which then, will point to the treatment) or referral for you to take him to a specialist or specialized center for treatment where they will talk to you and him about options.

My doctor is away for 2 weeks and I just wanted to know whether this Mammillary polyp can cause any memory related problems. Should I undergo any additional tests? Is a test for Thiamine deficiency relevant?","Doctor":"Hello, I was able to find your question written for the first time in Feb. 2012 on another question board and on the same board in 2010 you posted that you had been having some trouble with your memory for the past couple of years. You mention that you're a research student.  I'm assuming that you've since finished being a \\"student\\" and perhaps now are a researcher? There is no such anatomic entity in the brain called a \\"mammillary poly\\". MRI's frequently show the presence of nasal polyps or MAXILLARY RETENTION POLYPS.  Therefore, my guess is that the transcription of what should've been MAXILLARY turned into MAMMILLARY. That is what you're looking at. As far as memory problems are concerned, obviously you've got a long history of feeling a memory problem. If it has been stable for 11 years according to your posts then, I would not worry too much about thiamine deficiency unless of course, you feel that ETOH use is excessive or there are other symptoms such as hallucinations, etc. But I would say for the present you don't need to worry about thiamine deficiency based on the MRI report.

The swelling in the feet may be due to what we call dependent edema and can be resolved if you are on a plane by taking walks up and down the cabin aisle every 1-2 hrs. The tingling sensation may be due to an entrapped nerve in your shoulder or neck that can be worked on by physical therapy and possibly released.

Sixteen years ago this upcoming August a resection osteotomy and fusion in the t-11, t-12 (andersen lesion) was performed on me by a prominent spinal specialist at Buffalo General hospital. Recently I was diagnosed with drop foot by my rheumatologist, after complaining of progressive numbness in my right leg (I ve also had hip replacements). My rheumatologist believes the numbness generates from my spine (I ve been dealing with a dull, constant ache on my lower right side for some time). My problem: the surgeon in Buffalo no longer accepts medicare patients, and I can t afford to pay out of pocket. Therefore, I need to find a new surgeon in the upstate New York region (not far from the Elmira/Corning area where I live). Equally frustrating is my inability to get a good radiology reading of what s going on since the hardware in my spine (rods and pedicle screws from s-1 to t-6) generates a lot of scattering. Not sure why but every time I go to my local hospital for a ct-scan I m told it is too hard to determine a reading of the area in question due to the scattering. I attribute to lousy, dated equipment, since I usually get a good read on x-rays in Buffalo. I wrote my rheumatologist last week, but, as in the past, he s overwhelmed and doesn t get back to me.

I went to a orthopaedic surgeon last week for a second opinion, but he could not find any reasons (from my xrays) why I would experience pain chronically. I then went to see a chiropractor who helped a lot, and the pain eventually went away, but short lived. It is slowly returning again. The chiropractor noticed that I have a number of anomalies over my spine and missing a pair of floating ribs (previously thought by first orthopeadic surgeon as having an extra vertebrae). There seems to be some kyphosis and possibly Scheuermann s, however they say it is not the reason for the pain. I used to give yoga classes, which I cannot do now anymore, and struggle to find a way to manage my pain, apart from the chiropractor s help, which is short lived. No-one can give me answers, and I keep on struggling with pain shifting around all over my back, hips, legs, knees, feet (more recently), arms and between the shoulder blades.

It has only been a week and a half and I already feel like increasing the dosages again. I only take the medications at night at this time.

I plan to travel from 900 feet in Texas up to 8,000 feet in Colorado and am worried my symptoms might get worse due to the change in elevation. I am also worried the my head will not heal as fast.","Doctor":"Hi, You are likely suffering from symptoms of postconcussive syndrome and this can continue for up to several months, sometimes long after the head injury. You may wish to check in with your neurologist to solicit their opinion on your upcoming trip, however, I'm unaware of specific data linking speed of recovery from TBI to changes in elevation. It is certainly possible that symptoms you are already having of headaches, dizziness, etc. could be magnified until your body becomes acclimated to the change in elevation which could take about 3 weeks.  However, the speed of recovery should not be affected (so long as you are not going to Colorado to Ski or Mountain Climb!). Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I do yoga regularly and I’m wondering if it’s a pinched nerve. I have had a shoulder issue and sore hip on the same side of my body as well for a few months.","Doctor":"Hi, You may have something akin to tennis elbow if the pain is strictly on the elbow. That is referred to technically as epicondylitis and can be best treated by limiting use and strain. Yoga moves where the elbow is extended her overly flexed may need to be curtailed to give the joint a chance to heal. Ice for the first 24-48 hrs. on the area followed by warm compresses for 10 days will help. But resting the elbow more than anything will be beneficial. Hope I have answered your query.

After 5 days in the hospital and terrible headaches they ordered an mri showing small blood clots in her brain. Cerebral vein thrombosis. She has since had blood tests done that have come back abnormal. She is on warafin. I have been looking for information connecting the two. Mono and clots. She is only 21, an athlete was in great shape before all this. She has lost 20 pounds because of the nausea and now is getting little sleep. We have Kaiser Insurance. We were told to wait 6 weeks for another blood test and in the meantime take oxycoden for the headaches. In 6 weeks if the blood test are still abnormal he will refer us to a hematologist. My question is should we seek a 2nd opinion and is there anything else we should be doing for her?","Doctor":"Hi, Hypercoagulable state is a condition which commonly comes about because of infectious states, dehydration, and other metabolic disorders.  The blood clots are referred to as sinus venous thrombosis or venous thrombosis and they are in the venous circulation of her body...which is not a bad thing compared to if they would be on the arterial side in which case she may have suffered acute strokes....not to minimize the gravity of the current situation....she's got a bit of work to do to get normal....but she's not lost any neurological function due to the clots....just slowed her down...and giving her some mild headaches, I'm sure.  Since your daughter has been diagnosed with EBV...then, that is likely the most plausible explanation for her blood clots, severe headaches, cloudy thinking, etc. The good news is that she'll get better...she's on an oral anticoagulant though current guidelines actually recommend she NOT be given orals.  If she's converted to warfarin then, I'd ask the doctor if he'd consider something instead like Eliquis (newer version of warfarin such that no INR testing is really needed, less bleeding complications overall).  I'm not sure why they chose oxycodone for headaches. CVT headaches have been shown to have pathophysiology very similar to migraine and they do respond to standard migraine regimens.  She may benefit from IV DHE (dihydroergotamine) or triptans even though she can't take the medication continuously. Now, if they keep giving her the opiate drugs....I'm afraid she might run into some medication rebound or overuse syndrome which will give her even more headaches. You may find better medication choices for the headaches from a headache specialist. I am not sure what the hematologist move is going to accomplish. Her status of resolution will be dependent upon how quickly the venous clots come down. Other details have to be explained to your future for the future and another blood testing should be done now that this has happened. Hope I have answered your query.

Results are At C5-6, mild to moderate cervical spondylotic disc bulging results in mild central canal stenosis and mild to moderate bilateral neuroforaminal narrowing. At C6-7, mild to moderate spondylotic disc bulging and a left paracentral and foraminal disc protrusion. There is remodeling of the left paramedian cord but without overt impingement. Moderate left-sided neuroforaminal narrowing. My PCP is wanting to send me to a pain clinic for injections. How will injections help a bulging disc? What else can be done besides surgery?","Doctor":"Hi, My assumption is that you're complaining of pain symptoms that your primary doesn't feel he can effectively treat... or you're not responding to the treatment he feels comfortable giving and that's why he's sending you for injections. Personally, I wouldn't go that route as a neurologist because I know there are other things that can still be tried before going to a pain clinic.....if pain is even an issue (which you've not really presented thus far that it is....).  I would consider sending you for an EMG/NCV study to more precisely to identify which of those cervical lesions are really the important ones.   Just because you see it doesn't mean it's relevant to your symptoms.  You may also have something called thoracic outlet syndrome and not cervical radiculopathy although imaging is compelling for at least some degree of cervical pathology causing or majorly contributing to your symptoms.

I am having cough since last 2 days and today while I was coughing I almost passed out . can you please tell me the reason or suggest me the treatment?","Doctor":"Hi, There is a medical condition called cough syncope which means that a person passes out (loses consciousness) when they cough very forcefully or become spastic in their coughing (one cough after another without being able to stop). What happens is that there is pressure inside the head that is built up with the cough (or series of coughs) that prevents blood from flowing through the carotid arteries into the brainstem itself. When blood flow to the brainstem is interrupted in this way a person can temporarily lose consciousness. In your case, you didn't quite lose consciousness because there wasn't enough pressure to completely stop all blood flow to the brainstem. The treatment is to discover what is causing the cough and to treat that entity.  Eliminate the cough...or cough spasms... and you won't nearly pass out. Hope I have answered your query.

I have tried friction massage with very little success. This new flare up occurred approx. 3 days ago. I am also noticing loss of balance on occasions but have not fallen. My biggest fear in life is ALS.","Doctor":"Hello, Your symptoms are not at all suggestive of or indicative of a motor neuron process (mainly based on the symptom of pain in the distal forearms.  I think what you can benefit from is a good NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT and evaluation. My first thought based upon your symptoms is to examine the carpal tunnel in both arms and test function of the median nerve though you are noticing any specific weakness in holding onto objects. It is not unusual for CTS to present as PAIN before weakness. Also, does not typically do this as it does not involve sensory ganglia at all in its outset or presentation.

The disorder is no longer referred to as Arnold-Chiari malformation rather just Chiari malformation (along with various types, I, II, etc). The definitive treatment to this problem is in fact surgery and this should relieve the headaches and neck pain so long as the diagnosis is accurate. If you or she have any doubts on how well surgery will work then, I recommend you seek a 2nd opinion on the case before committing to the surgery. It is true that many get surgerized but do not experience significant relief.  Unfortunately, even when the diagnosis is dead-on. Still, surgery does not seem to completely relieve symptoms because in some patients they also have other underlying problems such as HEADACHE DISORDER or cervical spine arthritides. A 2nd opinion may help identify other comorbid issues that could make it appear that surgery was unsuccessful since neurosurgeons and radiologists are not always in search of anything except strict measurements of the cerebellar tonsils. Was a CSF flow study accomplished?  What are the details on the multiple cysts you mention? Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

My dad likes a bottle of beer at night and I am wondering if this somehow interfered with the way the drug worked Thank you","Doctor":"Hello, I must say that your father proves one of the reasons I am not a fan of Trazodone. It does not work well at all in states of dementia and in fact, may cause behaviors and sleep hygiene to get worse. Trazodone can also increase the chance of seizure disorders and cause severe headaches. Unfortunately, your father's condition of sundowning makes it very difficult to prescribe a medication to control since there is nothing specific for brains that are experiencing atrophy and loss of cortical to subcortical connections. The use of alcohol of any type and prescription medications is always a questionable combination since alcohol can and does inactivate many medications by ramping up liver metabolism. But nonetheless, I do not believe trazodone in any dose will be his best option.

With these symptoms do you think I could have a concussion?","Doctor":"Hello, The diagnosis of a concussion is best made after a visit to a doctor knowledgeable in such injuries who can solicit the proper history surrounding the events that occurred just prior and just after the fall. If you are still experiencing the dull headache then, my best suggestion to you is that you be seen at an URGENT CARE center or even an ER. I cannot know without examining you further what may or may not be happening to your head and there certainly is the possibility that you suffered a CONCUSSION.

You can substitute your car for an Uber or Lyft service just until things come under better control.  I believe you would benefit from a 2nd opinion on the diagnosis of fibromyalgia because although the condition is certainly known to be painful and debilitating as well as causing people to be depressed and withdrawn it's not known to cause diffuse ARTHRALGIAS and trigger periods of frank anger.

Thanks.","Doctor":"I believe that a neurological examination by a qualified neurologist is in your best interest.  Although it is a very low likely possibility something such as a meningitic process may be a consideration for the symptoms you present.  On the other hand you may also have some type of obstructive process of the sinus drainage system on the left side that could be producing unilateral symptoms.  A set of frontal facial or SINUS films (CT SCAN) should easily show any type of congestive or infectious process."},{"Patient":"Hi I have been diagnosed by my G.P as having cfs.

Medications that are for the purpose of treating neuropathy are things such as NORTRIPTYLINE, DESIPRAMINE, GABAPENTIN, DULOXETINE, LYRICA, TOPIRAMATE, and a host of others.

I have had five surgeries, each time to put the nerve deeper and to remove scarring on the nerve. It keeps coming back. Surgery always removes the symptoms. Although my emgs always show mild involvement of the nerve, the condition shows up wth the typical clumsiness, weakness, and most obviously a wartenberg sign. This in itself defies logic--severe signs and mild emgs, doesn t make sense. But I am wondering about something. I had an ekg as a pre op procedure. It said I had LVH. But I don t. On an echocardiogram, the doctor said that the test was reading the signals from bottom up instead of top down. So, it was giving a false positive. I am wondering if this is happening with emgs. Somehow, could it be reading the signals in an opposite direction thereby missing the most damaged neurons? They are based on electrical signals, too. I have been very frustrated by all this. I need to know. But please don t respond based on what statistics say should happen. I have had this thing on both sides, and have had three recurrences--due to scarring of the nerve. Surgery is always successful, but why doesn t the emg seem to read accurately? could it because it is picking up signals differently. I have had many other tests to rule out everything else under the sun. It is cubital tunnel. It is the ulnar nerve. But please help me with this frustration.","Doctor":"Hello, Since there is a poor correlation between EMG and clinical data, I think that second opinion and a second EMG elsewhere should be done.

If the doctors have determined what the calcified granuloma may be then, their determination of the medication as well as the amount would've also been taken under consideration. I have no basis for disagreeing with their recommendations and can tell you that the most important role a patient can have in such a situation is to take medication such as Levipil as prescribed on time every day and to keep track of any side effects or other abnormal circumstances while on the medications.

However, in general terms the only way a person can know for sure if they are pregnant is by taking a pregnancy test.

Can you please tell me the reasons for these?","Doctor":"Hi, Your symptoms are highly suggestive of some form of stress or generalized anxiety disorder more than anything organically wrong with either the brain or the ear. If the sounds of music bother you to an extreme extent you may have a condition referred to as misophobia which represents a person's extreme aversion to certain sounds or groups of sounds resulting in a sense of heightened irritability, stress, fear, etc. Basically, it's an extreme emotional state triggered by sonic stimuli.

My mother had an MRI done in 2007 showing white matter disease, subcortical atrophy and small vessel disease. Over the past 6-7 years she had been falling in the house and I noticed after the falling she had been experiencing some forgetfulness. She has been to a neurologist about 5 years ago and he had given her a mini-mental state test, and sent her for neuropsych testing. She also suffers from renal insufficiency due to hypertension (she is in Stage 3). She was in stage 4 but a nephrologist has her in stage 3 due to the right medications. Her mother had died from uremic poisoning over 50 years ago (no dialysis then). Anyway, the neurologist based on his examinations and testing feels that she is in a mild to moderate stage of alzheimer. Her cardiologist told me that she has microvascular leukoencepahlopaty (she also has hardenining of the arteries). Her primary care physician feels that her dementia is microvascular (AKA vascular due to small vessel disease; she also has diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, cholesterol.) She was a smoker, but stopped about 17 years ago. She also has perepheral artery disease. She is on many medications including aricept and namenda. She also experiences parkinson-like tremors. She had a eeg showing a slows of speech language done about 4 years ago. Based on what I have told you is this dementia of a vascular origin, or is it a mixed dementia? She is currently 86 years old and resides in a nursing home. I know I witnessed while she was at home some forgetfulness like leaving a stove on, poor hygiene, moods swings (verbally and hitting). Also, she would have auditory & visual hallucinations (hearing music, talking to imaginary people). I thought at this point she would be better in a facility where she is exposed to people her age and mind stimulation would be more available than staying at home with a home health aide. She had a sister who had passed away last year at 83 years old from alzheimer. Could both sisters have the same thing? I know her sister had hypertension and atrial fib.","Doctor":"Hello, Microvascular leukoencephalopathy is usually progressive, as one ages changes to blood vessels usually add up. Apart from her age (in itself a risk factor), she has all other risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol changes etc., so while it is attempted to slow progression by controlling these factors it can't be stopped. As for whether she has Alzheimer's the forgetfulness and the hallucinations you describe are not common with vascular dementia, would go more in the favor of Alzheimer. However neurological exam, imaging and neuropsychological testing are necessary for a more complete assessment. In addition to that one doesn't exclude the other, it is common to have mixed dementia due to both Alzheimer changes as well as small blood vessels ones, they are both the most common causes of dementia.

Please help.","Doctor":"Hi, Most would tell you that if it's been already several months since the stroke then, however, much he's improved to this point is probably the stable plateau upon which he will continue for the foreseeable future.  However, I've seen nontrivial improvements in stroke patients as far out as 18-24 months from when they had their event. Of course, these folks were also aggressively and faithfully rehabilitating almost daily with either supervision or at home with the family but they were actively working to make the affected functions better. Therefore, the real answer is that it is highly dependent upon the amount and time a patient spends day to day rehabilitating and focusing on making functions better that were affected by the stroke. Also, very important for anyone expecting good or full recovery is strict control of risk factors. Glycemias of 350-450 are significant risk factors for recurrent stroke and will also reduce his ability to rehabilitate if, in fact, that's what he's doing now.

The first thing to do is to stabilize the lumbar spine using a lumbar spine brace. Along with this using a hot water fermentation should be done to relax the muscles. Then doing the McKenzie maneuver for centralising the pain. The McKenzie maneuver can be looked onto the internet. Post getting centralisation of the pain, hot water fermentation to reduce the pain is advised. From here take on to the stabilizing the core muscle exercises along with lower limb strengthening exercises.

The best means to diagnose it is a neurological physical exam and a lumbar MRI, I would start with a neurological consult.

Basically healthy except for high blood pressure which he takes 10 mg norvask and he only has 1/3 use of his kidneys. Just recently, we believe a blood vessle popped in his head. He suddenly had headaches,dizzy and was unable to read. He was in intensive care where they did 5 catscans which showed blood on the brain(back of) near the neck i believe. He is in no pain but gets confused at times. Drs put him on 2 different blood pressure meds(one listed above) and B6 to get rid of water. He had reaction to the 2nd BP med and stopped it per MD. We are currently going to see the doctor after having an MRI. Also they said his kidneys were failing due to the medicine they gave him. My question is this.will the blood dry up? Will he get the ability to read and stop getting confused and dizzy? How long will that take? Will he be alright with this blood on the brain and what can we do to dry it up? And lastly, what of his kidneys? I belive he is going to a urologist on Monday. Thank you PS-they ruled out a stroke..","Doctor":"Hello, As your father has a past medical history of high blood pressure and was under medication these symptoms are expected for kidneys to malfunction. Also, there might be lacunar infarct leading to such blood vessel issue. with the blood-thinning medication, he should be fine having control of the blood pressure. Lasix is given usually to control the high blood pressure and it works well. but if kidneys are damaged then other measures are taken like reducing the water intake. Coming to the difficulty in reading it happens at a certain age due to neural tissue degenerative changes. having a neurologist opinion should provide good outcome score. At 78 we can expect unexpected changes too. I will advise to visit a neurologist and start doing regular exercise in low intensity. Recent researches have reported that doing 20-30 minutes of low-intensity exercises have helped reduce the blood pressure throughout the day. Also taking a power Nap will help reduce further the BP for up to 5 mmHg. Monitor the medications, do regular exercise, monitor the water intake and diet plan. Hope I have answered your query.

Can you please tell me what does this mean and is this serious problem and what treatment needed. Thank You","Doctor":"Hello, Well, to start with a comment I would like to say, that MRI is a diagnostic procedure and it helps us to correlate the clinical symptoms with the pathology of the neural tissue. So, MRI is nowhere a true diagnosis but a diagnostic procedure. Without correlating with clinical symptoms commenting is not possible. As mentioned in the MRI, this sounds to be possible tuberculoma/neurocysticercosis but needs a clinical examination and assessment for the symptoms. Also, due to aging, there will be ischemic/demyelinating changes and which needs as said before a clinical correlation. A neurologist is the one to be visited and have a clinical examination done. Once done examination and correlation with MRI, the clinical provisional diagnosis will be made and the symptomatic treatment will be started. Treatment will include - medication, physical therapy, and diet. If your mother has any other past medical history of High blood pressure of High blood glucose levels than that also will need attention to workout by the cardiologist and the diabetologist.

(In that order). My neck easily cracks when slightly moved from left to right. My back i have to actually crack it like normal people do by sitting down n twisting . Theres really not that much pain unless i bend my neck/back in a certain ways and even those pains are barley there and i think they only are there because the excessive cracking. I ve recently turned 15. this problem started this week starting with the headache. I had lower back pains on the lower right side but that went away for while now. I don t think I have Arthritis because i/m really young and i m not experiencing the slightest bit of excruciating pain. But could this be the start of it? Or is it just Headache and some stiffness cause of not sleeping right/enough or eating right etc? I hope its not Arthritis.","Doctor":"Hello, With history, it does not sound to me that it is arthritis. So you can be relaxed for the same. Now the cracking sound is actually the unlocking of the facet joints, which is once in while common for some. But if it is always associated with relief of back pain and neck pain than its a muscle weakness of the spinal column and an exercise will be of good choice to work behind it. Headache can be cervicogenic headache or due to stress as well. Since you are 15 and having no major traumatic injuries I do not think you will have any major symptoms. But you can get your eye checked once if anything related to the same. Of course sleep is a must to look for, because if you do not sleep well, the body will enter the fatigue state soon and may lead to muscle weakness leading to pain. At the age of 15 doing regular physical aerobic exercises are recommended. Because lack of exercise can cause pain and aches, and at the age of 15 its is hardly acceptable that one will have headaches and back pains. Hope I have answered your query.

A solitary entity such as what you describe is also a highly unlikely cause of the type of headaches you have been having. Have you tried modalities of thermal intervention such as a cold pack or even a warm pack upon the forehead or back of the neck? There is a device specially designed for headache relief using thermal relief that includes light compression of a band strapped to the head that circulates water of regulated temperature called a thermal zone device. You may find this by Googling it. A very large number of my patients with chronic headaches find this to be a very soothing and relaxing intervention. Of course, the mainstay of permanent treatment for such headaches is know their root cause and treat that issue either definitively or preventatively. Seeing a neurologist or headache specialist may help reveal good approaches along those lines. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

It contains Calcium Citrate, Iron 50 mg, and Folic Acid 0.3 mg.   It is indicated for use in lactating women as well as those women who have anemia while pregnant. I can see where someone may believe this to be a MEMORY supplement because of the folic acid element and possibly iron. I would caution you not to take too many of these capsules daily due to the iron content as this could change your bowel habits and you may become constipated. The calcium citrate can also cause side effects that are not pleasant if taken in excessive doses. If you feel your memory is not functioning at peak performance there may be a better solution than to take something like Raricaps though this appears to be relatively safe if taken as directed by a physician. Otherwise, see a doctor who can evaluate you for more specific causes of cognitive/memory dysfunction such as B12 or vitamin D deficiencies, underperforming thyroid gland, as well as other hormonal imbalances).

We used apple juice and suppositories for awhile and the last 2 years she has had bladder infection symptoms. Took her to urologist and he recommended putting her on miralax. Started miralax and it got her going at least 3 times a week rather than once. She started vomiting/diarrhea so we thought she had flu bug. I stopped miralax. It continued off and on for next 2 weeks. Went to pediatrician. They thought it was not viral and sent us to gastrologist. He did xray and she was not constipated and did blood work to rule out celiac. Few days later she was vomiting and diarrhea again. Still not taking miralax. Got blood work back yesterday and no celiac. Told us to give her a colon cleanse with miralax and chocolate exlax. Woke up this morning and it did produce a BM and she s vomiting. Should it cause her to vomit? Is this IBS? Could the miralax be causing the vomiting/diarrhea?","Doctor":"Hello, It would be helpful having at least a fecal analysis if this has been going on and off. It's warranted to rule out a parasitic cause which needs antiparasitic medication. A stool culture could also be helpful to rule out any bacterial infection that is not identified with usual routine labs. This should help your son. Hope I have answered your query.

I have an odd shaped lump or growth in my bottom right ribcage. It feels as if it is growing directly on it. It also feels like a deformed rib sticking out. It does not really hurt when I touch it, but it gives me an unusual sensation when I do touch it. It is under the skin. I can feel it whenever I move a certain way.","Doctor":"Hi, There are a couple of things that come to mind. One is called a lipoma and that may be the most likely type of lump or nodule. Another thing that comes to mind is something called a neuroma. The first item is a tumorous growth of fat tissue (entirely benign and noncancerous) and the 2nd is a tumorous growth of nerve tissue (again benign). Lipomas are never painful unless they are overriding a sensitive structure such as a nerve. Neuromas are often painful when squeezed or compressed but if you leave them alone they'll do the same. In either case, it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a doctor take a look (and a feel) just to make sure all is in order. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Are you having double vision, blurred vision, any balance difficulty while walking, any other neuropathic symptoms? If any of the above is present you should meet up a neurologist and may be an MRI might be needed to understand the center of vision in the brain. The optic nerve also may need testing to understand if any optic nerve pathology is causing this or not.

Well, to answer your query, I would like to tell that expectancy of life cannot be predicted because we do not have much detailed version of history. Also, no one can say what will happen when science has its limitations which you might be aware by now. As your son is autistic and have a seizure disorder, I would like to ask you, how active is your son. Is he able to move around, is he able to walk, run, climb, etc. Is he having any kind of chronic cold or cough issues, etc? If your son is able to move around then maybe making him walk a lot can help improve the lifestyle and the expectancy of life can be improved. Based on the physical examination and also some lab findings we can figure out how to overall improve his lifestyle and avoid getting him into illness more. Medicine department is symptomatic and rests the body heals on its own. Also, for kids with autism, we need to work out with a team of autistic rehabilitation but to say this, I am sorry, we can expect big changes in his overall lifestyle change.

My Doctor prescribed Neuro kind gold capsules one at bed time for 10 days.I do not have B.P or sugar.What is the function of the above Vitamin? please let me know.what could be the cause of this problem?","Doctor":"Hello, Well, since the recent news of how poorly efficacious most multivitamin/multi-mineral preparations do their jobs has become publicized it grounds my feelings that I've had for many years which is anything of a MULTI-anything is likely, not worth the capsule covering it comes in. And Nurokin Gold is no exception in my opinion.  If your right middle finger is numb early morning only then, I wouldn't necessarily be suspicious of a nutritional deficiency so much as I might be concerned about a VASCULAR deficiency or a compression phenomenon going on at least over part of the MEDIAN NERVE that sub-serves sensory function of that finger. I would also recommend measuring serum levels of whichever B vitamin your doctor is apparently concerned about that would cause such an ISOLATED presentation of 1 single middle finger on 1 hand (not a likely presence of a B12, B6, folate, or niacin deficiency in my opinion). Then, based on those lab results I would prescribe the direct and single entity to the patient as necessary. Otherwise, I might consider doing vascular Doppler studies and possibly an EMG/NCV study and maybe even an Ultrasound of the carpal tunnel which could avoid having to stick needles into the arm/hand.

Thank you M.C.O.","Doctor":"Hi, Respiratory disorders including bronchitis, asthma, and pneumonia can all result in solar plexus pain referrals because of the connections with the sympathetic nerves from the bronchi with the network of nerves in this area of the abdomen. If you are just getting over the episode then, trying to take some mild analgesics such as Tylenol or Aspirin for a few days will help relieve the pain but it will resolve with time.

This condition arose after delivery. She has symptoms like, she cannot sit long in a same position. Also she has jerky movements. Having fear of loud sounds, vehicles, staying alone and travelling in a crowded public transports. What can we do?","Doctor":"Hello, Do you mean to say that her condition commenced after SHE was delivered to her mother. OR after she DELIVERED a child? She may be suffering from back pain preventing her from sitting and so she could be evaluated for a condition of sciatica or disk bulging that could cause the problem. Jerky movements should be evaluated by a neurologist specializing in movement disorders and could be related to after effects of anaesthetics used (if the delivery was recent) or it could be something entirely coincidental in terms of De Novo movement disorder. The other issues you mention of the various intolerances to environmental stressors sounds like something that is likely being caused by an inordinate amount of stress upon her. She may find relief by consulting with someone who can talk to her about what sorts of things are going on in her life including recently giving birth (i.e. postpartum depression) and perhaps some mode of either cognitive behavioural therapy or relaxation therapy with breathing techniques to slow down metabolism, visual imagery, and so forth would be helpful to her.

Having said that it is possible that the bulging disks themselves could be resulting in some contribution to the headaches. However, I would also expect to hear something about painful radiating pains from the neck into the shoulders and top portions of the arms and maybe even a stinging pain that goes down to the base of the thumbs. I'd also expect to hear some things to do with numbness and tingling into the upper extremities. If none of that is present then, I may still keep the NEUROSURGEON's appointment. However, I would ask to be sent to a NEUROLOGIST ahead of that May appointment with the surgeon so they can properly evaluate you for something causing the headaches OTHER THAN the bulging disks. You may still find something that is surgically amenable to fixing but at least it may not be cervical disks that could potentially stay where they're at and avoid neck surgery which has its ADVANTAGES.

You say you have become a vegetarian and cut out meat by 90%.  Did you know that Vitamin B12, which is an extremely important nutrient for good brain and nerve health, may be lost if your diet contains very little meat or animal product material? Low Vitamin B12 levels can affect the way a person feels in addition to how they think and process their environment.

The doctors want to prescribe medications that are in the psychiatric catagory and I am not comfortable with this because I am a mental health social worker and know these medication side effects well not to mention I don t need psych meds I am an injury patient not a mental health patient. What can I do?","Doctor":"Hello, Sorry to hear about the history. Coming straight to the point as what I understand is there is damage to the cervical region disc and doing impingement over the nerve as well as locking the facet joint. Due to locking of the facet joints there is stress pull over the para spinal muscles and also the trapezius muscle leading to stiff neck. Once the neck becomes stiff the muscles round and the other front muscles like the sternocleidomastoid muscle also gets spasm leading to disturbed vascular supply and the production of the headache. For this, as mentioned by the neurologist or orthopedists is taking a pain killer. Now you need a competitive physical therapist who can release this spasm and allow the body to have good vascular supply. Neck is due to the locking of the cervical spine facet joints there might be changes in the thoracic spine leading to trapezius muscle real spasm and restricted mobility of muscle and joint's. Releasing all such with MFR and IASTM and TENS therapy with Hot water fermentation should help to some extent to release the spasm and provide some ease. Later stages some exercise too will be advised. I am not sure how far this has to be providing the effect but at least trying out this will be all ways better than psychosocial drugs. As shoulder also got damaged with major muscles, nerves and arteries its needs a real tough hard word by the physical therapist and you to regain some relief. I would not say things aren't possible, but apart from psychological drugs, this is the choice of therapy I can advise you. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I had a MRI done last week and found my back has four disk blown and my neck has two disks blown. The surgeon said they could fuse my back but there is only a 10% chance it will help. The disk in my neck is causing headaches. They are going to do injections in it soon. My right foot is deformed and have been told I need reconstruction surgery on it also. I know the feet can affect the back and the back affects the legs. At this point I am not sure which way to turn. Although I have a high pain tolerance I know I am facing some serious pain. I do not want to live the rest of my life in a drug induced stupor from pain meds. In fact I will NOT exsist like that. Please give me some input.","Doctor":"Hello, Sorry to hear about the list of injuries you faced. Coming to the point, you mentioned that MRI is suggestive of Lumbar and cervical disc degenerative changes. Let's discuss this first and then the rest. What my experience taught me over a period of 12 years with cases related to injuries like you and others I will give my suggestion. First foremost, buy a soft neck collar and start using it. This will stabilize the bones of the cervical region and also will act as s support to the muscular system to allow less compression over the nerve. The disc injuries are most times self healing, once the inflammation subsides you should not feel much pain. When using neck collar I will advice you to use on/off hot water fermentation so that the muscled which have undergone spasm will relax and the pain will come down slowly. Along with this. you have lumbar disc degenerative changes, so why don't you first take hot water fermentation so that the muscles of the lumbar region gets relaxed and make you at least stable. Post this use 3-4 pillows and try McKenzie maneuver in passive way. The details of McKenzie you can find over the net. This will help centralize the pain and once the pain is centralized you can use hot water bag to again soothen the nerve roots. Once nerve root is relaxed the pain travelling in its course will reduce automatically. Post which after 5-7 days of doing this you can focus on exercises but please continue the above advice as well. Exercise should focus on core stability, lower limb strengthening, upper limb strengthening and neck muscle strengthening. Slowly you will develop strength also and the inflammation on the nerve root will be reduced leading to the end result of improved lifestyle. If your pain symptoms are too high then a nerve block may be administered to the nerve root which may block the pain sensation for a couple of months. but if the muscles remain week still, it will again come back so doing the above mentioned exercise will be of help to avoid recurrence of pain symptoms. Coming to the surgical management, there is possibility of removal of the torn disc element and also fusing the spine but this may not make you get rid of the pain over all for long. The pain will be present through out the life and need exercise for the same. This option I do not recommend unless and until the motor functions are compromised. Also, very important is the diet, what you eat is to be focused. Having food which can digest faster without leading to any gastritis should be kept in mind. As with gastritis there may be leading to two symptoms, one compression over the nerve in the lower spine and headache. Having a good diet plan will be good. Please do not ignore the hip and knee muscles as you have the replacement done in the past and the muscles are weak this may aggravate the spine curvature to deviate and lead to other symptoms. Coming to your ankle, I cannot comment much as the history is too brief to guide over anything. I am sorry for it. Please contact a local physical therapist who can show interest in you and give the maximum output. I have tried my best to put forth the best possible treatment plan which should help you. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Now, this is one of the common complaints I have come across the patients I have seen in my clinical experience of 12 years of patients having a shunt. First thing is you need to do is to meet up a neurologist and maybe a scan needs to be done to check the position of the shunt. If the shunt is okay then your optic nerve has to be assessed. Because any changes in the optic nerve can lead to visual changes. Next coming to the headache, post installation of the shunt there will be changes in the pressure within the skull and the brain that is called the intracranial pressure and needs to be assessed by the neurologist so that an actual cause of pain can be figured out. Regarding neck pain, it may be due to changes in muscle strength and cervical disc. A Mri will be of full insight to provide the details and a proper exercise prescription can be handed over. My opinion is to meet up a neurologist, get self-examined in person and take up the call. You should do well. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Kindly suggest what is the action to be taken. Regards, Rachana","Doctor":"Hello, With my clinical practice of 12 years most of the cases with disc herniation, disc degeneration, disc prolapse have responded well to a physiotherapist. As mentioned by you about the MRI report but the main thing which is missing is the clinical symptoms like - pain in lower limb/s, tingling, numbness etc. As MRI is a diagnostic procedure and not a diagnosis we need to compare the clinical symptoms with the MRI reports. If there are no clinical symptoms the MRI cannot be considered as a diagnosis. It is a diagnostic tool to correlate the clinical symptoms. If you have any of the above mentioned clinical symptoms than the treatment part will be this way. If the pain is radiating in nature then first need to try out McKenzie maneuver which you can find online, as this maneuver helps to centralize the pain and thereby stopping the radiation of the pain. Post acquiring the McKenzie maneuver position one needs to use hot water fermentation over the lower back to provide the soothing effect. Post which once pain level falls below the level of 5 in vas Scale of 0-10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is maximum pain. Exercise the core, extensors group of muscles of the spine, hip, thigh, leg, in short, the whole lower limb. In case you are non-diabetic then using icing post-McKenzie maneuver position will also be okay and rest steps as mentioned above. In case you trying for the first time and not getting an idea of how to perform in accuracy than taking guidance from a physiotherapist should be helpful. My experience of 12 years has produced a maximum recovery with the equal support of the patient for this condition.

You need a competitive physical therapist who can understand the RSD. This is a quite complicated one to be handled by a regular therapist. This condition mainly gives sharp shooting pain which is unbearable and uncontrollable by any individual who is undergoing it. In my clinical practice of 12 years seen bunch of cases with RSD and what has done wonders to them is the self-confidence of regaining the movement and also ability to bear the pain beyond the control. There is a saying which I always mention to RSD patients of mine - No pain No gain. So for having gain, let's take up the challenge now without having any kind of delay. This RSD will lead to lot of muscle wasting and also leads to overall weakness. First thing first. Take TENS therapy for a minimum of 30-45 minutes. Start the mobilizing of the limb in passive mode by a physical therapist so the joint get free and also get muscle stretch which might be painful. Again take the TENS therapy for 20-30 minutes if the pain is unbearable. Continue the same till you get adequate movement of the muscle and joint. Please understand that this condition needs a lot more effort from your own side to cooperate with the competitive physical therapist. Use hot water fermentation whenever you find time and post which please do active stretching if you can so that you maintain the mobility achieved while in session. If 8 weeks of proper competitive therapy is followed I am hopeful to get results to the optimum. Coming to the Hip, you need a good muscle strengthening now. having recurrent THR is not a good thing to hear for the surgeon or even the patient. Just that, you need a competitive physical therapist as I mentioned earlier to work on you case. The therapist should show 1000℅  of interest in you and you should show 1000℅ of interest in the therapy to get the cent percent results. I know, this sounds to most as a philosophical talk but the truth is I have achieved results in my RSD and THR patients to the maximum ability of their to have a independent ADL, which is more of the help Therapy takes times but its assurance that it will give wonderful effects if assessed, examined and planner properly.

If you are sexually active and you have just missed your period or are having some type of spotting of implantation then, the pink discharge could make sense along with the other problems as a sign of a pregnancy in progress.

I then raise the bottom leg up as an exercise and with each raise you can literally hear my spine grind. There is no pain, just a scrubbing noise.","Doctor":"Hi, If what you describe is painless then, it is not likely that you are suffering from any significant arthritic degenerative disease responsible for the sounds especially if you are able to rotate your spine in the fashion you mention and raise the leg. The noises you hear could be the sliding of tendons and ligaments over each other or over edges of vertebral bodies as you raise the leg since the rotation of the spine places the transverse processes at 90 degrees to normal which allows tendon gliding to occur over a different base skeletal structure.

MRI SCAN OF CERVICAL SPINE REPORT- REVEALS LOSS OF CERVICAL LORDOSIS, NO EVIDENCE OF GIST BLUEB, CENTRAL CANAL & SPINAL CORD APPEARS NORMAL pls tell us the treatment ...another MRI REPORT has also been attached.","Doctor":"Hello, Loss of the cervical lordosis probably doesn't really anything, however, most clinicians take that as a radiographic sign suggestive of neck muscle tightening or spasming. The words, \\"GIST BLUEB\\" do not make any sense. There must be some type of transcriptional mistake in the report or you miscopied something- those words do not have any meaning in English. Normal central canal and spinal means that no pathology in the spinal cord at the level of the spinal canal exists. Treatment could be therapy (maybe even aquatherapy) for the neck as well as massage, thermal therapy, and perhaps some type of pain medication if the neck remains very painful.

However, the hit did not leave a bump and I did not have any signs of a concussion. Also later in the night, my friend and I were play wrestling and I think he strained my neck a little. One day later, I started to experience pressure in the back of the head and a slight feeling of being spaced out. Everything else, however, is fine. What do you recommend I do / how long do you think these symptoms will last. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi, My best advice is that you be checked out by a doctor who is experienced in examining for and diagnosing concussions and traumatic brain injuries. Even though you say you had no signs or symptoms of a concussion you're not a trained expert. Taking a direct fall on solid concrete while running and striking your head almost invariably causes symptoms of a concussion which doesn't mean you have to have lost consciousness or been suffering from major headaches immediately afterwards. You may very well be exhibiting symptoms of what we call postconcussive syndrome and these can last from several days to several months and in rare cases, several years. If you are feeling \\"spaced out\\" then, at the very least I would recommend getting a CT scan of the brain and if I were your treating or examining neurologist I would likely order an MRI of the brain which can demonstrate contusions of the brain much better than any other testing sequence.

That is all I have done in a very long time I feel stupid.","Doctor":"Hi, It is certainly possible that metabolites of cocaine can show up in the urine. In urine tox screens I have found that patients who are willing to report their activities stand a more likely chance of overcoming their behaviors going forward than by trying to keep it a secret since often times lab results do come out positive and then, things get more complicated.

I don't think I would use the exact terminology you've used to tell one of my patients with the condition about how they are or where I think things will go. There are many alternatives to medications which are in general poorly effective. I understand the problems you're having with trying to move about and get up from a supine position but I think it is good, very good that you are trying and constant mobilization as you're doing, though painful, is one of the best therapies you can afford. There are numerous exercises and I am a huge advocate of aquatherapy for my patients with osteoarthritis who are willing to get in a pool with a therapist. It is relaxing, quite therapeutic, and has been shown to actually improve joint and connective tissue function in order to slow down the progressive nature of the problem which is linked to age. However, this doesn't mean you can do something to combat it. Take a look at the Arthritis Foundation's website. They have all sorts of options to look at in terms of exercise, diet, and therapies for the problems you have. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care.

The problem is getting reinjected in the same area and this could reactivate you after effects.

In my clinical experience, most cases perform well with a combination of drug and exercise therapy.

If you are certain that you struck your head against something in the car and immediately following the blow to the head you suffered any DISRUPTION or LAPSE in awareness or consciousness or if you are unable to recall good detail of what happened just before or after the accident then, you may wish to see a neurologist with concussion experience for a 2nd opinion.

Her heart stop and they had to revive her she is now in a coma. the doctor said she did not have a stroke, heart A. or blood clots What is going on?, my cousin had a tripple bypass about a week ago. She went through fine.What brought on the coma?","Doctor":"Hello, If her heart stopped and she had to be revived then, one of the more likely things that happened resulting now in a comatose state would be BRAIN ANOXIA which refers to a severe lack of oxygen to the brain during the time that the heart was stopped. Even though there was no heart attack per se according to the doctor something obviously happened to actually bring the heart to a standstill. There are usually classic radiographic features to brain anoxia after an event like this. I would focus attention on the PONS region of the brainstem which is where the most likely damage would be done to cause a generalized comatose state. Hope I have answered your query.

The weakness and imbalance occurred to you are sad to hear, as you do not have any specific lesion in the brain issue. This could be related to temporarily headache and needs to check once if you had an injury in the past or present taking to the head. At many times we avoid such small injuries and feel it's not major at all. Well, if you have not met any injury then as per me you do not need to worry. The age you mentioned is 37, which is pretty young to have any kind of major disorders if you are not a smoker or an alcohol drinker. How about your blood pressure? Have you ever checked with it? Sometimes due to high blood pressure and tension people may suffer a headache which is called a tension headache. The imbalance may be due to lack of confidence sometimes. So I do not think you should worry more. You can start doing morning jogging and some basic general exercise along with cycling should help you feel more balanced. Hope I have answered your query.

I was diagnosed with 2 bulging discs in my lower neck (I don t remember exactly where they are) and I went to a chiropractor for some relief. After that visit I ended up in the ER unable to twist or bend my neck/back and since then I have had chronic pain. I ve gone through physical therapy, done cold and heat therapy, etc..

It is sad and frustrating that the medical team is not able to help you have a good lifestyle in ADL. Coming to the point, there will be injuries due to accidents. Some will be shown that time and some will come to a later stage of life Now bringing the fact that you have spine issues and also the pain in multiple joints which includes the knee, shoulder, elbow, fingers etc., I can tell you that you need to first start your day while taking a good hot water bath in the morning. Post that you should start doing basic and simple exercise to keep the muscle active as much as you can. Something like pilates, aerobic exercise and some basic strengthening exercise. Also will advise you to buy one pocket TENS machine, which can help you reduce pain without taking much of the painkillers. Having too much of painkillers will only make you more trouble in the upper stages of life. So the non-trouble option will be buying the Pocket TENS machine which is widely available for commercial and personal use. Now as your job profile is about standing and working more, that means you need to improve your stamina to withstand the day. Well, currently we do not have any medication to improve the stamina but exercise is the option which can help you regain the stamina to pass the day. As you had an injury with an accident and having too many muscle weakness with pain, the only solution I See is to keep the body as much possible active you can with exercise. I have seen many cases with such issues and most of them are better with regular exercises. Having accept to the fact that every human has their limitations and so does medical. Hope you understand that the solution is with you and you need to do regular exercise and make your muscles strong and stronger.

Any time anybody suddenly loses consciousness causing loss of control of a vehicle or otherwise, causing damage due to unawareness of the environment or how they are behaving, etc. should be considered as suffering from a medical emergency. That person should be transported to the hospital for a full and complete evaluation.  At the very least they should be restricted from driving a vehicle until further notice.

It is important to know what type of seizures they are talking about when they tell you they are expected to subside with age.  For example, could they be the Absence type?  Or the Rolandic epileptic type?  I think it is important for you to know the name of the type of epilepsy your son's doctor has diagnosed which then, makes it easier for you to investigate in terms of the likelihood that it will disappear and perhaps not require treatment at this time...though you may have evidence to the contrary. If your son's spells place him in harm's way by any means then, you must make this clear to his doctor so that even if his episodes are expected to subside the interim use of some control agent is still likely a good idea.

First line treatment consists usually of pain killers and physical therapy. Alternative medicine options such as chiropractic, acupuncture, TENS etc may also be tried at times when physical therapy doesn't help. If symptoms persist then imaging preferably with MRI is advised. If a specific origin location is found then local injections are the next step.

I also get really cold hands and feet during the winter and my fingers turn white and then bright blue (it feels like someone is burning my hands) do you know what this could be as well?","Doctor":"Hello, The symptoms you describe seem to correspond to pre-syncope, which is usually due to a temporary lack of blood flow or metabolic issues. An ECG was a good starting point but since the episodes are continuing more prolonged monitoring of heart rhythm is advised through 24-48 hour Holter ECG portable device. A heart ultrasound might be needed as well. Some routine blood tests are also usually done for metabolic origins. As for the finger changes, it sounds like the Raynaud syndrome. It may be isolated but more often is part of other conditions, like rheumatological connective tissue disorders, so more blood tests on that regard are needed as well.

Cervical straightening of the cervical lordosis is often taken as a sign of muscle tightening or spasming that could account for some of the pain. Your best approach to treating this problem would be to start with some form of cervical physical therapy and even AQUATHERAPY itself may be very helpful given the MRI findings. Your doctor would best be able to counsel you on the use of acute pain management medications since they know your history and other medications you may already be taking.

I am concerned about damage to your brain which will explain the loss of feeling in the right foot and then, vertigo or spinning as a chronic symptom that may never get better unless you literally give your brain a significant amount of time off. Your mood swings may also be an indication that the concussions you've had are beginning to accumulate to critical levels and potentially could be affecting your personality and behavior to a point where people may even think you have anger management issues (and you just may at that). You should be evaluated by a neurologist knowledgeable in TBI's and concussive sports injuries because there are tests that will help locate and define the problem. You can clearly benefit from an MRI of the brain (at least) as well as blood work and some other tests to get a better handle on what these symptoms are not. If you continue as you are and do not suspend activities as a boxer you are risking permanent and even escalated damages than what may have already occurred. I know this since I treat many veterans of wars who experience very severe traumatic brain injuries (TBI's) from IED blasts, falls, and motor vehicle accidents.

However, if that's what the problem is then, the only definitive surgery to relieve your symptoms is surgical. Otherwise, the result could be an acute case of hydrocephalus which you likely experience not too infrequently. It also depends how the cyst was initially removed...if by aspiration then, recurrence rates are high usually requiring repeat procedures.  Definitive results can be obtained by radical excision or stereotactically guided microsurgical techniques nowadays has resulted in a much higher success rate than ever before.  Check in with academic teaching hospitals in your area.  The neurosurgical dept. likely has dedicated surgeons to this sort of procedure using latest approaches. Consultation with a different neurosurgical service may also provide you with more answers to the dilemma which I understand is on your mind regarding the risks of another surgery.

Julie Smith","Doctor":"Hello, The surgery in your case aims to relieve the compression from the nerves and spinal cord and to maintain the stability of the cervical spine. This is achieved by posterior laminectomy (removal of posterior bony parts of the vertebrae ) with or without spinal stabilization (it depends on the extension of the laminectomies and number of levels involved).

If you are not being followed by at least a NEUROLOGIST (better yet, EPILEPTOLOGIST) then, I would make the request of your PMD. Phenytoin (generic for EPTOIN) at 100mg. is clearly not therapeutic for you since you continue having seizures. If you've not had blood levels checked recently then, that would be the 1st step. Second step: if you ARE therapeutic then, consideration to raising your dose to at least 3X daily should be given as this is a more convenient way for someone to take this medication.

In your area of complaints, swelling, WINGING SCAPULA, or any other physical evidence of trauma or positional entrapment of even blood vessels in the area that can occur from sitting too long in one position, sleeping on the affected side without moving enough, etc. An EMG/NCV study could demonstrate abnormalities of nerves and muscles in this region as well. Also, I would recommend either a CT or PLAIN X-RAYS of the thoracic spine and right shoulder girdle in both flexion and extension positions (something not able to be done on an MR scanner) which can demonstrate other causes of this sort of pain such as arthritic degeneration, scoliosis, other skeletal abnormalities irritating structures in that region.

This could contribute to blacking out spells. Of course, blacking out from drinking excessively can simply be from how the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) behaves under the influence of ALCOHOL which is a DEPRESSANT type of chemical. In other words, maintaining a state of alertness after having drunk excessively is difficult and people can just pass out from overly concentrated the chemical in the bloodstream. Stating that you are in \\"premium shape physically\\" but drinking excessive amounts of alcohol is non-sequitur. Excessive alcohol intake over time will weaken the heart and lead to early congestive failure weakening of the cardiac muscle which cannot be reversed and damages the central nervous system which in the long run can lead to dementing illnesses and alterations in behaviour and personality.

You should talk to your doctor about any new prescriptions recently given to you in the past few days to few weeks either by them or even by some other doctor for a different problem. The cause of such problems is usually readily identifiable after reviewing your medications and personal health history and correctable. Hope I have answered your query.

Would you put this in simple terms. She was diagnosed w/a grade II astrocytoma in June 2011 & underwent radiation. Currently on Avastin.","Doctor":"Hello, I think you have a typo in your statement. You may have meant to say T2 flair signal areas in the cerebral white matter. In plain terms? Well, your sister's brain lobes in the front (on both sides) are demonstrating what is referred to as white matter degeneration which means that either the capillaries feeding the deeper parts of the brain are clotting off and causing the very smallest of infarcts or that the neurons are losing their protein insulation coverings which is technically referred to as demyelination. Radiation therapy to the brain is known to cause radiographic signs of white matter degeneration within 18 months of receiving the treatments so I'm not surprised at the read given her treatment that was given. It is not suggesting that there is any recurrence of a tumour if that's what you may be concerned about right now. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care.

This is not typical for me and I just want to know if this is because of the diet I am on or just an extreme case of pms.","Doctor":"Hello, I have gone through your question and understand your concern. The cause of symptoms could be excess stress and diet modification. It is less likely to be caused by pms. I would suggest you to relax, keep your self well hydrated, and if possible get your blood pressure monitored. Since, excess physical strain, and sweating during fitness routine can lead to dehydration and hypotension. I would advise you to take oral re-hydration fluids, and if the diet you are following permits you can even take vitamin B complex supplement as it helps improving energy.

I ve 18 brain surgeries dealing with this since birth. The last 16 of them since 2005, as well as migraines. I ve had every kind of problem with the shunt since 2005 that shows a problem. Except now. My last surgery was done last year. I ve had fevers as high as 100.5 with nausea, pain where the shunts located. Now there s something new. There are red marks around the shunt on the abdomen. Plus a burning sesation though out most of it. My mom(who s an RN) has never heard of this. I m have testing done tomorrow morning. I see the doctor again in 2 days. Do you have any idea why the burning sensation has been here for the past 4 days, & what could be done? Thank You For Your Opinion!","Doctor":"Hi, The sensation of burning on the skin is usually attributed to the irritation of some nerve or nerves in the area. The redness is usually taken to be a sign of some type of inflammation under the skin or subcutaneous tissues, often times as the result of an infection or other forms of irritation from a foreign body or toxic substance. The first thing I believe needs to be ruled out is an infection in the abdominal area where the shunt is placed. The 2nd thing is to be sure that the shunt is not broken or otherwise not working the way it should for some reason. So that I can see the surface anatomy you are referring that appears red please send a digital photograph. Don't use a flash device for lighting. Just regular ambient lighting is fine. I would think that an ultrasound would be one of the best and least invasive imaging studies to obtain in order to see what might be in the area of the shunt to explain the redness and burning sensations.

Another possibility to explain a \\"lump\\" on your spine would be the development of what is called a kyphosis.  However, these are generally rapidly growing as yours seems to be nor do they typically obstruct head movement. You also may have torticollis which is a spasming of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on either the right or left side which would definitely make it difficult and painful to move the head.

Usually, there are multiple cysts that develop over that period of time and patients decline and have other problems such as seizures and brain bleeds. Please upload a copy of the MRI report as a PDF file. Aside from the diagnosis of cysticercosis, I would also consider a diagnosis of tuberculoma, cryptococcal infection (again difficult to believe she could be a chronic carrier, untreated without other symptoms in 4 years), or old brain bleed.  She could also have a lesion of cerebral sarcoid. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Ideally, I would need to examine her for a complete diagnosis. However, I would like to explain it like this- 1. the weird, often bitter taste in the mouth with excess watering could be due to severe gastritis. 2. the dizziness may be a vasovagal reaction to the above which may be \\"near syncope\\". I would recommend starting with Pantoprazole tablet twice a day before meals and taking plenty of fluids. As for the tests, I would suggest testing 1. EEG 2. Echocardiography and 3.

I think that an appointment with a doctor as soon as possible is the next step for you to see whether a quick ULTRASOUND or another imaging study would be worthwhile. Certainly, I would also order bloodwork looking for infectious or other causes for swelling.  I would definitely NOT LANCE anything at this point unless the doctor themselves.

This is a feeling of movement, spinning, tumbling, or being pushed to the side.  There are many potential causes. If she is standing up to 10 min. before this actually starts to happen then, in fact, BLOOD PRESSURE problems (i.e. DROP in blood pressure) is a very real possibility. She should be tested for what is called ORTHOSTATIC BLOOD PRESSURES and perhaps, even better yet, get tested on a TILT TABLE which usually takes about 30 min. and is even a more precise way of measuring this phenomenon. There are other potential problems including side effects or interactions of medications that she may be taking that are new within the past 4-6 weeks. With the pain of the scalp (ALLODYNIA) she may be experiencing PSEUDOAURA symptoms to an aborted migraine headache so that another possible diagnosis may be atypical VERTIGINOUS MIGRAINE headache. It is atypical in the sense she doesn't have vegetative symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, etc. Otherwise, this is what the diagnosis may be as well in which case you need to consult a headache specialist or neurologist for further assistance so that proper testing and medication may be prescribed.

If you've had this condition for a couple of weeks then, the feeling of numbness on that same side is where the nerve is being compressed or pinched would be a reasonable factor to consider as causative of the condition.

The most likely cause of this finding is from loss of calcium in the vertebral body which fractured. The remedy is to increase your body's calcium retention and incorporation into your skeleton. If you don't fix that then, no matter job you have you will still be open to the same problem in some other vertebral body later on. Make sense? If you have back pain and that is the reason you had this x-ray taken then, you may have to find less strenuous ways of doing your job for the time being until you correct the cause of this problem and also to make sure you don't fracture another spinal body.

There is no abnormality that is worried about on the basis of such sounds unless there is the pain, weakness in a limb, or loss of sensation when a joint is flexed, extended, or rotated.

Long story short, she is 66, diabetic. We believe she had the stroke, then went to bed afterwards. We found her unable to wake up the next morning (about 12 hours later). Called an ambulance, she went into cardiac arrest at the hospital, she developed septic shock, which she miraculously recovered from. This all left her with brain damage to the frontal lobes. Doctors completely gave up to her, told us that she will never get better and to put her in hospice. Hospice told us that she was NOT eligible, because she was and is NOT on any type of life support. We bought some baby food and took her home, where she is now receiving in home hospice care. It has been 4 months and she is still alive, her vitals are good. She eats a soft diet everyday and we just started her on cereals and soups. She swallows and drinks perfectly and definitely WANTS the food. She is bed bound, we change her diapers and bathe her. She does not respond to commands, but it seems like she tries to touch her nose when asked, but she is TOO weak to do it. So, we are cautious about giving her the Glasgow scale assessment, because maybe she really is just too weak to lift her arm (we want to be fair to her). She has trouble speaking, but inconsistently will say yes , no and small phrases like Stop it Kim or Oh sure or That s good or Shut up or she will nod her head when asked a question. At times, she will say things that we cannot understand, but we can see that she is trying to communicate something...The problem and reason for for me reaching out to you today is that sometimes she looks spaced out, not fully there, like she s looking off into space. Her eyes will be looking up to the right direction and she is not saying anything. She looks like she is not fully there . We know it is the brain damage she suffered, but we are wondering IF she will pass through this stage or is this the best she will be? And what state of consciousness would you say she is in? Again, it has been 4 months since the initial stroke and she is 66.","Doctor":"Hello, It would be useful to have the imaging reports to understand the extent of the damage, but however by your account on what the doctors said it is clear it was a case of massive damage. Frontal damage is commonly associated with apathy and depression so those episodes where she doesn't seem to be there may be in that setting. Epileptic seizures would be another possibility so you should watch her for abnormal, even subtle, movements in her face and limbs. As for her level of consciousness since it seems she is able to obey some commands, pronounce some phrases and alert I would say her consciousness is intact, inability to communicate is probably related to damage to the language areas, not due to a diminished level of consciousness. As for expected improvement. Improvement is expected in the first 6 months, afterwards very little can be expected. However most improvement takes place during the first 3 months, so while there may be some advanced in the next 2-3 months it should be a minor one, she will probably remain bedbound I am afraid.

However, before accepting that you should discuss with the doctors how did they reach that conclusion. One single seizure doesn't make the diagnosis of epilepsy, only when there are repeat seizures. So it's unclear how did they decide that, did they see other more subtle seizures, did they see abnormal activity on EEG or epileptogenic focus on MRI?

For the past 4 days I ve nearly blacked out every day and the back of my neck and bottom of head feel like there s loads of pressure.

I am suffering from left thigh frontal burning pain, and recently bruising. What would my condition be..The doctors I have seen have bot made a diagnosis. Thank you kindly, Irene Kiffe","Doctor":"Hi, I am happy to answer your question but letting you know that burning in the left thigh can definitely be caused by spinal canal stenosis of the lumbar portion of the column by compressing anything from L1-L3 (Lumbar 1- Lumbar 3 nerve roots). The best way to relieve this sensation is to first undergo physical therapy to try and release the compressive forces through activity, massage, etc.  Then, there are medications that can lessen the pain. Finally, if none of those methods relieves your symptoms it is possible that surgery can be performed, however, this is dependent upon how severe the canal stenosis is and how long the stenotic portion is since it is too long the surgery may produce worse pain symptoms during recovery than what you already have. It is a dilemma to be sure. But just attack it step by step. Save surgery for last in my opinion. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Dariush Saghafi, Neurologist"},{"Patient":"Hi, I m from Canada and had a few arguments with my neurologist and now I just want a few other opinion. I had in November 2012 a working accident, were I fell 8 of a roof straight on my feet and with my left foot I hit a rock and kinked my ankle and that s how I broke a few pieces of an inner bone off about 15mm x 10mm x 5mm was the biggest but that they found out a year and five month later because thats when they did the surgery . The rock I landed on with my foot was small but I guess I was stiff or something when I landed. I tried to walked but it was to pain full and I right away noticed that I got dizzy and tried to sit down but later woke up laying on the ground. I don t know for how long it all was but I then somehow got to my company van and drove to the shop which was just 2 miles away. There they dropped me off at the hospital and they did a x-ray but could t see anything just a big swelling and then they send me home. About 3 month after I started to have seizures and it got worse and worse till they did the surgery and then things went better and I was seizure free, but all with medication. It went good till September 2015, suddenly in the evening I was sitting down and I had a seizure and hard one. Till know I m not really recovered, lots of headaches, dizzy, bad hearing, beeping in the ears, hands and face is getting num. But I never had that before the last seizure. My questions are: as a child when I was 8 I had encephalitis but recovered 100% (that it shows in my documents) and there were no signs of seizures because I had to go for EEG s and MRI s every few month after I was diagnosed with encephalitis and later every few years and there was nothing. It all happened after the accident that the seizure started. Is there any possibility that the seizure come from the accident? Because I lost consciousness after the fall, is that normal? It was snow and icy and I was wearing a toque. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, If I understand you right there was no hit to the head, no direct head injury from the fall, you say to have fallen straight on your feet. In that case, I don't see any link between the seizures and the fall unless there is a brain injury there is no reason for a fall to cause seizures. Loss of consciousness was most likely a vasovagal syncope, a common cause of loss of consciousness due to increased vagal activity often related to stress and pain which I suppose were present after that fall. Tough to throw any hypothesis about the origin of the seizures as you provide no info on current brain imaging and EEG results, you mention only those after the childhood encephalitis. It is unclear why you had surgery for seizure as well, surgery is rarely used for seizures, usually when there is a tumor or some other type of brain lesion as a source. So please provide more info on that regard if you are to resume this discussion. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

What could it be.","Doctor":"Hi, The sharp pains you describe are consistent with an entity known as either \\"jabs and jolts\\" or \\"ice pick\\" headaches. These are 2 names for the same disorder which comes under the more general rubric of the trigeminal autonomic cephalgias. In other words, these are not migraines or tension types headaches although it is possible that eyestrain could be a contributory and even prior type of headaches from looking at the computer screen or not using proper prescription glasses. Your best bet to combat these headaches is to find a headache specialist or neurologist in order to review options. Indomethacin is the drug of 1st choice but in my experience with this drug in my headache clinic there is a poor overall compliance rate due to its GI side effect profile. Another possible treatment for this condition is high dose melatonin.  However, I would not go out and simply do this type of treatment (even though it's OTC medication and may seemingly be safe). Melatonin in high doses can react with other medications you may be taking causing unsafe symptoms and even harm. You'll need a doctor to guide your use of either the melatonin and certainly the Indomethacin. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

What you describe is not an uncommon complication from such a surgery. However, depending on the type of tumor it was- perhaps the risks of taking it out (resulting in your facial, hand, and leg paralysis) were judged to be worth the benefit of removing that foreign mass which may have been causing problems due to elevated intracranial pressure, headaches, other symptoms of weakness, etc. The good news, however, is that 1 year postsurgery is not necessarily that much time for full recovery and I believe it is still possible that with rehabilitation assistance you may still be able to obtain some type of recovery. You should investigate something called Functional Electrical Stimulation therapy (FES). Even after 1 year there may still be a window of opportunity if you can find a center that has this capability to treat patients with similar problems. Unfortunately, I live in the United States therefore, I do not know how to direct you to any specialists in your geographic area. My recommendation is that you call a local hospital and ask for assistance. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Results showed: tiempo parcial de tromboplastina 23.7*, reacciones febriles- Tífico “o” positivo 1:320, Brucella Abortus positivo 1:320, Proteus OX-19 positivo 1:320, albumina 5.1*, globulina 2.7* I don’t know what this means, and my doctor did not want to accept these test results and did not even want to see them to help me. I am now in the process of switching doctors. Is there any way you can help tell me what this means?","Doctor":"Hi, I am very familiar with the meanings of these results, The parcial De tormboplastina or PTT in English is a measure of coagulation factor activity (i.e. how fast the blood clots) and your case appears roughly normal though you did not provide the laboratory normal values to know for sure. It could possibly be slightly low but I don't believe it's clinically significant since it is so close to the \\"textbook normal\\" numbers. The albumin and globulin are measures of protein content in your body.  They appear to be within normal limits. The positive Typhoid O protein of 1:320 is part of what is referred to as a WIDAL agglutination test used to diagnose typhoid fever. However, though it was widely used as clinical evidence to treat people with typhoid fever it is no longer recognized as acceptable because of the very low sensitivity and specificity of the test. What is considered the gold standard for diagnosing a patient with typhoid fever is the isolation and culturing of the organism which means that blood, urine, and other secretions, as well as bone marrow biopsies, are obtained if clinical suspicion for this infection is high. I suspect this is the likely explanation as to why your doctor didn't want to look at the test results. However, under the circumstances, if I were involved in the care of a patient with your symptoms and all tests were negative to explain your symptoms and if the patient did have a recent history of travel to a 3rd world country or may have been contaminated by food or water supplies where they live then, I would consider the possibility of an enteric or other type of infectious process and either culture the patient myself or send them to an infectious disease specialist who is known for working with patients with these sorts of traveler's infections.  However, the test for brucellosis you present does appear to peak my attention a bit since it is in a significant range of 1:320.  If your blood, stool, or urine were to be cultured positive for the Brucellosis organism then, together with the titer results you would more likely than not have a case of HUMAN Brucellosis which could be treated successfully with an antibiotic. Once again, I understand why your doctor may be hesitant to accept the results of the Typhoid O titers but I think attention could be paid to the Brucellosis titers since lab studies detecting antibodies are still considered to be quite valid to make a diagnosis, even more so when combined with positive culture results.

Speaking in general about brain damage due to a blood clot in the brain what your doctor has told you is correct. Such brain damage is permanent. Improvement is hoped when damage is not too extensive, but it is due to the undamaged brain compensating for the damaged cells, that process requires months and it is usually a partial improvement not 100% of the previous state.

Seizures originate in the brain which is confined inside the skull, the lumb on the outside of the skull is not in contact and can't irritate brain cortex to cause seizures.

He was lifting weights doing an overhead press. He felt a pop or crack in his neck and some pain. very soon after that he got a Migrane headache. He has got them before when he didn t have good sleep habits. This Migrane seemed stronger than previous ones but he did not throw up. The next day he woke up with a very sore neck and numbness on the left side of his body. The numbness was in the back of his arm and down his leg. We took him to the hospital and he started a bunch of tests. MRI s, Echo, ect. Things they found were. The possibility of two very small dots on the occiptial lobe of the brain which they said could be there and if so could represent a stroke but also could not really be there. They said he has Chiari Type 1 which could be the cause. They don t believe there has been a disection of arteries in the neck according to MRI s. He did not have a PFO. We left the hospital yesterday with a wide range of possibilities from very scary to no big deal. He continues to have numbness in his left arm and leg. Also he hasn t had a stool movement for a couple of days which is atypical. My questions are 1. If its just a pinched nerve then how long would the numbness typically last. 2. from looking at the information on the web is it possible he had a Sporadic Hemiplegic Migraine (SHM) and if so how long does the numbness usually last in those cases. 3. Does the Chiari have an effect on the nervous system after an injury. The web seems contradictory in this area. 4. Can a stroke or mini stroke be associated with a minor neck injury. 5. How do we know if the chiari is affecting his nervous system. My son is a college football player and its a big part of his life. So this has the family very concerned.","Doctor":"Hi, I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your son's symptoms could be related to a possible stroke. Regarding the pinched nerve in the neck, it would also cause irradiating pain in the arm, triggered by neck movements. So, I don't think this is the case. Besides, it would be signs of spinal canal compression or stenosis in the cervical spine MRI study.  Regarding the dots in the occipital lobe, there is a special sequence in MRI, which is called DWI, which can differentiate if they are acute or old. Regarding Migraine, it could be migraine if the numbness recovered within 72 hours, but it is usually associated to motor deficits too. The Chiari malformation can trigger headache and neck pain during an injury, but it usually causes chronic signs like headache, dizziness, gait imbalance, etc. It does not lead to such acute clinical situation. Anyway a follow up every 12 months with brain MRI is necessary to see if the cerebellar tonsils are in the same position or if there is presence of siringomyelia (which is a common complication of Chiari malformation).

The most pain was a monthe ago for me and right now my daughter hurts to sit and even coughing and sneezing.","Doctor":"Hi, I have never heard of any such infections. In fact, it does not make much sense given the anatomical separation and other barriers. Coughing and sneezing through a mechanical process is the most likely cause. After all, mother and daughter are likely to share the same anatomy and a plethora of other shared factors. Your pain improved, your daughter's pain should improve as well.

Such patients are aged 55 years or older and have slowly progressive and asymmetric parkinsonism with resting tremor and bradykinesia or rigidity.

At first I couldn t sleep for 5 days straight, I do not use drugs. My skin turned white and purple. I had started to see things and felt poisoned. I knew something was wrong. My head felt very heavy, my neck was so sore that I couldn t turn it even a little. My heart was skipping beats(The last sentence has been things that have been going on for some time) . Then one day I had my friend s daughter over and she asked me why my nose was so red. I had no idea. I looked in the mirror and there it was, bright red. I knew right then I had to get to the doctor asap, again. On my way to the doctor I started feeling very strange. Nothing seemed real. As soon as we got to the doctor while I was checking in the rash (was hot to touch) moved down one arm and then the next. It was worse and worse. I became delierious. I couldn t think right. I had such a great amount of pressure inside of my head and down my neck. I was so out of it I wasn t even scared. The doctor did tons of tests but ended up sending me home. I have no idea why... This has happened many times. The last time I went to the hospital they admitted me because I had slipped into a whole different world. They kept me for a few days and couldn t figure out what was wrong. I went into a cataconic state, pretty much a coma. When I woke up they sent me home. They gave me no answers. I kept asking them to test for menigitus but they wouldn t. Even my mom asked them to when I was in a coma. It took me months to finally start thinking clearly let alone talk right. I still have pressure around my head and in my neck. Some days I can t even talk right. Do you think that I should go back to the ER and make them take the test? Can menigitus come and go or go dormant for awhile and come back? I have had so many issues the past few years including high fevers between 103-105 and this last one almost killed me. My body almost completely shut down on me. What should I do? What can I do? I am a very active and healthy person when I dont have my flare up. I eat well and have no drug problems. Please, any suggestions would be great. I just want to be better. I am only 24 and that is why so many doctors tell me that I couldn t possibly have the problems that I think I may have. Thank you for your time and sorry to make this so long. I am just terrified. I have a 14 month old baby and 3 other children that need their mommy. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Andrea I am sorry. I can no longer get your answer, I would love to but have no way to pay for it. I don t have a credit card. Sorry for your time.","Doctor":"Hi, In fact, the headache and confusion may be caused by meningitis however your story does not look like meningitis. Patient with meningitis are very sick and they are rarely missed. Meningitis would cause great loss if left untreated for more then 1 or 2 days. And more importantly, a lot of tests would be abnormal. So while this is possible that meningitis may be rarely recurrent (Mollaret meningitis) but your story is not like meningitis. Howe'ver the problem needs to be assessed by a neurologist as what could be your problem. This may be anxiety, but other brain disorders like epilepsy or mass should be ruled out. I don't think you need to go to the ER until very sick but you definitely need to be seen by a neurologist for proper assessment and management. Hope I have answered your question. I will be glad to answer any further question about this.

It is apparent you are having difficulty with getting enough sleep but the incidence and prevalence of SFI are so rare that other things should be ruled out first. I recommend that you see a neurologist at first opportunity to do a good history and physical examination. It also seems appropriate that you should undergo a sleep study for your insomnia and that will provide a good amount of information which can then, be correlated to any history that may explain why the sudden onset of these sleep problems. From there additional studies such as MRI imaging of the brain and so forth can be determined although once again, the rarity of this problem would make it highly unlikely that you should have it as opposed to other problems of either an organic or psychological nature that could better explain your symptoms.

Some authors would say that limits for tacrolimus are 5-10 while others allow the upper limit to ride out to 15. Therefore, if the lab range is the former you would be approximately 50% above normal and this could signal too much tacrolimus in your system. If the lab range is the latter then, the result of 15.7 is not significantly higher than normal... unless you are feeling some sort of symptom or experiencing some sort of organ insufficiency or failure over the past 6 months making it a significant number.

Is there any other way to test for sleep apnea other than to go to a paper thin walled small room and be hooked up to 25 wires and three different machines and then try to sleep while someone is watching you through a camera as well? He said the three times he has had his AFIB attacks he has slept in his chair before going to work and has woke up at least 10 times at one time because he was not breathing. Since then he has laid down on the floor to nap before work and that has seem to help not cut off his air passage as much by laying down on the floor. Can a doctor recommend a Sleep apnea machine without all of the results from a sleep study test?","Doctor":"Hi, A sleep study can be done within the comforts of one's own home. This would make him less claustrophobic. CPAP machine can not be advised without confirming obstructive sleep apnea. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

This was in 2007 and also that year, after many episodes of chest pains, I was diagnosed with a flextion deformity in the arch of my aorta. My aorta is only 1/3 the size it should be, resulting in tachycardia, and almost daily chest pains. I also have severe hypertension. I had no insurance at the time, and moved to Colorado where I qualified for Medicaid. Over the last few years, I have noticed I can t concentrate on anything, and certainly can t finish anything I start. My mind is like a whirlwind. As a former nurse, I know something is wrong. I just can t focus. The meds. I take for my brain lesions is Norco 10/325 & Valium 10 mg. for headaches. For the other I take Norvasc 5 mg. HCTZ, & Lisinopril 20 mg. and Trazadone 50 mg. for sleep which does not usually work and I rarely take. This issue with my thought process is what bothers me the most as I can t think straight. I don t hear voices, but it seems in my head, I m telling myself to do 10 different things at one time. My lesions seem under control as I haven t had a seizure in years, but of course I take my Valium regularly. My flexion deformity of my aorta will always be with me, as a cardiologist in Birmingham, AL told me to go home and enjoy the rest of my life. I can t enjoy my life with my mind whirling around at 100 miles per hour. Any help for me?","Doctor":"Hello, I am afraid that more information is necessary for the nature of that brain lesion. A brain lesion can mean anything, it can be a tumour, an infection, a stroke, inflammation, trauma, hypoxic injury etc. It's impossible to make suggestions without knowing what it is. Some brain injuries remain the same, some may worsen with no available treatments, some may improve or even be cured, so it's impossible to make any prediction or recommendations for any lesion. The precise nature must be cleared out. So please look into your medical records about the precise diagnosis and feel free to write again. Hope I have answered your query.

I went on it after brain surgery in 2002. My 2nd under the knife, 2 other times prior underwent radiation procedure. Also between 2000-2002 times were dramatic, Mom long time suffered from same thing(nf2), died a month prior to the 2002 surgery. After awaking from that surgery and becoming paralysed entirely on left side of face, I was in a panic state of mind. That panic started a year prior after my second gamma knife surgery. Didn t realize back then, but thinking back, there was a few times where to panic came out through speech. Moving on..I was put on 25mg of trazodone, didn t do much, or last long. Then 50mg. That did it, and I ve been on it every since. I started to feel the panic/anxiety in 2010 and have been dealing with it ever since. I had two minor facial procedures (eyelid surgery) in 2012, and that kind of tip me over the boiling point. I had 2 full blown panic attacks. There were caused by abdominal pain. Very very painful. I ve always thought it was ulcer, but i m not so sure, it s almost like the sink is clogged? all the gas, acid, everything just gets stuck and doesn t move. I had it a few times when i was 17. After a year+ trying to figure it out, I quit coffee after supper and that stopped it. It took about 8-12 months to get over the affects of those attacks. I d always find myself tense, my hands would always clench up, or grabbing my shirt without even knowing. Same goes with other muscles. Only thing that remains is when I do something like house work, moving furniture, mow lawn etc. , my lips will be very red. the panicky feeling is under control for the most part. But after those attacks it just feels not that far away. If i ever need surgery I m gonna definitely seek max trazodone or something. with all this said, is trazodone even working any more? does the body over time develop resistance against it. It didn t calm me down one bit when I had those minor surgeries, or every day since 2011. what im wondering is if i quit, will the panic increase and become unbearable or no change? if i do need more surgery in future I will seek help, but nowadays manageable. I wondering if the 50 mg is still helping out. Mike","Doctor":"Hi, Cold turkey withdrawal of trazodone could lead to withdrawal reactions.  You would be best advised discussing your concerns of being on this medication with your doctor who prescribed it and asking for their suggestion as of how to safely wean off in order to minimize unwanted effects. There are many other very good and safe alternatives for your symptoms and condition and I'm sure your doctor can find one for you that works much more compatible than trazodone.

You haven't said anything about the types of doctors who are following you or medications you may be taking/physical therapies you may be engaged in, but in my opinion it is not likely that your \\"brain is changing fast\\" so much as your feelings and sentiments are coming out more and more. It would help you considerably, in my opinion, to have either a counselor/therapist/psychologist whom you trust to be able to talk to about all your feelings so they can help you develop ways of channeling these emotions in a way to benefit you.  Perhaps, medication would be of benefit. Perhaps, you are already on medication that could be resulting in side effects as well.  I do not think that the \\"chemical imbalances\\" in your brain are beyond correction or improvement. Are you trying methods and approaches when you get angry of deep breathing, mental imagery, or even more hands on techniques that you can learn such as BIOFEEDBACK, meditation, and even YOGA which can help with loosening up some of the left side which is probably suffering from spasticity?

I am a working women and most of my work involve working on the computer.i have the pain the middle of the spine at around the spot where I was give an injection for my c section. Pls advise","Doctor":"Hi, I believe that a good physical workup should be performed to discover the most likely cause of the localized back pain. It seems that you've lost nearly all of the weight you gained during the pregnancy so mechanical causes of back pain are probably less likely. Still a good examination to distinguish different types of back pain including the possibility of chronic pain following the c-section is worthwhile and can help identify even other causes of chronic low back. Psychological stressors causing back, shoulder, and neck pain are very common and even physical stressors such as working on computers without proper back/neck support or not taking frequent enough breaks, or being tensed in the shoulders and arms while typing constantly can play into the picture. In short, a number of potential causes can be in play.  A good physical examination by a good physician with proper imaging studies and other workup will do a lot of elucidate the root of your problem. Hope I have answered your query.

Other things to consider would be metabolic imbalances in blood chemistry or even hormonal imbalances in the thyroid profile or other glandular systems.

I was stunned and disoriented and fell onto the passenger next to me. The plane took off and I was not attended to medically until the next layover in another town. I had an x ray and was given a eye chart to read; had blury vision. I was given a shot for pain and put onto another flight for 4 hrs until I reached home. My question is , Should I have been flown any distance with a head injury of this sort? And secondly; after a Ct scan i was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm; which has since been treated with a pipeline stent. Could this have been caused by the injury or provoked by it? Drs. here say no and I have a suit against the airline.","Doctor":"Hi, Regarding the first question the answer is not that easy since I weren't able to examine you at the time. The severity of the hit seems minor (though depends on how heavy that can was) and I am inclined to say that you could have safely flown, however since you say you were disoriented you should have been checked, if a mental status alteration was present it would have been more prudent to have you seen by a doctor. As for the second question the answer is easy, there is no relationship whatsoever between that injury and the aneurysm. Up to 2% of people develop aneurysms in their lifetime, so it is not uncommon for them to be discovered by chance during imaging for other causes.

I agree that Meniere's disease is not a great diagnosis to work with if you do not have any hearing loss. However, tinnitus plus imbalance and vertigo highly suggests either a brainstem pathology, cerebellar problem, or something in the periphery at the level of the cochlear nerve complex or even where the brainstem comes together with the cerebellum. Have you had high resolution imaging studies of the Internal Auditory Canal? That could reveal some type of vascular anomaly such as a fistula or AVM.

I was told they thought my symptoms were just vertigo I was experiencing and was prescribed Meclizine for vertigo and naproxen for the headache. I was also told my EKG was abnormal and that I should make an appointment with a cardiologist to follow up. I was given a copy and it said I had flipped T waves.

Vertigo occurs due to infection or disease of the middle ear called positional vertigo, Meniere's disease or vestibular neuritis. Visit an ENT specialist & get evaluated for the cause of vertigo so that you can be treated at the earliest. The dizziness that you are experiencing can be due to some developing coronary heart pathology. You have already been diagnosed with T wave inversion & feeling nauseating or dizzy may complicate to syncope which is a medical emergency so you are recommended to get physically examined & get treated at the earliest.

You may wish to ask your doctor for a referral to another type of specialist since there could be any number of things going on to cause these symptoms requiring either lab testing or imaging studies. Also, you could be suffering from an excessive amount of stress and anxiety since your symptoms are so distant and apparently disconnected from each other. In the interim and until you have a better diagnosis you could try implementing deep breathing and/or relaxation techniques to lower stress levels and improve oxygen and blood circulation throughout the body and see if this has a positive effect instead of medication.

She may need X-rays, CT scans, or an MRI of the neck and shoulder. If the dizziness is coming on now that she has started a medication then, she may be suffering a side effect.

Also had a spinal fusion C5/6 last Feb for spondylosis. Was referred to PT for treatment to relive remaining numbness but he suggested seeing neurologist. Saw a neurologist who was dismissive of my problems which are trouble swallowing, poor hand/eye coordination, severe constipation and autonomic nervous system symptoms of tachycardia and excessive sweating. Collapsed in street a few weeks ago and had glucose level in blood of 3.1- banged back of skull but was not concussed although had momentary loss of consciousness. I have a feeling that I could have Parkinsons disease- 2 odd facts being a sudden craving for bananas, which I hated before and starting to smoke for first time-I have read that these 2 things raise Dopamine levels. Have MRI booked for 5/4 but understand that PD doesn t show up on them. From these details, what do you think?","Doctor":"Hello, Point of clarification so that you are clear about concussions and TBI's.  If you had a \\"momentary loss of consciousness\\" then, by definition you DEFINITELY suffered a concussion and even more to the point, a TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI). That event by itself should get the attention of at least a neurologist with a subspecialty or interest in this type of problem.  I suggest you see such a specialist. You are a bit on the young side to have PARKINSON'S DISEASE and there is no correlation between your cravings and the onset or risk of developing PARKINSON'S DISEASE. In fact, perhaps it would help to understand that PARKINSON'S DISEASE comes about as the result of a LACK or DEFICIENCY in dopamine in the body. If you have read that smoking and banana ingestion RAISE dopamine then, clearly this is against the notion of developing PD. I am not sure what the MRI scan is actually going to show in your case and yes, you are correct. PD is not something that can be diagnosed by MRI or any other imaging study.  It is still a diagnosis made on clinical (not laboratory or diagnostic testing) grounds. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I have had had back and sciatic related leg/foot pain issues for the last four years involving L4 region. I have been diagnosed with epilepsy 12 plus years ago - coinciding, time wise, with a stressful marital divorce. I question stress and or sleep apnea as a trigger, since the University of Cincinnati is studying a possible link to the apnea and epilepsy. I have been totally controlled for over 10 years with dilantin and Keppra (generic) and would love to get off medication, if not needed. Recently, I was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea and wear an oral appliance which is working very well. Now recently, I am experiencing an increase in numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. Also, about six/seven years ago, I started having a series of skin eruptions - small, itchy, and crusty - occurring anywhere on my body, mostly on my trunk. They are more intense initially then subside yet leaving a small, permanent and crusty eruption which may flare up on occasions. A dermatologist diagnosed this as Grover s disease. My last blood tests were mostly normal except for a high good cholesterol reading, which my M.D. stated out weighed the overall high cholesterol reading. First, what is your opinion on the skin eruptions, and secondly, how might my other issues be perceived. My blood sugar levels have been fine over the years, yet I do wonder about type two diabetes particularly with the tingling extremities. I also wonder about a possible thyroid involvement, since the blood tests have revealed a borderline reading. No history in the family of either issue. My back issue has improved recently - curiously, as the tingling became more apparent. Connection? With the present state of hurry-up office visits, my questions are superfluously addressed. - frustration. Thank you for your opinion!","Doctor":"Hello, Regarding the skin eruptions, the diagnosis of Grover disease is likely, it has the characteristics which you mention. However, I am afraid that it is difficult to express a decisive opinion without being able to examine them or at least some photos of them. As for the tingling and numbness symptoms they can be a manifestation of peripheral neuropathy. It is unlikely to be due to diabetes as diabetic peripheral neuropathy generally occurs when there is long-standing confirmed diabetes, not as an initial sign. Thyroid disorders may cause it too, but with a borderline result it's unlikely. An electrolyte panel is advised if not already done as alterations in magnesium, calcium or potassium levels may also be a cause. If no metabolic cause is found I would advise nerve conduction studies to check for nerve damage. If all is normal then peripheral neuropathy is less likely and anxiety should be considered as a possible cause. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I see no harm and certainly a potential benefit to doing at least a bedside screening test such as a Montreal Cognitive Assessment or something even a less complex such as an ST. Louis University Mental Assessement. Also, I would definitely send you for blood assays for B12, FT4, TSH, and Testosterone levels known to all affect general cognitive competencies when getting chronic infusions or suffering from something such as central apnes.

In your case, Nucoxia and Duzela have been chosen which are definitely appropriate types of medications for the problem. However, if you are not obtaining adequate relief from the symptoms of pain and discomfort you may wish to talk with your doctor about either changing the dose of the medications, using alternative medications, or adding adjunctive approaches to your medications.

My plan is to wean myself off Ambien but am not sure about Clozapine because when I don t take it, my head starts spinning again.","Doctor":"Hello, If you have vertigo that has never been evaluated as to underlying then, I suggest you see a neurologist or if possible a NEURO-OTOLOGIST. There must be a reasonable explanation for why you have such symptoms that can only be cured with clozapine. You should be screened for what is known as VERTEBROBASILAR INSUFFICIENCY which is a reduction or lack of good perfusion into the vascular tree of the brainstem which could be critical. It should not be masked by something like clozapine but rather identified and addressed. Perhaps, it is something simple such as BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO (BPPV) which can also be quieted down by something like clozapine but never cured as well as either the Brandt-Daroff exercises or an Epley Maneuver.

My skin felt like it was on fire. I broke out into very profuse sweating, and quickly soaked my clothes. I got lightheaded. Being a mild diabetic, I took my blood sugar level and it was normal. Also, I have high blood pressure and have blood pressure machine. My blood pressure was within limits. After about 45 minutes the symptoms began to subside. After an hour I was feeling better but completely wrung out . I kept getting these symptoms every evening, albeit moderately, for a couple of weeks. For another couple of weeks I got the symptoms, albeit mildly, sometime during the day at differing times. Now, I get the symptoms mildly every once in awhile.

Center, Kansas City, where they opened up my abdominal cavity to get in and put bone wedges in between 3 vertebra, put that all back together and sutured up, turned me over, and opened up the posterior of my lower back to put 3 sets of screws in the same 3 vertebra and tied them all together with rods, sutured that up and called it good.","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concern and would explain that it is necessary performing a comprehensive differential diagnosis between different possible causes that may lead to this clinical situation: thyroid gland dysfunction, possible cardiac arrhythmia, orthostatic hypotension, low blood perfusion to the brain, etc. For this reason, I would recommend performing some tests to investigate for the possible causes: -a Doppler ultrasound of the carotid arteries - thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid gland dysfunction - blood electrolytes for possible imbalance - an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring in order to investigate for possible cardiac arrhythmia.

I have had 2 craniotomies for atypical meningioma in both 1999 and a further recurrence in 2004! Following the recurrence in 2004, I had Stereotactic Radiosurgery in 2006. I didn t remain tumour free and had a further recurrence of 2 new tumours in 2011! Subsequent SRS followed....which leads me to now? I ll bet you can t give me an honest answer!!!","Doctor":"Hi, I'm not sure what to exactly make of your statement \\"bet you can't give me an honest answer!!!\\" but the BEST and most truthful information I would share from available data on the subject is that few studies on this topic that have looked at in terms of LONG TERM recurrence rates.  However, suffice it to say that it is in fact quite high (48% after 10 years). Atypical meningiomas (AM) do recur after resection..unfortunately, that is their nature, and the use of radiation therapy and surgery does not ELIMINATE the HIGH RISKS of recurrence. In fact, the data shows that increased numbers of stereotactic surgeries with high recurrence rates tends to shorten survivability of patients. It is not clear whether this implies FEWER surgeries should be performed as recurrence occurs and patients get older or if it is the simple ongoing recurrence of the tumors that leads to shortened survivability and that surgery itself is not the factor driving this statistic. You've not mentioned the symptoms you get when there is a recurrence since not ALL meningiomas need to be resected just because they are present. Surgeons may be willing to go on and remove them but in the face of the last statistic I mentioned, my approach for any patient with AM who has already had at least one STEREOTACTIC resection with or without radiation therapy is to consider repeat surgery ONLY IF the recurrent tumor(s) are causing impossible symptoms to occur that cannot be treated or controlled by any other means.

Yesterday night she was also complaining og giddiness.","Doctor":"Hi, If you would like to upload the last EEG report for further review then, please do so at: www.bit.ly/drdariushsaghafi and I will happy to review it in the context of additional questions but it certainly seems that an adjustment to her medications would be helpful in this case. However, from a distance such as this and without being able to examine your daughter it is not possible to make valid recommendations. She is likely to be followed by a pediatric epileptologist and this is a highly specialized provider who has the best vantage point over your daughter compared to myself or anyone else online. Has there been consideration to either doing home monitoring with video recording or in-hospital 24/7 monitoring (if frequent enough) since this would be the best way of making on the fly adjustments to her meds which can then, be watched in real time for changes in the brain's electrical rhythms. Reduced appetite is a clear function of increasing seizure episodes as is the symptom of giddiness which could be a form of gelastic seizure that may be part of her seizure syndrome vs. side effect of medications.

The first sign of memory issues occurred at age 12 when I got into a dispute with the English teacher becasue I said I could not memorize a poem. Memory issues were more pronounced in high school where memory became more important. But I got through high school and college with a B to B+ average. If I have ADHD, I have managed to overcome it pretty well, except for being disorganized all the time. Disorganization, impulsivity remain. But memory issues are increasing in the past couple years. I wonder if ADHD is affecting my memory more now but it might be helped with ADHD RX.","Doctor":"Hi, The likelihood that ADHD is the culprit to any memory problems you are currently having at age 84 is very unlikely. I would recommend a good assessment by a neurologist in your area who can apply simple bedside cognitive testing and if necessary refer you to the services of a NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST who can usually perform or even more detailed and ample testing in order to rule out more common problems of memory dysfunction for your particular situation. The neurologist will likely engage in blood work and even urine testing looking at specific levels of things such as B12, vitamin D, testosterone, and thyroid hormones, electrolytes, liver and renal enzymes- in addition to the possible presence of a chronic subclinical urinary tract infection, etc. Hope I have answered your query.

The use of ADD medications is likely to be most useful in the first diagnosis but not the last two. All the same, you should be aware of these 3 different entities.

Many times when medications are responsible for causing side effects such as neuropathy then, stopping the medications often relieves the symptoms. In some cases, it does not... hard to predict which scenario you fit into without examining you, however, the first step is to let your doctor know what's going on if they are ones who prescribed the drug in the first place. I am not aware that plantar fasciitis is a direct consequence of bupropion but it could be indirectly caused if reduction in pain symptoms in the foot and/or neuropathy allowed you to walk greater distances which in turn could've helped precipitate the fasciitis problem.

HER New doctor from india in my opinion is better for him to go back to the old country to atended sick snakes ,and not working in one off the best medical/hospital in wi. THANKS ANY ADVISE","Doctor":"Hello, Generic medications are in theory composed of the identical chemical substances as generics. Therefore, insurance companies typically do not ALLOW for brand-name drugs to be dispensed (UNLESS PATIENTS ARE WILLING TO PAY) and so pharmacists are very accustomed to simply changing all brand name prescriptions to generics since the vast majority of people do not want to pay the extra charges. If the doctor insists that the BRAND name drug is given then, the prescription should be coded DAW. The pharmacist will then, dispense EXACTLY what the physician prescribes. If the physician believes that the generic will work equally well to the brand name then, typically they will agree to the pharmacy switching to the generic. Have this conversation first with your wife's physician.  If you get the brand name drug. Be prepared to pay significantly more at the pharmacy. Hope I have answered your query.

My sister took a dosage of 9 tablets of stalopalm and was noticed sleeping unusual. Later, after discovering this after 5 hours after the intake, we had her stomach washed and we saw her going drowsy. After 3 days she started complaining of drowsiness, heavy head, vertigo and breathlessness. All the ABG,Biochemical and LFT results came normal. Vitals are also stable. I am not certain about CO2 levels. May I know what can be the reason for this and how this can be recovered from? Regards","Doctor":"Hello, This medication is an antidepressant and when taken in excessive quantities can cause excessive sleepiness and fatigue.  In your sister's case she took an overdose. It is possible that with that much medication in her system at once that her liver was overwhelmed and could not expedite the metabolism of the excess medication. Also, that much medication at once will also cause an excess amount of metabolite to be formed, some of which can be active as the original parent drug. It will take some time for everything to wash out.  Finally, you should have your sister's liver and renal functions checked again in about 2 weeks after the incident to make sure she has not suffered some type of significant damage to these organs.

Is increased fluid exacerbated by poor diet control? Is this an additional process in addition to the removal of waste products? How is the amount of fluid to be removed determined ? Does the pt lose important aspects of lymph fluid or nutrition with the removal of fluid? Thank you, Murry, OTR/L","Doctor":"Hi, Excess fluid is usually lymphatic in nature and can be due to a number of processes such as congestive heart failure, hepatic portal hypertension resulting in liver congestion and fluid backup, pneumonia, and kidney disease. Fluid is diuresis according to the clinical picture of the patient and discretion of the physician. Fluid loss in this manner usually doesn't contain critical nutritional elements although some electrolytes such as potassium can be especially lost and are usually replaced as diuresis occurs.

Mrs. Gunther","Doctor":"Hi, Peer-reviewed literature, as well as FDA study of low-level laser treatments in order to cure or heal neuropathy, is controversial at best. The treatment is recognized as at least efficacious in some individuals with painful syndromes such as diabetic neuropathy but it is not necessarily better than other treatments that are FDA cleared and considered mainstream in the management and treatment of such neuropathic conditions.  In your case, it appears to be helping therefore, you will need to make your own decisions on the costs vs. benefits. There is no CURE to painful neuropathy in general except if the actual underlying cause is discovered and addressed such as exposure to toxins or specific nutritional deficiencies which when corrected can result in normal return to function and regeneration of lost nerves.

Also you have some breathing and (may be) swallowing problems. You had lumbosacral and thoracic MRI study which are unremarkable but you did not mention a cervical MRI. What you mentioned as the muscular seizure is more probably muscular fasciculation (local twitching of the muscles.) You did not mention if you have done an Electromyograhy and Nerve Conduction Study (EMG & NCS) test or not. -There are a lot of conditions that could explain your situation: 1- Peripheral nervous system problems 2- Motor Neuron Disorders 3- Myopathies (less likely) The first and most important test that you have not to mention is an EMG & NCS (see above) to reveal any peripheral nervous system (polyneuropathy) or Motor Neuron disease. This is very important that an expert Physiatrist or neurologist does this test. You should also do some other blood tests such as Vit B12 level as severe B12 deficiency can mimic your symptoms. Overall, there some of the etiologies for your condition are acquired and some others are genetically inherited. Some of the acquired etiologies have specific treatment and if you do not recognize them as soon as possible, they will induce irreversible damage. Above all the things that I mentioned, a detailed physical examination can help that unfortunately, I cannot make it for you. Please refer to a Physiatrist or a neurologist and ask them to perform and EMG & NCS test and order a cervical MRI as well as some blood tests including Vit B12, thyroid function test. Also, if you use alcohol, please tell them as alcohol abuse can also damage the peripheral nerves seriously. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Anyway they were all successful (although recovering wasn t easy), but I still have the common itching inside the right foot. I would love to hear from anyone who has successfully managed to eliminate / ,minimise this tingling / numbness. I hope to hear from you guys. Thanks. Roger","Doctor":"Hi,Spinal stenosis and multiple surgeries is indeed a challenging problem to overcome. If all that is residual are the paresthesias and numbness of the right foot then, you should know that you are not being left with very much to deal with things could be much worse. I would not vote for more surgeries since each additional surgery confers a risk of complications that are not already there.  Have you been tried a TENS unit to be applied to the lower back where the surgery occurred (not the foot) since the PROBLEM is the nerve root that was decompressed, not the foot.  Have you tried medications such as Gabapentin, Pregabalin, or Oxcarbazepine?  Have been prescribed Aquatherapy and water jogging as part of a rehabilitative back program?  Have you had your Vitamin B12, D, and Thiamine (B1) levels checked since all of these nutritional deficiencies alone or in combination can contribute to the sensory neuropathy/radiculopathy you are experiencing.Hope I have answered your query.

I understand is Sciatica pain but please explain these results; and what is the best course of treatment to remedy this situation. Many thanks Doc.","Doctor":"Hi,Your scans suggest a mechanical cause to your pain symptoms. In other words you are suffering from what appears to degenerative arthritic disease which is most severe at the L5/S1 levels. Narrowing of the disc space at the various levels is an indication of a condition known as osteoarthritis which could be irritating the small nerve fibers that are close to or in contact the arthritic skeletal elements of the spinal column.  The best treatment for a problem such as what you have is medical which means that surgery is unlikely to work and it could even be a detriment if performed. You may ask your primary doctor to refer you to pain management where they could try focal injections to the spinal column where the canal narrowing is being experienced.Exercise therapy (both aquatic and landforms) is highly recommended and then, there is pain management which could take the form of medications or a TENS unit over the lower back where arthritis seems to be most severe.Let me know if I can assist you further by sending questions/comments to: www.bit.ly/drdariushsaghafiRegards,Dr. Dariush Saghafi, Neurologist"},{"Patient":"Help!

Even if he really wasn't exhibiting anything significant in your mind until the fall. Also keep in mind that sometimes the trauma from something like a fall followed by hospitalizations and changes in familiar environments combined with medications that could be adding to the mix will UNMASK an underlying cognitive disorder. Therefore, if not already done he should be worked up with tests such as Vitamin B12 levels in serum, Thyroid hormones such as TSH and FT4, ESR and CRP in case there may be an underlying or occult infection somewhere in the body that has not been detected.

I had a lower face lift and neck lift (the more invasive kind) almost 6 months ago and used a very reputable, board certified MD that I trusted from the recommendation of others, include an RN. I still have what feels like nerve pain to the touch and a pinching feeling in my earlobes and the area surrounding my earlobes, worse behind my ear lobes, with one ear being worse than the other ... which I understand had more work done. It s also still painful to wear glasses, so the top of the ears are still painful to the touch as well. The adhesions behind my ears are raised, but not visible. I had no infections after surgery. The last time I asked my doctor, about 6 weeks ago, he said it s still normal and may take up to a year to resolve, but I just want to confirm that. Are you able to answer that question?

Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello, You are correct about needing some input from a plastic surgeon familiar with this procedure since I cannot confirm what he says about the timeline as to when things should get better. The pain you are feeling is likely mechanical in nature and this is placing traction or stretching nerves in the area where the facelift attachment points are located. However, what I can say is that if the surgeon is not giving you any type of medication for this type of pain you are describing then, a reasonable choice or two may be something such as Gabapentin, Pregabalin, or Nortripytline just to dull the pinching/stabbing feelings until the 1 year timeframe has elapsed.

I developed it to manage my low back pain after severe L5-S1 herniation, use it every day and am sure of its effectiveness. My offer might be of some good profit if ElFAD is sold in the USA (or any other country) but officially it needs clinical pilot study first (see programms emails ). Please note I am not a company, just a retired Russian medical doctor living in Hove. I ve written this to you in hope a company could be created in your country to introduce my ElFAD device-method into medical practice that might make profit to you and the country. I offer you to make business on my ElFAD method. Or investigate, оr sponsor it. My device to treat low back pain (LBP) is patented in the UK, method pending in the USA where I have right to sell, simple, safe and effective auto-decompression method to be used at home. I cannot fill in any application form as do not understand that official language. Could you introduce it into medical practice? As a medical doctor using this method to treat my low back pain I can claim that: 1.This method kept me, a young LBP patient, capable to work. 2. It was cost-effective as all the other treatments were abandoned. 3. It keeps me, now an old LBP patient, from becoming a back cripple (unfortunately, there is no absolute cure for heavily herniated disc LBP). 4. The most important advantage of this method is that it is a self-help, self-manage method to decompress vertebrae strictly along the spine axis. I do not go to my GP or hospital, I use it at home any time suitable and my GP here does not even know that I have a back problem. There are some other advantages of this method that require further investigation: 1. Using this method by patients with simple backache might prevent subsequent disc injury that is highly possible in this group. 2. This method may be a helpful and cost-effective treatment for patients with neck pain. 3. This method may be a helpful and cost-effective treatment for patients with ankylosing spondylitis. 4. It may be reasonable to use this method for preventative measures by people in groups of risk: sedentary mode of life, drivers, porters, weight-lifters, oarsmen and some other sportsmen or parachute jumpers. 5. This method can be used for spine curvature correction. 6. Regular use of this method might prevent development of osteoporosis in the bones of spine, upper limbs and shoulder girdle (it is a positive side effect). 7. This method might prevent periodontal disorders providing the gums massage (it is another positive side effect of this method). This is absolutely new and effective method - it will decrease the number of hospital visits, it will reduce the cost of care. And it can help soldiers. My device is extremely simple. It will be very cheap to manufacture but the profit might be high and fast (for example see that huge back pain market in the USA where my device is pending and already electronically published). To examine the method you only need really suffering LBP patients and my device that I myself can bring. Contact me YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi, Your offer is generous, as are you for looking for a way to bring a technique as you have invented to the masses of people to treat chronic low back pain.

There are extended release formulations such as Sinemet CR and ODT which either release medication slowly (CR) or immediately (ODT). These can have benefits in different populations of patients. Also, there is a carbidopa/levodopa PUMP which is likely the most rapid and best way to have medication dosed since it is a constant release formulation directly into the GI tract which gives patients a pill free existence. Finally, DBS is a surgical procedure which has shown excellent success in many patients who do not do well with conventional therapy.  Unfortunately, there is nothing on the horizon at this point that is likely going to address every concern or consequence of not having enough dopamine produced by the brain. What I've mentioned may be a step up for many patients compared to the conventional therapies of the last 10 years.

His blood pressure was 195/100 mm Hg, which he said was typical of what he had experienced during the past two years. Blood gases and electrolytes were normal. The ECG showed no arrhythmias but did demonstrate a left axis deviation. The gentleman was admitted to the hospital and a cerebral angiogram was performed which showed left cerebral hemorrhaging. 1. What is the diagnosis of this individual s disorder?2. What are the major contributing factors to this disorder?3. What could have been done to prevent this problem?4. What are the early warning symptoms prior to the complication?5. Why did the ECG show a left axis deviation?6. Why was there impaired motor function on the right side from cerebral hemorrhaging on the left side?","Doctor":"Hello, The patient has had a left cerebral haemorrhage. The left side of the brain controls the right side of the body. Therefore the haemorrhage on the left side of the brain affects the right side of the body. A high blood pressure is probably the cause of the haemorrhage in this case. A normal BP is 120/80. So, of course, the BP was high for him. And this may have resulted in the haemorrhage. The recovery depends on the size of haemorrhage, the age of the patient, the deficit in the first place, the location of the haemorrhage and control of BP among several other factors. A control of BP previously by regular check-up may have prevented the condition. A headache may have been a common symptom that he may develop. However very frequently there is no preceding symptom. The ECG findings suggest that hypertension was starting to affect the heart chambers as well. The heart was probably starting to remodel itself in view of the blood pressure changes.

He also said I have hyper reflexia when he tested my reflexes. He ordered bloodwork and one test came back positive. I had a Paraneoplastic evaluation serum test. I tested high for a3 AChR Ganglionic antibodies. I was then sent for MRIs for my chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They were all negative for a tumor. I was then sent for a lumbar puncture and I m waiting on those results. Do these a3 ACHR Ganglionic antibodies occur in healthy people? Does this mean I have a Paraneoplastic syndrome? What is the likelyhood of cancer for me? Thank you","Doctor":"Hello, The detection of α3-AChR autoantibody can aid in the diagnosis of neurological autoimmunity and cancer in patients who test positive for the marker (SEROPOSITIVE) but it does not MEAN that the patient has cancer by any means. In order to prove what the patient may have if seropositive a thorough workup must be performed. In your case, the history of 30 years of cigarette smoking certainly puts you in a higher risk category for detection of some form of cancer with or without the autoantibody markers but again it is not diagnostic for cancer or a paraneoplastic syndrome just by itself. This autoantibody can be found in approximately 0.5% of patients who do not have any form of autoimmune disease or cancer according to some studies. Exact percentage risks for you to have CA is not calculable based on the information you've provided. However, your risk category can certainly be considered higher than the average person who doesn't smoke. I would encourage you to look for a way to stop smoking since one of the associated parameters to acquiring cancer from environmental causes involves the duration that a person exposes themselves to a carcinogenic substance as well as the total load they are exposed to per incident. In the case of smoking-  someone who smokes a few cigarettes a day for a few years is at much less overall risk of future cancer than someone who is a 1 pack per day smoker for 30 years.

Cognitive performance may be affected by other issues than dementia. Anxiety and depression are two such common causes which create the false impression of memory impairment but in truth, it is because they affect concentration, not because there is true memory impairment. One other factor apart from anxiety might be the medication, as it may affect cognitive functions, so it might contribute as well. Therefore, dementia wouldn't be the first diagnosis coming to mind. You may have some neuropsychological tests (sort of questionnaires administered by doctors or psychologists) to test for dementia to make sure, but in the meantime, I see no reason for panic.

Since she is being abusive and potentially dangerous to you and herself you have the right to request that, laws vary somewhat between states, but if patient represents a threat to herself or others it is invariably possible to have them admitted against the will. It would be for her own good, in order to initiate the medication, afterward, she should be easier to manage. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

At that time saw a neurologist and after 3 years of tests and pokes the only conclusion was it might be the stat of MS or Cancer. Well, Cancer did come a calling two years later in the form of colon cancer. I did not go back to a neurologist until 3 years ago complaining of balance and speech issues along with eyes twitching. She did multiple test including MRI of the brain that showed my cerebellum only 1/3 the size it should be. My two questions are: my neurologist feels my cerebellum caused my cancer and can cause cancer again. Is this true? And how? My oncologist agrees with my neurologist. Also what is the life expectancy of someone my age with this disease? We do not know why my cerebellum is shrinking because I do not drink or have never had a stroke and no family history of this.","Doctor":"Hello, I am afraid I don't agree with what you have been told. Cerebellar atrophy doesn't cause cancer. Cerebellar atrophy can't even be called a condition, it is simply a descriptive Latin term meaning shrinking of the little brain, doesn't indicate the origin, may be in the setting of different causes with different mechanisms. I think what the doctors must have meant is the other way round, that it is the colon cancer which has caused the cerebellar atrophy. It is known for cancer to cause Paraneoplastic syndromes in other organs, meaning affecting other organs in distance without the cancer having spread there. Cerebellar atrophy or degeneration is a well know neurological paraneoplastic syndrome. It is as a result of the body's immune system reacting to the cancer cells creating abnormal antibodies and an abnormal immune response which affects the cerebellum, even in the absence of as direct spread of the cancer there. It may start well before the tumor is diagnosed, even years, when there are malignant cells triggering the immune response but the tumor is not yet big enough to be detected. So it is the cancer which has caused the cerebellar atrophy. Of course you should discuss with your doctors again as I don't have your reports. Hope I have answered your query.

One of them is Exelon. I know that this medication was created by pharmacist in Israel and is used for cureing the soft simptomps Alzgeimer disease (doubt about spelling)and dementhia as result of Parkinson disease (sorry for wrong spelling). My husband has Parkinson disease during 7 years, and big problems with his memory now. Secon medication is Azilkat (Spelling?). I know that it is considered as the most effective medication for decreasing slowing development of this disease. What could you say about these medications?","Doctor":"Hi, Regarding the use of Exelon, it seems you already are aware of its use. It is more effective in treating dementia for Alzheimer's, it is less effective for Parkinson's dementia, but there is some slight benefit so since there aren't other alternatives it is commonly used. Since your husband does show memory impairment I concur with its use. As for Azilect, it is also a commonly used medication for Parkinson's. It is rarely used alone though, only in the initial stages of the disease, later on, it is as an adjunct to levodopa therapy, so if that is the only medication he's prescribed levodopa should be added.

Someone told me my neck could be causing all of that is this true? The neck, arm and back all connected?","Doctor":"Hi, Cervical degenerative disc disease can cause pain spreading down to your shoulder and upper limb. So it may be related with those symptoms, but it should be confirmed by clinical neurological exam (testing for sensory changes, altered reflexes) and if in doubt by imaging and nerve conduction studies. As for sciatica it is not caused by the neck issues, not directly at least. However, degenerative spine disease usually affects the whole spine, not only the neck in isolation. So it wouldn't be surprising for there to be at the same time degenerative changes in the lumbar spine as well, which in turn can cause nerve compression and sciatica.

The CT Scan of my head Came Back Normal And He said that I wasn t having true seizures and that my brain was just stressed out and I need to go get help from my psychiatrist and sent me home. Three days later I came back to the same er for the same thing again but this time they wouldn t stop and didn t recover from them. So the same neurologist saw me and he did another CT scan of my head and it came back normal and be told me that I need to stop coming to the er because I m not having true seizures and sent me home so I just stop coming to the er for my SEIZURES unless hurt my head or substain any other injuries to any other parts of my body. So a month later on 08-3-17 I had a seizure and I was out and about with my grandpa so be called 911 and met them their at the Hospital. So I had two SEIZURES in the back of the ambulance before I arrived at the er they gave me versed to stop my seizures and it for about 3hours. I got to the er they checked me in and took my vitals and everything bout 3mintues after my intake I had 6 SEIZURES they gave me Ativan to stop my SEIZURES it worked bout for 2 hours then I started having more Seizures so they admitted to the neuro unit for further evaluation and testing. My 3rd day their they did an 1hour V-EEG Test and it came back negative so they ruled out epilepsy. So they looked back at my history and saw that I have a Psychiatric history so they based my diagnosis off of that so they Diagnosed Me With Psychogenic NonEpileptic Seizures. But the thing is I continue to have SEIZURES where I m very confused post itcal foam at the mouth and loose BLADDER CONTROL and every time I go to the er they say my SEIZURES are fake and not real SEIZURES and I need to stop FAKING and grow up But I m not FAKING so I stopped coming to the er again. So i recently just started my JR. Year of high school and i continue to have SEIZURES at school. My school sent me to the er 4 times and I told them u didn t need to go but they sent me anyway so the hospital doctors are getting tired and mad at me for coming to the er for my SEIZURES. So my school says I can t come back to school until i am medically cleared by my neurologist to come back to school. I don t know what to do because I m still having seizures.","Doctor":"Hi, I can't blame your school, either the ER doctors since they have a written neurological opinion that yours aren't seizures. If you are convinced that you have seizures then you should seek a second neurological opinion. Another EEG must be obtained. A single EEG may miss on epileptic activity, but it is unlikely that repeat EEGs miss epileptiform activity. If repeat EEGs turn out normal (or even more conclusively if the EEG is obtained during the seizure and it shows no epileptic discharges) then I am afraid that psychogenic origin must be accepted and you should consult a psychiatrist for management.

Such changes may cause local inflammation, compression or nerve roots and spinal cord, so could be responsible for the back pain due to inflammation and arm deficits from spinal cord compression. In order to confirm the diagnosis and determine whether surgery is needed, type of surgery and risks imaging is necessary.

The activity you were performing that resulted in your falling face first in the water at high speed initiated the sequence of events which now is being experienced by a migraine-like headache. I would seek out a TBI specialist or headache specialist (neurologist) to start tracking and properly treating these headaches which typically subside in 3 weeks-3 months.

I would appreciate your answer to the similarities & differences between CAA, Post Polio Syndrome & Parkinson Disease. With Kind Regards Robert Moger","Doctor":"Hi, The conditions you mention do not have much in common apart from being neurological conditions, there rarely is the needed to make a differential diagnosis between these conditions. Post-polio syndrome is characterized mainly by fatigue and worsening of prior neurological sequelae of polio, it has none of the manifestations you mentioned. Parkinson's disease is a chronic disease progressing over many years characterized mainly by slowing of the movement, rigidity and tremor. It may include falls but later on in the course of the disease, not in the first few years. There are no vascular lesions like hemorrhage on imaging. CAA, on the other hand, is characterized by the presence of multiple hemorrhages on MRI imaging. Manifestations may vary depending on the manifestation of major bleeds and their location may manifest with motor deficits and seizures which might be causing your falls.

I think the bypass vessel graft was taken from the same leg. So it's likely that the area supplied by the  blood vessel is involved and affecting you. This usually doesn't happen because the remaining vessels pick up the function of the vessel removed. Maybe that has not happened in your case.

They can range from mild to severe. Severe symptoms might significantly interfere with communication, daily functioning and quality of life. Tics can also involve movement (motor tics) or sounds (vocal tics). Motor tics usually begin before vocal tics do. Other possibilities like rheumatoid chorea or Wilson's disease or postviral infection demyelinating disease etc. Until examination is done it is difficult to say what it is.

There are no known medications or treatments on the market to reverse the consequences of dementia. My advice is that he obtain a caregiver who can help with his activities of daily living.

Spinal surgeon says he won t touch me just go ahead a live my life. My question of deep concern after reading about CSF could I get demention,or any metal deteriation and it was mentioned watch my driving it would be risky because of whip lash .","Doctor":"Hi, The results of CSF blockage read from an MRI is highly insensitive when it comes to accurately determine anything do with exactly how much fluid surrounds the spinal cord. My guess from reading your information is that you likely have a normal amount of fluid in your canal.  Imaging is a poor approach to determining exactly HOW MUCH CSF is around the spinal cord. The AMOUNT of CSF in the central nervous system is entirely unrelated to the risk of acquiring dementing illnesses or not. The comment on driving and being careful of whiplash is without basis in fact in terms of injury severity (which is what I believe was being implied) based on AMOUNT OF CSF.

So let s say you did something involving a lot of movement, like cleaning a room for a couple of hours, or marching band practice for a while. You feel fine. You get home or get to a stopping point and take a seat, just to have a break. You feel fine. You need to stand back up, but once you move to stand up, you get this strong pain in your lower back, like in the small of your back and your hips. It s so bad it knocks the breath out of you and something as simple as standing up takes a few minutes because it hurts so much. Trying to walk is difficult and you almost drop to the floor because of pain when you take even a single step unless you re grabbing something for support. After a few minutes of limping, the pain starts to alleviate and you can walk normally again and the pain is nearly gone entirely. Like literally walking it off. That s basically what happens to me and I ve been dealing with this since I was 15 and now that I m 19, I m kind of tired of it and want to know what it is so I can get it treated.

She did take some ibprofin a little bit ago and is seeming a little better as time goes on. but we want to know if we should take her to the ER or just a regular doctor because my grandmother says it looked like she was having a seizure. and while shaking she said her eyes were watering excesssively.","Doctor":"Hello, If your grandmother witnessed whole body shaking while your mother was handling the car and your mother was unable to respond to any questions or comments by any of the passengers while she was pulling the vehicle over then, this could be an indication that she may have lapsed in her state of alertness for a moment and that could certainly constitute an incidental seizure of the brain. On the other hand, if your mother was simply in a lot of pain but has perfect recollection of the situation including any conversations that people were having with her including questions they were asking her while she was pulling over then, she may have simply been in severe pain. If this were the case then, taking her to her doctor first may be satisfactory in a few days.

The pain is worse at night when I am sleeping and it wakes me it is so severe. Also if I walk too much or sit too long I have pain. I have seen 3 doctors and they all seem to be stumped. I am having an MRI of my abdomen on Friday to see if there is a mass in my abdomen pinching on a nerve. I have been having this problem since the middle of December.","Doctor":"Hi, As you have mentioned, one of the causes would be a radiculopathy. However, I think since the MRI is negative, another possible cause that needs to be ruled out is a neuropathy- an isolated single nerve involvement, called mononeuropathy. I agree with the testing of the MRI abdomen. However, I think you should also be tested with an Nerve Conduction study of all 4 limbs- sensory as well as motor. This may need to be followed by a nerve biopsy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"I have Parkinsons Disease First diagnosed in 2013.

I would recommend a visit to a neurologist for an examination and confirmation of this. The treatment can thereafter be initiated according to the diagnosis and this may need a dose adjustment of Levadopa/Carbidopa. The increase of the dose may help you reduce the autonomic features.

If surgery is needed, Doc said he could not operate; I would need a sub specialist. Should I worry?","Doctor":"Hi, You may need to clarify your question about \\"should I worry\\" since, I don't understand what you may be worried about?. The surgeon who tells you that you have one of the most complicated anatomies, would send you to a sub-specialist. This sub-specialist is doing the right thing by telling you that someone else is better suited in your case. I suppose, I'd be worried if it were your brain surgeon doing the operation.  But since it's not the case, I would not worry about his opinion at this point. With respect to any future surgery, just wait to see what the sub-specialist says in the future.

Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"My wife was never fully diagnosed with Alzheimer s but the consensus appeared to be the cause of her declining memory problems. This started about 5 years ago with 2 strokes affecting her left brain. There appeared to be little difference between left and right body strength and did not seem to suffer and typical body reactions. She quickly learned how to walk, eat, dress but it took much longer to recover memory and speak. Two years ago I retired to take care of her full time. In the last few weeks, she has had very rapid physical decline. She used to dance with me almost every day, could walk unassisted and mostly could dress, go to the bathroom by herself, brush her own teeth and feed herself. Now she cannot do anything at all without assistance. Her joints are very stiff and she cannot stand, walk or get in and out of bed by herself. She is also almost constantly shaking her hands and arms, sometimes quite violently. Is this a clear symptom or dementia with Lewy? Is there any correlation to stage 7 Alzheimer s. Beginning, middle of late stage 7?","Doctor":"Hi, I think she has multiple problems which probably stem from the strokes. You have mentioned that dementia started after stroke. So first and foremost I think it would be better to consider this as post-stroke dementia or multi-infarct dementia, and not Alzheimer's disease. As for the movement problems, this can be stroke related as well. The difficulty in getting out of bed could well be stiffness resulting after the stroke. Similarly, her tremors could possibly be vascular Parkinsonism. I would need the details of the treatment that she's on. But I would recommend a repeat MRI BRAIN scan. This may be followed by a PET scan. If it is indeed found to be due to further multiple small strokes, the medications need to be added and modified. Along with physiotherapy. If however, she doesn't have the multiinfarct state the PET will help confirm the type of dementia. Many centres are into different stages of study with use of PET. Enrolling her in one of the centres may help her further. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"My wife is on mirapex for pd.

I have been at this for 4 days now and not sure what else to do","Doctor":"Hi, Deep Brain Stimulation needs to be individualized. The frequency and strength of stimulation need to be gradually adjusted. As you reduce the medicine the doctors will increase the stimulation. So reduce the medicine until she is comfortable. The symptoms are bound to increase as she's coming off medication. Also to avoid the severe effects of medication withdrawal you need to be slow. To reduce the dose until she has symptoms but remains comfortable. The doctors can then readjust the stimulation until her symptoms disappear. Once that happens the dose can be reduced further and the cycle will progress until she continues to be symptomatic at the maximum permissible stimulation. A dose of medicine, usually small, may thereafter be needed continuously. I have tried to make it as simple as possible. Hope I have answered your query.

The doctor 2 weeks back stopped syndopa which she is taking for the past 8-10 years. After the surgery she is able to walk which she was not earlier, but at night she cries complaining of severe leg pain from thighs to toe, crying inconsolably. The Surgeon who oeperated her says it is not due to nerve compression as the surgery was a suceess. could this be withdrawal of syndopa.","Doctor":"Hi, Your mother has peripheral neuropathy responsible for the pain. Start taking Gabapentin, which comes in various brands like ZEEGAP, Lyrica for relief of the symptoms. Syndopa is given for Parkinson's disease so I don't understand why the doctor gave her that medication, but currently she definitely needs these drugs for peripheral neuropathy.

The consequence of this is that I m not as able to do routine things such as buttoning the left hand cuff on my shirt or exerting leverage to open a food package using my right hand.

Thanks! -Julia","Doctor":"Hi, I don't think it's necessary for another CT scan after all that time.Probably nerves of the scalp were compressed/crushed. If the symptoms are bothersome, drugs (simple painkillers initially) could be used. Nerve block injections also may be of help. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"My husband will be having a laminectomy next month. How can I assist in his recovery without enabling him, by doing too much for him? I want him to be as self sufficient as possible and I suspect he rather enjoys me doing things for him that are not in the best interest of his full recovery.","Doctor":"Hi, If the operation ( laminectomy ) goes well, without complications, your husband could start most of his physical activities after one month. Weights, and long physical activity should be avoided for few months. So, you can start intercourse in about one month after laminectomy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"I woke up Saturday and could barely walk. Right leg tried to buckle and I felt like a deer on ice. Sunday I woke up and my right hand was not working properly. I can t sign my name. I had a CT scan done and they said they couldn t see anything. I was taking zocor 40mg for 4 days. I stopped taking it immediately.","Doctor":"Hi, If the simvastatin was the culprit, symptoms should regress after stopping it.If the symptoms persist, I suggest you to consider cervical spine problems ( stenosis, herniation, etc.) as a possible condition.MRI is a more specific radiological examination in such cases. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"I have a herniated disk in the lower part of my back (near the small of my back). For the past week or so, I have noticed a little numbing in my butt and the back part of my legs. Today, I have had sharp pains in my lower right abdomen that come and go. (My right, not the right of someone looking at me.) can these be related? And what should I do?","Doctor":"Hi, The pains in your lower right abdomen may be unrelated to the herniated disc disease, numbness and pain in legs are related. I suggest you to be checked by your Doctor for conditions such appendicitis, kidney stones. Also a reevaluation of your herniation is necessary since there is progression of the symptoms. Hope I have answered your query.
