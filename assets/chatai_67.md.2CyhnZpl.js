Ms. Leah Wong","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!You should know that your symptoms could be indicative of radicular pain in both arms. Chronic spinal column degeneration could lead to such symptomatology. For this reason, I would recommend performing a new cervical spine MRI study and a nerve conduction study. Regarding Roxicet, I would not recommend taking it for a long time, because it can lead to addiction and tolerance. Instead, I would recommend taking amitriptyline or pregabaline for the chronic management of nerve pain. A new surgery may be needed, depending on the new MRI results.

The neurologist ran some labs, which came back negative. He did some in-office-type testing and offered to prescribe some kind of antagonist (or something like that). I declined at the time because I have prisms in my glasses (because of what my eye doctor has observed re double vision on a few different occasions now) and they seemed to be doing the trick. I moved about 1000 miles away ... and now am really having trouble. The idea that it could be related to myasthenia gravis concerns me.

It can not cause such symptoms, as it is a past lesion.

You should know that encephalitis is acute infection of the brain, caused by an infectious agent (viral, bacterial or fungal). The infectious agent is responsible for the skin lesions too.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.With all probabilities your biological pain is the manifestation of some kind of anxiety and stress which you could overcome with your own efforts.  There is some amount of stress in everyone's life, but one should put all his efforts to overcome this, and should not make the stress into a full fledged disease process. I would advise you for a modification of your life style. Go for a morning walk/jogging depending on your medical fitness. Eat healthy fresh food, fruits and enough liquids. Try to remain busy in your work, and indulge yourself in other activities during your leisure hours. Have a good night sleep, and avoid smoking/alcoholic beverages. Do some deep breathing exercises when in stress. I am sure, you would improve if you adopt these measures. In the worst case, you might have to take the help of a psychiatrist. You can continue taking nexium till then, but better avoid motilium for a long duration.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Physiotherapy is needed to help improve the posture and reinforce the back muscles. I would also recommend avoiding heavy weight lifting.Surgery can not give you a new vertebral column.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From your history, it seems that the IUD Mirena is the culprit in your pain in lower abdomen. As you are already due to remove it soon, you might be relieved completely after its removal. If I were your treating doctor, I would have removed it alongwith a vaginal swab culture sensitivity test, and would prescribe a broad spectrum antibiotic covering both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. This would relieve your symptoms. As presently you do not have any gastro intestinal symptoms, I would defer referral to any gastroenterologistfor the time being.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

A concussion is basically a bruise that happens when the soft, jello-like brain bounces against the hard surface of the inner skull. The treatment is to rest the brain and let it heal.Air travel does present some unique conditions, and you’re right to ask about air pressure changes.At sea level, the air we breathe contains about 21 percent oxygen, while due to pressure differences on a typical commercial flight the cabin air has only about 15 percent oxygen. This can result in a slightly lower blood oxygen saturation for passengers while in the air.For healthy individuals , this small decrease usually goes unnoticed, however adults with recent head injury have reported an increase in symptoms like headache and nausea while on board.Consider pre-medication with a dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen before boarding. It’s a good idea for him to be well-rested (or maybe sleep on the plane) and to stay hydrated during the flight. Encourage water rather than soda or fruit juices, as these can actually pull water out of the tissues.Since brain rest is recommended following a concussion, reading, watching movies and playing video games – things people normally do for entertainment on a plane – may make things worse. Instead, suggest your fiancee listen to quiet music or an audio book with the volume on the low side.Most mild concussions improve dramatically in two weeks, so he should wait for at least 2 weeks .Thanks."},{"Patient":"Sir, My 5 year old son has been suffering from seizure and presently he has been taking AED for mor than one year.

Radiation therapy is absolutely of no avail in treating such cysts and Keppra could be useful to you if your symptoms are related to seizure activity....which may or may not be a CONSEQUENCE of the cyst.It really depends on how big the cyst is, where exactly it's located, and if it's really causing pressure or mass effect to develop which could be triggering seizures.But, before putting a patient on Keppra (or any drug), I would do testing and be as sure as possible that I have the right diagnosis since the medicine can cause side effects.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Dariush Saghafi"},{"Patient":"My mother is on sinimet. She has been on this for a while, she has Parkinson s.

She gets Trazadone mirtizapine at bed time and we ve started relying on Xanax to ca her however it puts her to sleep. We just started to notice her fingernails are turning dark","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I would explain that anxiety is a common complication of levodopa therapy (sinemet). Trazodone and mirtazapine can help in this regard. But, both these drugs increase sleepiness and may have some interactions, possibly leading to serotonin syndrome. Coming to this point, I would recommend discussing with her doctor on the possibility of making some changes to her therapy (stopping one of these drugs and starting an anti-psychotic drug instead, to help with her obsessions).

Thank You","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!Your symptoms could be related to different possible causes: -a spike in blood pressure values- tension type headache, caused by psychological stress- ice peak headache, which is a benign type of headache. Coming to this point, I would recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure values, especially during this type of headache. If the problem persists, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful physical exam and some tests: - thyroid hormone levels (synthroid dose adjustment may be needed)- blood electrolytes- PCR, sedimentation rate, complete blood count for inflammation. If all the above tests result normal, and your blood pressure values are within the normal ranges, there is nothing to worry about!

I also feel hungry within 3 hours of eating. what should i do.","Doctor":"Hello dear,The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to Acid Peptic disease.Sensation of discomfort after eating spicy food is characteristic.An Ultrasound scan of Abdomen & upper GI endoscopy will be helpful in clinching the diagnosis.Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Pantoprazole preparation (to be taken twice a day before meals) & antacid gel (to be taken after meals).They prevent formation of excess acid in the stomach & provide symptomatic relief.And it is also needed that you take certain precautions regarding your diet & lifestyle, such as:1. Take soft, plain, non-spicy foods.2. Drink lots of water to maintain adequate hydration.3. Avoid fast foods & gas producing food products like cabbage, etc.4. Avoid smoking & alcohol.5.

However, if after multiple cycles of BOTOX nothing seems to be changing then, unfortunately, either the person doing the injections needs to rethink the diagnosis or the method of injection is inadequate, or the dosage of the BOTOX is inadequate, or the injector should consider an alternative to BOTOX such as MYOBLOC or another agent, etc.  Certainly, a 2nd opinion would not hurt if you are not getting the relief you seek from current therapy.

You have problem with passing urine or stools.3.your pain is unrelenting and non responsive to conservative measures which include bed rest,physiotherapy , nerve numbing medications and anti inflammatory medications all tried for a period of 12 weeks.If any of three conditions   apply to your condition and it is affecting your quality of life and your job, getting the surgery done at the earliest  is advisable. The source of pain can be inflammatory or mechanical. during the initial few weeks sine the pain is related to inflammation it has more chances of getting resolved on its own , but once the pain is related to mechanical pressure it is unlikely that your pain will resolve without relieving the mechanical pressure by surgery. If the pressure is due to inflammation you might do well even without surgery , whereas if it is due to mechanical pressure it is likely that your symptoms will progress if not operated.Hope this answers your question.With Kind regards,Dr. Shashidhar.B.K Spine surgeon Bangalore"},{"Patient":"my daughter is 18 years old and 4 year ago had a partial thoratic spinal fusion for her scoliosis.

However, there is no gold standard established as of now for selective thoracic fusion for scoliosis and we spine surgeons are still exploring the ideal lower instrumented level to avoid such a phenomenon. The postoperative deterioration or progression of the lumbar curve  below the thoracic spinal fusion instrumentation resulting frequently occurs and it might  require surgical revision if patients is cosmetically bothered by the appearance.  As of now there is nothing which the patient or the relatives can do to avoid surgery.

However, balance problem may or may not be related to your surgery. Balance issues will need evaluation by a neurologist. Balance issues can be due to compression in some other part of your spinal cord - that is thoracic spine( balance issues only in legs) or cervical spine( balance issues in both upper or lower limbs) or occasionally in the part of the spine which was operated due to weakness in the muscles of the leg. It can also be related to issues of brain( cerebellum apart mostly). With this background I would suggest you to kindly visit a neurologist .

So now her neurologist prescribed Trokendi XR (Topamax), beginning with 50 mg/day and over a few weeks, up to 100 mg/day.

Please consult your doctor if symptoms deteriorating and new symptoms developed he will guide you in right way."},{"Patient":"Hi,i woke up with a strange sensation in the right side of my lower lip,i thought it might be the onset of a bad cold sore but then I became aware that my whole lower lip was going numb,it was extremely frightening and thought it was a stroke,I panicked as I live alone and discovered my lip went completely white","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of any stroke. You should know that the lower lip is not related to a specific region on the brain. So, it is less likely that these complaints are related to a brain stroke or any other lesion. Blood pressure fluctuations could be the cause of your symptoms. Other causes to consider would be: electrolyte imbalance, thyroid dysfunction, anxiety, etc.. So, if the problem persists, I would recommend checking your thyroid hormone levels and blood electrolytes. It is also necessary to closely monitor your blood pressure values. If all these tests result normal, and your blood pressure values are normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause of your complaints. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"My head has hurt for a whole half a day, went to sleep, woke up and it still hurts.I hear clicking on the left side of my head where it hurts along with pressure.What is this?Also hurts my head when I cough.I hit my head and got a concussion about 3weeks ago.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to the head concussion.Anyway, if the clicking noise and headache persists, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist and performing a brain MRI or MRA, to exclude a possible vascular lesion. If you have symptoms like nausea or confusion, I recommend going to the ER for a brain CT scan, to exclude possible delayed subdural hemorrhage. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Wishing all the best, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I have hypothyroidism and PCOS. and I recently had a T3, TSH, and Reverse T3 bloodwork done.

For this reason, I would first recommend performing a nerve conduction study to examine your nerves. Regarding treatment, you should know that Typtomer can help with the chronic management of the pain. Anyway, considering the fact that the pain persists, I would recommend adding pregabaline or gabapentine to your actual therapy.

Im taking codeine/tramdol/diazepam.. which are all doing there jobs. The numbness just started from my bottom first then over 3 days right down to my feet","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I passed carefully through your question and would explain that the numbness in your feet could be related to different possible causes: an electrolyte imbalance, peripheral neuropathy, adverse effects related to your current therapy, etc..I would not recommend taking for a long time codeine, tramadol or diazepam, because they can cause addiction and tolerance, beside other adverse effects. Besides, codeine and tramadol may aggravate IBS. I would just recommend consulting with a neurologist and performing some tests : -  complete blood count- blood electrolytes- a nerve conduction study. I would also encourage you to stop taking codeine or tramadol, and see if your symptoms improve. This would implicate these drugs as possibly related to your complaints.

She has become more dopey than before (Primipex  0.125 mg + Tryptomer 25 mg). Is this regimen OK?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding Tryptomer, I would explain that this is an atidepressant, which is not well tolerated by patients of this age. It may cause dry mouth, low blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension and urinary retention at these ages. Cardiac arrythmia can also occur as a possible adverse effect of this drug. For this reason, I would not recommend taking it. Instead, I would recommend taking a SSRI drug (sertraline, paroxetine, etc.)for the same purpose (depression or anxiety). These drugs are better tolerated at her age. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Wishing good health, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I have a noticeably inflamed nasal septum in the right nostril.

I am currently taking OTC allergy meds and using home remedies (which I have done for 3 weeks unsuccessfully).

I have been snoring a lot, waking myself up and keeping spouse awake also mild headaches during the day and staying tired. Can this med be the cause? I have high blood pressure which I take medication for (years now) and take a HRT.","Doctor":"Citalopram does not cause snoring. Snoring is a structural, anatomic issue. when you sleep, the muscles around your neck area relax. the airway, instead of being fully open, gets floppy. it is the sound of air going through a floppy pipe, essentially, that causes the snoring noise. The amount of airway closure that occurs increases if you are on muscle relaxers, drink alcohol, or (most common) if you are overweight. If you are waking up at night and feeling fatigued during the day, as well as snoring loudly, these are all signs of possible sleep apnea, which very commonly occurs in heavy snorers. I would advice seeing your primary care doctor about this in order to obtain a sleep study referral. In the mean time, there are several over the counter anti snoring devices that basically all work by keeping the airway more open. Try those out, I am sure your spouse would appreciate it."},{"Patient":"I have high blood pressure and take medication to controll my blood pressure. but sometimes I fill like i can hear the ocean in my ear and head. this sounds strange and my arm also tingle also.

This can lead to radicular nerve pain in the region where this nerve travels (maybe both lower limbs), which is triggered by sitting or standing up position. If the pain is not relieved by painkillers, I would recommend consulting with a spinal surgeon for surgery as a possible treatment option.

The sound was like that made by clicking rocks together while swimming underwater. The MRI showed nothing amiss other than mild hardening of the blood vessels.

In my search for an answer, I found that the sweeteners used in Sunny D aren t natural sugar and at least two of them contain aspartame. I quit drinking Sunny D and in a couple of days the problems went away. Is it just a coincidence, a lull in my symptoms, or was aspartame causing the problems?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!Regarding your concern, you should know that there are not enough data based evidence to support these adverse effects of aspartame.

In the mean time I have to deal with the dizziness.","Doctor":"Meclizine is poorly effective for the majority of cases of \\"dizziness\\" yet it is prescribed with what I refer to as \\"reckless abandon\\" at times from ER's, etc.  First, dizziness has to be defined as either VERTIGO or not and then, the UNDERLYING cause needs to be sought and discovered.  Medication (meclizine or not) is not going to resolve problem if the vertigo is because an inner ear problem, a circulatory problem, or a brain problem.  Your next best move is to see a NEUROLOGIST or if possible a NEURO-OTOLOGIST.  The time of 1 week to see a specialist is not bad at all.  If you wanted to be seen sooner then, you could try a CVS pharmacy Minute Clinic but typically those are staffed by Nurse Practitioner and from what you're stating I don't think it's likely that you would get much more than either the meclizine back at a higher dose or something else geared toward just treating your symptoms without looking for a cause.

Iris","Doctor":"Dear Iris, Thank you for asking on Healthcaremagic!I understand your concern and would explain that all these treatments are symptomatic. Besides acyclovir, which is an antiviral agent, used  against herpes infection, all the other drugs are symptomatic treatment for the pain control. Antiepilepsy agents can be used for years, to reduce the severity and frequency of pain attacks. I would  not recommend taking ativan and hydrocodone for a long time. Hydrocodone can cause addiction and tolerance. A brain MRI is necessary too. Other treatment options would be local infiltrations of the trigeminal nerve or other antiepilepsy agents. You should know that during antiepilpsy treatment, it is necessary to periodically check up their plasma levels and also complete blood count and liver and renal function tests.

I had my stones removed in Jan. (this year) The doc. gave me the Ok to resume training at the gym. I noticed my abdomen hurts when I do abs exercise and at night when I urine. I tried to massage while in bed but it still hurts. What should do? Thanks, Carlton","Doctor":"Hi. It would have been helpful for us , if you would have mentioned the route by which the stones were removed.Anyways- from your history I can think of a few possibilities - as the pain is during exercises , there can be a strained muscle in that area. The infection of the urinary bladder can cause pain while passing urine. Get a high resolution ultrasonography of the abdomen , abdominal wall and urinary system done to get a clue. Of course a clinical examination by a Surgeon can get you the maximum information ."},{"Patient":"I have distonia and have had this head tremor since I was 30. My sister had this same problem and tried to solve it by getting medication from the Dr. she was going to, but she seemed to need more and got another dr. prescribing meds , she ended up in a nursing home when she was in her early sixies. and died when she was 80.. I didnt want to take this route so after going to a neurologist in Ottawa, tried the meds the Dr. prescribed but found I couldnt breath 13 or so days after taking the meds so a few years later I tried again and after 10 days or so I fainted from taking them. Since then I have been struggling with the effects of this decease and only taking a lorazem pill 0.5 mg. when going to the dentist or a funeral , now I know I have to get something that will agree with me , and I need to see a Dr. like Dr. Da Silva , that I have heard is very compassionate and I can t wait 6 months for an appointment. Do you think you could help me, by the way,, I m now 84, but other than this I m energetic and walk and swim a lot and eat a healthy diet. I was going to Dr. Grimes but his meds or botox never worked for me so I want to go to another neurologist. Sincerely and desperate, Kathleen C. MacDonald","Doctor":"Hello Kathleen!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!I read carefully your question and understand your concern!I would recommend trying clonazepam with a low dose and increase slowly for your head tremor. This drug is better compared to lorazepam, which is not recommended as long term therapy, because it can cause addiction and tolerance. Starting at a low dose (0.25mg at night) and increasing slowly (0.25mg every 3 days), until reaching the dose of 2mg daily, will help improve your situation, without experiencing its  adverse effects. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues.

The fact that you have lost hearing in in your left ear, is another argument in favor of this disorder. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing a brain CT scan, which can help exclude a brain lesion and also examine your inner ear structure. A brain MRI study may be needed, based on the CT scan results.

I am extremely fatigued, hands arms, legs are very weak. I take levothyroxine and high cholesterol. My bad cholesterol is 196, my weight fluctuates 20 lbs up and down. I am having difficulty sleeping but yet extremely tired. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!I would like to review your brain MRI findings for a more professional opinion. You should know that MS is an autoimmune disorder, which may coexist with other autoimmune disorders like thyroid dysfunction and connective tissue disorders. Have you performed a spinal tap to check for the presence of oligoclonal bands? This would be another step in the diagnosis of MS. From the other hand, I would also recommend performing a cervical and thoracic spine MRI study to be sure of MS diagnosis. Steroid treatment may be needed considering your connective tissue disorder. A follow up with brain MRI to study the progression of those lesions is necessary too, before starting treatment for MS.

Is his headache triggered by standing up positition? This would indicate possible intracranial hypotension (from low quantity of CSF). A brain MRI is also necessary too, coupled with a lumbar puncture to exclude possible infection. You should discuss with his doctor on the above issues.

Memory problems may be strikingly severe while other thinking and social skills are relatively unaffected. For example, individuals may seem able to carry on a coherent conversation, but moments later be unable to recall that the conversation took place or to whom they spoke.Korsakoff syndrome is a clinical diagnosis representing a physician's best judgment about the cause of a person's symptoms. There are no specific lab tests or brain scan procedures to confirm that a person has this disorder.so if you are suffering from antegrade amnesia , you might have korsakoff syndrome. my advice would be stop alcohol forever, & continue oral thiamine and multivitamins supplements.thanks for the consultation with HCM.:)"},{"Patient":"Good mourning.

No significant health history other than anxiety. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!Your symptoms could be related to blood pressure spikes. Anxiety can also trigger this situation. If these episodes keep repeating, I would recommend consulting with your GP for a physical check up and some tests: - a chest X ray study- complete blood count- kidney and liver function tests- fasting glucose- thyroid hormone levels. A close monitoring of your blood pressure is necessary too. A Holter for blood pressure may be needed.

Any idea I have blood trust to rule out limes and rhumithroid arthritis, it did show signs of swelling.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!The pain in your neck irradiating to the toes is not related to the trigeminal neuralgia. It could be related to a bulging disc in the cervical vertebral column causing irradiating radicular pain in this region. For this reason, I would recommend performing a cervical spine X ray study and a nerve conduction study. A cervical spine CT scan or MRI may be needed. Regarding trigeminal neuralgia, it is necessary performing a brain MRI to exclude other secondary causes that may lead to this situation. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests.

Orthostatic hypotension can mimic this situation. Electrolyte imbalances like high potassium levels (caused by candesartan) can trigger this situation too. For this reason, I would recommend checking your blood pressure values in sitting and standing up position. If there is a drop in your blood pressure in standing up position orthostatic hypotension could be the cause. It is also necessary checking your potassium plasma levels, although it is not typical for high potassium levels to cause symptoms which are modulated by standing up.

But physical exercise and Yoga can help reinforce your back muscles and correct your posture. This will help reduce the back muscle spasms and thus reduce the pain. Surgery is not a definitive solution too. You may still experience chronic back pain after surgery.

For this reason, I would recommend performing an EEG and a brain MRI to investigate for seizures. Transient amnesia can also occur during anxiety. So, if all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as a possible cause of her troubles.

You should know that phenytoin is a very good drug,but it may interact with many drugs and foods. That is why you have these fluctuations in plasma levels of phenytoin. If you are taking the dose of 400mg twice daily, I would recommend switching directly to one dose of 300mg ER in the morning and one dose of 300mg ER in the evening. Anyway, considering these fluctuations of phenytoin in your blood and also its adverse effects when used for a long time, I would recommend considering other treatment options for epilepsy like Valproic acid or Levetiracetam, which have fewer adverse effects.

But your headache  characteristics is not typical of this disorder. The throbbing headaches, could be related to migraine or high blood pressure. Did you measure your blood pressure values?Anyway, if the problem persists, I would recommend performing a new brain MRI to evaluate if there is progression of the tumor and a visual field evaluation (because tumors in this region can cause visual field defects). A close monitoring of your blood pressure values is still necessary, to exclude blood pressure fluctuations, which are common causes of throbbing headaches.

I have not been lifting anything heavy so I don t think it is a hernia. Could it just be trapped gas or do I need to go to my doctors Monday if I can get in?","Doctor":"Hi dear, I have gone through your case and I can understand your concern. Thank you for asking on HealthcareMagic.com, providing better healthcare for you. I guess it may be due to urinary tract infection or kidney stones, so it would be better to have and abdominal ultrasound & urinalysis done to set the diagnosis. For the pain I would prescribe Buscopan 10mg two tablets 4 times a day. Increase fluids; drink at least one large glass of water every hour while you are awake. Drink cranberry juice to help fight and prevent urinary tract infections. If you do not like the taste of cranberry juice, mix cranberry juice with another juice like grape juice.

I am now starting to experience some tingling on the top of my right foot at times. More in the morning or after sitting. No pain, just a tingling sensation when I arch my foot inward. Could this be related to my stenosis?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!Your symptoms are not typical of spinal canal stenosis. Instead, they could indicate a possible pinched nerve or tarsal tunnel syndrome. For this reason, I would recommend performing a nerve conduction study to examine the nerves of your lower limbs.

Very addictive. Work in yard. I do take medication but I see my doctors on a regular basis. About 2 months ago I past out and was taken to the ER. They found nothing wrong with me and I was sent home. I remember nothing of going to the ER. However I had to have a MRI because my back hurt.(I had been putting it off for about 6 months. I pick up heavy things) I found out. that my left Lomba disc 4&5 have pulled apart.I m now wareing a soft brace when standing. When I m to get up in the morning I can not be leave the pain.

Old friend, know him all my life--- need new eyes to look at me. I look forward to healing from you","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!I read carefully your question and would explain that the dizziness and headaches could be related to an inner ear disorder. There is no connection of these symptoms with the lumbar back pain. Coming to this point, the best thing to do is consulting with an ENT specialist (like your friend or another specialist of this field). A brain MRI may be needed too.

You should know that lumbar spine  chronic degenerations can cause chronic back pain.I would just recommend performing a lumbar spine MRI study to exclude possible spinal canal stenosis, although your symptoms are not typical of this disorder. A lot of physical activity to reinforce your back muscles would help reduce the pain. A muscle relaxant or gabapentine could be helpful too. You should discuss with your doctor on the above options.

The increased sleepiness could be caused by a head concussion or a temporary loss of the brain normal function due to the head trauma. The best thing to do in this situation is to help him avoid a possible repeated head trauma in the next days. For this reason, it is necessary to stay next to him. I would also advice avoid heavy games, which need a straining physical activity or impose the risk of falling in the next days.

For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your doctor and performing a nerve conduction study (electroneurography) to exclude this possible cause. Other blood lab tests are necessary too : complete blood count, iron plasma levels, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, etc.. If all these tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as a possible cause of your complaints.

A hormonal imbalance, can not be excluded either, especially considering the fact that your symptoms repeat each month at the same time. I would exclude any neurological disorders possible related to this clinical situation. Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting with your doctor for some tests: complete blood count for anemia, blood electrolytes, PCR for inflammation, thyroid hormone levels for electrolyte imbalances, sex hormone levels, fasting glucose. If all these tests result normal, it would mean that nothing serious is going on.

They do not indicate any serious medical disorder. The nausea after eating could be related to abdominal distension or gastro-esophageal reflux. The headaches and dizziness could be explained with the low blood pressure, which is a common finding in pregnant women.

While the tingling and numbness in your arm, could be related to a pinched nerve or radicular nerve pain related to a bulging cervical disc. You should know that even the occipital neuralgia can be triggered by chronic degenerations of the cervical spine. Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful physical check up and performing a cervical spine X ray study. A cervical spine CT scan or MRI may be needed.

It is important to investigate for the possible causes of these blood pressure fluctuations. For this reason, I would recommend performing some tests (if you have not performed them yet): - blood electrolytes- PCR, sedimentation rate for inflammation- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction- a Head Up Tilt test for possible orthostatic hypotension.

I have been diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma (very small, around 3mm), and PCOS back in September. I've been on meds for these and since the meds started I have had no side effects, and my symptoms went away (biggest one being headaches with blurred vision, nausea and vomiting). Beginning of December I got a headache that didn't go away for almost 3 weeks. Also accompanied with blurred/cloudy vision, dizziness, and nausea/vomiting. The headaches have gotten better, but the cloudy vision has stayed. I had an eye exam a few months ago which showed that I had blind spots in my left eye, leading the neuro and eye doc to believe the adenoma was slightly pressing on the optical nerve. Problem is when I went back to my endo and neuro this past week and told them about the headaches, neither seemed to really care. I of course am concerned because I do not want to end up with permanent vision issues. Not to mention the headaches are not pleasant. I am due to deploy in the very near future and don't want to get somewhere and have an issue down the road. Is this something I need to push with my primary care doc and possibly get a new neurologist, or am I worried about probably nothing?

Since my surgery I have had no pain at all in my back. However before the surgery, my right leg has drop foot (this is why I had emergency back surgery), It has not recovered . Last week I slipped on the ice and yesterday I had x-rays done yesterday. I just picked up my report and The findings were There is posterior fusion of L3-L5 with disc innerspace devices. Vertebral body heights are within normal limits. There is grade 1 anterior subluxation of L4 on L5. L5-S1 has sever disc space narrowing. Impression: 1. Lower lumbar fusion as described above. Hardware appears intact. 2. Grade 1 anterior subluxation of L4 on L5. 3. Severe disc space narrowing of L5-S1. I have not been able to get ahold of my back surgeon and am very scared. I am in a lot of pain now. I have not had any pain since my back surgery. My drop foot is making it easy for me to fall. I wear an AFO on my right leg. Can you explain to me if this situation is severe and if I messed up perfect back surgery by my fall. What is Grade 1 anterior subluxation of L4 on L5. Will this require another surgery. I am scared to death. The L5-S1 severe disc space narrowing, I don t believe would be caused by falling. If it is can you let me know. I just turned 55 and currently have no one to get answers from.

It s just that, there are some decisions in my life that are simple to make. For example, I never had dental insurance, so now I m finally getting around to going to the dental college several times to get a deep cleaning, several fillings, etc. That s an easy decision to make. I m saving my teeth before they get too bad. But here s the hard decision: I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder three years ago right after I finished my math bachelor s degree and while I was working on my teacher s certificate. I never finished the teacher s certificate, so I ve been living with my parents since I graduated college because I couldn t get a real job. When I was in the mental hospital for two weeks, I thought I had schizophrenia because I said some weird things. I m actually bipolar, but I need some support. I know friends and family help. I don t have a girlfriend, but I don t know if I should. What I really wonder about is the spiritual aspect of things. I was an atheist who was angry that his parents went to Bible Colleges and ended up working in low jobs. That was why I went to a top university and majored in math. When I was at the mental hospital, a girl was into me and wanted to be my girlfriend, I tried yoga, I read the Bible a lot, and I was given a book that I ve been studying called The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle, which later led to studying the philosophy of Alan Watts. I know that it s important to know exactly what you want in life before you pursue it, or you ll keep changing your mind and waste your time. I have been given advice by some people I respect that I should try to pass some actuarial exams (basically becoming a statistician for an insurance company). I could earn good money that way and use my math background. But I m afraid of working hard, which I will need to do in order to get anywhere, and then ending up having another nervous breakdown and being institutionalized. My psychiatrist is just a drug dealer who gets as many patients (who are poor) as he can so that he can just give them prescriptions but not any advice or therapy. The point I want to make is that I just need a support system that I can put all my faith in, like Jesus Christ (but I m too much of a skeptic), so that I can stop worrying so much. Once I stop worrying, I can find out exactly what I love as a career (I m not even sure what that should be), and then I will pursue it. I was able to earn my college degree without having support, but it led to mental illness because of stress with nowhere to turn. Right now, I just wish I knew what my religion or source of spirituality would be for psychological strength so that I can achieve goals in the real world. Also, I never took a psychology class, but I may have something called paralysis of analysis.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HealthCareMagic.com I am Dr.J.Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas.

Was hit by car and damaged my nerves in my left arm. The doctor. Says its an left bracular plexis.  They did a nerve replacement, by taking nerved out of my left and right leg. But i didnt see any imrovement. Is there another alternative that i can check out","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. You had nerve grafting for brachial plexus years ago. As you mentioned there was no improvement. I will first tell you about nerve recovery and then mention other options.The best recovery and regeneration of damaged nerve occurs in first 6 months. After it slows down and it almost stops after 12 months. The last cut off is 18 months. The ideal time for nerve graft surgery is 3 to 6 months post-brachial plexus injury (blunt injury) and immediate exploration if cut injury.Now as many years have passed, nerve graft is not an option here. It is because muscles atrophy after years. Even if nerve regenerates, muscle will not respond. So nerve reconstructing surgeons have developed other alternatives- Free muscle and tendon transfer - Here muscle is rotated from its original site and re-implanted in upper limb to provide shoulder abduction. e.g. Gracillis muscle.- Vascular pedicle muscle graft - Here muscle is completely transferred to upper limb. Its vascular supply is anastomosed to limb artery and nerve to healthy nerve. - Joint fusion - Shoulder is fused in slight abduction and elbow in 90 degree flexion. Wrist and fingers are fused in mid-pronation, slight flexion. The problem is that the results are not that much good. Fine movements can not occur. Only gross movements can occur. You can discuss above options with surgeon.Hope it will help. If any doubts, do let me know.Thanks. Take care.Dr Ishu Bishnoi"},{"Patient":"hello there, I am Beverly from Indiana,  My husband had spinal menigitis as a child.  And in the past several years his health has went down hill.

You are on three anti epileptics that is eslify (eslicarbazepine), lamitor (lamotrigine) and solzam (clobazam). Your semen analysis is showing low sperm count.

Shift the routine of drug intake one by one, not all at once. You will experience sedation in morning after taking solzam. So be careful, avoid driving/going alone/walking on roads. And also these medications do not cause low sperm count. There is no effect on sperm count or motility.Kindly ask your doctor to repeat an EEG of you to find the seizure focus.

I don't think that Keppra is related to high platelet number or sepsis. An infection could be the cause of his clinical situation. Coming to this point, I would recommend first treat the infection and the fever. After the fever is gone, you may discuss on the possible changes to his therapy. In this regard, Lamotrigine or Valproate would be a good treatment option.

Also i had a chest xray done today and i have had a R node on my lung ,and today its still there but now my L lung has a bigger node what could this be ?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!I read carefully your question and would explain that it is necessary investigate for the nature of these lung nodes, which could just inflammatory lymph nodes or a tumor. An infection can not be excluded either. Biopsy may be needed if they persist. From the other hand, the fact that the doctors wanted to put you on IV steroids after the MRI results, indicates that your symptoms are related to a relapse of MS and IV steroids would help improve your situation. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues.

From the other hand, the way you feel could be related to depression. For this reason, I recommend consulting with a psychiatrist for a careful evaluation of your situation.An antidepressant could help improve the way you feel, make you more optimistic. Besides antidepressants are a good treatment option for chronic pain and neuropathy pain. Pregabaline could also be a good treatment option for neuropathy.

The pain occurs even when I am at rest without movement.  It hurts to cough and I feel pain when pushing out urine. It doesn't hurt to urine but the pushing out of the urine causes pain in that area.

But if he stops eating the situation may aggravate in some months. For this reason, I recommend consulting with a psychiatrist to help his with his appetite and apathy.

My question is...I also have hepatitis C.  I just had a blood test with very high liver enzymes.  Does the epidural injections affect my liver enzymes? I had injection 1 month ago","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. You had epidural injection for spinal canal stenosis. I think, the doctor had given you some painkiller or steroid injection for relief. You are hepatitis C positive. You had asked one question -Epidural injection affect on liver enzyme?I will explain it to you. Epidural injection injects drug in epidural space. It does not cause direct entry of drug into blood. The idea behind epidural injection is giving drug at local site. If same drug will be given through blood (intravenous route), that will reach at every organ. It will affect liver and kidney more. While epidural drug will first act at local site and some amount will finally reach liver and kidney. So the damage will be less.The point is epidural injection is relatively safe for liver and kidney. Can it cause rise in liver enzyme? Yes, it can cause. The rise will depend upon the type of drug. Steroids can cause rise in liver enzyme. But chances are less.Try to rule out other causes like active Hepatitis C, alcohol, any oral or IV drug. Consult your doctor to rule out any progressive worsening of liver function tests.Hope it will help you.

You are very young for diffuse cerebellar atrophy. One thing I want to clear to you, is cerebellar atrophy is irreversible. However, you can stop its progression. I will tell you few measures for this- First consult some neurologist to rule out B12 deficiency, spinocerebellar atrophy, Freidreich's Ataxia. He will advise you few investigations to rule out it. Treatment will depend upon final diagnosis. Spinocerebellar atrophy and FA are congenital, progressive disease. They can be treated symptomatically only.- Increase intake of fruits, green vegetables, curd, dry fruits. These are rich in antioxidants, minerals and vitamin. It will naturally stop atrophy.- You should take neutron specific vitamin supplements like B12, folic acid, Pantothenic acid, Pyridoxine after proper prescription.- If you are having tremors, tablet propranolol can be taken after prescription.- For memory loss, you can take tablet Donepezil, citicoline after proper prescription. Keep a dairy with you to remember things. try to play Sudoku or chess to improve your memory.- Consult physiotherapist to improve your muscle strength.

As of know I am unable to lift or stand any length of time without pain and spasms.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. You have already fused spine at L5 S1 level. Fusion of spine increases chances of disc herniation one level above and below. It has happened in your case. You are having disc bulge at L4-5 level. But good thing is, it is only bulge and thecal (spinal nerve covering membrane) compression. There is no actual nerve compression of L5 or traversing nerve roots. I am worried about your S1 nerve root. As your spine is fused at this level, it should not be compromised. You should consult your operating spine surgeon and get a NCCT lumbosacral spine to rule out spinal canal stenosis, graft migration. Get a nerve conduction velocity and electromyography of L4 to S4 nerves to rule out nerve damage and muscles affected. It will also confirm the degree of damage and affect of disc bulge.Till then, for relief in your symptoms  - You should avoid forward bending, weight lifting.- Avoid prolonged standing or sitting.- You can take painkiller like pregabaline, gabapentine or combination of gabapentin+amitriptyline/nortriptyline, after proper prescription. - For leg spasm, do stretching exercise, apply hot fomentation over back and pain area. - Apply diclofenac gel locally over pain site, after prescription.- Take nerve regenerating supplements like S-adensoylmethionine, B12, folic acid, Pyridoxine, Pantothenic acid after proper prescription.If you can send me your MRI pictures and treatment summary, I can help you more.Hope above answer will help you.Thanks.

Stable abnormal FLAIR signal within the left occipital lobe. Persistent posterior parafalcine, tentorial, and cerebellar dural enhancement. The dural enhancement of the tentorium is slightly worse compared to the prior examination.Redemonstration of a few tiny FLAIR signal hyperintensities within the bilateral subcortical and deep white matter, most likely related to chronic ischemic microvascular disease. The diffusion weighted images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct. Unchanged left parietal developmental venous anomaly.

What does that mean? She has some psychiatric issues that she takes meds for. She has had head injuries in the past as well. Any information will be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. Your daughter is quite young for diffuse cerebral atrophy. Age related cerebral atrophy usually occurs after 60 years age. I suspect repeated head injuries as the cause of diffuse cerebral atrophy in her. Repeated head injuries can cause accumulation of blood and chronic ischemia of brain. It can result into progressive cerebral atrophy. If she had sustained diffuse axonal injury or/and acute subdural hematoma, the atrophy will be more.Now coming to its treatment, it can be treated symptomatically only. It is irreversible. With medication, we can delay its progression. You have mentioned about some psychiatric issues (details not provided). - You can consult a Psychiatrist for psychiatric illness. Counselling, medication and family support will help her in overcoming it.- Increase diet of green vegetables, almonds, fruits, fish to provide maximum nutrition and antioxidatives to brain. - You can also give her nerve specific vitamin like B12, folic acid, pyridoxine, Pantothenic acid, Benfotamine after proper prescription. It will take care of nutritional deficiency.- Some new cognition improving medications like Citicoline, cerebrohydrosylate can be tried after proper prescription. For memory, she can be given tablet Donepezil after proper prescription.- Music therapy, Yoga and meditation enhance the cognition and higher mental function. Hi, thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. Your uncle is suffering from multiple diseases like DM, pulmonary TB, Thalassemia minor and ependymoma. All these diseases can cause deterioration in patient's general condition. Thus worsen the prognosis of TB and ependymoma.Now coming to your questions,1 Spine surgery can be deferred for few weeks till 1-2 months. It is because your uncle is having ependymoma at terminal spinal cord. it is usually \\"Myxopapillary ependymoma\\". This ependymoma is grade I and carries a good prognosis. It is very slow growing tumor. Waiting for few weeks will not going to increase the size of tumor.2 Both are priorities. Pulmonary TB can be completely treated by anti-tubercular treatment. During TB therapy, patient can undergo surgery of ependymoma. Also you have to wait for decision of neurosurgeon who is going to operate him. If he thinks, patient is not fit for surgery, then wait.3 CT guided biopsy can be done after surgery. If his sputum was positive for TB, then there is no need of CT guided biopsy. 4 Prognosis of both diseases are good. Pulmonary TB is 100% curable if complete ATT is received. Ependymoma can be completely resected. Myxopapillary ependymoma carries best prognosis among ependymoma. Hope above answers will clear your doubts. Hope it will help you. If still in doubt, do let me know.Thanks.

Thanks, Aminu, nigeria.","Doctor":"Hi Aminu, thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. You are suffering from Pott's spine (TB of spine). You are already taking 4 first line anti tubercular therapy, which is ideal treatment of Pott's spine. The therapy is long, around 9 to 15 months. There is no standard treatment guidelines. The duration can be decided based on your physician decision and your symptoms.Now coming to your symptoms, leg cramps and sciatica. These symptoms are most probably due to compression and collapse of vertebrae, collection of pus in spinal canal and compression of nerves. To get relief, you should- Avoid any kind of weight bearing- Avoid flexion and extension at spine- Wear back supporting belt like thoracolumbar corset.- For pain relief, you can take tablet pregabalin after proper prescription. Usual adult is 75 to 150 mg twice a day. If still no relief, you can take tablet amitriptyline after proper prescription.- For cramps, do physiotherapy and take tablet baclofen after proper prescription.- Also increase your protein and calcium intake for strengthening bones. If still no relief and symptoms worsen, repeat MRI spine to rule out any progressively increasing compression of spinal cord or nerves. Sometimes surgery (less than 10% cases) may be needed to relieve pressure symptoms.Hope it will help you. If still in doubt, do let me know.Thanks.

Could there be a connection?","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidate history. Since you had a breast surgery long ago, having neuropathy now is not possible due to this particular reason. Yes neuro problems like prolapsed disc in th lower thoracic region can cause pain in lower abdomen, but has a specific character like cutting or burning pain.

I am 41 yrs old. When I woke from surgery I immediately felt my big toe and in between 2nd toes numb and pins and needles as well as my calf on my right leg was numb. Told Dr right away. Was told when back heals the foot will heal. Well today my back feels pretty good but still some pain. On right side. Mostly it s the new burning feeling that goes over the top of right foot an toes are sensitive to the slightest touch. I feel as though if it wasn t there before surgery it shouldn t be there now and that I traded in back pain for intense foot pain. Any advice I ve tried prednisone a few others the only thing that does anything is oxycodone 5mg an a robaxin an that just takes away the pain a little. Thank you","Doctor":"Dear user..your pain is nerve related and wont be alleviated by normal analgesics.I would suggest you try MAXGALIN 75 MG twice daily..Also i would like to get your blood sugar levels tested..get a fasting sample ang glycosylated hemoglobin levels,plus vit B12 Levels..if low then u can start on nurokind 1 mg OD  tablets.Hope i have answered your question."},{"Patient":"Hi I had decompression of my Arnold chiari, in Dec 2013. Post op mri showed a pseudomenigocele. In March this year I started having the headaches again and numbness in hands and at times when headaches are bad I get pupillary changes, my right pupil is a size or 2 above the left. I had another mi which showed no change and my N S said if the symptoms are un manageable he would do a shunt as last resort.For the last 5 weeks I ve had vertigo and nausea, the dizziness occurs and goes quickly but is only over the right side. Nausea is constant heightened by turning my neck sideways. I m in constant pain and its worse of a night. It s at the site of my scar and is very deep seated. Also I feel foggy and forgetful and my concentration is awful. Friends and family although their kind their running out of sympathy.","Doctor":"Hello user..First of all u need to know that Arnold Chiari is a malformation for which permanent solution is still to be obtained..Firstly,although posterior decompression is the most favoured therapy it is not helpful in all the patients..m sure ur doctor has given u the right treatment because i cannot comment without seeing the patient and the images.Secondly pseudomeningocele is one of the complications of such a surgery.One more complication is cerebellar slump,which is due to cerebellar herniation through the defect and compressing on the right side of brainstem causing right cranial nerve palsies.All your right side symptoms could be attributed to them.Again its just one of the possible reasons.In my opinion u need a re exploration surgery with duroplasty.Hope I have answered your question."},{"Patient":"I am writing a paper for school, based on the book \\"I Had Brain Surgery, What's Your Excuse?\\"  The person in this book was experiencing seizures every six months, and was ultimately diagnosed with a brain mass.  The mass was removed and turned out to be a gliosis - is that the typical treatment for a gliosis?  The person in the book cannot recall any head injury - does a gliosis ever occur randomly?","Doctor":"To answer your question gliosis does not occur randomly.It is always the result of some insult to the normal brain tissue like trauma,ischemia or stroke.It is a part of normal repair process of the neuronal tissue. Or it may result as a part of any of the inflammmatory neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis,parkinsons,alzheimers and others.And surgery is usually not the typical treatment for a gliosis.It can be managed conservatively like in this case with the help of anti epileptic drugs.Many people dont remember any such injury or small stroke like events occur which may go unnoticed and lead to reactive gliosis.Having said this i admit that i havent read the book and i cannot comment further.Hope my answer is satisfactory."},{"Patient":"Which medication would be best for controlling seizures if you had to chose between Lamictal and Keppra?  The Keppra  is being used now but has bad side effects of aggitation and drowsiness to the point of having to take another medication, Abilify for the aggitation.","Doctor":"Lamictal is a newer second line of antiepileptics which is usually used in conjuction with other first line drugs to attain seizure control.However Keppra can be used as a single drug with good seizure control.However its side effects   can be managed by adequately titrating the dose.So to answer your question i would still chooser Keppra of the two"},{"Patient":"Was playing with my husband and son this morning and while we were wrestling on my bed I felt as if the world was spinning and it took me a good minute to regain my balance.

These 2 instances are the first I have experienced the feeling of blacking out. What could it be?","Doctor":"The symptoms u listed suggest some disorder of your vestibulocochlear system,which is quite evident.Problem is it could be anything from benign to malignant.U need to visit a ENT specialist so that he can examine u clinically and do a series of tests to rule out few diseases.As a neurosurgeon a simple brain MRI woudn hurt and would rule out bigger causes.Again start from smaller things and then go big.Hope i have answered your question."},{"Patient":"My wife (41 yrs) used to get sudden chills and recently had a few incidents of spinning head for a couple of seconds. We got her tests done and had couple of factors out of range. Her ATG levels are 934 and AMA is 314. T3 and T4 are normal, however, TSH is 7.5. Lipids are normal. She has been prescribed Thyronorm 25mcg for 3 months. Is hypothyroidism curable? Also, she has a family history of heart problems. Does this add to her risk of developing heart problems even though presently her tests results are normal?","Doctor":"Hello.I am Dr Mittal.There are three parts to your query which you seem to want to know about- heart problems, thyroid and vertigo.I will try to answer them one by one.1. Ideally you need to be more specific about the exact heart problems that are present. If there is a family history of heart problems, where you are considering heart attacks, yes she may be at risk. However, if she takes good care of herself, she need not necessarily have a attack herself.2. Hypothroidism- well the blood levels certainly suggest mild hypothyroidism. It is not curable. But it is well controlled if she takes her medicines properly and regularly. The thyroid medicines are best taken on empty stomach in the morning. 3. Spinning of the head may be a positional vertigo. That is why she gets it temporarily, probably when she looks in one direction or bends her head in one direction. You will need to visit a neurologist to perform a Dix Hallpike maneuver. if the condition is confirmed, medicines can be initiated like betahistidine.I have tried to make it as simple as possible.Let us know with the results of the tests for further suggestions.Best of luck, Dr Mittal."},{"Patient":"Is it normal to have cold/numb feeling hands and feet when experiencing bouts of PVCs? I get pvcs frequently and my cardiologist has said they are benign. But I'm laying in bed and the tops of my hands and feet have an odd, almost numb sensation, but they are not totally numb because they still have feeling.","Doctor":"Hi.I am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.I think I can help you.Having read your symptoms, there are 2 possibilities that I would consider first.One, PVC, or premature ventricular complexes basically cause a reduced blood supply if there are many of them together. It is caled trains of PVCs. If these trains of PVCs are present, then sometimes you may have these symptoms as the blood circulation in the body is affected and the body attempts to supply the blood to the vitals organs first.A second possibility is that you may be developing peripheral neuropathy. There are many causes of this disorder. In this situation, the loss of sensory symptoms in hands and feet, usually symmetrical (classically known as glove and stocking pattern of sensory loss) is highly suggestive of neuropathy. You will need to test a Nerve Conduction Study and meet a neurologist for the same. If it does turn out to be neuropathy, the addition of medicines like pregabalin or gabapentin may help you.I have tried to make it as simple as possible.Best of luck, Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"I have sudden numbness on the left rear area of my head, completely numb, it travels down the left side of my body slightly going to the right of my body, some left facial numbness.

I have only taken this med for 2 days but have seen no change. i am not dizzy but am uncomfortable at all times feeling numbness.","Doctor":"Hello.I am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.The sensory loss-numbness- from the head, and face and involving one side of the body more than the other is very possibly suggestive of a thalamic stroke.So I would suggest a CT scan of the brain.However, you also have a headache.Similar symptoms may suggest a migraine in such a situation.In migraine however, you have on and off headache previously as well.Since you have not mentioned this in the query, I assume you do not have headaches regularly.And therefore, as such I would suggest the CT scan of the Brain.Let us know the report for medication advice.Best of luck,Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"My left forearm and thumb twitch and my right heel feels tingly everytime I put weight on it while walking.

I am too young to not be able to work and too young to have such fatigue. I know this disease is not reversible but no one has told me what to do to stop it from developing further. I am doing a lot of research online but nothing conclusive. I used to smoke but I do not smoke now. Try to eat healthy, do a little exercise and limit alcohol. I seem to be getting worse. Any advise you could provide me with would be greatly appreciated. I have even considered trying to find a clinical study being performed on people with this particular disease but does not seem to be anything going on in this area right now for clinical studies of the disease.

CT brain result was mild periventricular hypodensities suggestive of ischemic changes of small vessel disease.  Is this a serious condition?","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.The headache and dizziness is most probably related to the head trauma, it is common after trauma. As for the small vessel disease that is a coincidental finding, is not related to the trauma or those symptoms. It hasn't happened over night but over many years, would be present if a CT was done before the trauma as well.It is not serious in the sense of life threatening, those are chronic changes of blood vessels over the years. To a degree are part of aging, the older the more likely to find them. However at 52 they are appearing a little early so they do raise some concern and call for attention as if changes progress to severe over the years they do affect performance, cognitive functions. What is necessary is to screen more closely for predisposing vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol etc and addressing them. That is the only means to at least try (genetic factors play a major role as well and not much can be done about that) to slow their increase in the future.I remain at your disposal for other questions."},{"Patient":"my left hand tingles when i cough.

If there's ALWAYS some numbness then, there is baseline compression and this should be checked out by going to a neurologist, getting an examination, and then, proper testing.  There may be a solution of physical therapy that can help reduce the compression...or if necessary, surgical decompression.

This is most likely the best way to supply dopamine precursors to the body as opposed to what we traditionally been doing in terms of dosing tablets every so many hours.  In your case, every 2.5 hrs. is not bad at all as a dosing interval......but dosing the medication into the gut for CONTINUOUS ABSORPTION is now recognized as the most likely delivery system to give patients the best possible long term outcome of relief and AVOID common side effects of dyskinesias and other problems often seen in conventional dosing interval methods.

If you discontinue it, you could be suffering from those symptoms. Some antidepressants can interact with azilect, increasing serotonin levels up to a critical level, causing potentially life threatening reactions as serotonin syndrome (agitation, restlessness, diarrhea, tachycardia, hallucinations, hyperthermia, nausea and vomiting, hyperreflexia, hypertension), or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (rigidity, diaphoresis, dyspnea, dysphagia, gait abnormalities, hyperthermia, incontinence, pallor, drooling, delirium, stupor or even coma).

The drug was started by his doctor after looking at his Color Doppler and CT following a very violent seizure. There was a tiny clot found. Since then he has had only one violent seizure, but often gets smaller episodes of forgetfullness of duration 2-3 minutes when he loses complete context of his surroundings and looks puzzled. The help that I require is:1. on the side effects that may be caused2. how to subside/overcome those side effects.3. Natural diet that can help him to build resistance to side effects.4. Is there a way of doing away with medication with the help of a one-time treatment?I would always remain indebted to you for this help.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Unfortunately, it looks like you've provided a good deal of other information to someone else in this forum and were expecting the same doctor to continue with your particular question. However, I have no information on what medication you're talking about or the actual condition being treated. Medications that come in 500 mg and are given twice daily are many but perhaps you're talking about Keppra? And maybe you're referring to a seizure disorder diagnosed in your father? Side effects of what we call AED's (antiepileptic drugs) range from mild to severe and definitely can involve cognition (that is memory, thought processing, etc.). There would be no known dietary regimen to prevent side effects of the medication that is specific to the drug at hand due to its chemical properties and how your father's metabolism chooses to react to it. No amount of dietary supplementation or improvement will alter those effects (at least none that have ever been studied or published. Interesting thought though to be sure).Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Dariush Saghafi"},{"Patient":"Hello docter , my name is sid and I am 16.

That casuse rapid decrease of blood pressure that afects you brain and you faint and lay down. Propably you hited the head on the floor and that is why you have head ache.To avoid this problem you should not raise or stand immediatly but first stay in sitting position for few minutes until your body adapts with this position and then you can stand.Also you should drink a lot of water or liquids during the day so your blood pressure increases.

I am a 35-year-old female. I started noticing that my feet tingle and go numb when I sit down about 4 months ago. It began with my long daily commute to work and now extended to sitting down on any surface. I can't cross my legs comfortably.In my day job I often have to hunch over patients and occasionally help lift them. I am also an advanced ballet dancer who goes to the gym and take kickboxing. I think the tingling started around the same time I began kickboxing. I do have long-standing knee and ankle injuries that have been hurting quite badly in the past month or so. I have stopped the boxing classes and go easy in the gym. X-rays of cervical spine and MRI of lumbar spine showed everything is fine.So why do the tingling and numbness persist?

There is a mild amount of mucosal thickening in the posterior left ethmoid air cells.

It does not indicate any medical disorder. 2- The underdeveloped mastoid air cells, is another normal variation of the bone spaces. It does not indicate any medical disorder. 3- The mild amount of mucosal thickening in the posterior left ethmoid air cells could indicate possible chronic sinus infection. I recommend only taking some nasal drops for his sinuses. A sinus discharge bacterial culture may be needed. An allergic sinus reaction can not be excluded either.

Is there any one diagnosis that you can possible think of that I can mention to my dr. just to see if they will look into it further. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!Considering all your symptoms, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to adrenal gland dysfunction coupled with thyroid dysfunction. The TIA are related to atrial fibrillation. That is why it is necessary taking anticoagulation therapy, as you are at high risk for stroke, considering the repeated TIA. From the other hand it is necessary checking your thyroid hormone levels and also cortisol and aldosterone plasma levels to examine your adrenal gland function. It is necessary to regulate these hormone balances in order to have relief of your symptoms. The seizures could be related to thyroid dysfunction and hypoglicemia. It is necessary checking your insulin levels for insulinoma. A possible diagnosis which is associated to multiple gland dysfunction is Pituitary gland dysfunction. I recommend performing a brain MRI for this reason. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Take care, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"Hello, my name is Jocelyn and i am 17 years-old.

I went to the doctor today but she had no explanation and recommended an MRI- any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Your symptoms could be related to a TIA (transient ischemic attack). For this reason, I agree with your doctor on recommending to perform a brain MRI. Other tests to consider would be : a Doppler ultrasound of the cervical arteries to examine the blood flow to the brain, a Holter ECG monitoring for possible arrhythmia, blood lipid profile, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests and blood electrolytes.

Other tests to consider would be: complete blood count for anemia, thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction, blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance, calcium plasma levels and vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency.

You should know that in this region nerves lie under the skin and the soreness is related to the nerve inflammation too. it may take some weeks for the sensibility of this region to recover like before.

Considering the fact that you have had a head trauma a few months ago, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful physical exam and a brain EEG. A brain MRI is necessary to investigate for any possible brain lesions, which can lead to seizures. Some blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, ESR, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose, thyroid hormone levels) are necessary to exclude other possible causes that may trigger seizures. Then you should discuss with your doctor on the possible need of antiepileptic drugs. But the decision in such case after a single seizure should be taken after a comprehensive review of the above test results.

Brain atrophy on a scan may suggest that a patient is having cognitive deficit or dementia.When you say that \\"the  neurologist  has determined that the disease has progressed at a rapid pace\\"  you probably mean that the neurologist has diagnosed your mother with dementia and is referring to dementia as progressing rapidly.Dementia does not end up in coma, but in \\"end stage dementia\\" - worst case which you are asking about - patients brains deteriorate so badly that patients do loose all  contact with the outside world and their condition may be compared to patients in a real coma.I hope you find my answer helpful.

Could you please explain what canal compromise and myelomalacia are please im 24 years of age and dont understand the terms when i have read from websites thanks","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,The bones of the spine  -  which are called vertebrae and their processes create a spinal canal - which is like a tube going down from the lower part of the head all the way down to the back of the pelvis. Inside of the spinal canal there runs a spinal cord which is a structure made of nervous tissue.A disc is a small structure between your vertebral bodies - like a cushion.Sometimes a disc can slip out of its usual place - due to injury or for other reasons. This is also called disc herniation or disc protrusion. A  herniated disc  presses on the spinal cord inside of the spinal canal. Because the size of the canal is now smaller due to the protruding disc inside the spinal canal - this is what is called the \\"canal compromise\\" . Myelomalacia means that your spinal cord - the nervous tissue is damaged - the location of the damage at c4/5 means that it is in your cervical spine at the level between 4th and 5th cervical vertebrea - which is your neck area. You probably saw the neurosurgeon because you were having some symptoms in your arms like tingling /numbness or even weakness - perhaps dropping objects from your hands.Myelomalacia is a serious medical condition and you should contact your surgeon as soon as possible.Hope I answered your question.Regards and best of health."},{"Patient":"Hi. I have a colloid cyst and am typically symptom-free. Lately I have been experiencing increased vertigo, as well as extreme tiredness - like wanting to fall asleep while driving, and while working. Is this possibly related to the cyst? At first diagnosis it was 7mm. First follow-up it grew 17% and showed signs of hemorrhaging. Still, I was symptom-free at that time. Second follow-up it had shrunk to 6mm. My next MRI is supposed to be in April. It is ok to wait, or should I call and move it up to get it checked out sooner?","Doctor":"The most common symptom that would be related to a colloid cyst that would be of clinical urgency would be severe headaches that start and stop upon postural changes (lying to standing and vice versa).  INCREASING vertigo in the absence of headache for a colloid cyst (especially one that is smaller than before) would be improbable.  Fatigue not known to be a symptom of this type of cyst.  If I were your neurologist I would recommend limiting the number of MRI's UNLESS there were more hard core signs of abnormalities or neurological compromise than what you're describing. Studies are pretty convincing that increased numbers of MRI's in a short period of time can lead to DNA breakage and other issues and these can cause more comorbidity in the long run than watching a colloid cyst shrink in the absence of clinically relevant symptoms.

I am skinny fat, 5 71/2 and 125 lbs. I have been suffering from this condition for the past 5-6 years. I have seen a doctor over this issue a few years back but nothing came out of it. He did all sorts of tests, no stomach or intestinal ulcer, no gas trouble, no appendicitis, no stomach or intestinal worm, no hepatitis or lacerations within stomach or intestines, no presence of helicobacter pylori . He did a barium test. Stool test and blood test came clean. At the end he gave me some medication related to stress (I think, based on the info on the leaflet found within the drug case) which i discarded as I found it amusing that he would treat me for stress when I was having trouble with my abdomen and stopped seeing him. Also ECG results came -ve. The dull pain doesn t affect me during daily life. Only when i press my belly i feel it. When I eat, after some time I feel my belly to be throbbing as if my heart is in my belly. I did my own research online and found my condition closest to Chronic functional abdominal pain. I don t suffer from bouts of diarrhea or vomiting or pass blood in stool. I don t feel any pain during bowel movement and I have one every day. I went without gluten once for a few months, it felt slightly better but the dull pain didn t end, i.e it has no effect whether I have gluten in my diet or not, i get the same throbbing sensation some time after I eat. Looking forward to your diagnosis","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM! I understand your concern. Your symptoms seem to be related to irritable bowel syndrome , which is a common intestinal condition characterized by abdominal pain and cramps; changes in bowel movements (diarrhea, constipation, or both); gassiness; bloating; nausea; and other symptoms. It is known that stress can worsen the situation. So the doctor who wanted to treat you for stress has not been wrong. This is not a life threatening condition. All the tests result normal, like in your situation. Much about the condition remains unknown or poorly understood; however, dietary changes( more fibers and avoid caffeine and spicy food), drugs ( like buscopan, antispastics) , and psychological treatment are often able to eliminate or substantially reduce its symptoms.Hope to have been helpful!Greetings!

As per your history, your father had right side ischemic stroke (blood clot blocking artery and damaging brain). It is true that the dead area of brain will never recover. But artery blockade causes some area of brain permanently damaged (dead) and some area temporarily damaged (edema of surrounding brain). This temporarily damaged area of brain (edema) recovers with time.Thus your father will improve with time. Another good thing about brain is the functions of dead brain area will be taken care by normal brain (It is known as brain plasticity). To enhance plasticity, your father requires- Good physiotherapy and occupational therapy- Family support and motivation- cerebroprotective drugs can be taken like citicoline/edavarone/cerebroprotein hydrolysate after proper prescription.- Give him good nutrition rich in protein, vitamin like paneer/milk/green vegetables/fruits/pulses/curd- Neuron specific vitamin supplements like B12, thiamine, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid will also fasten recovery.So do not be hopeless. Just wait and watch. The maximum recovery from ischemic stroke occurs in first 12 months. After this there is some recovery till 18 months and then it stops.Hope it will help.

It only happens occasionally and only after orgasm. It feels like a knife was shoved in the back of my neck. The pain lasts about 10 to 15 minutes..... It is really intense pain.","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for using HCM.I have read your question and understand your concerns.Sex headaches in most cases are nothing to worry about, but in rare cases, they may be associated with underlying conditions such subarachnoidal hemorrhage, dissection of arteries, arteriovenous malformations, etc. especially if they happen suddenly.So, before to be sure that there is nothing wrong with these headaches, getting evaluated by a Neurologist and by imaging studies (MRI) is necessary.Hope you found the answer helpful.Kind regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, I ve had a CT scan done yesterday because I ve been feeling very ill. I ve have had non stop nausea and leg/arm shaking, and when I breathe my chest is shaky. I feel weak all the time, and when I go to bed I begin to shake violently and it feels like a seizure. I have had blood work and it came back fine, and no calls from my CT scan yet. I ve also been feeling very un-balanced and dizzy, and can barely stand. I go to school and feel sick all day. I m 17years old, and I have bad heartburn and anxiety. I try not to worry over the symptoms. Just another thing, my ears have been feeling pressured as well as my eyes... And I get very strange head rushes, it feels like waves in my head. I m really scared, I have no clue what this is! Help please!","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Regarding of your worry about seizures I do not think that is the case, there is no indication in your description about seizures at all. Even those shaking episodes do not constitute seizures because such convulsions would be accompanied with loss of consciousness.The most probable cause judging by the combination of those symptoms which involve many different systems, not anatomically related to each other, would be anxiety.Some blood tests for infections as well as thyroid function should be done though.I remain at your disposal for other questions."},{"Patient":"i hit my head about a 3 weeks ago, quite hard on a glass shower door, on my forehead above my eye, i did not knock my self out but went to the hospital a week later and was diagnosed with concussion still.  I now have a dent there and still feel like i have concussion.","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.It is unclear though what do you mean by feeling to have a concussion, what symptoms do you have to make you think that. The presence of the dent is not indicative of concussion, it is an external manifestation, doesn't provide any information on what is happening inside the brain.Speaking in general it is possible for concussion symptoms like headache, fatigue, lack of concentration, sleeping difficulties etc to last for several weeks even months. To say whether that is your case though as I said you should provide more information.I remain at your disposal for other questions."},{"Patient":"I have Hashimoto Encephalopathy of the brain and I am on 120 mg of prednisone each Sunday (which is push therapy.) but the nuerologist is thinking of redusing the prednisone and adding azathriprone . I was just wondering with the AZA drug would you be able to tan. I love the sun and live in Arkansas and was just wondering. I also have a colostomy bag (4 years now) permanent and also MS and also take phenebarbitol for a seizure disorder but have not had one in over 20 years. The nuero I have had heard on HE but had never met anyone that had it until he met me so does not know a lot about it so we are doing trial and error and we have a facebook page and he has me print things off when I see him every three months. I know that the prednisone is not good for me so was just thinking of something else to tell him. It will be 2 years this Sept since I have been on prednisone every week.","Doctor":"Hello, i read carefully your question.Hashimoto encephalopathy is an autoimmune disease which is associated with thyroiditis. Patients with this condition respond most of the times very well to the corthycosteroid therapy, and that's why the condition is also known as steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis. In the cases that the steroid therapy isn't successful, immunosuppressors are used like azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide or even plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulines. When taking azathioprine, like any other immunosuppressor , one must be very careful about the skin, because the risk of suffering from skin cancer is greater during this kind of treatmet. You have to use very high sunprotection (over 30 uv factors), avoid sunbathing especially the midday hours (11am-3pm). Also, even if you re getting good care of your skin you have to control frequently, every week) if there are chenges in your ski, and you have to report any skin lesion or new scars to your doctor and the dermatologist. I hope i've been of help. You can contact me again for further questions, i would be pleased to assist you."},{"Patient":"Hey. Myself and my children have thalassemia. One of my daughter s hemoglobin count remains around 93 this is normal for us. I had to have 10 units of blood during each of my pregnancies. This is something my daughter expects when she gets pregnant. This is were my questions comes. She is very serious about a man. This man s mother and sister has scoliosis. He seems fine BUT, can he be tested for this? If he doesn t have it can his child? And, are there addition dangers for them to have children together?","Doctor":"Scoliosis is believed to be caused by a combination between GENETIC as well as ENVIRONMENTAL factors including medical conditions that may trigger or favor the development of the disease such as cerebral palsy, Marfan's Syndrome, chronic muscle spasms of a severe nature that do not respond to treatment, and certain tumors such as neurofibromatosis.  There are no genetic biomarkers available yet or approved by the FDA for testing individuals with or without clinical evidence of scoliosis.  There is a genetic test currently being looked at but not approved for adolescents diagnosed WITH scoliosis in order to predict future progression of curvature....but nothing for people who are not clinically diagnosed to predict the probability of offspring having the problem.Since I stated above that scoliosis is believed to be a COMBINATION of genetic predispositions and environmental factors there is no verifiable or certain way to predict the outcome of having children even if families where scoliosis is known to exist since there are many examples of children born to parents (both of whom have scoliosis) and who never develop the disease.My recommendation is if there are significant concerns of your daughter on this topic that she should seek out a genetics counselor or geneticist for more directed guidance.Feel free to send more questions to: www.bit.ly/drdariushsaghafi and I would also appreciate your 5 STAR rating of our interaction."},{"Patient":"my husband has a probable diagnosice of cjd diease lumbar protein levels were 14-3-3 losing nerve function in legs and arms also has lesions on brain vision problems cant work tremors and start of dementia the neurolisgts gave us 2 years he says there is no 100% daigosis till death we are ar a loss what should we do I am already paying different drs for test and daignious I don t think I want to pay online again too sorry","Doctor":"If you are dealing with a neurologist who knows well how to use the 14-3-3 test then, the likelihood of an incorrect diagnosis is small.  The 14-3-3 is best applied when the PRETEST probability of having CJD is HIGH..in other words, just on clinical history and physical examination the neurologist believes that CJD is high on the list of possibilities.  Assuming the clinical diagnosis is highly likely to be CJD, the neurologist will likely pursue other testing measures such as an EEG and MRI of the brain with FLAIR and DWI sequences (more sensitive and specific in most patients than the 14-3-3 assay).  The neurologist will also work very hard to rule out all possibilities of any other type of infectious or demyelinating illnesses (including inborn errors of iron/copper/zinc metabolism) as well as reversible or treatable forms of dementia in categories such thyroid encephalopathy and B12 deficiency.  Under these circumstances then, the clinician will have done everything possible to find every other diagnosis.  Therefore, if this type of comprehensive investigation does not yield any positive results then, what you are left with is the original presumptive differential which should be then, diagnosis of the most likely clinical diagnosis.  This could be verified upon autopsy but in my experience it is rarely if ever the case that families will ask for that kind of confirmation if the workup as I've described has been carried out.  In other words, the diagnosis is as certain as it can be under these conditions.   If, however, this type of workup has NOT been pursued then, there is still more to do in my opinion to solidify the final thoughts and judgments of what your husband may or may not have.Just as an aside- I understand the implications and use of the 14-3-3 CSF assay in quite a bit of detail since it was originally developed and tested at my training institution during the time I was a neurology resident.  The doctor who headed up the initial discovery of the protein and its subsequent approval for CJD screening by the FDA was Head of the Neuropathology Division at that time.  Trust me when I tell you that we were intensely trained on when and how to use this test as well as its interpretation as well as when NOT to use it and when NOT to put very much stock into the results.

You should have a MRI and an EEG if not done already.As for Levetiracetam, as all medications it can have some side effects. Side effects are similar whether you have epilepsy or not. Among the antiseizure medication it is one of the safest ones which has made it one of the most popular in the last years.

The weakness after C5-6 corpectomy in postoperative period could be due to - Postoperative hypotension and ischemic damage. If there was significant blood loss and hypotension in postoperative period, it can cause ischemic damage to spinal cord. It can be confirmed by seeing the records of BP monitoring and MRI of cervico-dorsal Spinal cord.- Low hemoglobin is another cause of weakness. If there is significant fall in hemoglobin level (Hb level lesser than 8gm%), it can cause hypoxic damage to spinal cord. Postoperative hemoglobin level helps in determining the cause. There are chances of good recovery if blood transfusion is done on urgent basis.- Postoperative hematoma or compression from bony pieces/Instruments - It is another cause. Delayed bleeding or broken bone pieces/Instruments compressing over spinal cord can cause postoperative weakness. MRI cervico-dorsal spinal cord will help in finding the cause. Immediate decompression can help in regaining the functions. - Anesthetic drug side effect - Sometimes toxicity to aesthetic drugs can cause damage to nerves or spinal cord. It can be confirmed by nerve conduction velocity/nerve biopsy if there is confusion. You need to discuss all the possibilities with your spine surgeon. MRI cervico-dorsal spine is must investigation to confirm the cause. You can also send me the reports. I can help you further after seeing your MRI report.Hope it will help you. Thanks. Take care.Dr Ishu Bishnoi"},{"Patient":"Hello, i am having these symptoms for about 2months like: stabbing pain in arms and legs.....nause....tingling......fatigue...headache.....vision problems and sometimes diarrhea. i had an MRI and it showed a 6mm lesion on my occipital lobe. my questions are: What is the severity of this lesion?

I was also hospitalized because of a nervous breakdown for over a month. I don t want to self diagnose, but I checked the Mayo clinic for what the symptons were for parkinsons and I was shocked at how many of my symptoms were listed. In 2012 I was in a tramatic automobile accident with a semi truck and trailer and that is when I noticed differences and changes in my body. I was diagnosed with having PTSD. So I thought the PTSD has been causing my problems. But now I m not sure! Is Parkinsons non-curable? I do have a doctors GP appointment, but they couldn t get me in for a whole month because I am a new patient. Should I be trying to get into a neurologist instead? I don t want to waste time waiting only to be referred to a specialist. What should I do? Thank you, Nancy","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!I read carefully your question and understand your concern. You should know that your symptoms are not typical of Parkinson's Disease. Depression or PTSD could explain your symptoms. Anyway, it is true that a careful physical exam from a neurologist would help exclude other possible disorders like Parkinson or any brain injury. A brain MRI would also be necessary considering the fact that you have gone through a head trauma. For this reason, I agree with you on the fact that consulting with a neurologist would help exclude other possible causes of your symptoms.

For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your GP and performing some tests: - a nerve conduction study to exclude polineuropathy- complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation. Further tests may be needed to establish the right diagnosis and treatment options. Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"I am currently recovering from the flu.

Although it is not typical of occipital neuralgia that the pain is triggered by standing up position. Intracranial Hypotension could cause such symptomatology. Anyway, I would recommend having some rest and taking plenty of fluids in the next days. A close monitoring of your blood pressure is also necessary to exclude low blood pressure.

You should know that the cold and heat spells could be related to a thyroid dysfunction. The dizzy spells could be related to a thyroid dysfunction as well as to an inner ear disorder. While the bumps on her skin could be caused by a hormonal imbalance, as well as to an infection. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with her doctor and performing some tests: - complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- PCR, ESR for inflammation- an abdominal ultrasound to exclude ovarian cysts.

Correcting your posture is the best way to stop the progression of this disorder. You should avoid weight lifting and straining physical activity. A cervical collar can help for the pain time after time. But, as this condition is progressive and can cause gait difficulty and pain in the future, it is necessary to periodically follow up with cervical MRI and consult with your neurologist or spinal surgeon.

Is this something I should be overly concerned about ?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!In my opinion the rash on her hand is not related to the head concussion. It may be indicative of a subcutaneous hematoma, probably related to a trauma in this region. If she has pain in her hand, a hand X ray study may be necessary. But, I do not think there is any need to go to the ER now. I would just advise some rest and avoid any head trauma in the next weeks.

From the other hand kidney dysfunction coupled with pneumonia could mimic her troubles. The memory troubles could be relate to a temporary dysfunction of her brain due to her clinical situation (pneumonia and low oxygen saturation, kidney failure). For this reason, I recommend bringing her to the ER for an advanced treatment of all her problems. Dialysis may be necessary for her kidney function.

But their effects are slow and are more noticeable after the first month of starting them. 1mg of Xanax is a normal dose for anxiety. It acts with a high speed. Anyway, the decision of starting antidepressant may be a little difficult especially in young patients, because of their adverse effects. That is why your doctor has decided to try psychotherapy first. I agree with his decision. I would just recommend you to take some deep breaths and practice meditation. It can help you to calm down. Another option is physical therapy (aerobics, Yoga and recreational sports). Physical activity can cause similar brain changes like antidepressants.

If the nerve conduction study results normal, the next step to follow would be a brain MRI to exclude brain small vessel disease, which is another common complication of uncontrolled diabetes.

All these drugs are usually not recommended for a long time because of possible addiction and tolerance. I agree with you that this drug is not so addictive like other drugs, but it can lead to a low grade of addiction. That is why they have adviced you to stop the drug.

Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. I understand your concern. As you are experiencing new symptoms, you should see a rheumatologist. He has to do a physical exam to you, in way to detect the cause of your pains. Your doctor might ask you to bend in different directions to test the range of motion in your spine. He or she might try to reproduce your pain by pressing on specific portions of your pelvis or by moving your legs into a particular position. Also, your doctor might ask you to take a deep breath to see if you have difficulty expanding your chest.You should have a X-ray to check for changes in your joints and bones, also.An MRI may be necessary to provide more-detailed images of bones and soft tissues.Meanwhile you should take in consideration that the main treatment of Ankilosis Spondylitis remains the fisical activity. It would be better to begin the exercises after a shower with warm water which will help you with the stiffness. Swimming, volleyball, etc are the main activities which help decreasing the pain level and conserving the normal posture of your body. Is recommended to stay overthrown for 15-20 minutes for several times a day. If the symptoms does not improve with the fisical activity and the antiinflammatory drugs (CO-DICLO-MISO 75MG), then you have to see a reumatologist for more specific treatment.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

If all these tests result normal, I would recommend consulting with a psychiatrist or psychotherapist, who can help improve your situation.

When speaking to the dr afterwards he told me that the bones had rubbed together causing shards hogged into my spinal cord and he was unable to get them all. He fused c4 c5.

There is now a bump on my lower spine that hurts a little when I'm exercising. I've had it x-rayed and the doctors say there is nothing wrong, but the bump wasn't there before the accident.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would like to explain that the bump is related to soft tissue injury (muscles, ligaments and subcutaneous tissue), caused by the trauma you have had. But, as long as your spine X Ray study has resulted normal and you have no numbness in the lower limbs or difficulty with walking, there is nothing to worry about. You should just be patients, because it will take some time for the bump to resolve spontaneously.

Around the area of the inguinal canal / appendixHappens for about 3 hours every day but with no obvious trigger.Pain goes into the tubes running into the testicles as well.The pain is not sharp and agonising but dull, aching, dragging / heavy.Often rises slightly higher into the abdomen.Has been accompanied with nausea after eating (episodic), fatigue, and once I woke up in the night and the lower right quadrant pain had become a sharp throbbing more painful episode.  This went in about 15 minutes.The pain goes into my lower back and down my thigh (again dragging, heavy), and into my right testicle / scrotum.My bloods are fine, I have had an abdomen ultrasound on liver, kidneys etc and they are all fine and I am going to have a soft tissue hernia scan.I don't have an STI, but the Sexual Health clinic treated me for epididimitis and put me on a two week antibiotic course.  This has actually helped a fair bit, especially the pain into and above the right testicle, but not completely and the symptoms are definitely still there (esp lower right quadrant episodic pain and nausea after eating ).  It doesn't hurt to cough and there is no visible hernia bump.  Also it often hurts while resting / lying down.I have bilateral plantar fasciitis and am trying to get rid of this problem, so I can continue with my rehabilitation.Also I have had a great deal of anxiety and stress recently, due to my own foot condition and my family problems.Any ideas?!What confuses me is the hospital said it could be epididimitis, but my GP said it doesn't fit in with the symptoms (there is no obvious swelling, and it is episodic and not agonising). My urine and stool tests have been normal. Many thanks.","Doctor":"Thanks for an elucidate and understanding history.The pain you described , its radiation all suggest me that you may be suffering from more than 1 problem simultaneously. This is definitely a pain of nerve origin , wherein the nerve supplying this area is either entrapped or involved into an inflammatory process. We have to scan from the spinal level by MRI of the thoraco-lumbar region the back of abdomen , the iliac area by clinical examination as you have rightly  mentioned for hernia scan and ultrasonography or CT scan of abdomen to see for the psoas muscle problem, appendicitis in the course of the nerves. Once a proper diagnosis is make , a proper treatment is an easy thing to do.As for the planter fascitis, the best way is to have hot fomentation with super-saturated salt solution ( the feet are dipped into a tub with warm salt water.)"},{"Patient":"I have been smelling an offensive smell in my nose for a few months now intermittently and had a numbness at the base of my back, now a strong pain in my right buttock.  Could the 2 be connected?  I'm always tired and just put it down to the change in weather, always being cold and dark","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms (intermittent bed smell)are really complex and could be related to different causes like an infection of the upper airways, epilepsy or a tumor of the base of the scull. Anyway, it is less likely that the bad smell and low back numbness are connected to each other. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your doctor for a careful physical examination and performing some tests to investigate for the possible causes: - a sinus X Ray study for sinusitis- a lumbar spine X ray study- complete blood count, ESR, PCR for inflammation or infection. A brain CT scan may be needed to exclude a tumor of the base of the scull, which may lead to your symptoms. An EEG is also needed to exclude seizures.

It regulated the balance of many hormones. Your symptoms could be related to a hormonal imbalance. That is why I would recommend consulting with an endocrinologist and performing some hormone levels (TSH, LH, GH, GnRH, TRH, FSH, ACTH, cortisol, etc.). A new MRI would be needed to evaluate the possible progression of the tumor.

If you're not having ANY SYMPTOMS whatever that or new or progressing then, the findings of the MRI are taken as incidental findings and need not be acted on.  40% of individuals who have NO SYMPTOMS of back pain, leg pain, or other problems usually attributed to disk herniations, compressions of the thecal sac, etc. can have MRI's that show all these things.

An Endocrinologist,  a neurologist or some other specialty?","Doctor":"Your seizure disorder, non-epileptic or epileptic can be very well managed by a neurologist or an epileptologist which is a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy.  Your autoimmune pathologies would likely be co-managed by a neurologist for the encephalitic part of the problem along with the appropriate specialist for the primary body part which then, resulted in the encephalitis (e.g. Hashimoto's= ENDOCRINOLOGY), etc.  Hope that clarifies.  Please rate with 5 stars on exit and write me at: www.bit.ly/drdariushsaghafi for more questions.P.S. If you have documented ENCEPHALITIS how did you come by the DEFINITE diagnosis of NON-EPILEPTIC event disorder?  Encephalitis is a very strong risk factor for epileptic discharges to develop AND it is not uncommon for people diagnosed with NON-epileptic disorders to have a mixed picture meaning that both epileptic and non-epileptic events can occur at different times.

This disorder is not usually associated to loss of conscience. From the other hand some epilepsy seizures are associated to dizziness before the seizure.

But as EEG has resulted normal, seizures are less likely. I would like to know more about these episodes: -Do you feel them coming? Are there any specific signs so you can predict them?- Do you remember how they occur?- Do you fall abruptly or try to hold on something to protect yourself from falling?- Do you regain conscience immediately or you feel dizzy and foggy for some hours later, after these episodes?All these characteristics can help differentiate between a seizure and a syncope.

Do they not realize that by blocking the seratonin and dopamine receptors, which are natural anticonvulsants, and increasing an amino acid which will induce seizure activity-and that is precisely what psychotropic drugs do, the potential harm that they may be causing the patient?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that often there is commorbidity between epilepsy and pseudoseizures, because epilepsy patients tend to have psychiatric troubles (like depression or anxiety too). From the other hand the presence of abnormal EEG activity may be both in pseudoseizures and seizures. And sometimes epilepsy patients have a normal EEG. That is why the seizure description and even video registration of the patients during the seizures is necessary to distinguish between seizures and pseudoseizures. Anyway, it is true that antidepressants and anti-psychotics lower the seizures threshold, but when psychiatric problems are present in epileptic patients, they are given concomitantly with anti-epilepsy drugs, in order to improve the situation.

But sometimes chronic back pain is persistent despite surgery and physiotherapy. That is why I would recommend starting low doses of amytriptiline or gabapentine for the pain. These drugs can help against chronic back and nerve pain. They should be taken for at least 3-6 months, in order to have the desired effects.

I am a man in my early 60s. I have an odd question.I have been diagnosed with a moderate case of carpal tunnel, which is fairly well controlled by wrist braces. Unfortunately the symptoms appear when masturbating. Actually the symptoms first appeared lightly while masturbating starting several years ago, and as time went on became worse. At the time, I did not realize that the cause was carpal tunnel.My questions are:1. Could masturbation have caused the carpal tunnel either by itself or in combination with other risks such as moderate keyboard use? I do it about once a day for 15 - 45 minutes, and have been doing so since the age of 15, even though I've rarely been single.2.

And all is clear","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms seem to be caused by possible neuropathy or a metabolic disorder (electrolyte imbalance, thyroid hormone imbalance, etc.).. A cervical intervertebral disc bulging, causing compression of the nerve roots, can not be excluded either. That is why I would recommend consulting with your GP for a physical exam and some tests: - a cervical spine MRI study- a nerve conduction study- blood electrolytes - thyroid hormone levels- vitamin B12 level. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues.Hope to have been helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"I am a 59 year old male with multiple lumbar disc issue including severe bilateral foraminal narrowing at L5-S1. I am under the care of a spine specialist and have done several epidurals which have not worked as expected. I am currently on multiple drugs. I may need to go on around the clock pain medication. Is there any advantage of one over the other such as oxycontin versus fentanyl?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your question, I would explain that both these drugs belong to the same pharmacological class (opioids)and this is why they have the same adverse effects. There is not too much difference between them. But, I would recommend trying gabapentine or pregabaline in stead of these drugs. These anti-epileptic drugs can be really helpful in chronic back pain. An antidepressant can also be helpful in the management of chronic back pain. All these drugs do not cause addiction and tolerance like opioids. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"Is it typical to suffer from these symptoms since I am diagnosed with early stage Alzheimers? I am a 74 year old caucasian woman and was diagnosed in 2011.

I need to quickly sit and put my head between my knees. It just happened and I had no place to sit so I stood and put my head to my knees. After a minute or two it passes but it is becoming more frequent. I ma on Avalide for blood pressure and I had not yet taken it today. I have experimented with taking it at different times but it does not seem to make a difference. I am a nurse and when it first happened I saw my primary then a cardiologist. He said it may be a vasovagal response but I am getting concerned because it is increasing in frequency.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms seem to be related to orthostatic hypotension or an inner ear disorder. For this reason, I would recommend first measure your blood pressure values in sitting and then after 5 minutes in standing up position. A decrease in your systolic blood pressure more than 20mm Hg, would be indicative or orthostatic hypotension. In such case a Head Up Tilt test would be needed to investigate for this disorder. But, if your blood pressure values are stable, I would recommend consulting with an ENT specialist and performing labyrinthine tests to investigate for an inner ear disorder.

That is why, I would recommend performing a careful physical exam of the region and a CT scan, to exclude the above mentioned possibilities. Inflammation tests (complete blood count, PCR, ESR) are also needed. If an infection is excluded steroids would be another treatment option. I would also recommend performing a lot of physical activity, in order to reinforce the muscles of this region.

I would recommend trying an antiallergic drug. If her symptoms are improved, there is nothing to worry about. It is also important to monitor her body temperature. Fever would indicate an infection and possible need of antibiotics. Hope to have been helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"My husband has had dizziness fir the last 2 days. He was checked out at the hospital about a month ago and was fine. The right vein in his neck is 100% clogged but his cardiologist said it could not be unclogged since it was 100% blocked but the left side was ok and he had plenty of blood flow. Vertigo runs in his family. Our son has McNear s disease and our daughter also suffers from vertigo as well as my husband s mom.I don t remember h is lasting this long. He isn t dizzy when he lies down. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!His symptoms seem to be related to low blood flow or orthostatic intolerance. The fact that his symptoms improve when lying down is a strong argument in favor of the above mentioned causes. Besides, you should know that vertigo is related to the vertebral arteries and the blood flow in them. A low blood flow, caused by narrowing of these arteries, is more probable to cause troubles when it is combined with orthostatic hypotension. This can also explain why his symptoms improve when lying down. Coming to this point, I would recommend a close monitoring of his blood pressure values in sitting and standing up position. It is also important performing some tests: -complete blood count for anemia-Head up Tilt test for orthostatic hypotension -a Doppler ultrasound of the vertebral arteries. An angio CT scan of the cerebral arteries would give more information on the blood flow in the vertebral arteries and also in the collateral circulation, considering his clogged carotid artery (which is asymptomatomatic now).

The most significant and beneficial therapy that helps in regaining motor functions and power is physiotherapy. As of now, there is no other known therapy that will help you regain the functions of the limbs.As to the duration to complete healing, the question cannot be be answered with certainity. As of now, in your case, I need to know the size of the bleed, the extent of the bleed, the amount that is still there in the brain (of blood). These are just some of the factors that will prognosticate the weakness and paresis.The damage of the nerves in the brain that signal the movement of the limbs causes the paresis. The extent of damage cannot be predicted. The other parts of the brain have to take up the functions of the damaged part of the brain. This takes a lot of time and may sometimes be incomplete.So as of now, the only medical advice that can be given is to continue physiotherapy and stay motivated with it.Feel free to contact me with any query you have or any clarification that uou may need on any point.

It would be somewhat difficult to explain this to you. It is a complex basis of anatomy and physiology. But I will try my best to explain it to you. Simply put, imagine that there is a brain which is getting damaged, slowly with age. This may cause memory issues. Then, the brain damage causing memory issues is called dementia. In other words, it is obvious that there is brain damage if the patient has dementia. Furthermore, when the patient develops a seizure, it is like a shock of current that spreads through the brain. This shock, in normal people is stopped by the surrounding normal brain. But when the brain is already damaged, the defenses of the brain are affected as well. This may lead to abnormal behavior- what is often known as delirium. Delirium happens more easily in people with dementia then those without dementia.The speed of the brain damage may vary. Slow causes are like commonly known Alzheimers disease etc. Fast are infective pathologies like meningoencephalitis and CJD etc.I have tried to explain it very simply. The actual neurological grounds are much more complex. This is an oversimplified model so that you can understand what is going on and contribute positively in your mother's illness.Feel free to contact me for clarification on any point that you wish.Best of luck, Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"i was looking up to see what mite be going on with me. my bone s and spine hurt none stop and now i have been haveing falling spell s i have falling 3 times for no reson no worning and in one of my fall s i broke my right foot and i stay sick feeling all the time and now its just getting worse.","Doctor":"Hello,I am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.Unfortunately, there is no simple answer to your query.You need to be examined and evaluated, possibly needing admission for a day or two.This is because there are too many causes for the complaints of falls with or without fainting.Conditions like parkinsonism, parkisonson plus syndrome, seizures, transient ischemic attacks, carotid hypersensitivity, BPPV, etc can all be neurological causes of the fall. There are cardiac causes of fall as well like vasovagal syncope, arrhythmia, orthostatic hypotension and so forth.Besides, weakness of muscles and bones can also cause the problems.Therefore I would either need to know more about the symptoms and would need to examine you before I can suggest a possible diagnosis.

I can feel it if I pinch the area, but it feels very strange. Also, when I move it in a specific way, a sharp and brief sensation of pins and needles goes through my lower arm. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Your symptoms could be related to a pinched nerve in this area. It is a temporary compression of the nerve from the trauma. I recommend holding your arm straight for some days and your symptoms will recover spontaneously. You should just try to be patient. Painkillers (ibuprofen, acetaminophen) could help in the next days. But, there is nothing to worry about!Hope to have been helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"I am having an exacerbation of non-epileptic seizures when taking probiotics including Lactinex and the best multicultural refrigerated strains.

What are the risks and details of surgery and the recovery plan and timing?","Doctor":"Hi there, welcome to HCM, thanks for your question Synovial cyst's are fluid filled soft tissue structure's which are formed due to degeneration in the joints between bones of your back (known as facet joints between L4 and L5.I. e 4 th and 5 th spinal bone in your situation ). These cysts get filled like a balloon filled with water when you stand or walk and get deflated when you rest or lie down due to decompression like a deflated baloon.Since they lie in close proximity to the nerves in your spine, they are associated with pain radiating down the leg, simolar to sciatica pain seen with disc herniation During early stages when the cysts are small,  the pain can respond to steroid injection's which help in reducing the inflammation  associated with compression of the neves.But once the cuses reach a certain size the mechanical compression of nerves become significant  and atop respondin to injections.At this stage surgery is indicated. Surgical options include only decompression  or decompression with fusion with screws.Whether to use screws and fuse or not will depend on assessment for instability  of the bones at the involved  level by X rays/CT scan or MRI.However most commonly most of the synovial  cysts in spine respond cert well to decompression  surgery wit encouraging results.Hope this answers your question.All the best with best regards Dr.SBK"},{"Patient":"Hi there.

Additional tests like blood tests for vitamins,nerve conduction studies for nerves would help in ruling them out. If your symptoms are only one sided, regional causes like pressure on nerve at certain points of your limb need to be ruled out.Narrowing of blood vessels in your limbs can also lead to such symptoms. Any injury in the past can also present with pain and swelling now.In addition,there are certain  medications which can cause similar symptoms as a side effect.I would suggest you to meet your physician for further evaluation and follow up with a neurologist.Since smoking is associated with and can exacerbate all kinds of neuropathy, you should consider quitting it, if you do smoke.Hope this answers  your query Thank you.With best regards.

Regarding the first part of your question. RetroListhesis and disc bulge are radiological terms reported in an MRI which would require correlation with how your doing clinically.Retrolisthesis  describes the relative position of one bone over the other where one of the bones as slipped in relation to the other.Mild retrolisthesis is a normal variant at L5/S1 level and should not be a cause for Concern. Annulus is the outer envelop or covering of disc (which is the cushion between your bones). With degeneration of the disc's some times the material  bulges through its covering which presents as an annulus bulge. When the bulge goes backwards it can impinge on the nerves decreasing the space available for them which can also be termed as stenosis or narrowing of the space available for the nerves. If the bulge is not symmetrical it can affect one side more than the other as seen in your question (left more than right).These information is useful if the pain distribution matches the MRI, that is side of pain matching the side of narrowing seen in MRI. Conservative treatment with the combination of medications, physical therapy,exercises with strengthening of core muscles, spinal injections and life style modification should be tried before surgery is considered.Lifiting heavy weights, bending forwards and twisting movements have been associated with progression of back pain and should be avoided during exacerbations.  However, surgery will be absolutely Indicated if there is new onset weakness or numbness, loss of urine or motions control related to your spinal ailment.Unrelenting pain affecting your life style would be a relative Indication.Hope this answers your question.

During early part pain can only be restricted to buttock , with time there can be radiation of pain to back of thigh.It may or may not become associated with numbness also.An X ray might show dc reset space between the L5 and S1 bone providing an in direct evidence of disc degeneration.IIf the symptoms persist for longer than 6  weeks or if the pain is unrelenting in spite of medications  and physiotherapy and MRI might be indicated which has is more Conclusive. Spinal related pain can be one sidedo as in your case  or it might affect both sides.Non spinal buttock related pain is  usually one sided. Ischial bursitis which is inflammation of the covering of one of the muscles/ischial Bone on which we usually sit, can cause focal pain over the point of the buttock. Inflammation around the sciatic nerve in the buttook can also cause similar pain. Inflammation of the sacroiliac joint what is is a joint between the pelvic and the spinal bones can also result in similar pain.If your pain as been there for more than 6 weeks it would be worthwhile to get radiological and blood tests done to rule out the above Conditions. I would suggest you to meet your physician and get evaluated so that these Conditions can be ruled out. In the mean time physiotherapy,strechtes,anti inflammatory and analgesic mediations can help you tied over the pain.

The MRI report read as follows: “There is a 6 x 4mm lesion posteriorly in the anterior pituitary just anterior the posterior pituitary bright spot. This lesion is hyperintense on the T2 weighted sequences and hypointense on the T2/FLAIR and SWI sequences consistent with subacute haemorrhage. It does not demonstrate any enhancement. The findings are most consistent with an adenoma with associated intralesional haemorrhage. Findings are not typical for Rathke’s cleft cyst The remainder of the pituitary has a normal appearance with normal enhancement of the pituitary stork and remaining pituitary tissue. The posterior pituitary bright spot is preserved. There is no gross expansion of the sella and no soft tissue extends above the sella into the suprasellar cistern. The optic chiasm has a normal appearance with no evidence of compression and there is no displacement of the pituitary stalk. The adjacent carotid arteries and cavernous sinus have a normal appearance. No other intracranial mass is demonstrated. The ventricles, sulci and cisternal spaces are normal for age and there is normal grey-white matter differentiation. There are several foci of subcortical white matter FLAIR hyperentensity particularly in the frontal lobes which are slightly more numerous than expected for age. These may be an incidental finding but may also be seen in vasculopathies including migrainous vasculopathy. The differential includes chronic microvessal ischaemic change greater than excpected for age. The findings are not typical for demyelination. The posterior fossa structures and craniocervical junction are unremarkable. There is minor mucosal thickening of the anterior ethmoid air cells but the remainder fo the paranasal sinuses are normally pneumatised. My GP has referred me to a neurologist, but the neurologist is currently away and unable to see me for 2 weeks. The neurologist’s receptionist called me and told me not to worry in the meantime, but to go to the hospital if I experience headaches. Meanwhile, I am anxious about the reference to haemorrhage in the MRI report and whether it could be continuing and whether it could possibly be pituitary apoplexy. I don’t have a headache but I do have a feeling of pressure. I would be very grateful if you could take a look at the report (I also have the scans on disk if you need to see those) and tell me: 1.     Whether I might have pituitary apoplexy 2.     Whether it is ok to wait 2 weeks to see the neurologist 3.     What other kinds of tests might help with diagnosis.

Just an attitude as to how pain management is being, or should I say not being done. Because of a handful of people who CHOOSE TO Abuse drugs, who really gets punished? Spinal Stenosis and 2 back surgeries, the last the titanium rods, plates, and screws were inserted from L2 thru L5. Stopped the pain for about 2 years, or at least at a tolerable level. Then Lortabs helped. Sent to pain clinic for epidurals. Epidurals on me were extremely painful. Scale of 1-10 they were a 20. (Not Kidding) Quality of life was going fast. couldn t do or go because the pain had grown to the point that I couldn t eat or sleep. Pain was 24 hours a day. Told by the pain Dr. to stay on the Lortab and come to the pain clinic every 4 or 5 weeks for epidurals. Epidurals were not only painful but I got very little relief if any from them. Finally PCP started me on oxycontin and Fentynal patch. I was much better for awile. I was taught that in so called pain management you would gradually increase dose until you knew the patient was experiencing some quality of life. I reached rock bottom after telling PCP my quality of life was slipping away. Finally I asked for an increase in pain med as pain was now 24 hours a day. I could not function. I was told no, and referred to pain clinic for more epidurals and Narcotics. The day I went in to office for routine followup and new perscriptions I was ask for a urine specimen. After all I d been thru over the last 8 to 10 years, all the operations and all the pain. The loss of any quality of life. I am in my 70 s and lost all those Golden years, 10 of them. Asking for a urine specimen. I felt made ME the criminal. I decided right then I asked to be titrated off the narcotic meds. I will die with all the pain before I will let anyone treat me like a criminal. So you go on breaking your solom oath by hurting patients . Doctors swore to do no harm. A large % of those being hurt and are suffuring are the geriatric population. I feel Obama has been behind a lot of this but you know I believe a lot of the fault falls on every Doctor, Nurse, and everyone working in health care. STAND UP FOR YOUR PATIENTS. yOU ALL ARE JUST LIKE THE POLITICIANS. tO SAVE THEIR OWN HIDES THEY JUST CLOSE THEIR EYES TO WHAT IS HAPPINING TO MEDICINE IN THIS COUNTRY AND SAY NOTHING. tHE PUBLIC CAN T EVEN GET TOGETHER AND STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT. The old time Doctor s predicted It would be like this. They said if the HMO went through it would be the death of our wonderful medical care in this country. Many have passed but they were right on. They realized that there would not be anymore decent medical care. The patient is really obsolete. No more real check ups. no more time to explain your problem. No more real examinations Oh, there is on paper or in the computer so health care workers, even Doctors just make sure they cover their butts, to the point of out right lying!!! Make it look like things were done just to collect the fees. The lawyers are partially to blame also with their ambulance chasing and advertising for frivolous malpractice suits. Rep. and Dems. just sit on their hands. Political correctness has run amuck. I thoroughly loved working in the medical world at one time. Now I want nothing to do with it Extreme pain is killing me literally but I will die with it. Think back of all the pain meds that really did relieve pain. Where are they now. Listed as a narcotic, now even lortab now and it is only hurting those who really need it. The really sick. But their pain med prescription has to be picked up at dr s. office no matter if they can hardly get out of bed. No husband or designated relative or person can pick it up. Can t even be called into the pharmacy anymore. What do they think they are doing. I am done with a medical world that has turned into nothing but a money making machine. Worst of all the money flows to the very few at the top while staffs are cut to the bone. Doctors are told what they can and can t do, how many patients they have to see in a day. no wonder there is no examining going on, No time to get to know their patients. On top of that not enough compensation for what they are trying to do. Trying to do the impossible. The patient is only needed for a name and insurance number. The old days were Heaven when working in the medical field if your heart was in it. Today s medical world is Hell in my eyes after all my personal experiences. A lot of us feel like we are on our own and no matter what doctor you go to we are not being treated, just pushed thru the system as fast as possible. Many, many mistakes are being made. No one, including doctors and nurses seem to know what they are doing. It is not their fault. They are not being properly taught and trained, just shoved thru school and paying exorbitant rates to do it. Something I use to love so very much has become something very ugly and I hate it. I have been on both ends. Suffering terribly and hanging out here on my own but so grateful to God for giving me the privilege of working in the world of medicine during the years before it fell.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HealthCareMagic.com I am Dr.J.Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas.

I have hod more than 50 seizure type episodes and am being told it is simply a side effect of the drug. These are violent and painful and I do not feel I should have been prescribebed them, please advise of any contraindications. Thanks Sharon","Doctor":"Hi,I carefully read your question and would explain that you are actually being treated with a lot of drugs. First, you should know that temazepam and tapentadol belong to the same pharmacological class (benzodiazepines) and the concomitant use is not a good idea, as they both increase sedation and increase liver metabolisation of the other drugs. Topamax is the only anti-epileptic drug that you are taking. Aurorix is an antidrepressant, which can increase the frequency of seizures. Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting with your doctor and discussing on the possibility of stopping temazepam and tapentadol and add another anti-epileptic drug like valproate or carbamazepine to your therapy.

I have had this for about a week. I also feel a little dizzy sometimes.","Doctor":"Hi,I understand your concern regarding the tingling sensation and numbness. Since you have mentioned that you have as numbness in your cheeks, dizziness, it has to be related with nerve compression or due to diabetic neuropathy or lack of nutrients like cobalamine.

Mention him about your present problem. 3) You need to keep an erect straight posture of your back and neck.4) Do stretching exercises, when you wake up lie on your chest then using two hand lift yourself up, in a arc like position and then lie down slowly. repeat his at least ten times daily. this will surely relieve back pain. you can watch online videos for such exercises.5) Take Tablet Neurokind once daily. anlagesics only if you have severe pain.6) If your problem aggravates you need to get yourself physically examined and investigated through radiological methods like X ray followed by MRI only if suggested by an orthopedician.Hope these suggestions help you.

I would recommend to add a tilt-table test, a doppler-sonogram of the cerebral arteries and to check the glucose by fingerstick measurement after a spill occured. there are several questions a doctor can ask to ascertain himself that this can't be a seizure (I guess this was the case), in doubt an MRI and EEG should be performed."},{"Patient":"I recently fractured my L4 vertebrae. I have osteoporosis. I am a 68 yr. old man. I have had other fractures in the spine in the past that have healed. I have been pretty sedentary for about 3 months. My lower leg and foot are really swollen and red (LEFT). Twice the size of the right foot. But it is a little swollen. Is this a symptom from my back injury?","Doctor":"Hello Sir,please see a doctor ASAP. This could be a thrombosis of the leg veins which needs to be treated. It is a common condition after operations/immobilisations and can be treated. However, it can be very dangerous in some cases when the blood clot from your leg veins is dislocated to the lungs. Therefore please do not hesitate and see a doctor now."},{"Patient":"Recently i skid from my bike and sprained my neck along with some minor injuries. The neck sprain was low on that day later it became severe for 2 days. now i only has a small feeling of it. but the real problem is since that day i has this slight Headache (not much just a feeling) at the base of the skull that radiate towards the forehead. What is this phenomenon and is it serious? What should i do?","Doctor":"Hi,I read your question carefully and understand your concern. Headache after a sprain neck needs to be taken seriously, because there is the possibility of a dissected artery (separation of the layers of the artery wall, may lead to a stroke if untreated). See a doctor today, your best bet would be the neurology clinic in a hospital, because you need a CT or MRI scan to visualize your neck arteries. I have seen many patients with similar stories like yours.Please do not hesitate. Hope you will find this answer helpful.

She can feel the touch but not able to move hand.The question is what the point 1 refers to the status of  patient and what are the implications of this attack. Also how fast the recovery we can expect in this case","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and understand your concern.The hypodense area is most likely a stroke. The left corona radiata contains fibers which supply right leg and arm. Most important right now is to do physical therapy and rehab as soon as possible and secondly to find out why your mother head a stroke (holter EKG, cardiac echogram, neck sonogram).Recovery can be full if the infarction area is not too big and if you start physical therapy right away.Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards,Dr. Wu"},{"Patient":"Hi Im lem from province of Philippines, i dont know what kind of seizure i have, since 2008 im taking medicine twice a day valparin xr, and still seizure still remain, however before every seizure , i can acknowledge and determine the occurence, my question is, until when my valparin should be taken.","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and understand your concern.From what i read you take valparin and still have seizures. If that is the case you should see a neurologist who can prescribe a second medication for you. You can consider stopping valparin after being at least 1 year without seizures. As of right now, do not stop to take valparin.Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards,Dr. Wu"},{"Patient":"Hallow Doctor?I have been diagnosed with Bell's Palsy 5days ago and have been taking the steriods but there is no change though am supposed to continue the treatment for another 5 days. Is there any other treatment that I can get apart from the one am getting?","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and understand your concern. The bells palsy is a condition which usually recovers without further ado. Steroids may help to speed up the recovery. There are no alternative meds you can take. What you can do to speed up the recovery is to train your facial muscles as often as possible (found a youtube video for that.The recovery can take several weeks to months. So even in cases of very rapid recovery, one would not expect a change after 5 days. Get well soon!Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards,Dr. Wu"},{"Patient":"Iam Dr..Ashok chatterjee,from India  after sudden Epistaxis (profuse bleeding  ) without any symtoms  with B.P-130/80 get C.T scan of Head it was diagnosed Small lipoma(7mmX4mm) in falx cerebri posteriorly ,mind D.N.S to right with sinusitis.Advice my treatment.Now I am fine no problem .since last 1 month.?treat of  lipoma.

In case the lipoma does not make any symptoms (headache, seizures) nothing has to be done.As it can be hard to diagnose the type of mass on CT, I would recommend doing an MRI to confirm the diagnosis and another one 1 year from now to assess the growth rate (most likely it is not growing at all).Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards,Dr. Wu"},{"Patient":"mother 86-post hosp stay of 3 days 1 CT abd. done--full of stool.

Could this MUA have caused a pinched nerve somewhere?","Doctor":"Hi,I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms could be related to a pinched nerve or a discal herniation in the cervical spine causing radicular pain. It could be related to MUA, but there are also a lot of other causes to consider.

Is that normal? Thank you for being there for us newbie.","Doctor":"Hi,I carefully passed through your question and would explain that your symptoms seem to be related to severe neuropathy. Using a cane will help improve your situation. I would not recommend using a motorized wheelchair, because it would make you avoid physical activity, which is very important for your physical performance and to maintain the function of your limbs. Anyway, I would recommend performing a Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs vessels, to exclude possible peripheral arteriopathy as a possible cause of pain and difficulty walking. Being exhausted in the end of the day could be related to the physical effort that you make every day. But, I would also recommend performing some other tests to investigate for the possible causes: - a resting ECG and a cardiac ultrasound to examine your heart- a chest X ray study and respiratory function tests to examine your lungs- blood work (complete blood count for anemia, blood electrolytes for possible imbalance, kidney and liver function tests, HbA1C).

The normal CT and MRI results are another argument in favor of this diagnosis, coupled with the clinical characteristics of his headache.

The cranium is your brain, the cauda equina is your rear, therefore cranial is from your head, caudal means to your butt! As for lubulated, this just means something that looks like a lobule, or something that has lobes, such as a thyroid gland or a breast.

Nonetheless I believe the injection side effects should subside from 1-2 weeks after injection, thus you should no longer feel these effects. As such you must decide, are the benefits outweighing the side effects. I suggest hydration and diet alteration with less carbohydrates, and more proteins and fats.

He just saw a neurologist today and he said no Parkinson s or anything like that. He is thinking maybe something with the brain from anesthesia during the surgery and wants to do a brain MRI now.

Low iron in blood perhaps? Can you please help me to understand why this happens? thanks","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As per your clinical description it seems that you have peripheral vascular disease of your upper limbs. It is a constrictive disease of the blood vessels due to which blood circulation to the peripheries of the limbs decreases. If I were your treating doctor I would have done some clinical examinations and suggested you some tests as follows- Complete hemogram, fasting and PP blood sugar, lipid profile, doppler ultrasound of the upper limb vessels (eg: subclavian, brachial arteries) and regular monitoring of your blood pressure; to rule out any comorbid conditions like Hypertension, dyslipidemia, Diabetes mellitus, and to diagnose the vessel involved in the disease.With proper clinical evaluation and diagnosis you may need to visit a physician and a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and management. Hence, I would suggest you to visit your doctor with these early symptoms to rule out the disease. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards, Dr. Md Firoz Mullick"},{"Patient":"I had an MRI lumbar spine due to pain that travels from my back to my right side and down my leg.  The results say I have a large hemangioma of the L4 vertebral body. Small dorsal annular tear in the left paracentral region L1-2. And Schmorl's nodes are present at the endplates of T11-12 and T12-L1 and are chronic in appearance.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Your symptoms of back pain and radiation to the right leg is suggestive of radicular pain symptom due to pinched nerve or nerve compression at the exit  of your spinal cord.  This is usually seen on MRI spine and I would expect to see on the right side of the Lumbar area L1-S1 (depending on area of distribution of pain). Hemangioma is a collection of the blood vessel in the vertebral bone. This should not cause any pressure on the nerve roots or spinal cord and thus would not cause the symptoms. Hemangioma in vertebral body is a very common finding and it does not have any clinical significance most of the times. Annular tear could cause pressure on the nerve roots but it is the opposite side of your pain, and thus we can ignore that. Schmorl's nodes are clinically non significant findings as well which does not explain the pain. If you were my patient in clinic, I would order EMG/Nerve consuction study to get a neurophysiological data of nerve root involvement. Usually this pain is treated well with pain medications like gabapentin, pregabalin, amitryptilline or duolexetine. Physical therapy and avoiding movements which brings up the pain symptoms is recommended. This usually subsides in few weeks. Hope I have answered your query. Please do not hesitate if you have any more questions.

It is possible to take something to alleviate anxiety before the test. Muscoril is not the most indicated means for that purpose.

I cannot find the procedure listed above.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that this procedure consists on the injection of a steroid shot in the epidural space. This procedure may cause a temporary relief of back pain, resulting from bulging discs. The procedure itself is quite safe and there is no need to hospitalize. But, the limitation of physical activity is more related to the main problem which is the discal herniation or bulging, than to the injection procedure. It is important avoiding prolonged standing up and sitting position in the next days. Heavy weight lifting should be avoided too. Physiotherapy may be helpful to reduce the back muscles spasm. All there precautions are necessary to avoid exacerbation of the back pain.

She experiences nausea, dizziness, headache, fatigue, fainting and heart palpitations. Recently has tried smoking marijuana to explore its positive effects. She says that it helps the nausea, but is afraid to continue using incase of unforeseen negative effects. Would it be a good idea to continue this or is it risky or even dangerous?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I read carefully your question and would explain that marijuana would not be a good idea in her clinical situation. It is known to exacerbate cardiac arrhythmia, which can be triggered by changes in the body position, during POTS. It has also a lot of adverse effects in the cardio-vascular system. There are a lot of other remedies to nausea (for example metoclopramide, domperidone, etc.), which have not the same adverse effects of marijuana.Hope you will find this answer helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"may i ask what is the best thing to with my cervical spine c'4 c'5? my doctor said put a neck collar support and my spine c'4 and c'5 that there's no more  water coming into my spine c'4 c'5 what should i do?

Some painkillers would be helpful. I would not recommend performing and massage or physical exercise during this period, because it may exacerbate the situation. You should discuss with a neurosurgeon about surgery if the problem persists. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"tension headachesHello -My name is Brittany. I've been experiencing pressure, starting in the back of my head, that makes it difficult for me to sometimes hold my head up. It feels like my ears are clogged and someone is squeezing my head. My primary care doc has said that it could have something to do with my scoliosis and prescribed me muscle relaxers. I worry about this because my mother suffered permanent injury from a TBI from which she had a congenital cyst on her brain. What could be causing these headaches and do you think I should get an MRI?","Doctor":"Hello Brittany!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms seem to be related to tension type headache, which is a benign type of headache caused by anxiety. Cervical spondylarthrosis and a wrong position of the head during the day, a bad billow during sleep, can trigger this type of headache. No one of the above mentioned causes is concerning. So, I would recommend you to perform a lot of physical activity, try to correct your posture and use an orthopedic pillow during the night. If headache does not improve from painkillers, I would recommend performing a brain CT scan or MRI to exclude other possible causes that may trigger these symptoms.  Hope to have been helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"I was prescribed phentermine and antibiotics for a bladder infection three days ago.

Your symptoms seem to be related to phentermine (lack of sleep) or possible interactions between phentermine and the antibiotics that you have been taking. I would like to know the names of the antibiotics that you are taking. Have you measured your blood pressure values during these days?I would recommend taking plenty of fluids to remain well hydrated and have some rest in the next days.

Then afterwards I get a headache.  What could be wrong?Thanks","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Your symptoms seem to be related to orthostatic hypotension. I recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure in sitting and then after 3 minutes of standing up position. If there is a decrease more than 20 mmHg of your systolic blood pressure and more than 10mm Hg in the diastolic blood pressure this would indicate orthostatic hypotension. In such case a Head Up tilt test would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Other lab tests would help exclude other possible causes that may trigger this situation: - complete blood count for anemia- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues.

Depression can cause a slow thinking and memory troubles because of lack of concentration. Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting with a psychiatrist for a careful evaluation of his psychological situation. A brain CT scan would help exclude other possible intracranial causes that may lead to this symptomatology. He may need to start an antidepressant to recover from this situation.

You had indicated that the recurrent numbness or twitching in the hands could be a result of the concussions - diffuse axonal injury - frontal and/or temporal lobe.It has not completely gone away after this most recent concussion (2 years ago) as it did with the earlier ones. Am I correct that with repeated concussions, the chance of lasting symptoms increases - and why is it that the axons? won t heal all the way - as before","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that the axonal damage is an important damage of the brain cells. It is usually irreversible. Repeated brain trauma, can lead to repeated brain cell death, which leads to a more severe clinical situation. I would recommend performing a brain MRI to examine the possible brain lesions. An EEG is necessary to exclude possible epilepsy (including myoclony) which could be responsable for those twitching in the hands. There is no cure to brain damage. But we can try to improve the situation with physiotherapy and antiepileptic drugs to reduce your troubles (hand twitching).

The first to remove a meningioma behind my optic nerve. Tumor has not returned, but have some side effects from the surgery. The second surgery was this past June to treat trigeminal neuralgia. Surgeon found other issues in brain once inside. At the trigeminal nerves exit it was constricted by a y shaped vein scarred down to the nerve. It was dissected and removed. There was also a arterial loop scarred to a portion on the nerve. These adhesions had to be sharply incised and were able to move the blood vessel off the nerve. A sponge was placed over the nerve. My problem is that I continue to have massive face pain almost continuously and have been on different anti seizure drugs to control mini seizures. I am not doing well with side effects from medication. Is there anything else that can be done or am I going to be struggling with pain and drugs for the rest of my life?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!I carefully passed through your question and understand your concern!It seems that neurosurgery has not been effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia. Considering the fact that you can not tolerate the adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs, I would recommend performing local injection to the trigeminal nerve, which is called Trigeminal nerve block. This procedure causes a temporary improvement of the symptoms, reducing the need for antiepileptic drug, allowing to reduce the doses and even stop these drugs for a certain period of time.

Regarding your concern, I would explain that as her situation is not improving, it is important to exclude a possible delayed intracranial hemorrhage (like subdural hemorrhage) which occurs in the day after the head trauma. That is why I would recommend bringing her to the ER for a new brain CT scan to exclude this possibility. I agree with your doctor that resting is the best thing to do in this period.

Hope to have been helpful!Greetings, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"Hello, I recently had ultrasound after a physicial, to check abdominal aneurysm . It showed a dilated bile duct, and was sent for a mrcp. It came back as : mild dilatation of the proper hepatic duct with tapering of the common bile duct becoming near string-like at the level of the ampulla. This raises the possibility of ampullary stenosis. I now have appointment coming up with a gastroenteritis. I guess next is a ercp? I have some stomach pain every once in awhile with no other symptoms, this was just caught because of other reasons.  GB been removed for about 10 yrs now. From what I read I'm concerned about cancer.","Doctor":"yes this is cause of concern there can be involvement of liver or ducts with fibrous tissue benign tissue act the exact pathology can be found in investigations"},{"Patient":"My nephew was prescribed Dilantin when he was two years old. he continued to take it till he was eight and then it was stopped since his problem of seizures was cured. While on Dilantin he developed scaly skin on his stomach, neck and hands etc. Another problem was sudden and excessive watering of eyes. Both these problems are still continuing even though he is now 16 years old. Eye examination is normal but for ski the doctors say it is allergy. Couldit be that both these problems are side effects of Dilantin. How can they be cured?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that as Dilantin has been stopped, even her adverse effects can not occur now. You should know that Dilantin does not deposit in human tissues and its effects last for a short time after stopping its intake. The scaly skin during its intake could be related to Dilantin. But the situation should improve after stopping it. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing allergy test for possible allergy. A dermatological consult may be helpful to determine the skin problems. Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"In start of Jan. I started freezing. I was checked for everything-all lab reports normal. Finally went to neurologist and she said for some reason my thermastat on my body is not working. she says no known solution- just heating pads. Can t find anything about it. Have diabetes and parkinsons. Am 81 and freezing.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that parkinson disease can cause autonomic dysfunction including these changes in body temperature. Unfortunately there is no treatment or cure for this disorder. These symptoms are caused by a progressive degeneration of the brain cells in this region. I agree with your doctor that heating pads would help relive your symptoms. Avoid staying in fresh or cool places would help too.Hope you will find this answer helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"Is it possible ny 21 year old could of developed idiopathic scoliosis from having a lumbar puncture performed when she was 18 myths old.she had meningococcal septocemia. Doctor is waiting for xray results to confirm scoliosis . Suffering g from back and chest pains for last year. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that the scoliosis spinal column deformation can not be caused by a lumbar puncture even in a very young age. But chronic deficiency of vitamin D or calcium or even a wrong posture can lead to this symptoms. I recommend performing vitamin D and calcium plasma levels to exclude this possibility. A spinal column CT scan would help give more information on the anatomy of your spinal column and possible treatment options. Meanwhile, i recommend correcting your posture and perform a lot of physical activity which is important for the reinforcement of the back muscles.

I would recommend having some rest for some days. Holding a cervical collar may be helpful. For the pain I would recommend taking painkillers like ibuprofen, coupled with a muscle relaxant like flexeril. Your symptoms will improve gradually. If the problem persist, I would recommend consulting with your doctor for a physical exam and a cervical spine X ray study. A cervical spine CT scan may be needed. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"I woke up about yesterday feeling dizzy but the night before i felt fine .

What is your age?Do you have any cardio-vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, etc.)?I would recommend consulting with an ENT specialist for a careful physical check up and performing labyrinthine tests. A brain MRI may be needed, especially if you have known cardio-vascular risk factors. Meanwhile, I would recommend having some rest and take plenty of fluids to remain well hydrated. Cinnarizine or betahistine may be helpful.

Temporal arteritis could also mimic this clinical situation (although it is not related to the trauma).Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful neurological exam and some tests: - a brain CT scan or MRI - inflammationt tests (PCR, sedimentation rate)- complete blood count for anemia. It is also important to closely monitor your blood pressure values. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider post traumatic headache as the main cause of this symptoms. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues.

Dr. says next step is to MRI the spot.  I have to work what can i do for myself to help remedy this?Thank you,Donna","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I agree with your doctor that a MRI would help examine better the nerve compression. A nerve conduction study may also be helpful. Meanwhile, I would recommend starting therapy with gabapentine or pregabaline for the pain. These two antiepileptic drugs can be really helpful in nerve pain from different causes. They are usually well tolerated in every age. Physiotherapy may also be helpful. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Best wishes, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"Hi, I was diagnosed with Graves disease 5 years ago. When I started taking carbimazole to treat it, I experienced tiredness and sore muscles/joints. The specialist said these were normal side-effects, but after stopping the treatment after 1.5 years, these symptoms did not go away. And I developed numbness and tingling in my left foot, which gradually spread up my left leg, and down my left arm, into my left hand. I ve seen various specialists, including a neurologist to rule out MS, and had 2 MRI scans over the past 4 years, and had a lumbar puncture done approx 3 years ago. All tests came back negative. I ve now been discharged from all specialists, and since my carbimazole treatment, I ve been in remission for Graves . The neurologist did say that it s possible (though unlikely) that I might develop MS at some stage, and to go back if my symptoms develop. I ve since been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and have tried all treatments but to no avail. I m currently medication-free. The last few weeks, I ve been much more sensitive to sound, light and smell. Please advise. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I carefully read your question and would explain that your symptoms don't seem to be related to MS. Your repeated MRI can confirm this. But, Graves is an autoimmune disease and it is commonly associated to some autoimmune neurological disorders like MS or Myastenia gravis. Neuropathy from thyroid dysfunction can not be excluded either. So, I would recommend performing some other tests: - a nerve conduction study, including repetitive nerve stimulation to investigate for neuropathy or myastenic syndrome- thyroid hormone levels for possible dysfunction which can contribute to this symptomatology. - vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency- vitamin B 12 plasma levels for possible deficiency. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider chronic fatigue syndrome as the main cause of these symptoms. Duloxetine would be helpful to treat this disorder (considering also fibromyalgia). Hope you will find this answer helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"My husband is in a coma subdural hematoma which was diagnosed as well as a stroke that led to his state now the doctors want to embark immediately as he has not improved but is stabilized they want to have a tracheostomy tomorrow .what are his chances of recovering was told his brain stem was affected and thus his sight might be affected? Is there ever going to be a chance he might pull through as this happened about a week ago?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I am really sorry about your husband! His clinical conditions seem to be really serious. The tracheostomy is needed for the respiratory assistance as the brainstem is responsible for the respiration. We can not determine if he will recovery from this medical condition. Time will show it. Even though the brainstem has been damaged, as blood is absorbed there are still chances of recovery. I would recommend giving him another chance with tracheostomy, as otherwise it will be the end.

The bike hit the tree first and then the right side of my head hit the tree. I didn t lose consciousness. I remember exactly what happened. I felt a little nauseous afterwards and have been having dizzy spells all day whenever I change directions, like turn my head fast or get up or lie down. I don t have any other symptoms for a concussion. Should I still get checked out? My head is still swollen and hurts.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms are related to a head concussion. But the dizzy spells can also be caused by positional paroxysmal vertigo. This is a benign disorder affecting the inner ear, caused by trauma. So, I would recommend having some rest for some days. If the problem persists, I would recommend consulting with an ENT specialist and performing labyrinthine tests. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"Hello.

Now after three months he complains of heaviness in his body,We keep on asking our doctor about this problem ,according to him the heaviness goes away but it takes time. Now how much time ? he has no clear answer, due to which we are worried. please help.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that the heaviness in the body may be related to the motor deficits caused by the stroke. You should know that recovery after stroke takes months. It is important performing a lot of physiotherapy during this period (which includes 6-12 months after stroke). This is the period during which you can gain a lot from physiotherapy. After this period, he may not be as before, but the residual deficits usually remain. Anyway, other tests are necessary to exclude other possible causes of heaviness: - a cardiac ultrasound to examine his heart for heart failure- complete blood count for anemia- liver and kidney function tests.

The glands in her underarms indicate possible infection. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with her attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests: - a chest X ray study- a cervical spine X ray study- complete blood count for inflammation or anemia- PCR and sedimentation rate for inflammation- blood electrolytes. A Head Up Tilt test is necessary to exclude possible orthostatic hypotension.

From the other hand the fact that you have had a seizure followed by a head trauma, raises suspicions of possible intracranial bleeding (like delayed subdural hemorrhage, etc.). The progressive deterioration in your clinical situation is really concerning. So, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful neurological exam and performing some tests: - a brain CT scan- an EEG- complete blood count- PCR, sedimentation rate for inflammation - thyroid hormone levels.
