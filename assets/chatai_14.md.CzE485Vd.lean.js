I take a monthly injection as my colon was removed and B12 is mostly absorbed in the ileum. My BP is also high but I am having problems with a couple of root canals. Can pain from my teeth effect my blood pressure like that?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Pain anywhere in the body may cause bp to rise so if bp is high during pain then it may be related to toothache.

Could the high amounts of chlorine be a factor as to why I have a yeast infection? Can I treat the yeast with a detol soak in the tub?","Doctor":"Hey thanks for your faith in the health care magic.i have gone through your question and understood your problem.yes it can if u had yeast infection previously.When swimming with a yeast infection, keep your vaginal area dry when you're through with your swim. Hanging around in a wet bathing suit can stimulate the growth of yeast, exacerbating your infection. Avoid putting another suit on, if possible, because yeast thrives in synthetic fabrics. A loose-fitting dress and cotton panties helps keep your vaginal area dry and inhibit the yeast infection.Hope I have answered your query. If you like my answers and wish me to answer in future, bring it to my attention"},{"Patient":"I have a UTI history, in year 2004 after my cesearian operation i was detected with E-Coli ,again in 2007, 2009 my urine test showed E-Coli growth. In all the years i have gone through proper medication. Now my culture report is showing Klebsiella aerogenes. Why this infection is occuring again and again?","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCMI have gone through your query. Recurrence can be due to inadequate antibiotic therapy or dysbacteriosis. Culture and sensitivity of urine should be done and proper antibiotic therapy for proper duration should be carried out. You can take cranberry juice and barley water which helps in alkalizing urine and helps to get rid off infection and bacterial growth. For female using intimate wash is helpful also. Hope this may help you.Let me know if anything not clear.Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi there Is it ok to take both a general probiotic (Walgreens brand) and Acidophilius at the same time? I just added the Acidophilus due to recurring minor yeast infection symptoms. I have to take minocycline daily for my rosacea, and have been on that for almost two months. Thank you!  :)","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. Yes it is fine to take acidophilus and another probiotic at the same. Acidophilus is just one of the normal gut bacteria that is considered to be a probiotic. Taking multiple forms of probiotic may help relieve your symptoms. Make sure that your general probiotics does not already contain acidophilus because although it will not harm you to take double doses of it, you may be wasting your money if you are taking acidophilus in two different forms.

It does not seem that the DRS. my Daughter has been going to really know what to do.She has been so sick for such a long time,we are willing to try anything!!! Is tetracycline a safe drug to take & is it effective for h-pylori??","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. There are several combinations of drugs that can be used to treat H. pylori. The regimen most commonly recommended for first line treatment of H. pylori is triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor like omeprazole, amoxicillin (1 g twice daily), and clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) for 7 to 14 days. There are some regimens that use tetracycline, but they often require 4 medications instead of the 3 listed above. A typical regimen for H. pylori treatment would include tetracycline, a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth and metronidazole. Doses for these regimens are high and the course is often 2 weeks. She may need to see a gastroenterologist to get adequate treatment. I do not think that tetracycline alone will be sufficient. Thank you for using HCM."},{"Patient":"My granddaughter is 10 and had her ears pierced about 3 months ago. right ear is now infected and pus came out when the earring was taken out this morning. It was cleaned, some triple antibiotic applied and it was covered. Should we do anything more? She has allergies to nickel.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. Any time the body is pierced there is a risk of infection. Sometimes with ear piercing the putting in and taking out of earrings can re-injure the ear even after they have initially healed up. Keeping the ears clean and cleaning earrings with alcohol before and after use can help keep down infection. For now just have her keep the ears clean and use the triple antibiotic ointment. If the ears become painful, if she develops fever or if the infection seems to be spreading she should see a doctor right away because she may need antibiotics by mouth. Thank you for using HCM"},{"Patient":"I was experiencing vaginal pain the other day and the doctor took a peek and told me that I have a yeast infection.  I used vagicaine to help ease the pain and I then noticed blisters around my vaginal area.  Is this just a normal allergic reaction or could I have a more severe STD such as herpes?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. Blisters can be both an allergic reaction and a sign of a herpes infection. Herpes infections are very painful. Yeast infections can be irritating and itchy but are rarely severely painful. It would be a good idea for you to return to your doctor while you have the blisters and get tested for herpes infection. You will need to know whether or not you have this because if you do you may need treatment for it, you may have recurrences, and you would need to know how to prevent giving it to other people.

It sounds like you may have a small cyst around your navel that gets inflamed around the time of your period. The best thing to do is to clean around your navel every day with a q-tip and alcohol.

My symptoms are an off- white discarge itchiness and soreness in and around my vagina, and this morning there was a dark brown spotting in my discharge. Could antibiotics be making the yeast worse?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. Hopefully the doctor checked you for sexually transmitted infections when they diagnosed your yeast and bacterial infection. It can take several days for the STI tests to come back so check with your doctor's office to see if they did the tests or not. If you are on a yeast treatment as well as the antibiotics then the antibiotics should not make the yeast worse. It may be that you need more time for the symptoms to resolve. If after one week on the antibiotic and yeast treatment you are still having symptoms, then you need to go back to the doctor for further testing. If you develop fevers or pelvic pain then go to the emergency department. Thank you for using HCM."},{"Patient":"Hello, I had a tick on the back of my leg, and didn t know how long it had been there. I pulled it off, but part of it was embedded, so I went to my doctor and she took out the remainder of the tick. I had neck and shoulder pain, so she put me on an antibiotic for 3 weeks. When the antibiotic wears off before my next dosage, the pain comes back and now it feels like it is in the upper muscle of my left arm. Could lyme disease cause this?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. The type of tick, a deer tick, that causes lyme disease is very small and usually just falls off without becoming embedded. The larger dog ticks are the usual ones that get embedded. They may cause Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever but no Lyme disease. You would need to check with your doctor to see what kind of tick she thought this was. It is possible for lyme disease to cause muscle pains but usually it is muscle pains all over not just in an isolated muscle group. If you have fevers or severe pain then see your doctor again or go to Emergency.

From your description, the dog did not actually bite you rather its teeth hit your finger. It was good you immediately rinsed your finger with savlon.

She is healthy otherwise, but this is upsetting to her and the family.","Doctor":"Good day and thanks for your question. Sorry about your teenage daughter health. MRSA can be difficult to treat. She's probably having a Community acquired MRSA, could have contracted it while in school participating in contact sports. You have done the right thing by allowing a surgeon to drain the boil and going for follow-up.

In a small number of cases it needs to be drained in the scenario of painful lesion, or large lesion.3. In your case abscess is sealed off that means, it is walled off by fibrous tissue. If the swelling has come down, then no need to bother. 4. However if the swelling increases in size/ gets more painful then you need to get it drained, also change the antibiotics depending on culture sensitivity of the pus.Hope this helps.Wish you good health"},{"Patient":"I had a blister on the bottom of my food that I had to pop I then couldn't walk for 2 weeks and my foot swelled, I then went to doctors and was told that it was badly infected and now the infection that was previously yellow has turned black.

You can get the discharge examined for fungus, and start with antifungals after discussing with your consulting doctor. 4.

A painkiller can be added if you feel the pain is severe.Acyclovir is a peculiar medication because it causes your serum uric acid levels to rise which in turn can precipitate a kidney stone which in turn leads to aggravation of UTI due to urine stagnation.

I was told they tested several antibiotics on the culture, cipro being the only effective one. I'm having trouble finding any information on this bacterium as it relates to the throat. I'm on cipro, but wondering where this could have come from. Female nearing 40, usually in good health but flu-like symptoms for last two months. Thanks for any info.","Doctor":"Hello there,Pseudomonas aeroginosa is a different organism in the fact that it has the ability to form a biofilm. What it does is, attach to your throat then forms a slimy layer around itself which prevent the body from destroying it and then intermittently attack the throat epithelia layers. So you would have on and off fever alongwith a persistent sore throat over a period of time. Now that the doctors have established what it is sensitive to the antibiotic would take care of it. It is a organism present in the environment and ocassionally infects us. So you do not have to worry whether you were singled out or you did something wrong.

Other antiarrhythmic are available but possibility of side effects is there. These are frequently associated with MVP, also caffeine, alcohol, thyroid problems may aggravate these.

I would check the ingredients of the agent but it s in Portuguese","Doctor":"Thanks for asking in Healthcaremagic forumIn short: Stop using unknown medication and go to doctorExplanation: After you get your ear lobe pierced, usually to prevent infection you just have to take antibiotics for 3-5 days with local antiseptic ointments. And also the instruments should be sterile.                  It is dangerous to use unknown medication. I think you may be using local aneasthetic for pain with adrenaline which may be causing vasoconstriction. So, stop using your own medication and mean while you can apply oint soframycin/mupirocin locally for relief.                  And further, you can clean with water only no need of any medication for that. You can contact your local doctor for proper physcial assessment as it is difficult to diagnose without seeing.

My question is this. Since I m not sure where the bacteria came from that caused my husband s problem. I wonder if I was exposed to the same bacteria. No one told me to take precautions even when the infection went to the blood stream.","Doctor":"Thanks for asking in Healthcaremagic forumIn short: The bacteria doesnot come from somewhere , it is the bacteria which lies within our body which causes bacterial endocarditis many timesExplanation: Usually any patient with prosthetic valves or any regurgitation lesions of heart valves, are prone to get bacterial endocarditis and thrombosis. So, they will be put on warfarin/heparin therapy and will be given prophylaxis for endocarditis during any simple operative procedure involving break in skin/mucosa.(usually antibiotics)                So, sometimes it can still occur after taking proper precautions and prophylaxis.

My general practitioner has not been successful in preventing the flare-ups.","Doctor":"Thanks for asking in healthcaremagic forumIn Short: Allergic reaction, bite, wart , callus and cellulitis are not related.Explanation: If you are having frequent cellulitis, something is wrong with your immunity. callus is hardening of skin due to continuous pressure.

I constantly feel tired however I have been told it is because of the herpes virus I am currently taking antiviral medication carbomazipine and naproxen all for pain in my lymph nodes however there is no swelling present.

But it has to be confirmed by examination by a doctor.                  Herpes can cause pain post infection for many months to years in the distribution of the sensory nerve.

Tall leaking T wave may indicate high potassium levels or ischemia. But, it can also be seen as normal variant.

There is crust under my toenail and when i take the crust out there is stickyness like puss. The side of my toe swells up with puss and bursts.

Corn can be difficult to treat and am sure your doctors might have tried removing it medically before removing it surgically for you.

You should wear less traumatic foot wears, you can take Ibuprofen 400mg 3 times daily for the pain (if you do not have peptic ulcer disease).Check your blood sugar level to be sure you are not diabetic and your doctors would also check whether you do not have Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Any discharge from nose usually drains into throat. So, you have to undergo investigation thoroughly for a proper diagnosis. Do not switch doctors frequently, this may harm you rather than doing good."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m a very clean 25 year old female and I ve recently begun to smell awful, sometimes fishy and other times, like fecal matter. I ve been to several gynecologists as well as general practitioners; I ve had a brain scan, all sorts of blood tests, a stool test, and even a test for the very rare trimethylaminuria to try and determine the source of the smell to no avail. I m becoming increasingly desperate for solutions and I m not sure what my next course of action should be. What would you suggest/is there anything I haven t explored that could be causing the symptoms I ve described?","Doctor":"Good day and thanks for your question. If you are actually smelling fishy all the investigations you did would have point out the problem. But they all came out normal and okay. So that means you are okay, probably you are suffering from anxiety/body dysmorphic disorder/hypochondriasis. I would suggest you put your mind off it, use good smelling perfumes. If that doesn't help I'll suggest your next course of action should be to see a psychiatrist for proper evaluation. Please do not do anything funny, just see a Psychiatrist. Hope it helps. Thank you."},{"Patient":"I had a bartholin cyst or abcess (whichever one can burst) but I did not know I had it until it bursted. It bursted while i was peeing on the toilet. I then researched it because I got scared I had never experienced anything like that before. I felt instant relief as soon as it happened. Now here s where it gets tricky, I caught chicken pox a few days ago so I also have a few tiny blisters down there. I had the chills for about 2 days before this happened that I thought May have been from the CP but I m starting to think maybe it was infected because I read one of the symptoms for an infection is the chills and blood and pus did come out of it along with a whitish orange scab. It s still a little sore down there I m not sure if it s from the burst itself and needs to heal or it s just the blisters from the CP? Also every time I go to the bathroom or wipe a little discharge comes out of a blackish color. Is this normal? Please answer me I cannot see a doctor about it as I m still contagious from the CP. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. Bartholin's gland cysts are caused when this gland gets blocked and is a separate problem from the chicken pox, but is hard to know if the pain is from the healing cyst or the chicken pox. The cyst can ooze fluid, pus and even blood for a while until it heals up. Occasionally these cysts are so large that they have to be surgically opened and drained. If yours has already opened up, then the best thing to do is to use warm compresses and/or soak in warm water to encourage it to completely drain. If it gets blocked again then you may need to see a doctor at some point, but  for now just use compresses and soaks to help it drain until it heals up. If you are having high fevers and a lot of pain around the cyst area (more than you would expect from the chicken pox) then you should see a doctor right away, since you may need antibiotics.I hope you are over the chicken pox soon.

Although I cough during the day, it get terrible at night and I cough till I vomit. I vomit up mucus/spit though.

In addition the use of  a topical steroid nasal spray and oral anti histamine would help.If there is a history of GERD, this should be treated as well.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, I was stung four days ago while driving with my windows down so I'm not quite sure by what.

After taking a shower ask him to pat that area dry with a dry towel and dust it with a clotrimazole containing talcum powder.

I am not sure what is causing this but they seem to be getting worse even though I have refrained from scratching them. What is going on??","Doctor":"Good day and thanks for your question.

You may want to have a probiotic supplement like yoghurt or Yakult to correct that. Swollen lymph nodes along with hypersensitivity(Allergies) may be due to a viral infection that cannot be cured by antibiotics. Unfortunately for viral infections all we can do is give you supportive therapy i.e an analgesic for pain, an anti-pyretic for fever and some vitamin tablets to counter fatigue.

If you have a fever with a swollen lymph node then it is an indication for active infection. Otherwise sometimes a swollen lymph node is just the body fighting off some insect bite on the area of drainage.

I an 54 years old in good health and shape and my occupation is a rancher. I have regular stools, no blood in the stools, no discharge from the rectum, no odor. The area is not warm to the touch. Once in awhile there will be surface bumps on the skin. The itching can be so bad that I will draw blood. At times it feels like a mosquito or some other insect biting me. The feeling is the same during the day and night. Have not had a solid nights sleep in quite some time. Seems to become more aggravated when I sweat. Even during now cool fall days and not sweating, the area is constantly moist. I have tried Desitin, aloe vera, A&D cream, Sensicare, have taken worm pills(work with cattle every day), the only thing that seems to take the edge off the itching is benedryl and otc triple antibiotic. Also, no difference when I am standing, sitting, riding in a vehicle , or horseback. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Thanks for asking in Healthcaremagic ForumIN short: Pin worm infestation/fungal infection may cause these symptomsExplanation: As you told that the area you mentioned is constantly wet, fungal infection is a possibility. Even pin worm infestation can cause these symptoms as well. So pay a visit to your local doctor and get yourself examined and undergo investigation(Stool microscopy) to rule out worm infestation.                  For the time being, keep the area clean and dry (excess hair may be removed) and wear loose clothes. Antifungal powder may help.                 Good luck"},{"Patient":"What is wrong with me?

Try adding a fiber supplement for the constipation and drinking at least 60 oz of water daily. Completely eliminating all foods that you are intolerant to is also important.

MRSA is a very stubborn infection and could be transmitted through intercourse with your husband. And your baby too is at risk. Wash your hands. Careful hand-washing remains your best defense against germs. Scrub hands briskly for at least 15 seconds, then dry them with a disposable towel and use another towel to turn off the faucet. Carry a small bottle of hand sanitizer containing at least 62 percent alcohol for times when you don't have access to soap and water.Keep wounds covered. Keep cuts and abrasions clean and covered with sterile, dry bandages until they heal. The pus from infected sores may contain MRSA, and keeping wounds covered will help keep the bacteria from spreading.Keep personal items personal. Avoid sharing personal items such as towels, sheets, razors, clothing and athletic equipment. MRSA spreads on contaminated objects as well as through direct contact.Shower after athletic games or practices. Shower immediately after each game or practice. Use soap and water. Don't share towels.Sanitize linens. If you have a cut or sore, wash towels and bed linens in a washing machine set to the hottest water setting (with added bleach, if possible) and dry them in a hot dryer. Wash gym and athletic clothes after each wearing.Hope it helps. Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hello. I received two vaccinations on Thursday morning, both shots on my left arm.

In the past, I regularly wore small loops that I almost always left in, and had no problems when I took them out. However, I don't wear my ear rings regularly anymore, so the holes have closed slightly a few times, and the last time I put ear rings in again, about three weeks ago, my ears started acting a little infected, leaking a little bit each. I've been taking my earrings out and cleaning with the ear rings and holes with rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide, but three days ago my right one got really swollen and has stayed like that. What can I do to make them better? Should I leave the earrings in (they're out at the moment) or leave them out?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I understand your concern. Your piercings seem to infected. As there is already an infection, it is not advisable to put the earrings back. You need to allow it to heal first. I fear you may need to undergo re-piercing after it has healed completely. For now, you should apply topical anti-bacterial cream. Alcohol should not be used for raw area and pus filled area. It may cause burning and irritation. But you can use alcohol to clean the ear rings. Betadine ointment is best for this purpose if you right ear is not swollen much and there is not much pus. If there is already pus filled abscess, it needs to be drained at clinic followed by a course of oral antibiotics.Hope this will be helpful. Do ask if any further question is there. Take care.Regards,Dr. Nilesh Soni"},{"Patient":"I sustained a fever of 102 last night. this morning when I got up I find that my feet, knees and thighs are aching to the point where I m unable to walk without assistance.

I have been sweating profusely at night for the last two nights... my question is: Are all these symptoms normal?","Doctor":"HIGreetings from Dr.Divakara.PThanks for posting your query.     Sweating can happen while recovering from any kind of infection but rashes over your arm is not due to Viral Pharyngitis.     The possible cause for that rash is a separate Viral or bacterial infection of the skin or it could be due to drug allergy. So are you still on any medications given for your pharyngitis ? If yes then the chance of drug allergy is high and the rash will subside once the drug is stopped .    But if you are not on any medicines then it is due to separate infection . In that case just wait for 2-3 days as it may fade off by itself. But if it persists or if its spreading then you need to consult your doctor. Hope this information is useful to you.

As you are having a fever for last 20 days it may be a fever of unknown origin (FUO) which should be thoroughly evaluated to find out the causes of a fever. All the relevant investigations should be done to rule out the cause of fever.As your health care provider has prescribed paracetamol to reduce the fever, this drug will act for 6 hours and it will control the fever for this duration but it cannot cure the condition. The source of infection should be found out by the investigations.To confirm it is typhoid, after having a fever for last 20 days you should undergo stool and urine culture to confirm it. There are many conditions which can lead to fever of more than 1 month which should be evaluated thoroughly.Medications also must be taken for complete course and in typhoid it is often given for 14 days. You may take adequate amounts of water and fresh fruit juices. As typhoid leaves you very weak, taking rest for a while is advised. Typhoid recovery is not the same for every person who gets it.

This recurrence is because herpes viruses have the property of remaining dormant in the body in the nerve cells and getting reactivated when the resistance of the person falls.However, these reactivated lesions present similar to primary infection but are usually less severe and less painful.I suggest you get the itchy spot examined by your testing doctor to confirm reactivation of herpes zoster.Treatment of this condition will remain same. Most effective is acyclovir.I hope I have cleared your doubts.Thanks."},{"Patient":"i recently had surgery with no complications( 3 months ago) and today there was a small amount of puss oozing from one of the scars. it drained on it's own, but i am noticing a hole in the middle of the scar. it otherwise all looks well healed. should i be concerned or is this normal","Doctor":"Thanks for your question, I am Dr Asanghanwa Carlson,  it is not a normal happening to have purse oozing from a scar three months after a surgery.

They are mainly flat and roundish (however one or two of them looked more like a skin tag than a bump). None of them were of any significant size (all well under half an inch). So I squeezed them out. And for each bump it was the same. I would squeeze it and a solid mass would come out (sort of like a blackhead). The mass was not very hard like a pebble or tough blackhead, however it was not waxy or soft; it retained its shape if squeezed or pressed on but it was still fleshy. They were flesh colored although some had a darker hue to them. They popped out when squeezed as if they were lodged in my skin and each one was smooth and roundish (while the skin-tag looking ones were not). They would leave behind a small hole in my skin that would begin to bleed so I cleaned the areas with hydrogen peroxide and applied pressure. They are now scabbed over and healing. I do not know how long they have been hiding in my pubic hair (or how long they have not been in there). I just noticed them yesterday. However, a couple of months ago I did find one on the crease of my scrotum and inner thigh. And it did the same thing: I squeezed it, a fleshy mass came out, it bled, healed, and disappeared.

Investigations to find out the cause of enlarged lymph nodes needs to be carried out.However, simple investigation  like aspiration cytology of the lymph node will help to know the cause of lymph node enlargement.In this investigation, cells are sampled from the lesion, spread on a slide, and stained with appropriate stain.This investigation helps to know the origin and character of the lesion.In case tubercular infection is present, the causative agent can be picked up and treatment for tuberculosis can be commenced.Thank you."},{"Patient":"I was bitten by a spider and the symptom that I experienced was of mild tendon and muscle soreness starting in the arm that was bitten.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Regarding your concern, I would explain that a missed dose of Atenolol (considering the dose that you are taking) is not concerning. With your actual heart rate, I would not recommend taking any extra dose, because it may lead to bradycardia. Coming to this point, I would recommend waiting and see if your heart rhythm is going to raise. In such case, you can take the dose of Atenolol. Hope I have answered your query.

He was dx with emphysema 4 years ago and has not smoked since. He has been on antibiotics for 17 days and the latest course will end tomorrow night of pip-tazo and septra IV. We were told today he has a large fluid collection on chest ct that will likely require drainage or a chest tube by the end of the week if no improvement. He no longer has fever, but is tachycardic at 126 and saturates at 92 with 5 L o2 via nasal prongs, desats to 78 when off oxygen for 4 minutes. He was sent today for an emergency abdo ultrasound as his liver enzymes were elevated today. Last drawn and normal 4 days ago. Is this possibly related?","Doctor":"HelloWelcome to HCM Thanks for posting your query I understand your concerns. As your father had pneumonia, fluid has collected in the chest that is precisely called pleural cavity. Fluid collection in the pleural cavity is medically termed as synpneumonic pleural  effusion. It is due to excess translate  from the infection site. So no need to worry. As your doctor has told, insertion of chest tube will automatically decrease the effusion.

If you have no wound, then this is most likely a boil.You seem to have pyoderma in groin area. It is a bacterial infection caused by staphylococci. You consult dermatologist for firm diagnosis and investigations. Antibiotics like cefixime and anti inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen may be taken for 1 to 2 weeks. Immunoboosters may be taken to improve immunity. Hygiene should be improved to prevent relapse. Dettol bath may be taken to improve hygiene.

Is there anything that could be causing this, and is there something that I should ask about at the next doctor visit?","Doctor":"HelloWelcome to HCM Thanks for posting your query I understand your concerns. As you are getting recurring attacks of flu from 2-3years, your immunity has come down. You would have taken lots of antibiotics from past couple of years.

Yesterday, I got mail and found down that I had Hepatitis B positive. However, they run another test the HBsAg and HBV Nucleic Acid Test were negative. I am really worried, Is there any medicine I need to take to kill the virus. Please help","Doctor":"You do not need to take any medicine to kill the virus. You do  not have the virus now. You may have had it in the past, but your body fought it off. The HBsAg and HBV nucleic acid test both test specifically for the virus, and yours were negative. The other was most likely an antibody test. That indicates prior exposure and will always be positive. It will also be positive if you had the immunization for hepatitis B. So no need to worry. You do not have the virus now. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I've had a fever, as high as almost 102, with extreme fatigue, no appetite, and alternating sweats and feeling cold. Today is the 3rd day, and I am feeling a bit better. I called my doctor and she said it's probably just a virus, but the fever means infection. My doctor just thinks I'm too anxious, but since I haven't had a fever in decades, I feel pretty worried.  Are these just symptoms of some common virus that's going around? I have no respiratory symptoms at all.","Doctor":"Fever can indicate infection with either viruses or bacteria. Your other symptoms are nonspecific. Without any other specifics, such as a sore throat, productive cough, etc, the condition is most often ascribed to a virus. There are always lots of viruses going around and no way (or particular reason) to identify them. Most of these viral syndromes clear up on their own in a few days to a week or so. There is no need to be concerned unless the symptoms persist after that time frame or more specific symptoms start to manifest. You are already feeling better, so your doctor is most likely correct. It's just a virus and should resolve shortly. However, if you continue to have fevers past a week or so, or more specific symptoms develop, ask your doctor again about it. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello, I was contacted by a condo building I am staying at for vacation.

Since it's only been 2 cases over 13 months, and they're not even sure it's the condos, the risk is probably very very small but not zero. You will need to decide if even a tiny risk is too great for your comfort.

I discovered this after seveal sips - my throat began to hurt and my chest felt tight. My inhaler didn't do much help. Very allergic to mold.

I plan to finish my antiobiotica and then go back and have my blood work redone.  Am I making a mistake?  Money is an issue(no Insurace), so I am trying to be conservative but not risk my health.","Doctor":"If they called you about low blood counts and told you to go to the ER, then what they found was very significant and needs prompt evaluation and treatment. Low blood counts could mean low platelets, white cells, and/or red cells. All of these cells function in critical areas- control of bleeding, infection, and carrying oxygen. If the platelets are too low, you could have excessive bleeding, including internal bleeding. When white cells are low, you are very susceptible to all types of infections, which may be related to all the recent problems you have. If the red cells are very low, you might need a blood transfusion. I understand your concerns about costs, but without knowing the specifics of your blood counts, your best choice is to go to the ER as recommended and not take chances with your health.

Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.You have low blood pressure (hypotention) highly likely from blood pressure (BP) medications and diuretics. All of your medications decrease BP with different mechanism of actions. Lisinopril belongs to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor group which relaxes blood vessels, carvedilol belongs to beta-adrenoreceptor blocking group which mainly affects the heart to beat slowly and with less force. Diuretics (torcemide and spironolactone) decrease blood volume and relax arterioles to further decrease blood pressure. You should consult with your doctor to review your medications. The dose and number of medicines should be adjusted according to your blood pressure and chronic heart failure symptoms. Initially, after the start of BP medicines you should follow home blood pressure monitoring and record every day BP in  your Blood Pressure Record Book. Your doctor will adjust the dose, administration time according your every day blood pressure readings. Periodically, you may need blood tests and echocardiogram to evaluate and monitor your heart function.Please, contact your healthcare provider regarding review of your BP medications.Hope I have answered your query.

I assume that you have developed it on penis. As you have developed it very next day, it must not be due to any sexually transmitted diseases as all STD will take some time before any symptoms can develop. Most likely reason for this is abrasion due to forceful intercourse or wrong usage of condom. If it is the case, it should heal by itself in a few days.You told that you both has came HIV negative. And you had used condom during intercourse, so your chances of getting HIV is almost nil.

Treatment duration may range from 3-20 days based upon the antibiotic used.If you child has received both these kind of antibiotics than he has given proper treatment.Once your baby recovers from the infection, he will develop antibodies against the infection which may persist for long time (several years). So, antibody detection test will come positive till several years after infection. But persistent high level of antibodies may suggest tissue infection due to amoeba(e.g. liver abscess).You can go for stool microscopy a few weeks after completion of treatment which should be negative after successful treatment.You should be aware about the possible complications of amoebiasis and their symptoms. You should also know how to prevent repeated infection to your child which can very well happen if you don't take care.Hope this will be helpful.Do ask if any further question is there. care."},{"Patient":"chickungunya? moderate to high fever with heavy sweating, joint and muscle aching, feel weak and fatigued, get light headed, some diarrhea and vomiting - but only day one.

They may also have antihistamines which often cause sleepiness. It would depend on specifically what's in the particular medicines you purchased. If you have a bacterial sinus infection, you will probably also need antibiotics. If you're having fevers, yellow or green discharge, and a lot of sinus pain and pressure, it could be bacterial.

He is an active, healthy 43 year old with no immune compromising issues. We took him to the ER with sepsis, and he was diagnosed with an abscess in the left lobe of his liver. Klebsiella grew out of both the blood culture and the pus from the liver, which has a drain. He is on 4 weeks of IV antibiotics along with Flagyl 3 times daily. He is doing splendid 2 weeks later. Of course the BIG question is where did this infection come from? 5-7 days prior to developing symptoms of malaise, he was bit by a dog on the leg. The wound was cleaned, and did not develop infection at the site. His doctor said the bug escaped his GI tract. All his blood tests are within normal range with the exception of a slightly elevated ALT. Could the dog have introduced the bacteria to his bloodstream? How does Klebsiella take down a healthy, strong, active guy?","Doctor":"It's conceivable but unlikely that the dog bite introduced the Klebsiella infection. Infection would most likely have occurred at the site as well; also I am not aware that dogs often carry Klebsiella. The bacteria can be found in the GI tract of humans and it is more likely that is where it came from, as suggested by his doctor. When bacteria like Klebsiella get into internal organs like the liver or into the bloodstream, they can take down a previously healthy active person very quickly. Part of it is toxins the bacteria release, and part of it is the person's immune response to the infection and the toxins. Gram negative bacteria like Klebsiella and E coli, once they get into the bloodstream, are especially deadly and often hard to treat as they have developed resistance to a lot of antibiotics. I am glad that he is now doing well. Hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"I'm about to go on a trip with someone who has shingles and I've never had chickenpox.

You could consider getting a blood test to see if you already have antibodies to chickenpox, and if you don't, could consider getting the series of immunizations, although you may not have adequate time before the trip. You can reduce the risk by avoiding any direct physical contact with the person who has active lesions, particularly contact with the lesions themselves, be sure the person covers them well and that both of you wash your hands frequently and don't share any clothes, towels, sheets, etc. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"i am being treated for thrush for the second time...i had pneomenia in May &i've been on meds ever since. which is really aweful since i rarely ever caught a cold.

Inflammation from this or other causes could cause a sensation of something sticking deep in the esophagus. It would be a good idea to see a gastroenterology specialist promptly and have an endoscopy done to take a direct look inside your esophagus. Thrush and other infections can be diagnosed this way. Other conditions can also be identified. It is also possible you do have something stuck in your esophagus and with the endoscopy it can be identified and removed. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi.

A variety of infections can have a general onset with chills, fever, headaches, and body aches, and then symptoms specific to a certain body area develop soon afterwards. Burning urination particularly with a discharge suggests the possibility of a urinary infection or an STD. If it turns out to be an STD, you also what to be checked for other STDs, such as syphilis and HIV, as you can acquire more than one at the same time. The flu-like symptoms you had initially could also be caused by hepatitis, the flu, other viral infections etc. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I know that my boyfriend's facial stubble cannot directly cause the cold sore I sometimes get on my chin since it is generated by the Herpes 1 virus, however, is it possible that if his stubble penetrates the sensitive skin on my face it could indirectly provoke the cold sore?","Doctor":"Trauma to the area where the cold sore appears could possibly provoke the virus and cause a breakout of the lesion.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I would suggest a rate control rather than rhythm control. If you were my patient I would like to See a 24-48h ECG holter monitoring to see for severe beadicardia or pauses over 3 seconds,which is not very possible since you didn't have any symptoms. If the holter is ok, I recommend you to keep the medical treatment with rate control and blood thinner meds. If pauses are detected you may need a Pacemaker which will give heart rate in pauses or severe beadicardia. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been with my niece this weekend who has chicken pox - I had them as a child so I am ok. However, a work colleague is pregnant and I have been told that I cannot go back into work until I find out if I am a carrier or not? How do I find this out?","Doctor":"If you have had chickenpox in the past, you are immune. You cannot be a carrier. If the chickenpox virus came into your body, your immune system would eliminate it. It would not survive in your body to be passed on to anybody else. There are blood tests to see if you are immune but I have not heard of any tests to see if you are a carrier. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have an abscess on my arm and have been diagnosed with staph, what steps should I take in order to keep it down and make it go away? Since I have noticed it I have been putting Muciprin on it and putting a band-aid on it, just took one off and noticed it got a little bigger.","Doctor":"An abscess usually needs to be drained of pus and infection. Using a topical medicine won't help since the infection is inside the skin. A doctor incises the abscess to make a small cut and allows the fluid to drain. Sometimes a piece of gauze is placed into the cavity to act like a wick and draw any further infection out. Oral antibiotics may or may not be necessary, depending on the extent of the infection. If they have grown staph from the abscess, they should be able to test it to see which antibiotics it would be susceptible to. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"For over a year now I've had a green smelly (discharge) coming out of my righthand nostrel an its seems to just be getting worst I always brush my teeth I'm now always have to blow my nose to try clear it but 5mins later I'm back to how it was full of green smelly stuff","Doctor":"You might have a low grade chronic sinus infection on that side or some kind of localized infection in the nasal tissue. Your best bet is to see an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ENT or otolaryngologist) and have it looked at. A course of antibiotics may be necessary to clear it up. It's possible you may have a partial blockage on that side or even a retained foreign body that is acting as a source of infection. Have it examined to identify the cause and get on the right treatment.

The elevations in ESR and SGPT in this case are nonspecific, and basically indicate only that an infectious or inflammatory process is occurring. If there is vomiting, you may want to keep your son on a clear liquid diet only for a day or two until the vomiting stops. There are also prescription medicines your doctor can give if the vomiting is especially severe. Talk to the doctor about specifics as s/he is familiar with your son's case and knows what medicines were given to him.

I sthis normal?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM.I understand your concern.Not able to speak loudly is due to swelling of vocal cords. This may happen due to many reasons like infection, overuse of vocal cords or allergy. In your case, you have already mentioned that you have had chest infection with high fever. I assume you are already on some antibiotics and if so, this should go away in some more days. If you have not already started antibiotics, than I advice you to consult doctor and start a course of antibiotic along with chlorehexidine gargle and lozenges.You have also mentioned that you are wheezing while breathing. This may be due to swelling or narrowing of air tubes. Your chests needs to be auscultated to differentiate between them. If there is narrowing than you should take bronchodilators like salbutamol along with steroid inhalation. In case of swelling due to infection, a course of antibiotic will be sufficient. Hope this will be helpful.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, am suffering from low fever between 99 to 100 for last one mth along with severe body ache . Till th time I am ion medication, i feel good.

Last night i had a meal with seafood - this morning I had eggs with fish fingers - I grew two spots about two hours after breakfast. For supper I had crumbed hake and more spots have come out....what could it be? *scared*","Doctor":"It could be an allergic reaction to seafood that is causing hives. If you are having any wheezing, swelling in the face or throat, or difficultly breathing with this rash, get seen by a doctor immediately. Sometimes a very bad allergic reaction can result from repeated exposure to the thing causing the allergy. Benadryl might be helpful for the itching and spots and to prevent more from coming, but you need to avoid seafood in the future if this is the cause.

My partner and I have only been with each other and no one else. I ve looked it up and I was concerned I might have a yeast infection. I just did a vaginal exam and I saw some scaly skin peeling off inside and hanging. It hurts when I touch it. It is kind of white around the area. What could this be? Thank you.","Doctor":"It could very well be a yeast infection. This is not generally considered a sexually transmitted disease, and is very common in women. A topical cream or a prescription pill can be used to treat it. However, it would be best to have a doctor do an exam to confirm it's yeast. You might also have something else going on like a blister or abscess. The fact that it seems pretty localized suggests that possibility. With yeast the redness is generalized and there is often a discharge. Have it looked at to be sure what it is. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have been sick for 3 yrs now since contracting MRSA/cellulitis.  Since then I have never been the same.

Severe dizziness. blood pressure varies from low to high.   Pressure dropped numerous times on tilt test, but regulated quickly.

It can last for an hour before it lifts, and it can leave me exhausted for days to weeks.  This hits out of the blue, where I can be laughing and having a great time and all of a sudden I am powerless.","Doctor":"Your symptoms might be due to a condition called chronic fatigue syndrome. This may occur after an acute event such as a cellulitis,  although it is not caused directly by the cellulitis. No one yet knows exactly what causes chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), although it can be a very devastating condition, as you are finding. CFS is a diagnosis of exclusion; that is, other possible conditions such as Lyme and the other diseases you've been tested for have to be ruled out before you can be said to have CFS. With your history of MGUS, I would want you to be sure you have had progression to multiple myeloma ruled out as well. Also be sure adequate tests were done for Lyme disease, which can be tricky to diagnose sometimes. Talk to your doctors about the possibility of CFS.

Today a woman came into the store and said that she was dealing with a major pin worm infestation and had been dealing with repeated infestations in her home. She had scalp sores, etc. and was asking for a natural remedy. I gave her a few things, Tea Tree Oil, Wormwood, Kyolic garlic, based on some reading that she had done. She was touching everything in site and testing makeup, and I briefly brushed against her coat. I am concerned that she has infected the store and was wondering if I have to be concerned about having them because I came incontact with her. I removed the makeup items that she used so that other customers could not use them. Is there anything else I should do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query at HCM!The pinworm (genus Enterobius) is a type of roundworm (nematode) infection. In your case it is a one time visit it is highly unlikely that you will have contracted the disease. Transmission can occur via direct contact with contaminated furniture, bedclothes, bedding, towels, toilets, doorknobs, or other objects. Pinworms spread through human-to-human transmission, by ingesting (i.e., swallowing) infectious pinworm eggs  so there can always be a possibility. Eggs remain viable in moist environment for upto 3 weeks. I advice if you are too troubled you can take albendazole or mebendazole for treatment. Mop the surfaces with disinfectant like chlorhexidine.Practice \\"Handwashing\\"!I hope it will solve your problem."},{"Patient":"I got diagnosed with an abcess on my buttcrack and was given antibiotics, it has now became a pimple and is slowly draining should I go to the hospital again or try and pop it more its still causing an extreme amount of pain I cant sit for a long period of time?","Doctor":"Hi,Now what requires is  proper dressing after removing pus form the wound with antibiotic cream or with gauze pack with antibiotic lotion.Complete the course of antibiotic medicine.Gradually wound will be healed up.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"head pain I'm 25 female 5'6\\" 130.

I am not on any medication but I have used creams and ointment on the blisters)","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM.You have history of repeated abscess in skin folds. It is possible that you have infection due to MRSA (resistant staph aureus) bacteria. You should get the microscopy, culture and sensitivity of pus done. Avoid scratching or draining of blisters at home. That can lead to further spread of infection. Any current blister should be drained by surgical incision and drainage in clinic. You should take antibiotics (local or systemic) as per the sensitivity report. You have not mentioned whether you have itching in the areas where you develop repeated blisters. If yes, than there is a chance of having fungal skin infection as well. Repeated scratching may predispose to repeated occurrence of skin blister. If there is fungal infection, than it needs to be treated by anti-fungal ointments for long term relief.You may also need to take several injections of long acting penicilline to prevent carrier stage of staph aureus.As you have mentioned that your height is over 6 feet and weight is 300 pound. Your BMI is over 35 which puts you in the category of Obese. Obese person is having a greater risk of developing this kind of skin problems and other disease which can make this abscesses difficult to heal and recurrent.Your ideal weight should be under 200 pound.You should also get your blood sugar (FBS and PP2BS) to rule out diabetes.I hope this will be helpful.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello I have  a small hard pustular lump which i believe is a reesult of an infected hair follicule from waxing.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM.I understand your concern.You have developed a pus filled lump due to folliculites. They occur most commonly due to staph aureus bacteria. So, you need to use any topical cream effective against this bacteria. First of all, don't use quadriderm, as it contains a steroid (betamethasone) which you don't need in this kind of infection and also it can aggravate the abscess.As compared to Fucidin, I would advice you to use garamycin as it will give you better effect. Do not squeeze or drain the abscess at home. This can spread infection further.Be watchful for fever or increase in size of lump. Consult a doctor if such a thing is there.Hope this will be helpful.Take care."},{"Patient":"I take care or a 87 year old lady she has had the staph infection about 7 months now we had it to were it was just a small scabby soar now it is back and worse than ever just great big blisters we have been washing it with ivory soap and putting silverdine cream on it everyday but ts noy going away is there something else we can try","Doctor":"Hi, I am sorry for the situation this lady is going through. Apart local hygiene and applying silverdine cream, I highly advise to get the blisters checked by dermatologist as she might need oral antibiotics.

Where you Multi-drug resistant case or Extensively drug resistant case?As I see you are on 2nd line drugs for which I do not see any rationale until your history is clear. Normally patients must be started on Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol. If pulmonary TB 6 months treatment with follow up and for extra-pulmonary prolonged treatment upto 12-18 months. You are on Clarithromycin, Protionamide, Rifampicin , Isoniazid, moxifloxacin and Mucaine(antacids).

You have contracted viral infection of respiratory tract (It can be Rhinovirus, Influenza, Parainfluenza, RSV, adenovirus, etc)The antibiotics will not bring relief but only prevent secondary infections of the tract. So I suggest you continue with treatment. Sometimes antibiotics cause upset of GI tract so you can take a proton pump inhibitor and anti-spasmodic. Do saline gargles 6-8 times and steam inhalation.You can get few investigations done like blood culture for bacterial infection, gram stain of throat with culture & sensitivity to rule out Group B Streptococcus infection.

But the matter of concern is HBsAg reactivity I suggest you get the test repeated. In some cases it takes time for HBs Antibodies to appear late.So don't worry just be in touch with follow up with your physicians. Avoid marriage/immigration for some more time if you can as if your HBsAg is positive for more than 6 months then you might be a carrier and have risk of chronic infection.

Dietary deficiencies of certain nutrients like Iron, Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Folic acid, etc. which help in blood formation & nerve conduction.4.

Absolutely it is high time you start the treatment with first line anti-tubercular drugs isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide with pryridoxine. You may get registered if centers for treatment if provided in your country like DOTS in India where you get free treatment. You might have to undertake repeated aspirations for swelling if it persists and send sample for ZN staining and culture for AFB and sensitivity test for the same. There are special tests like Hains which can be ordered at that time for genotypic testing from aspirate.Yes this is infectious you need to take precautions and follow hygiene practices.

Try taking 800mg ibuprofen every 8 hours. Use ice packs on your heel frequently during the day.

Whoever enter the room before and after must strictly wash hand or use sanitizers. Masks on nose can also be used by everyone including patient. Do not spread large volumes of lysol all around.

The swollen lymph nodes can be due to part of ongoing infections or allergy.

If it is negative you can take oral cephalosporins. But another possibility which cannot be ruled out is that it may be tubercular lymphadenitis too. If above treatment fails go in for ultrasound guided biopsy of lymph nodes and get ZN microscopy/ culture for Mycobacterial infection and also culture for routine aerobic/anaerobic infection. The correct diagnosis is the remedy for you.Take care.

The best what can be advised is that her blood culture at regular intervals need to be drawn and sent for routine aerobic/anaerobic culture or automated Bactec/Phoenix system. Then according to the susceptibility results the drugs with less side effects can be given. Pro-calcitonin levels needs to be monitored regularly as it will help in prognosis. There is no drug as dancomycin but it is daptomycin which is given for complicated cases. All the best.

An infected Tick usually transmits the disease.   The concept of Chronic Lyme Disease is controversial, most modern medical centres in the world refuse its acceptance. If the symptoms persist after a comprehensive antibiotic treatment then disease is called Post Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome or PTLDS. Long term antibiotics is not recommended for PTLDS.  The symptoms you have mentioned are quite often seen in PTLDS.   I would recommend the following.1. Keep your treating physician informed of your symptoms. 2. Maintain a diary for symptoms, lifestyle habits, sleep, diet, excercise.3. Eat healthy balanced diet and have plenty of rest. Do not try supplements over the internet without consulting your doctor. 4. Get treatment symptomatic as and when needed. Hope I answered your queries. Thank you so much.

It is try that the medications you are on for your RA can suppress your immune function so it may take longer for you to clear infections than normal.

Should I be worried, and try and contact my doctor, or is this common after having such a serious surgery and recovery? I am a female; 47 years old; never sick other than sore throats etc.","Doctor":"Hello,I understand your concern.I am Dr. Arun Tank, infectious diseases specialist, answering your query.Slight tenderness after the surgery in groin area is common after such a large surgery.Consider it as a normal process. Gas in the stomach may be because of acidity. Taking the appropriate drugs for right time and right period can help you recover from the problem.You can take tab pantoprazole for the acidity. Taking it half hour before meal can help you reduce your gas.Diclofenac sodium can be taken for pain and tenderness.

After 3 days because of life cycle of these parasites .After 3 days fever get in blood for malarial parasite as well card test for malarial parasite .Whatever the result ,take chloroquine 600 mg base stat ,followed by 300 mg after 6 hour .Later on day 2&3 , single doses of 300 mg/day.After this take PRIMAQUINE 15 mg daily for 14 days and this is WHO recommended  radical treatment .Not forget to use pantoprazole-d and antacid .This is all about malaria .Now ,why fever , so beside malaria such type of fever may be due to , these possibilities ,these include. 1 Typhoid fever , get in blood for Widal test and serology test for diagnostic purposes.2 Urinary tract infection , diagnosis can  be confirmed by urine culture .3 Septicaemia chronic , get in blood culture for any chronic infection and also drug sensitivity test and whole thing will be clear.Since this is prescription , so consult a physician and get his help.Good luck.Anemia and drug fever are another reason of such fever."},{"Patient":"Sir I am having mouth ulcers.

A superficial wound resulted with not much blood. The dog was vaccinated 2 days before the bite and after 12 days am having a cold and slight headache. Wanted to know if its a result of rabies. I visited my physician and he said its not a major wound and was asked to clean it up, put some neosporin for infection and then bandage on it. The wound healed after about 6 days. Is it likely i have been infected","Doctor":"Hello,This is Dr. Papaqako answering your question.The early symptoms of rabies in people are similar to that of many other illnesses, including fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. As the disease progresses, more specific symptoms appear and may include insomnia, anxiety, confusion, slight or partial paralysis, excitation, hallucinations, agitation, hypersalivation (increase in saliva), difficulty swallowing, and hydrophobia (fear of water). Death usually occurs within days of the onset of these symptoms.Now after 12 days its less likely for you to have rabies, and more likely to have a common cold.  Rabies in humans is 100% preventable through prompt appropriate medical care. Decisions to start vaccination, known as post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), will be based on your type of exposure and the animal you were exposed to, as well as laboratory and surveillance information for the geographic area where the exposure occurred. Your doctor, for sure would have known is your area of living is an area that have cases of rabies and would have administered the vaccine.You should receive a tetanus shot if you have not been immunized in ten years.Hope this helps,Take care."},{"Patient":"when i checked up my blood they said tpha+ , doctor told me that bring vdrl report they give RPR=nr, and doctor told me that \\" if one time tpha positive in life it will be positive he no active disease no treatment necessary . i would like to go work abroad so they unfit me medical    . is it possible to make tpha negative by using any medicine","Doctor":"HelloSince you are TREPONEMAL TEST i.e. TPHA is positive .

I came down with a high fever (103.5) on friday. I have a history of UTI s, kidney infections and kidney stones twice. I went to the doctor again no Saturday and they agreed that I probably have a kidney infection as the symptoms at the time were similar to my previous episodes. They did not confirm the kidney infection with bloodwork however. They just figured that I knew well enough. They prescribed cefuroxime for me. Since Saturday I am still running a fever which I have kept down to about 100 - 101 with ibuprophen and tylenol. Now I think that it may be something else. I am not having the lower back pain that I usually have with kidney infections. I am having a lot of abdominal pressure in the front and my back is soar up closer to my shoulder blades. I have never had indegestion but if I had to guess it feels like this. I cannot lie down flat comfortably. Sometimes it feels like when I lay on my right side that my guts are being twisted on the left. I also started my period on Saturday. I also have a massive headache that despite all of the medicine has persisted for 2 days now accompanied by lightheadedness.","Doctor":"HelloYou are taking ibuprofen and tylenol  frequently for high grade fever ,so these two tablets may be the possibility of pain in the front or abdomen and also intestinal upset ( as you mentioned in the query ).Fever is high grade and you are also having intense headache and lightheadedness .Such type of fever may be due to UTI , but you didn't get urine and blood test ,so please get in these tests .Also get in serum creatinine and blood urea with ultrasound of both kidneys . Since this time ,  no doubt symptoms don't simulate like UTI but you are an old case of kidney infection so we should not forget this thing . 2 Flu or  upper respiratory infection may be the  other possibility of such symptoms . So consult another physician and get his opinion ( 2nd ) . Since you are taking cefuroxime and this is not effective because still you are having fever, so 2nd opinion is important.3 Malaria is another reason of such high fever . Get in blood for malarial parasite .However , there are so many other reasons of such fever , like dengue , typhoid but physical examination and 2nd opinion is important.Good luck."},{"Patient":"good day!! help,,,,,  what should i do to become a non reactive hbsag? cuz i found out recently when i was an initial medical to  work abroad,, does a interferon an alinia (nitazoxanide) can help me out?plerase do help me an give a quick advise for my remedies to ease this reactive hbsag?","Doctor":"Brief:You can get negative but will take timeDetailed:HelloThank You for contacting HCM.Welcome to Health Care Magic.My name is Dr Muhammad Ahmad & i will look into your problem.I have gone through your query and would try to help you in the best possible way.

We come across many patients like you on daily basis who say that before they cough there is sharp pinch at the back of their throat like a needle has been pricked in it and they have to drink water to get it relieved but when it happened in a mall in a meeting or during a fast for muslims specially it creates a hell for them as they can't drink.                       In my opinion you are having same issue but one thing in all those patients is common,they have acid reflux,or heart burn issues with them 90% face heart burn sooner or later on daily basis or occasionally so sir here are my suggestions for you.      Suggestion:                      1- Control your heart burn                       2-Take omeprazole 40md daily in night                       3- Keep a bottle of water at your bed side in night.                        4- a spoon of honey mixed in warm milk before bed anf before office helps                        5- avoid spicy food.Trials have proved that for this kind of cough a cough syrup has no benefit so i am not recommending you one ...have two three candies and centre filled gums in your pocket always during meetings and they have helped many of my patients ....                       When you swallow water saliva or juice from gum try to pass it over the needle pinch area and it will be a relief..Hope this answers your question.

First thing , if you TPHA is positive it is sure that you are having or had syphilis and hence going on treatment was the right decision.    But repeating the same TPHA test to know whether your syphilis has been cured or not is a wrong advise as TPHA once becomes positive remains positive whole life inspite of a successful treatment .

Many people with lupus are sensitive to light, with fair-skinned people tending to be more sensitive.-Fever.-Changes in weight.-Swollen glands.-Headaches.-Raynaud's phenomenon: Some people with lupus have Raynaud's phenomenon. It affects the small vessels that supply blood to the skin and the soft tissues under the skin of the fingers and toes. It causes them to turn white and/or blue or red. The skin affected will feel numb, tingly, and cold to the touch.-Hair loss:This hair loss usually isn't permanent.Inflammation of blood vessels in the skin (cutaneous vasculitis): Inflammation or bleeding from the blood vessels can lead to small or large blue spots or small reddish spots on the skin or nails. COMPLICATIONS: include 1-Nervous system2-Heart2-Lung problems.Conclusion:-It doesn't seem to be lupus-If you are still  suspicious Talk to your doctor and get yourself tested for lupus.-Some some topical anti allergic it may work-keep them area Dry.Hope this answers your question.

It did not stop bleeding completely for about 4 days and I kept changing the bandage and putting on neosporin.  I then removed the bandage and cleaned the would with peroxide a couple of times a day for three days because the flap of skin was yellowish and the redness around the wound seemed to be growing, but there were no streaks indicate blood poinsoning.  I noticed today the entire thing is very black and the red is still there around and it appears there is peeling along the edges of the wound.  There is no pus or fever.

It does not hurt any more and any other scabs I have had that have not dropped off.","Doctor":"Hello,This is Dr. Papaqako answering your question.Thanks for posting on HCM.--The black color is sign of dead cells, and it will need to fall off soon. --The red around the wound means that it is healing in the surroundings (and that is good), but the black center do not allow the healing process. The peroxide its true that kills the germs, but also kills the normal cells, those that are trying to regenerate, and keeps the would dry. It is maybe the cause of the black area.Yes it is healing. But, if I was your caring doctor, I would also recommend to help the healing:a) Do not use anymore peroxide. Continue using instead the neosporin, or vaseline, so something to keep the wound hydrated/soft.b) Do not try to remove the black area, but for the wound to heal completely i will need to fall off. By keeping the wound hydrated, you will help the process of making it fall of dissolve.c) If it gets pus, or more painful/swollen/red then you have to have a doctor check it, because that is a sign that it is getting infected, and he may need to give some help with removing the black area.Hope this helps,Take care."},{"Patient":"Good afternoon, I m a senior high school student at Marietta High School taking Anatomy and I am implementing a research on Tuberculosis.

Now , the answer of your question:TB spreads from person to person through the air by droplet nuclei containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis .After inhalation , infectious droplet nuclei may reach respiratory bronchioles or alveoli.Depending on bacterial virulence and the INHERENT HOST DEFENSE mechanisms of the alveolar macrophages, infection may be established and replication may ensue.The tubercle bacillus grows slowly , dividing every 25 to 32 hours within macrophages.Intially , there is no host resistance  until a sufficient number of organisms are produced 2 12 weeks  ( AND HOST REMAINS ASYMPTOMATIC ,  this is the answer of your question and this is a very helpful in the treatment  for TB in next 50 years).If within this duration the immunity or defense of host ( macrophages ) become able to kill Myco then host will not suffers with TB.However , this is a short study but it is not possible here to write down in detail.Hope this will be useful for you .Good luck."},{"Patient":"hivhi about june 18 I had sex with a prostitute and on november 12 I did and HIV test it came back negative.  now like 2 weeks after the test I got swollen glands a mild fever a pinch nerve .

The fever started Sunday afternoon and spiked to 104 by nighttime. today is Wednesday and with Motrin and Tylenol the fever has only gone down to 100. He has muscle pains all over the body including his neck most recently. Today he has a slight cough and says its a little hard to breathe thru his mouth? I am a pharmacist and should know better not to read every detail on line, but when I read meningitis, encephalitis or pericarditis I am very concerned that maybe I should take him to the hospital? Is it normal for the high fever to last for so many days? Help :( concerned mom. THANK YOU","Doctor":"Hi,It seems from the history that your child has not gone through some important investigations Eg..C.B.C,stool test to confirm it was entrovirus infection.As for  now your child has got cough and difficulty in  breathing with spike of fever.If I would have wanted to evaluate the cause of these symptoms,I would suggest chest X-ray and sputum test first to rule out any bacterial or viral chest infection.As any infection can cause bodyache, or muscle pain. Meningitis or encephlitis are inflamation in brain membranes and brain i self respectively ,you should think about it when your child gets seizure,neck siffness,confusion ,paralysis or any other sign which is related to brain infection.So be relax and you discuss further with your doctor after above mentioned investigations.Regards,Dr.Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"i had a vaccination for meningitis around 3 days ago and ever since it has been sore when touched or when it has been in contact with anything and it has also a big red circle around the where the needle went in and also a big numb on it is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM and thank you for your queryIt is usual to have a local reaction at the site of meningitis vaccination.These usually last 2 or 3 days. If it persists longer or if there is fever, then there is a possibility of an infection at the site of vaccination. Check with your health care provider.Serious side effects are rare and can include high fever, weakness, and changes in behavior.Take CareDr Noble Zachariah"},{"Patient":"Hi there, my Husband works an opposite shift from another employee who has been hospitalized with swine flu. He does not work with him, but has used the same shower to clean up after his shift. If my Husband has been exposed , will getting a flu shot now do any good? This guy has been in the hospital all week and just now got diagnosed.Thank you","Doctor":"Brief:Low chances of infection but better get vaccinated.Detailed:Hi it's Dr.Muhammad Ahmad i have carefully read you question and will try to answer in detail.In thin changes of your husband catching the flu are rare but i will help you understand how it spreads...it spreads between humans when infected people cough or sneeze,other people breathe in the virus or touch something with the virus on it and then touch their own face.(so a towel or a tap used by that infected man can be a source in your husband's case) he should Avoid touching his eyes, nose or mouth after shower . Germs spread this way.\\"He should wash his hand thoroughly back at home after reaching back from work.This flue doesn't spread through food or pork in food.The swine flu in humans is most contagious during the first five days of the illness,(so if that other person has been treated already then chances of infecting others further drop) although some people, most commonly children, can remain contagious for up to ten days.Conclusion: Get Him vaccinated                   Take precautions as i told you like frequent washing of hands with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand sanitizers, especially after being at a place where the patient worked. Chance of transmission is also reduced by disinfecting workplace surfaces, which can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach solution.(this can be suggested to owners)It can spread in coughs or sneezes, but an increasing body of evidence shows small droplets containing the virus can linger on tabletops, telephones and other surfaces and be transferred via the fingers to the eyes, nose or mouth.Social distancing, another tactic, is staying away from other people who might be infected.Hope that Answered your Query . Wish you and your husband lasting health."},{"Patient":"My father had back surgery in july and 2 weeks later he was put in the hospital for a staph infection.

In My opinion the pain and symptoms he has are not suggestive of a complication or an ongoing staph infection unless there is high grade fever general body aches shivering loss of appetite skin rashes or related symptoms of which you mentioned nothing.      So My opinion this issue relates to your father's back, may be the surgery didn't cure what it should have or may be a new things has appeared.If i were your doctor after ruling out staph infection (as you are concerned about it) through blood work and culture i would have put all my focus on his orthopedic issues,if its a structure touching his nerve or a disc compressing on or is it neuralgia of some sort or a muscular pain, For that these days we have got so many state of the art diagnostic modalitieslike MRI     Dopplers     Nerve conduction studies     Radio graphs     Ct scans      Bone tagging      and much more    WHAT TO DO NOW:(1) Talk to the doctor who operated/Orthopedic consult:                 i would suggest you to discuss all the options with your doctor specially the one who operated on him ,if there is any complication of surgery or the surgery didn't work or is there any new problem arising , an Orthopedic consult and diagnosis seems to be the key in this problem.(2) Pain clinic: There are specialized pain clinics which can use different methods to relieve pain these clinics can be found specially in association with cancer hospitals and clinics.And here again i will say that Pain can be managed better if diagnosis is made.(3) Support you father mentally dont let him lose hope(4)Physiotherapy: This also is a very developed science these days and can help patients in re-hab.CONCLUSION: A good diagnosis first.Hope I have answered your query.

However, I believe my boyfriend of 3 years has the HPV1 virus. Prior to being with him I never had an abnormal pap. I m wondering if my abnormal pap was a result of him giving me the virus. He continues to get cold sores on the outside of his mouth. They look like the images on google for HPV1 herpes virus.

My concern is I most likely have it now and does this mean he will keep giving the virus to me and I will have abnormal paps again?

WHAT CAN MAKE THIS GO AWAY ASAP?","Doctor":"It sounds like you are developing a cellulitis, which is an infection within the skin. This can be particularly dangerous if it is near the eye. You most likely need strong antibiotics to get control of this right away. Go to emergency or urgent care and get this looked at by a doctor promptly. If there is an actual abscess there, it also may be necessary to drain it. Antibiotics won't be enough by themselves. So get seen right away and get it taken care of.

Can I use calamine lotion on them to help the itch?","Doctor":"Calamine lotion may be soothing. Talk to his pediatrician about something oral to help with the itching, such as Benadryl. You may have to put the lotion on with mittens on so he doesn't keep rubbing his hands raw. There is also the risk of a secondary infection with bacteria if he continues doing that. Your pediatrician may also have other suggestions, such as a topical medicine that may numb up the rash a bit, so talk to him or her. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have a genital boil that will not heal. I finished a round of antibiotics a week ago and have been soaking in hot water 3x a day and putting bactriban on it after for about three weeks now. I can t really put a bandaid on it because of where it s located. It s not really big anymore, it s almost flat but the very small hole that the pus is coming out won t close. I don t feel very confident about going back to the doctor but I don t think treating it on my own is working either. This has been a 2 month ordeal total and I can t take it anymore.","Doctor":"You need to have this re-evaluated, perhaps by a different doctor. A boil should have cleared up by 2 months, so something else is going on, or more definitive treatment needs to be done. Sometimes this requires opening the boil and really cleaning it out. It sounds like the infection is still in there since pus is still coming out, and in fact if the hole did close up the pus would just accumulate and cause another boil. My guess is you need a minor surgical procedure at this point to be sure all the infection is cleared out. This can be done in the emergency room or urgent care.

They do not necessarily indicate the foot is infected. If there were an infection in the foot, he would experiencing local symptoms there, such as redness, swelling, heat and pain. You should let the surgeon know about the fevers and chills. S/he may want to take a look to be sure it's not the foot.

This could be due to an infection or to many other causes. The inflammatory process and the change in ESR could be due to the infection and would occur regardless of antibiotic treatment- it is part of the body's response to the infection. If the infection clears up with treatment, the inflammatory process will start to clear up, but signs of it such as the ESR may take some time to return to normal. The ESR is not useful for following the course of an infection. Again, it may also be due to an entirely different condition from the infection, such as arthritis, lupus, response to injuries, etc etc. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"THREE DAYS AGO, I WAS STUNG/BIT BY A RATHER LARGE BLACK ANT....THE BITE IS A LIGHT RED COLOR AND RAISED AND ABOUT 8ML ROUND..I USED CLAMINE..BENEDRYL CREAN AND YESTERDAY STARTED DOMEBORO SOAKS...STILL THERE AND RAISED AS IF IT HAS SOMETHING INSIDE..SHOULD I SEE A DOC?

(1) Serology(blood tests)       (2) Urea Breath test using C13 and C14-Urea       (3) Faecal Antigen test .       In the end i just want to mention that endoscopic biopsy is indeed the Gold standard to finding out diagnosis or cure of H-Pylori but its hard for the patent to bear so it can be discussed with your physician to use alternate tests which may be less accurate but can be good enough to avoid endoscopy.Application of these tests are limited in different cases and that has to be discussed with your physician, with which option he wants to go in your particular case....Hope I have answered your query.

However, metabolic problems (e.g.diabetes) should be ruled out through blood tests (fasting blood glucose test, hormonal balance).

If it was not severe it is probably unlikely. It would depend on how contaminated the cans were. Clean the area well and keep an eye on it the next couple of days.

Montek-LC consists of monteleukast and levocetrizine.It does have some side effects like headache,dizziness,heartburn,upset stomach,tiredness,stomach pain,tooth pain and stuffy nose.New drugs have evolved which can counteract these side effects with ease.So, I advice drugs like Third generation antihistaminics like levocetrizine,olopatadine which are relatively very free of side effects and are more patient friendly.Since urticaria in your case is more than 6 weeks duration,it is usually termed as Chronic urticaria,which also requires low dose steroids for improved outcome; Ex-hydrocortisone for short period of time,when used on intermittent basis,can dramatically control symptoms of itching and rash by reducing the causative inflammation and bring you prompt relief.Hope you are happy with the answer.Thank you"},{"Patient":"I took hepatitis B vaccine abt 7 yrs back.Now in a blood test my HbsAg level s borderline.What does it indicate?The doctor said it can be false/pseudo positive and i have 2 check again.Pls help me.Can i also know how does syphilis spread other than sexual methods??Does it spread from using public toilets?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCMThanks for posting your query in HCM.As your Hbsag levels are borderline it is probably false postive result.So,i would advice you to repeat the test once again in different lab for confirmation of the diagnosis.The most common way to get syphilis is by having sexual contact with an infected person.It cannot get transmitted  from sharing food or utensils, or from using tubs, pools, or toilets.Syphilis can be passed from mother to infant during pregnancy, causing a disease called congenital syphilis.Hope you are happy with the answer.Thank you"},{"Patient":"Hi, I m a pregnant women who recently found out that I had an yeast infection, they gave me a pill and I finally feel better.

It has been an on again off again diagnosis. I have definite CSm but this has been known for over 20 years now. My symptoms leading to ALS have started the past 3 yrs.. Recently a neurosurgeon has said that additional surgery would not help. Help please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Doctor":"Hi,   Thank you for using HCM. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),  is a progressive neuromuscular disease that weakens and eventually destroys motor neurons (components of the nervous system that connect the brain with the skeletal muscles). Treatment is only palliative and there is no cure for ALS. Supportive treatment is given to relieve pain and improve the quality of life. Treatment is based on individual therapy and  continuous adaptation of medications. Suggested treatment for ALS include :1. Riluzole (Rilutek) : it is one of the drugs that has been proved to be effective against ALS and it may prevent progression of disease and prolong life for a few months or so. 2. Baclofen (Lioresol) or tizanadine (Zanaflex) may be given to relieve spasticity.3. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen can be given to reduce discomfort.4. Tramadol (Ultram) for pain relief.5. Physiotherapy is an important part of treatment and helps to relieve cramping and muscular pain. Passive stretching helps to avoid permanent contraction of muscles (contractures) that may cause joint problems.    Other therapies, such as occupational therapy and speech therapy, are also used in treatment. ALS patients require a diet of high-energy foods that are easy to swallow.If the patient is not able to take enough orally, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), or feeding tube, is usually inserted. This has been shown to prolong life in ALS patients who are losing weight.Some ALS patients may also need pulmonary consultants and respiratory therapists to assist breathing. Depression is very common among ALS patients. Hence antidepressant medication and counseling can help patients and their families cope.However, all the above treatment should be started only with the advise of the consultants."},{"Patient":"I had an injury to my left hand.

It is unlikely for Typhoid fever to cause low platelet but sometimes typhoid fever co-exists with Viral fever and in that case Platelet count can be low . So I advise you to get IgM Typhi Dot to check for Typhoid fever .     I also advise to get Urine routine test. Repeat platelet count everyday till it reaches normal value.

In a very small percentage of patients that have Hashimoto's antibody the thyroid becomes overactive. But this is very rare and I must say that we rarely see it. I can say that your symptoms (Pain,excessive tiredness,profuse sweating,palpitations,anxiety and irritability ) are very indicative for Hyperthyroidism. It would be helpful if you send me a copy of your blood test report so I can evaluate the results and to know which tests you have already done. A diagnosis of Hyperthyroidism Can be confirmed with blood tests that measure the levels of thyroxine and TSH in your blood. High levels of thyroxine and low or nonexistent amounts of TSH indicate an overactive thyroid.Thank you."},{"Patient":"I'm sneezing every morning and then sometimes I have sneeze attacks that just comes on suddenly.

Many allergies do not show up on the allergy panel. Moreover the thing that you are allergic to can be different from what you were tested with. So try to find what it is that you are using like bedsheets, or pillow covers, curtains, or room fresheners. It could be anything.

Several antibiotics are effective in the treatment of typhoid fever. Chloramphenicol was the original drug of choice for many years. Because of rare serious side effects, Chloramphenicol has been replaced by other effective antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin and Ceftriaxone IV injections are the commonly used antibiotics. In children usually Ceftriaxone is advised. The choice of antibiotics also depends on the geographic region where the infection was contracted. For example some strains from South America show a significant resistance to some antibiotics. In cases of relapses, patients are retreated with antibiotics. In addition IV fluids and electrolyes are  given to prevent the dehydration that results from a prolonged fever and diarrhea.Nonbulky, high-calorie meals can help replace the nutrients you lose when you're sick.Vaccines against typhoid fever are available, but they're only partially effective.

The last time was a few days ago, but the window in the house i was in was open, and I have had two other red bite like marks on my arms and underarm since that day also. I have three under the skin red spots near and around my clitoris and they are very itchy, along with a slightly less itchy vagina, but these lumps are soothed by sudocream. This occurred on my genitals a day after shaving, but I have never had bumps like before, although i am prone to shaving rash. i was just wondering if this sounds like genital herpes and also how long symptoms take to first appear? Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for your question. I have read your description of the problem. It could be bug bites or irritation from shaving but I will give you a description of herpes so you can see if this fits. If you are exposed to herpes it usually takes 2-7 days for the symptoms to appear. The herpes rash is small blisters and they are very painful. The pain is often described as burning pain. If you do not have pain it is probably not herpes. I hope this is helpful."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor..

After going through your medical details I understand your concern. first, with arterial blood pressures of 170/102mmHg your brother has uncontrolled arterial hypertension.

The drop in Blood pressure with an increase in heart rate, with \\"tunnel vision\\" suggests that it is more likely to be dizziness or syncope, rather than vertigo. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a condition in which a change from lying to standing causes an abnormally large increase in heart rate. This occurs with symptoms that may include lightheadedness, trouble thinking, blurry vision, or weakness. but studies are needed to establish the diagnosis.
