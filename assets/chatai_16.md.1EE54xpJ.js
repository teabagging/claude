It is difficult for a women to know exact date of ovulation and signs of ovulation are not experienced by many women. Here are few signs of ovulation1. During ovulation, the cervical mucus increases in volume and becomes thicker due to increased estrogen levels. It is often said that the cervical mucus resembles egg whites at a woman's most fertile point.2.Ovulation may also lead to a 0.4 to 1.0 degree increase in basal body temperature, but difficult to determine this rise3.Finally, ovulation predictor kits are available from drug stores (like i sure) that are able to detect the increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine just before ovulation.Most of the women who have regular cycles ovulate, but if you think that you are going through cycles without ovulation then its better to consult a gynecologist and she/he may suggest you a scan.A women said to be Infertile if she fails to become pregnant after 1 year of unprotected sexual intercourse, I suggest you to eat nutritious diet, Take Tab ovacare 0-1-0 for 3 months (it contains nutriernts which helps in ovulation) and observe for 3 months, if you fail to conceive its time to consult an expert.

The delay in period is most likely due to the hypothyroidism. So also the weight gain. Please get your thyroid levels checked and adjust the dose of medicine for thyroid if needed. If the thyroid is Ok other reasons may be pregnancy, imbalance in other hormones like prolactin, FSH, LH, and ovarian cysts. Stress and severe exercise also delay periods. So get these evaluated if thyroid is ok.Do not worry. Once the cause is found treatment will help you out of the condition.

It lacks the total quantity of the ejaculate, liquefaction time, viscosity, color and total sperm count etc. Regarding the total cellular count whether it is white blood cells or something else was not mentioned. How many days abstinence was observed before collection of semen. That is also very important.With the available data, if the rapid progressive motility of the sperm is more than 60%, it will be a good quality one to make you conceive earlier. Similarly the normal sperms must be 70-80% and not less than that.By a detailed examination of your husband and with other investigations we can find the reasons for this mild defects.Repeat the semen examination in another good laboratory with 3-4 days of abstinence.

As you describe both of you are perfect in the tests of gynecologist,you need not have this treatment. But if 3 years passed after the marriage,most of the doctors use this treatment.                    Menogon is a purified combination of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. to induce ovulation and enable pregnancy in women.                   In women, HCG is used together with other hormones called follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) in the treatment of infertility.                   So there is every possibility of getting pregnant. it needs per vaginal ultra sound scanning at the time of expected ovulation, to see there is maturation of the follicles, and ovulation.                   If you don't get pregnant in the first time,you may become pregnant you will become pregnant in the second cycle.

Emergency contraceptive pills will have high dose of hormones compared with regular contraceptive pills. Repeated usage of emergency contraceptive pills can lead to problems like hormonal imbalance, menstrual irregularity etc.For more details :   The usual recommend gap between two emergency pills is two months. As you are not having menstrual irregularity, there may not be any problem for fertility. As you have used the pills for longer period, better to avoid emergency pills from nowonwards. You once go for ultrasound to check the uterine size, endometrial thickness, ovaries etc. Then track the ovulation in next cycle and plan intercourse around that period.

Please comment.","Doctor":"Hi, There are several possible reasons for feeling dizziness with anti-hypertensives, and with diabetes and hypertension. Most Anti-hypertensives can cause a lowering of blood pressure. This lower blood pressure may reduce the amount of blood flow to the brain. When this happens, it is possible for one to feel dizzy and suffer headaches. Along with this, it is possible for one to develop headaches and drowsiness as a side effect of any medication. Another reason for a headache may be an excessive lowering of blood glucose levels with medication. This happens when the glucose-lowering drug one uses reduces the glucose to less than 80 mg/dL and this causes both headaches and the dizziness. Low blood sugar also causes one to feel sleepy. It would be best to talk to your regular doctor about changing your dosage or to monitor the glucose levels and the blood pressure better to prevent any symptoms. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Vignan Rachabattuni, General & Family Physician"},{"Patient":"My blood pressure has been low ever since i'v had my first child.

I am so sorry to hear about this absent cardiac activity on the ultrasound. Every other finding indicates that the p[regnancy in increasing in size and the gestational hormone titer strongly suggest this. I will suggest that you get a repeat ultrasound iin 4weeks to control this again. if there are no signs of a cardiac ativity, then other possible causes of gestational tissue without fetal activity like molar pregnancy should be considered. Do you have exagerrted nausea and vomiting? These could be suggestive and if the titers are rising higher than expected for age, this should be strongly considered.

Pls, what can I do to be totally free of this disease and to get pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM,You have two different problems. To prevent Candida infection, you have to prevent heat and moisture ( wettiness) in your vagina. To do this, you should avoid wearing synthetic panty, and G strings. Avoid any chemicals in vagina, like bubble bath, foam bath, vaginal douching, antiseptic solution etc. You must avoid tampoons, or any foreign body in your vagina. You have to take best hygienic measure during menstruation and before and after intercourse. you have to rule out Diabetes. If you are taking any antibiotics, you must use Flora tablets. Rule out any other associated infections. Avoid i even protected intercourse until you completely get rid of Candidiasis. Make sure that your partner also gets checked and treated. Usually Candidiasis is not a STI, but when you are getting it recurrently, better to treat him also.  Some Candida species are resistant to usual antifungal tablets, so you may need to get either long course of the same tablets, or your doctor will choose the best one from the available antifungal medications. Once you are cleared of infection, then you should try for pregnancy. For Infertility, there is a full work out, and you have to be in constant touch of your Doctor.Best wishes.Dr Hamdani"},{"Patient":"hello i am 34yr old and have a 15 yr child i have only been pregnant 1 time and have been tryn to become pregnant for the last 2rys my MD just gave me a rx of clomiphene 50mg that i just started as of 11/24/13 i do have 1 fibroid but its only the size of a very small marbel but what concerns my is that i have been on my cycel for over 20 days will this rx still work and will it help stop my cycel","Doctor":"Hi,Your age is more.

This is an arranged marriage and his second marriage. When he failed many times after marriage, I tried a lot to understand him but all in vain. Sometimes he told me that he is 30, not 20 years old and sexual urge in men decrease with age. At other times, he told me that he is tired or I shouldn t ask him for anything. He cannot perform when asked, so i shouldnt try to arouse him or touch his private parts. Everything went in vain, i cried and he shouted at me telling me that my sexual urge is very high. He even abused me verbally. I gave it back to him asking him to take medicine or I will have to go out of marriage. Very reluctantly, he tried medicine and was able to perform only in 50% of occasions during his sleep. Through medication and persistance, I managed to concieve and delivered a baby. Our marriage is only 15 months old now and we have a 1 month baby. Since I have concieved, he never approached me for sex. He doesnt even talk about sex and keep on running away from this topic. I am only 30 years old and so is he. His old divorce was mutual but it has come to my knowledge now that in his first 6 years of marriage, he never attempted sex and that was the reason why she committed adultry after 6 years for which he left her. I am asking him the reason for non performance, and he is providing me some false reasons like he never lived with ex for a long time. I had to call her ex and she tells me that for all 6 years, she was staying with him under the same roof but he never approached her for sex. She used to cry every night but he ignored and never attended her even emotionally. Also, i have discovered that he got optical internal urethrotomy done just 5 months before our marriage which i never knew earlier. I have a question on my future sex life with my husband. He is not available physically or emotionally driven by himself and dont make me feel like a woman. I am already feeling burdened because he cheated me but thinking about the baby, I want to understand his mind. He never shares anything with me, his regular routine involves spending 10 hours in office and sleeping off with dinner and TV in the night. When i ask him about his problem, he becomes agitated and fights with me. After the delivery of the baby, he tells me that he is normal and this is very common behaviour in indian men. He refuses to get treated and considers it a public humiliation to visit a doctor. It has made me so frustated that recently, i abused him back once on phone and he recorded that. Now, he is using that to threaten me of divorce on gounds of cruelity. I am feeling extremely depressed and I am worried that he might even hurt the baby if he can threaten me of divorce instead of feeling happy for the birth of the baby.

Uterine cavity is spacious means size of uterine cavity is slightly increased than the normal. Irregular contour again means that he wall of uterine cavity is not smooth as in case of normal uterus. This again could be due to infection or endometriosis.

You can try Gonadotropin injection for infertility.Because you have already tried and failed by using UROFOLLITROPHIN (folliova).You can also try Clomiphene In women who do not ovulate, clomiphene, rather than gonadotropins, is often recommended as an initial treatment.The advantages of clomiphene compared to gonadotropins include 1. Ease of oral administration2. Fewer side effects3. Lower cost (of the medication itself, as well as the monitoring)4. Lower risk of multiple pregnancies, and reduced time commitment (related to monitoring during treatment).But Gonodotropin is given by injection.Early in the menstrual cycle, FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) is given by injection 12 days for maturation of follicles.Once the follicle is matured as seen by serial ultrasound.One dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) will be given to stimulate ovulation.Side effects are more common and more serious with gonadotropin treatment.Please consider Clomiphene and compare both.Consult with your Gynecologist regarding this for further management of your infertility.Hope this helps.Please reply for further queries.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"I took naddol (40mg) daily for years for rapid heart rate and hypertension.

If value is above 1500-2000mIU/mL & pregnancy not visible in uterus, its most likely ectopic pregnancy & you need to follow your doctor's advise. If value is less than 1500mIU/mL, you can wait in consultation with your doctor for the pregnancy to be visible in scan. All this applies only if your condition is stable & ectopic pregnancy is not visualized in scan. If its otherwise (unstable haemodynamic condition/pregnancy seen on scan to be outside uterus) its better to follow your doctor's advice. In any case your doctor is best judge as he is personally examining you & seeing scan reports & can better judge condition than the one who is consulting online.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"I have a intramural fibroid that's about 3.5 cm according to my last ultrasound.

Endometrial tuberculosis is a notorious condition as far as conception is concerned. Of course, in these days of modern medicine any type of problem is treatable.

When I reached 25 years old I got married and decided to have a baby..but for few months  we got no luck and we seek for a help from a local doctor. I was diagnosed that I have PCOS..My menstruation is very irregular. My BMI is just normal but was advised by my doctor to reduce my weight. I was given few tablets like utrogestan‚ ova-mit clomifene‚ metformin‚ folic acid and vit.b12..I just finished my 2nd cycle of ovamit and I failed to get pregnant. For the 3rd cycle I did not take utrogestan hoping that my cycle will now follow the exact date but sad to say it didn't. My last period was on July 25‚2013 but until now I do not have my menstruation. Pregnancy tests every week but negative results.I feel tired most of the times. Light headed and headaches. Do I need to take utrogestan again to induce my menstruation? do I still have the chance to get pregnant? i hope to hear from you at your earliest convenience. thank you very much and God bless.","Doctor":"Polycystic ovary is a condition in women that can lead to difficulty with menstrual irregularity, infertility, blood sugar control, weight management and increased body hair growth. Many women need to use a medication like utrogestan to induce their menstrual period. If women go without their menses for long periods of time, they have a higher risk of uterine cancer. Taking a medication to induce menstruation is helpful for knowing when to start clomiphene on months that pregnancy is attempted. Clomiphene is used to help women ovulate, and this can be a problem in PCOS, leading to the irregular menstrual periods. The good news is that with proper treatment, the fertility rate for women with PCOS is approximately 80% if no other factors are involved. Metformin helps regulate blood sugar in women with PCOS, helps regulate menstrual cycles, and actually improves fertility as well. I hope this answers your question. I am available for further consultation if needed."},{"Patient":"Sir,my wife has been suggested by doctor for HT (?) on D-09/10 of next cycle.

After that, my doctor give me progynova 2 times a day as my endometrium is thin  only 0.46 cm, intact isoechoic. Two days after, my doctor instructed me to have TVS on my day 14, with results of 0.57cm, thin, my endometrium and my follicle F1 measured as 2.55 x 2.03 cm. Then, i came back to my OB with the results. She said it is time to do the iui a day after the injection of prygnil for ovulation. After 24 hours, IUI was performed. She instructed me to have 30 minutes rest before I am going home. She give a duphaston 30 tablets good for 15 days and taking those tablet twice a day. I started taking duphaston after 2 days iui.

Your question is , is it possible to get pregnant?Yes, you can get pregnancy.Ovulation  date was 9-10 August ,so now if ovum fertilized i.e.pregnancy , you can test blood for Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (HCG) ,level should be 300-500 ng/dL,if pregnancy.

Your husband's sperm count is low .Normal fertility is associated with sperm count of >48 million /mL.Endometrium thick of uterus is also below than normal. In my opinion consult one more infertility specialist and get his opinion.

It is thought to be one of the leading causes of female sub-fertility and the most frequent endocrine problem in women of reproductive age.The principal features are anovulation, resulting in irregular menstruation, amenorrhea, ovulation-related infertility, and polycystic ovaries; excessive amounts or effects of androgenic (masculinizing) hormones, resulting in acne and hirsutism; and insulin resistance, often associated with obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol levels.The symptoms and severity of the syndrome vary greatly among affected women.In PCOS, there is a so-called \\"follicular arrest\\", i.e., several follicles develop to a size of 5–7 mm, but not further. No single follicle reaches the preovulatory size (16 mm or more) but you have 16 mm or more, so do not get tensed.Every cycle can not be the same, due to many physiological and hormonal effects, so keep patience and continue on treatment.So keep in touch with your gynecologist for continuation of the treatment and monitoring.Regards,Dr. Naresh Jain."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor i am under treatment for conceive.

Whether your husband abstain from sex at least 3 days prior to seminal collection. It should not be more than 7 days. Then only the results will be more reliable.As per the present result, the motility of the sperms are not adequate to make you pregnant,and regarding the morphology, more than 70-80% normal sperms constitutes a good quality of semen. It may be due either infection in the reproductive tract or may be due to varicocele etc. Physical examination and presence of pus cells will confirm the cause.You have to ascertain whether your ovulation is regular following the treatment for PCOD.

This could explain the foggy vision and shaky hands. Are you taking any anti-hypertensive drugs actually? In such case, I would recommend not to take them until your blood pressure values with be back normal. I would recommend having some rest and taking plenty of water to stay hydrated. Regarding these frequent episodes, a cardiac arrhythmia can not be excluded either. I would also recommend performing some tests:  - an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring- a Head Up Tilt test for orthostatic hypotension- blood electrolytes- complete blood count for anemia. You should discuss with your attending physician on the above tests. Hope to have been helpful!Wishing good health, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 34 yrs old with two children.

If it will take multiple tries at IUI, I would prefer the reversal.","Doctor":"Hello,The semen count of your husband was 100% OK. But associated factors like motility, morphology are important. If the other factors are OK the count is viable enough. I assume that the tubal reversal you mean is vasectomy reversal. The success rate of vasectomy reversal depends upon the age and the sperm count and motility analysis done during the procedure. Usually the success rate is reasonably high for an individual with a normal count and motility. If your husband's semen was stored before vasectomy surgery, IVF is the only option.The IUI is of your choice.Best wishes"},{"Patient":"gud nun sir.i am saravanan from erode.i got married on 31.5.2012.my wife is not conceived.my wife have a irregular periods and my sperm count is also low.we consult a doctor for last nine months.if we have a chance to make a baby and what kind of treatment will be take for our problems and one more thing in my sleep i lost my sperms automatically but we have a intercourse regularly.kindly clear my doubt sir","Doctor":"DEAR SIR/MADAMIRREGULAR PERIODS??

As such, your chances of conception are almost nil in this cycle. Follicles usually rupture when they are about 18 mm.

For which you are using Ovafar, a drug which has no proven efficiency. You have not revealed about your menstrual history (regular or irregular) and any USG scans report done to assess the uterus and ovum. Considering everything is normal, except the follicle size the drug of choice will be Clomifene 50 mg from the 2nd or 5th day of your menstruation for 5 days and doing a follicular study from the 9th or 10th day of your period.

My new partner and I had been trying to conceive for some time back in 2008... after fertility testing we discovered that I had possible PCOS and my partner had low motility sperm .

We were both cigarette smokers years ago, though we both quit (I quit in 2009 while my partner quit in 2010). We had unprotected sex on New Year s Eve this year and I had a very short menstruation (only 1 day normal flow, second day was only spotting) on January 18th. I am not regular due to my PCOS but I have had tender breasts and unbelievable mood swings since my period stopped. I have been taking Blackmores Executive Stress Formula B complex tablets since October last year for optimal health and stress reduction. I have not had symptoms like this over the last few months and I ve never had breast tenderness straight after a period or lasting as long as it has now (over 4 weeks).

Of course you should have intercourse with your husband if the follicles reached mature size (after taking the hcg trigger). Don't worry about the cyst as it is a functional cyst and will resolve spontaneously.If six months of ovulation induction have passed, do not repeat the same step. You will need to reevaluate your tubal patency and you husband's semen parameters, and manage accordingly.I wish you good luck and getting pregnant soon.Dr. Ahmed Bahaa."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have my husband semen analysis result, it says he has 1+ pus cells, liquification is incomplete(forced), color is grey white, motility after 6 hours is 30%, and sperm per/ mil is 5, appearance is cloudy, morphology 20% pin headed.

I was pregnant at 19, and did not go through with it then. Ever since I have not been able to get pregnant. I discovered i am gluten intolerant and cannot have dairy. ive heard this might have something to do with infertility. i am sticking to my gluten free,dairy free diet. now at 41, I'm wondering how to become more fertile to try my options of becoming pregnant, as well as best way for my partner. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.Gluten intolerence itself doesn't cause infertility, but can cause reduced ovarian reserve sometimes. If you stick to gluten free diet, it has no impact on fertility. At the age of 41 female fertility naturally declines because of declining ovarian reserve. You can improve it to some extent by taking DHEA tablets 25mg thrice daily in consultation with your physician. Regarding ways to improve partner's fertility, it can be done by taking diet rich in antioxidants, avoiding/reducing smoking & alcohol intake. Also he can avoid prplonged sitting/standing, take local cold watet bath.The treatment giving highest chance of pregnancy is IVF/ICSI. You can go for it if acceptable to you.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Hi,Please find my semen analysis report below and let me know if any issue is there:-time of collection:12:00 pmlab receiving time:3:00pmDays of abstinence: 4daysPHYSICAL EXAMINATIONvolume: 5mlcolour:grey-whiteliquefaction time: 30minreaction:alkalineviscosity: normalMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:Spermatozoa count: 40 millions/mlMOTILITY: (after 1/2 hour incubation)Actively motile:50%Sluggishly motile:20%Non motile:30%MOTILITY:(after 1 hour incubation)Actively motile: 40%Sluggishly motile:25%Non motile:35%MOTILITY:(after 2 hour incubation)Actively motile:25%Sluggishly motile:30%Non motile:45%MORPHOLOGY:Normal forms:70%abnormal forms:30%OTHERS:Pus Cell: 4-5/H.P.F.Epithelial Cell: AfewR.B.C: Nil","Doctor":"Hello!

I scheduled an appointment and had previous docs forward stuff blah blah blah......So she wanted a current Ultrasound....it came back as a mass on the right ovary...no surprise. ...then she wanted a CT scan??? I complied. The results came back contra-indicating ........nothing was found on the CT. I called my OLD doc in Tucson and had ALL records sent. BUT NOW......she wants a biopsy of that ovary??? before doing my Hysterectomy ?? What the heck for? Number one....the CT scan indicated nothing and a CA -125 was never run (I'm an old Lab Tech.).............She also never told me the procedure for the biopsy..as if a fine needle will say much  Anyway..this has been going on for 4 months and I FINALLY have a surgery date.I really hate to get a \\"second opinion\\" because then I'm set back a bunch more months before having surgery.I am just sick of the pain and serious blood flow.  What is your take on all this testing and the whole Ultrasound/ct scan differences????? I almost considered going back to my infertility doc who did the original surgery before my IVF..........ughI'm a wreck.

Prior in the morning just pick up the final sprouting end of your lawn grass and wash it nicely... extract a juice out of it and pour 5 to 6 drops in each nostril daily morning..This is the remedy to reduce your blood flow which may save you from few more test of hemoglobins and other required blah blah blah.. whatever you say to that..:) Secondly if you get convinced by this just kindly let me know.. so that you could be set on some personalised medicines by further evaluation of whatever papers you got printed till yet through various consultations and reports..

The medication can be used alone, in an ovulation induction cycle as with intrauterine insemination or during in vitro fertilization. HCG  will cause ovulation approximately 36 hours after you take it, allowing your doctor to better time intrauterine insemination or the egg retrieval or timing an intercourse.Next 2 days are very critical after taking injection HCG.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi Docter.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a common cause of infertility in women. In addition to difficulty conceiving, there is also a history of (1) polycystic ovaries which may be identified on ultrasound (2) hirsuitism (hair growth in areas abnormal for females such as the face,chest or abdomen) and acne which are due to high levels of male hormones called androgens which are normally found in small quantities in females, (3)irregular periods, Two of the above are required for it to be diagnosed. Persons may have a resistance to insulin resulting in slight increase in blood sugars. It is treated with lifestyle changes to achieve weight loss. Weight loss is associated with an improvement in fertility. The medications used are metformin and clomid.  The metformin helps with the weight loss, reduces the insulin resistance and improves fetility, clomid improves ovulation. If you have undergone blood tests and imaging at fertility clinics, then it is likely that the doctors would have looked for this condition. If you are unsure then you can find out whether it has been ruled out.

My husband's semen analysis shows zero rapid linear motion now what do u suggest is the next option for us to conceive? Rest of his report is within normal limits","Doctor":"Thanks for your query. In fertility assessment we look at the male and the female partner separately. As for you, assuming your periods are regular ..........you should be ovulating as the cyst alone was removed ..........you have both ovaries with tube test showing patent tubes.....at the moment you don t  need further investigations. As for your husband, You do not have to take the first semen report as final. Check with him whether there was a collection problem. Your lab will help you to explore this in more detail. Also if there has been a recent viral illness( mild, easily goes unnoticed) there can be re percussions on the semen parameters. So , its advisable to repeat the test in 3 months time before coming to any conclusion. In case your has husband has a habit of using tobacco ( smoking), then its wise to stop it completely and the  repeat the test after 3 months I would also advise your husband to avoid wearing tight undergarments and exposure to heat. Having a cool bath twice a day also helps as we know that a slightly lower temperature is necessary for sperm production. Meanwhile continue taking folic acid and you can continue to have normal sexual relations. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor. I am a 31 year old female trying to conceive since the last 1 year. After starting my infertility treatment, my doctor suggested IUI. We did two 2 IUI but they did not turn positive. Since I had PCOD, my doctor advised for laproscopic ovarian drilling and hysteroscopy. The endometrial biopsy post hysteroscopy revealed endometrial tuberculosis. I underwent anti tubercular treatment for 6 months. Have now been trying to conceive with IVF.HCG number post 1st IVF was 77 which later dropped.Awaiting result for 2nd IVF cycle.My question to you is that do patients who have suffered from endometrial tuberculosis face problems while conceiving through IVF?","Doctor":"Hi, Endometrial tuberculosis affects the uterine lining essential for implantation and as such, spontaneous conception is affected. This is why IUI also had perhaps failed. Added to this, you suffer from PCOD, a deficient ovulation condition. Tuberculosis usually affects the fallopian tubes first, so tubal blocks should also be assessed. Endometrial tuberculosis may lead to endometrial or uterine adhesions and in such a case, IVF also may not give good results. A hysteroscopy is necessary to diagnose this. Please wait for your next cycle and follow your doctor's instructions.

If only one time, he can repeat the test once more with 2-3 days sexual abstinence, as one semen analysis is not sufficient to draw any conclusion.

Regarding cyst in ovary, if it is simple clear cyst & diagnosed recently, you can wait for 1-2 months for spontaneous resolution.

Reading your history I understand that you have taken ovulation induction drugs that is clomid and famara just for two cycles if I am not wrong? According to the protocol what we follow you need to undergo ovulation induction cycles atleast for 5-6 times before we switch over to other mode of treatment, but anyways that is absolutely subjecive and can be changed according to the patient profile and needs. The next level would be to go for IUI that is intra uterine insemenation, rather than directly jumping over t IVF. So I would advice you to go for IUI for atleast 2 cycles before taking up IVF.

Azoospermia that is Men with zero sperm count in ejaculate can be divided into two broad groups: A.Men who have an obstruction problem or blockage, meaning they are producing sperm, but the sperm can't get out ( Obstructive azoospermia) B.Men who have a production problem, meaning they are not making sperm, a condition called \\"non-obstructive \\" azoospermia.\\" You need to be examined by an Urologist or fertility specialist to find the cause of azoospermia. You require to undergo few tests to assess hormones. If it is obstructive azoospermia, surgery to remove obstruction can be done. If obstruction is not repairable then there is high probability of getting sperms from testis (by  Procedure called TESA ) and then IVF/ICSI can be performed. If it is non obstructive azoospermia, in 50% of patients sperms can be found in testis by TESA / Micro dissection TESE and then ICSI can be performed.

I ve been suffering from palpitations for over a year now. I was offered anti depressants but don t want to take them because I don t want to rely on drugs that are hard to stop taking. Most recently I ve been offered beta blockers and told if I don t take them my risk of a cardiac event or stroke increases because my heart rate was high and diastolic bp was over 100 (taken during a highly anxious situation). I ve had 2 readings taken today and my bp was 120/68 and 120/78. Heart rate immediately after exercise is 120 and when not anxious is around 70 when resting. Really don t want to take beta blockers and I want to treat the cause not the symptom! 2 ECGs were also normal Height, Weight, BMI Height (cm)     BMI     Weight (Kg)      167.00     22.23     62.00","Doctor":"Hello, Greetings from HealthcareMagic The mentioned parameters are absolutely fine. I don't think there is absolute need of the medicines. But, if your symptoms are not tolerable then you can have beta blockers for symptomatic relief. For the evaluation of cause, this can simply be psychological causes like anxiety. However, it's advisable to get your hemoglobin, thyroid test done as these are also common cause for these symptoms. So you can avoid medicines but there is no harm in meditation and yoga which will certainly help  you.  Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

Seminal analysis will reveal the present condition of your fertility status. Varicocele can be corrected only by surgery. If left uncorrected further damage of you sperm producing tissues will be possible. So the surgical correction will prevent further damage. Cyst over epididymis is not a big issue.

First you didn't mention what type of contraception you have been using during the 5 years period since your abortion and the time you decided to get pregnant. Second, I think you have good ovulation because your hormone levels are good except for the serum prolactin. The first thing you must do is to check your partener's semen analysis, which if good, I agree to have a laparoscopy as well as a hysteroscopy which is of equal importance and can be done at the same setting.

Sometimes it has really sharp pains.  I don't smoke or drink and I'm 20.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HealthcareMagic! The symptoms that you describe is more suggestive of pericarditis. It is inflammation of the sac surrounding your heart which commonly presents with sharp chest pain that usually comes quickly. Variety of factors may cause pericarditis such as infection, trauma, certain drugs etc. The pain is located mostly on the left side (or behind the breastbone). Pain is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward and worsened while lying down and deep breathing. The diagnosis is confirmed with EKG and Echo-cardiography. The other possible condition that causes chest pain with deep breathing and lying down is pleurisy (pleuritis). It is  inflammation of the lining of the lungs. If the inflammation on the left side the pain may locate in the area around the heart. To confirm the diagnosis your doctor may prescribe x-ray or CT scan according to the initial physical exam findings.I hope the above information will be helpful for you.

If there is VERY less sperm count Injections & Tabs are available to improve the sperm count. But for normal way of fertilization 60 millions are needed.

But, as ovulation was documented and if you are more than 2 weeks past the ovulation date, then we should keep possibility of pregnancy as first one.

Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually not a life threatening condition. Usually ECG is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holter monitoring. Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. Is there any stress or anxiety associated. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab Ciplar LA 20 mg once a day.

Follicular cyst is most common type of ovarian cyst. It is formed in a follicle that fails to release egg due to hormonal failure.It is benign and dose not cause any harm unless it ruptures and superimposed by infection. Primolut N contains synthetic hormone norethisterone used in menstrual disorders, it dose not cure cysts but it may help to prevent cyst formation in future. Treatment of cyst depends on its size and its persistency. Usually  follicular cyst resolves within 3 months. Surgical intervention may be need for larger and persistent cysts. Hope it helps.

Main function of ovary is to produce the female sex hormone like estrogen / progesterone which comes out in a cyclic fashion like 25 days comes estrogen while for 5 days comes progesterone which cause bleeding. This is maintained by brain but the days varies for all females. now due to the PCOS the production of estrogen and progesterone gets disturbed/ may not have enough production on one or the other leading to imbalances and hence makes irregular bleeds as well as problems with pregnancies are seen. (2) Here is the way to give a greater chances for becoming pregnant. The process know as \\"OVULATION\\" is when the female egg releases from OVARY, this occurs roughly between the 15 th -20 th day after the menstrual cycle (end of bleeding ), pregnancy means the meeting of the man's SPERM to the female's OVA- both have half genes which need to get together in order to form a complete structure, so the best possibility for the pregnancy is if the intercourse has occurred during those five days, other time their is no OVA present to meet the sperms hence no possibility of getting pregnant. IF you have been having 30 days cycle so the best chances to get pregnant is during fertility window while you are ovulating, for the best chances to get pregnant are from 16 days to 21 day from last menstrual withdrawal/ bleeding, ( if last day of menses is 14 march the the fertility window will be 1 april to 5 april ), more over the intercourse position is also important for the sperm have best possible chance to enter, mostly the female in bottom /missionary position is considered better, and keep lying for 30 min after ejaculation with the legs on the pillows and head flat to make incline position for sperm entry in the uterus. (3) Treatment mostly regularize the menstrual as long you take the pills which mostly ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE PILL which is not helpful to become pregnant.But Fertility medications  like Clomiphene may be given for  ovulation  problem, which is usually the reason for fertility problems in women with PCOS.MYOTOL-F Is a multivitamin and apcod is also as nutrition supplement which will not be any help as long as getting back to the regular cycle, only OPC will help to get you back on track.Hope it helps."},{"Patient":"hi, i m a lady aged 28 yrs, yesterday i go for an laparoscopy and hysteroscopy .

Irregular menstural cycles & inability to  conceive are the common problems for women with PCOS. Improper ovulation & excess amount of androgen are the main reasons. Ovarian drilling (ovarian diathermy) is done in women with PCOS to improve the fertility rate. Destroying part of the ovarian tissue restores regular ovulatory cycles in around 80% of women. It is a surgical procedure that triggers ovulation. It is an option only when other measures like weight reduction & fertility drugs fail. It is a safe procedure in expert hands. The aim of this laproscopy procedure is to destroy testosterone producing tissue in the ovary. A combination of  Letrazole & Clomiphene Citrate has been found to be useful in improving ovulation. Your BMI is in normal range but the  endometrial thickness is high (normal 6.7mm). Since Letrazole has not helped you, you can undergo ovarian drilling.

You need to undergo complete clinical, hormonal and genetic evaluation to reach at cause of low sperm count. Please consult a Fertility specialist or Urologist.  Antioxidants and multivitamins will help you to improve sperm motility. You can take them in tablet form and include in your diet also. Include lot of fruits, salads and green vegetables in your diet. Avoid oily and spicy food. Try to maintain or reduce your weight if you are overweight. Mild physical activity will help your cause. Avoid smoking or alcohol.

As you are on 4 th day of IVF treatment, I presume that you are getting gondatotropin injections( with or without Gnrh agonist)  for ovarian stimulation or only Gnrh agonist. Yes you are right that dosage of injection is pre decided and exact dose should be taken correctly under the skin or intra muscularly. As volume of these injection is very small these injections can be given subcutaneously ( Highly purified and recombinant) in no time. It is absolutely OK to walk and do your normal routine. You should avoid physical or mental stress. Avoid lifting weights ( eg. Bucket filled with water ). Regarding dosage of injections you can always clarify with your treating doctor.

Egg size of 18 mm and above are considered mature and pregnancy can occur if you made contact at the time of egg rupture. As u took ultrasound test on 13th day and egg size was 17 mm, hopefully it would have reached maturity on day 14 as follicle grows 2-3 mm/day. You can confirm pregnancy by doing Urine pregnancy test after 16-18 days of contact. If you are overweight, try to lose weight by diet control and exercise. Get your blood sugar levels done apart from other hormonal investigations. Testing blood sugar levels will give an idea about need to start metformin.

In cases of unexplained infertility, for instance, even with regular ovulation, ovarian stimulation with Humog can be indicated to cause superovulation i.e development of 2-3 follicles to increase chances of success per cycle. A small risk of overstimulation would always be there, the exact risk differs on a case to case basis."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, My husband and I are tying to have a baby.

There are generally functional cysts which are temporary, organic cysts that tend to persist and what is called a polycystic ovarian disease. these conditions have different management plans and their outcomes related to getting pregnant are very different.

She was undergoing treatment to induce ovulation through progesterone hormone tabs and related medicines & injections to induce ovulation She underwent regular follicular study so that we can plan appropriately. So will this treatment be advised and continued by US Doctors? I checked with My Insurance Company Cigna and they said it will be covered under Standard insurance as long as this case history from India is documented and US Doctor authorizes.","Doctor":"Hi there. Yes, your Insurance company is quite right. You need to produce all the medical history documents of your wife to the US doctor who provides his/ her services under the said insurance company. They will evaluate that it is really a case of secondary infertility and advise if the same treatment has to be continued or something else which would be better than this can be done. I am saying this because an Endocrinologist experienced in PCOS and an infertility specialist or OB doctor are involved in such cases and they will see the need of her undergoing this particular treament. So be prepared that they might try to simply regulate her menstruation and hence ovulation first and then would take other steps if ovulation is not happening properly.

Thanks DR","Doctor":"Hi,  thanks for using healthcare magic Semen analysis gives only a general idea of fertility. Men may have a essentially normal result and experience difficulty and some men may have abnormal results and have no problem conceiving. The fact you have a child improves your chances of future fertility. The sperm analysis: few WBC - this is good , it would normally indicate that there is no infection present but the microbiology indicates that a bacteria is present which may need treatment. Motility: 60% non motile- at least 50% motility is considered optimal but this is just slightly below the norm The sperm count is good at 158 milliion, it should be at least 20 million and your value is much higher. I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"we are trying for our first baby and i have been married for 2 years.....im on clomid ..last month i have periods on 13th jan....and i had scan on the 15th day of my periods there were one folicle in right and one folicle in left ovary and i had hcg shot also....and this month i didnot have periods yet...and i did hpt on 12th it was negative ....and i had a ultrasound on 18thfeb in which there was no sac but endometrium is 10.4mm thick....i again had the hpt it was negative again......im so confusedd what to do....still no periods.....is there any change of pregnancy.... what should i do ..please help me","Doctor":"Hello there, Thanks for writing to us. In your case, as there were 2  follicles after clomiphene, and you took Hcg for rupture of follicles, there is a possibility of pregnancy.

Reading the information this is usually only prescribed to women who have a history for miscarriage or have undergone ivf and/or have low progesterone levels.. I am really concerned about taking this as reading into it the drug has been banned in some countries and can cause birth defects...can you advise? When have these defects occurred and what is the % statistics for this? Also should I be taking this based on my medical history? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi! There is no clinical evidence that ovulation induction with clomiphene requires any luteal phase support with progesterones like Duphaston. However, many clinicians routinely advise the same to support a possible pregnancy. There is no evidence that there are any birth defects with Duphaston and its considered safe to use during  pregnancy. In my opinion, you should continue with Duphaston once started and not worry about any teratogenic effects."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am married since 1 year.

A bicornuate uterus may be an incidental finding alone, and may or may not have an impact on fertility, though the chance of miscarriage can be increased.

You have not mentioned the abstinence period before giving the semen sample. Long duration of abstinence may cause high viscosity of semen. Try to give semen sample after 2 days of abstinence. According to this report all other sperm parameters are within normal limit. As infection is one of the important causes which leads to high viscosity,get a semen culture and sensitivity done ( although pus cells are within normal limit in this report).

With respect to you, It would be worth knowing if you have done a complete infertility work up. This runs from hormonal testing, ultrasound and a hysterosalpingography. These exams shall indicate the state of your uterus and tubes. Infertility management usually starts with a proper consultation to ascertain the frequency, regularity and timing of sexual contact. This usually involves a joint consultation between you and your spouse. This is followed by an infertility evaluation of the couple with series of tests to exclude infectious causes of infertility. A male infertility panel is also  prescribed. Depending on the results, drugs or lifestyle changes are prescribed. It must be known that even after all tests and prescriptions are made, most couples might get a pregnancy about a year later. Its not actually worth it to start rushing for IUI or IVF, if a proper infertility consultation has not been done, and if the duration of post consultation treatment is less than one year. Your infertility specialist shall then decide based on all of these factors, with your accordance to undertake the procedure. I suggest you book an appointment with an infertility specialist and review a management plan with him. Thanks and hope this helps, Luchuo, MD."},{"Patient":"I am looking for fertility tests to be done before marriage due to higher side of age (~35) In this regard I would like to know which tests should be done for this. Please give me the names of these tests for both Male and Female. Thank you for the help. Regards","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for using HCM. Fertility naturally decreases in women unlike in men. In men, unless they present with acquired causes of infertility, even at older ages, they still maintain their fertility. However, in addition to acquired causes of infertility in women, women naturally loose their fertility as they age. This decrease is related to ovarian function in which the quantity and quality of egg is affected with age. A practical test used to evaluate this is the FSH hormone concentration in blood. Very high values of FSH ( above 15 international units) collected on day 3 of menstrual cylcle usually indicate an ovary that has given up. However, such test should be done more than once as values may fluactuate from one cycle to the other with fertility likely to increased in months with reduced values. Other possible tests for acquired causes will include ultrasound, hysterosalpingography and serologies for chlamydia, ureaplasma, mycoplasma. Your partner will have to do a spermogram.

Not getting pregnant within two months of regular contact is not a big thing to be worried. If you are not able to conceive even after 6 months of regular contact then you need to go for investigations. It is possible to have occasional anovulatory cycles in spite of you having regular periods. The frequency of sex during these two months also matters. Ultra sound examination for follicular study during the expected ovulatory period will reveal the presence of ovulation. Other factors like tubal block, cervical factors, Congenital anomalies, hormonal factors and immunological factors are to be investigated to find out the causes for infertility if you have not conceived even after 6 months. Wish you best of luck. Dr S.Murugan"},{"Patient":"Hey. I haven t had my period for 2 months now. I am 32. We tried IVF s and IUIs and all failed. I took a pregnancy test and they were all negative.

Also, you seem to have had intercourse not during the fertile period, but in the safe period, presuming that you have regular 28-30 day cycles. You could be suffering from unexplained infertility, but the cause of your present amenorrhoea should be elicited. For further evaluation, you may consult your gynecologist, get a trans-vaginal sonogram and a blood test for beta-hCG.

There are several causes of infertility other than just infection and appropriate diagnosis is key in instituting a treatment plan. Infections are a common cause of infertility but with effective antibiotherapy, the infertility should resolved except in chronic infections with complications such as pus or fluid in the fallopian tubes. Poor sexual exposure is a common cause of difficulty in conceiving. Effective exposure requires at least 4 sexual exposures per week spread out throughout the week. I will advice you and your husband get complete panel of tests for infertility including hysterosalpingography, pelvic ultrasoud, chlamydia serology, ureaplasma and mycoplasma serologies and spermogram and  a temperature chart."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am xxxx.

Will I get conceive atleast this month? what this indicates?will it get normal?Pl suggest","Doctor":"Hi, If the follicle has reached a size of 3.6 cm., it is more likely to be due to a cyst formation. Ovulation usually occurs as the follicle reaches a size of 18 mm. The repeat ultrasound should be able to show if the cyst has spontaneously regressed or not. Ovulation induction can lead to ovarian hyperstimulation resulting in such a picture. Conception in this cycle seems difficult and cannot be predicted now. See your doctor for further advice.

There are many causes of infertility and tubes being open is not synonymous to being fertile. However, even if its just one tube that is open and if it is histologically good, they will be a very good chance of conceiving provided there is no other underlying cause of infertility. You should see your gynaecologist so that more tests should be done to rule out other causes of infertility which could be ineffective sexual exposure, ovarian dysfunction, hormonal disorders, antibodies against sperms etc. For the anteflexed cervix, you could stay in a Mohammed position for a couple of minutes each time after an intercourse; this could help provided there is no other underlying cause."},{"Patient":"Dr. I m trying to get issue.

To get a decent result in the treatment of infertility, you need to wait for at least 6 cycles. If you have not ovulated with a single drug, another drug may be added or injections given. Duphaston is a progestogen that helps in priming the endometrium after ovulation. Try to eat healthy food, exercise regularly and maintain a healthy weight, as this in itself settles some of the hormonal imbalances in PCOD. Good luck."},{"Patient":"I m 28yrs old,its been 3yrs tht i gt married... N had abortion twice in d first 2yrs of my marriage.. Planning fr a baby nw n diagnosed with pcos n my doc prescribed me wid metformin 850mg i hve taking it since a mnth.. Hw does it help me in.conceiving.. Pls let me knw.. V r worried abt my pregnancy... I want a healthy baby","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting. Metformin will help in conceiving indirectly by first of regulating your menstrual cycle (hence ovulations). The presence of PCOS will require a medication that could regulate hormonal balance of your body since imbalanced hormoone with PCOS will not be very good if you are planning to conceive. Metformin does not have any known negative effective on your future baby ( no contraindications during pregnancy). It was probably prescribed because of your size (you are probably overweight or have obesity) and this would reduce your size and hence effectuate your cycles. Metformin might require stopping by your gynobs after you have taken in (gotten pregnant). So consultation with your treating physician will be recommended. Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"hi doctor, we r trying to conceive since past 1 yr, but due to low sperm count i could not conceive. bt in dec semen analysis my hubby s report got normal with 55mill/ml sperm count. bt when in last semen analysis his sperm count dropped by 33mill/ml n the sample was 15days old, bt jst after 3-4 days he gave another sample n the result was 16mill/ml....how does it is happning...can u plz suggest","Doctor":"Hello, welcome to HCM, I am Dr. Das Look, for a semen analysis test, you have to follow some instructions. Abstinence from sex is necessary for minimum 3 days. Semen should be given after masturbation at laboratory, which should be examined immediately followed by at 1hr and at 2nd and 3rd hour.

Kindly suggest what can be done now.","Doctor":"Hello, Im glad to answer your question. Since TB-Gold is positive, you are likely to have active tubercular infection. Next step would be to get a HSG done to know exact site and extent of tubal blockage. Fallopian tube is most common site of damage in genital tuberculosis. The Mantoux ( tuberculin) skin test is  unreliable. It tests merely for the presence of immunity against TB . Resection and reanastomosis surgeries are advised If there is isthmal block , then hysteroscopic directed procedure is done. Meanwhile continue taking antitubercular drugs.

Interaction between extra-ovarian and intra-ovarian factors that determine the fate of the follicle and the quality of the oocyte.

It cause  blockage of the passage ( no sperm enters the semen because the tract is blocked). Management of tuberculous infertility consists of two parts. 1. Treatment with anti tubercular drugs to treat primary infection. 2. Reconstructive surgery followed by assisted reproductive techniques like ICSI,MESA, TESA. In the majority of cases, the presentation is late and antitubercular therapy does not improve the fertility status. Infertility here usually results from anatomic obstruction .

I went for follicular study on day 9 only 1 follicle measuring 1*1cm was developed on my left ovary and yesterday day 11 i had my ultrasound scan the follicle in the right ovary dint increase in size and there was another follicle that developed in the left ovary measuring 1.1*1.1cm and ET was 4mm. Assistant doctor said they may plan for HCG injections and my chief doctor said she will decide after taking a follicular study on my day 13 tomorrow. If they give me HCG is there chances for me to get pregnant. I am very eager to become pregnant. Please do reply... Thank you","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query, In the presence of one or more mature ovarian follicles, ovulation can be triggered by the administration of hCG. As hCG supports the corpus luteum and enhances the production of progesterone. Ideal size of follicle for conception is 18-22mm. Since your size of follicle is 11mm with thin endometrium, chances of conception is low. But continue your medications and be positive. wish you good luck, regards, Dr Nilofer"},{"Patient":"Hi, My mother contracted chicken pox before I was born, and although most children suffer from some form of congenital varicella syndrome I surprisingly had none of these effects. However, when I hit puberty I developed a rather severe case of dysfunctional uterine bleeding and as far as I know never ovulated. I am essentially permanently on birth control for this condition, but I was wondering if exposure to the chicken pox could have inhibited my production of eggs before birth and these two events are therefore connected? If so, does this mean that I am most likely infertile?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query, During first or second trimester of pregnancy, there's a slight risk (probably less than 1.5 percent ) that  baby will get something called congenital varicella syndrome (CVS). The risk is highest (about 2 percent) if you're infected between 13 and 20 weeks' gestation. So you might have just escaped. There is no relation between CVS and infertility in women. You do have chances of conception provided you rule out other causes of infertility. good luck regards, Dr Nilofer"},{"Patient":"I would like to know if I would be able to use or under go a fertility treatent using drugs while using heparin due to Protein S Deficiency and repeat Pulmonary Ebolism having had three prior C-Sections.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, There has been some speculation that couples who are trying to conceive should reduce the frequency of sexual intercourse during the fertile window to increase sperm supply. This is not true for most couples. While couples with known male factor issues should consult their doctor for the best intercourse strategy, couples with normal fertility and no known sperm issues should not reduce the frequency of intercourse in the fertile window. Fertile window is 5 days before ovulation and the day of ovulation. It makes up 6 days. Your probability of conception is increased when you have intercourse multiple times in your fertile window. While it is true that sperm concentrations decrease slightly with increasing intercourse frequency, frequent intercourse is still more likely to result in conception than infrequent intercourse for couples with no male factor fertility issues. Each additional act of intercourse within your fertile window increases your probability of conception for that cycle. Since there is no male fertility issue with you,sex can be performed as much time as it is possible for you.

In this regard, we visited Fortis Mumbai and started the treatment there. 1. At Fortis Mumbai, we were suggested to take female contraceptives for 3-6 months with the hope that it might help to regularize periods and try naturally afterwards. We tried for 3 months after that but this did not help as there were muliple follicles and mature follicle/ egg formation. 2. Thereafter, we were suggested to go for Clomid to stimulate ovolution. We tried this method for another 6 months but this did not help inspite of increased dosage. The scans during this time still reflected multiple follicules and no single mature follicle (upto maximum 10 mm size). 3. After that, we shifted to Bangalore with the focus of getting results in this regard and visited Fortis Bangalore . We were suggested to undergo various tests like fallopian tube ( HSG ), tuberculosis, semen analysis etc. All the tests were normal and she confirmed that Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCO ) is the only problem and that we should go for IUI as taking clomid for long duration may have side effects. 4. Since then my wife has undergone 3 IUIs and there has not been any positive results, with no explained reasons for failure. We have been suggested that we should try for 3-6 IUIs before thinking of IVF.

Please post complete hormonal assessment and ultrasound report. If tubes are patent then you can go ahead with ovulation induction and  intrauterine insemination( IUI). Clomipure and GMH are medicines to induce ovulation. You need to undergo follicular monitoring by ultrasound to assess the growth of egg and confirmation of ovulation. Once ovulation is confirmed IUI can be done. Try this for 4-6 cycles. IVF is the option if IUI does not succeed. All the best"},{"Patient":"My husband and I are having issues conceiving. His sperm count is high, motility is a little bit low, and morphology is quite low (15% are shaped normally and doc. says it needs to be 70% normal shapes).

Though interference with sperm count or morphology has not been reported as a side effect of Adderall, the studies have shown the individuals taking amphetamine to have decreased libido and sex drive. So...if you are planning to conceive, then consult with your Gynecologist. Otherwise it will be better to wait till your husband completes his medicines. Make sure he is taking his medications regularly, having a healthy balanced diet & avoiding stress, alcohol and smoking. Wishing a good health. Thanks & take care"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor!

Thanks you very much!","Doctor":"Hello, Since your wife is already 33 years old and have tried pregnancy for past 4 years under the guidance of doctor,I would advise you to go for assisted reproductive therapy like IVF or ICSI. There is no point waiting time as PCOS is a very tricky and complex situation and one can't be sure of pregnancy by natural means. Consult a Gynecologist who is specialising in this field and discuss with her. Till you consult a specialist I would advise your wife to go for regular aerobic exercises and shed weight if she is overweight.

More important, you need to investigate for the cause of missed abortion at 22 weeks like congenital/acquired thrombophilia profile, TSH, VDRL, Sugar level (RBS/GTT) etc. If your tubes are confirmed (by tubal patency test) open, and you have tried 2-3 IUIs, its better to go for laparoscopy. If tubes are open & it was your first IUI, you can go for simple dilatation of neck of womb followed by IUI.

My follicular study also shows the following details, Day-12th, Right Ovary-MSF, left Ovary-MSF, Endometrium- 8mm. she is suggested for some more scans till the 17th day to check the ovulation dates, but does this reports indicate that i am infertile & cannot ovulate without medication . i am very much confused & upset because i want to conceive asap. Is 12th day growth of the egg seems quite low or can be considered as normal? please help....","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for your query. I read your query and understand your concerns. Following is my reply: Egg needs to be 18 mm in size before doing any treatment. That is tthe reason your scans are exceeding day 17. Ovulation is delayed in women with PCO as in your case.

Is laparoscopy operation really necessary? I am very afraid to take the risks of this kind of operation","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HealthcareMagic As per your history you are suffering from unexplained infertility. As you are already 34 yrs ( with increasing age and time to conception fertility further reduces ) and have been trying for 3 yrs,you need to be thoroughly evaluated by doing a laparoscopy+ hysteroscopy. Why Laparoscopy?? sometimes few patients may have minimal endometriosis or mild adhesions which may affect the function of tubes and leads to infertility. By doing laparoscopy adverse factors if any can be ruled out or treated. Also tubes can be evaluated under direct vision  Hysteroscopy is the procedure where inside of uterine cavity is viewed using a camera and if any pathology found can be treated at the same time. Laparoscopy is a day care procedure where you can go same day or next day morning. Don't get scared. As your doctor already said you can try IUI after laparoscopy because immediately after surgery there is good chance of conception. If 3 IUIs fail after laparoscopy you can go ahead with IVF. IVF can be done directly but you need to undergo hysteroscopy before IVF for the reasons explained above. Trust your doctor.

After over 8 years of trying for conception, you should now consult an Infertility Specialist. there are various reasons for infertility You should have the following tests done after consulting a SPecialist - basic hormonal profile, blood sugars, thyroid hormone and adrenal hormone tests, blood group and tests for sexually transmitted diseases, semen analysis of your husband, basic ultrasound and pelvic examination for you, and lastly, a tubal patency testing also. Since the reasons for not conceiving are numerous, it is not possible to tell you whats wrong with one simple answer. Only a thorough workup would tell you that, even then, 30 % of cases of infertility are unexplained ones. Take care."},{"Patient":"I m on cycle day 14 and I m currently taking metformin , iron,b12 and on cycle days 3-7 5mg of letrozole to induce ovulation . I noticed around 5am I was spotting and didn t think much about it and figured maybe it s ovulation bleeding . But after having it last all day along with cramps that have now started tonight and gotten stronger, I m wondering if it s something else going on. Anyone else taking some of these meds and have any positive news? I was really hoping that this cycle the meds would work and we d finally be pregnant. I m feeling pretty down and worried that maybe yet again there will be no baby or that maybe somethings happened that will make it impossible to conceive. I know I m likely over worrying but I could really use some positive reassurance","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for your query. The mild spotting and cramps around day 14 definitely point to an ovulation bleed. You would be having follicular monitoring and ultrasound in this cycle, so you easily know what is the cause. ALso, you should see an Infertility specialist for your problem, as there are various causes of infertility. Your basic hormonal tests, semen testing of your partner, your tubal patency tests and ability to ovulate are some cardinally important issues. These should be thoroughly evaluated. THere is no reason in this era of ART ( assisted reproductive technology ) why anybody should be childless. Do not lose hope and keep consulting a specialist.

PCOD is a condition which interferes with normal ovulation. Many follicles are present in the ovary, but none matures into a follicle and ovulates. Hence, assuming your laparoscopy was normal, and both tubes were open, your infertility specialist is right in prescribing you ubiphene. It contains clomiphene citrate, which stimulates the ovaries to produce mature follicles and hence is a treatment modality for PCOD. For women whose only infertility problem is anovulation, up to 80% of patients will ovulate using this medication and 50% of those will conceive . Clomiphene may be combined with intrauterine insemination to boost the success of the medication by placing the sperm and egg in closer proximity to each other. All the best."},{"Patient":"my husband semen examintion report says; Quantity: 4.5 mil Colour: cream Reaction: P.H 8.0 Consistency: slightly viscous sperm count: Nil Morphology: nil Motility: nil Rapid progression: nil Sluggish progression: nil None progression: nil Motility after 2 1/2 hrs at room temperature: nil Smear study: Pus cells ..10-15/HPF.....

Docters solution is for me to lose weight but find it very difficult. Been very low since. I am 30 hubby 31 been trying for 10 years ttc.","Doctor":"Hello, Loosing weight is very important to regain fertility in a patient of PCOS. It is said that even if you are able to shed 10% of your weight,you hall be able to get your periods back. To shed weight Take low carbohydrate and high protein diet Do regular aerobic exercises like brisk walking or swimming or cycling And you should take medicines to balance your body hormones like birth control pills The most important aspect of treatment is use of insulin sensitising medicine called as METFORMIN. Since patients of PCOS have incresed insulin resistance ,you need METFORMIN to reduce the insulin resistance. Insulin resistance causes a build up of insulin and sugar levels in the blood which results in Increased production of male hormones in body. These increased levels of male hormones result in acne,infertility and WEIGHT GAIN. You must consult a dietician for the desired result as you are already 30 years and getting old as far as issue of pregnancy is concerned. Consult a Gynecologist or a physician and start taking METFORMIN 500 mg twice a day,under his advise.

Please consult a proper infertility specialist for further treatment. As all your tests are normal, which you have mentioned, then IUI ( intra uterine insemination ) seems the best way for you. The major cause of infertility is unexplained infertility, in which no definite cause can be found. In such cases, sometimes, there might be some local or cervical factor, which can be overcome by IUI. As such, by wasting time without treatment, your age would increase and age related problems would arise. You should definitely try to go for IUI, if you have already spent three years trying to conceive naturally. take care."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been trying to conceive a child for seven years with my husband. My infertility (and/or my husbands) is unexplained - All tests performed have been normal. I have undergone IUI treatments, but have taken this month off due to residual cysts on my ovaries after my last IUI round with GonalF. The doctor said it was okay to try timed intercourse this month. I am currently 12 days past my LH surge and have received a positive pregnancy test this morning, and again in the evening. I have read online that corpus luteum cysts may cause false positives on pregnancy tests . I am not sure if a residual cyst is the same thing as a corpus luteum cyst. Are they one and the same? Also, what are the chances of the false-positive from the cyst? I am not sure if it is worth making an appointment, or if it is likely that this is a false positive caused by the cysts.","Doctor":"Hello thanks for your query. Residual cysts are not the same as corpus luteum cyst. After stimulation with gonadotropins like Gonal F , there is multifollicular stimulation of the ovaries - that is instead of one egg, many eggs  ( follicles ) mature simultaneously. All of them do not rupture at ovulation, and some follicles give rise to residual cysts. However, corpus luteum is the structure that supports a growing pregnancy. False positives with urine pregnancy tests are common, not just with corpus luteal cyts, but also various other causes. As you have been trying to conceive for seven years now, this is a precious pregnancy for you. Please do not waste time, and consult a gynecologist, as if it is an early pregnancy, you definitely need proper guidance and medications. I think it is definitely worthwhile, since residual cysts do not give false positive test, and with a positive test, you definitely need confirmation and ultrasound at the earliest.

You should be investigated thoroughly to rule out all of them Exercise, stress, anxiety, fluctuations in weight and age around 40 are chief causes. Polycystic ovaries can cause irregular cycles for which various hormonal assays are necessary for diagnosis. Thyroid disorder, adrenal disorder can cause this. Also, some disease within the uterus or ovaries can also lead to irregular cycles. The medications prescribed to you act empirically, and are not known to cause any side effects. However, you should consult a proper Infertility specialist, to get all investigations done, also your partners semen testing and tests to know if both your tubes are open. As your cycles are irregular, it is extremely difficult to pinpoint the days of ovulation, around which, intercourse leads to maximum chances of pregnancy. Also with irregular periods, it is very likely that you might not be ovulating at all. Please consult an infertility specialist, who would perform follicular monitoring by ultrasound for you, and hence advise best days for trying to conceive, as well as treatment for anovulation.

Regards."},{"Patient":"my husband and I have been trying to conceive for 20 months (both currently 30y) without luck. I have been tested for progesterone , and have charted for ~12 cycles (25d). He has since had a semen analysis . His numbers for count were well above average but his motility was listed as 11% with the reference range of 12%. My OBGYN has told us to be patient but 20 months seems a very long time for people our age. What would be the next step. We do have a Urology apt set for him but im unsure what to expect or ask.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for using healthcare magic Normally after a year of persistent intercourse, a diagnosis of infertility is made if conception does not occur. Motility of 11% is a little low, it is thought that at least 50% of the sperm should be progressively motile. This can sometimes be caused by exposure of the testes to extreme temperatures or delayed analysis of the semen by the lab.It is important to remember, however, that some men with normal semen analysis may have problems conceiving whereas, some with abnormal results have no problem. It only provides a general idea of fertility. You should mention the semen analysis results to the urologist and ask him what areas would be affecting fertility and ways that they can possibly be improved. In the female fertility is affected by cervical, uterine, tubal and ovarian factors. Cervical factors can include- obstruction of the cervix Uterine factors include-any abnormality in the structure of the uterus and adjacent structures- this is evaluated with a test called HSG Tubal factors include any blockage along the fallopian tubes Ovarian factors- any issues with ovulation In 10% of couples the exact cause of the problem is never discovered, this would not  necessary influence treatment as your doctor may proceed in a step wise fashion. Hope this helps and wish you the best"},{"Patient":"hi i want to ask that we r trying to connceive since 1 yr,but not succed yet.gynacologist is treating us,she suggest semen analysis of my hushband.. his rapid linear progression is only 4%,is that normal? and please tell me the diet which help to increase his linear progression,dr suggest to him VERONA and ASCARD 30...please guide me","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM Welcome to HCM For conception a rapid forward progressive linear motion is needed in atleast 50 % sperms. If this rapid motion is present in less than 50 % sperms, there is difficulty in conceiving or penetration of ovum by the sperms. Please post the entire semen analysis report for better interpretation. In case there is isolated low rapid linear motion, semen analysis can be repeated. Verona is a herbal preparation for preventing pre-mature ejaculation. Ascard is enteric coated aspirin. Please post the entire semen analysis report.

The Nur-Isterate can last sometimes 6-9 months before you resume having normal periods, that is probably why it is taking so long for you to have your ovulation and conception. However please do not worry it will not cause infertility and you need not take any specific medicines for regaining your ovulation . With time the effect of the contraceptive will wear off from your system and you will conceive as per your wish. Also it would be advisable to consult your gynaecologist for ruling out any other problems like uterine or ovarian disorders if you are unable to conceive after 6-9 months of nur isterate. Hope I have answered your query. Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi I am Khan One question - i am 44 and married. My wife is 38 and her right ovary is removed and she had IVF treatment 2 times .Doctor checked my semen report and are satisfied but despite of that the IVF treatment was negative Now i am financially gone washed out and left everything on GOD- But me and my wife are enjoying our sex life well but sometimes few things strikes my mind If my wife does not ovolute during the time of ovolution and during that time if we do intercourse .What is the possibilty of fertilization as my semen does not unite with ovum .Sometimes i feel like why should i do intercourse when i know that my wife does not ovolute and cannot fertilize..i love my wife a lot and no one is more important to me more than my wife.","Doctor":"Hi mohammed, It does not mean that if one ovary is removed she does not ovulate and she has the same chances of getting pregnant as women with two ovaries. The success rate of IVF is not so promising and it decreases with increasing age of women. In this case ovulation and sperm condition may not be the only problem you are looking for, her uterus may not able able to implant the fertilized ovum, hormones required for continuing pregnancy may not be sufficient and so on. In many of the cases the cause for infertility remains unidentified till the end. So you can have one more complete infertility workup done and keep trying. With regards, Dr.Parthipan"},{"Patient":"My husband and I have a two and a half year old. We got pregnant the very first time we tried without me really tracking ovulation . I had just gotten off birth control after being on it for seven years. Now we have been trying and he has been diagnosed with varicocele . We have been trying for four months. Should we be concerned a out the diagnosis? He is turning 34 this weekend.","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for posting your worries on this forum. I will try as much as possible to elaborate on this issue as it is very sensitive and normally you need to discuss this with your doctor. They occur in 15-20% of all males. Usually diagnosed in males between 15-30 years and rarely above 40. Varicocele can be harmless, but in many cases it can cause infertility and pain. Although there are studies showing improvement in sperm quality in 57%, there are also studies showing that the regular surgery has no significant effect on infertility. Thus the surgery may not improve fertility and the patient will need to undergo a non-invasive treatment However researches show that if the treatment is performed adequately, both sides by interventional radiology procedure or by microsurgery, sperm production can be restored even in men without sperm cells at all (azospermia). Chances are, if your husband meets a specialist early enough either an interventional radiologist or a urologist he could get his condition corrected soon enough and fertility could be restored. hope this helps"},{"Patient":"hello doctor im sugested to take siphene 100mg and duphaston 10mg tablets as we are trying for pregnancy...will i surely concieve,this month only i started those tablets..she sugested to take siphene 100mg from the day 5 to 9...and duphaston 10mg from the day 16th to 25....will i sure be pregnant after taking these tablets this month?","Doctor":"Hello.siphene helps in the formation of eggs.though a female ovulates every month and releases egg ,siphene stimulates the ovaries and multiple eggs are produced.

You mean to say about the post coital test from your wife's cervical secretion. How long after the coitus  the test was done? The dead sperms in the cervical mucus may be due to infection of cervix, absence of fructose in your semen, infection of your genital tract or antibodies present either with you or with your wife against the sperms. The sperm count can be increased with drugs like Clomiphene citrate tablets or with appropriate hormones. Any abnormality of your genitals (Varicocele, undescended testis, epidydimitis etc ) have to be ruled out by examination before treatment.

I assume that you are undergoing infertility treatment, and that too COH ( controlled ovarian hyperstimulation.) In this procedure, you are first given gonadotropins ( hormones that cause release of multiple follicles - eggs from your ovaries ). This is the injection Sitrodin as mentioned by you. Then, when mature follicles ( eggs ) are ready in your ovaries, Injection HCG is given to cause ovulation - that is rupture of mature egg/eggs from the ovaries. This is the injection Fertigyn that you have been advised. Hence, if you are under treatment of a proper infertility specialist, who has evaluated your case, and decided the need for such a treatment protocol, then you should not worry. There are side effects to such treatment, but you must go for proper counselling for the same. Also, to maximize chances of conception after taking such stimulation, you should go for an IUI ( intra uterine insemination ) also. Please consult your treating specialist for further information. You will know the results of the treatment almost two weeks after your IUI.. that is around the date of your next expected period.

Many women complain of this with changes in their life like exams, marriage etc. It should gradually settle down. About the pain, see a gynecologist if the pain continues, although it does not really sound like period pains. If you go overdue, do a pregnancy test to make sure.

I still have low back pain that is usually associated with my period. I took a pregnancy test this morning and it was negative. My bleedign started on day 28- normla. What is going on?","Doctor":"Hello Periods can be irregular sometimes. Periods are affected by hormones, which can fluctuate, especially with stress. Just wait for a while. I would think your periods should start properly soon. If you do not have any proper flow for a week or so, have a blood test to see if you are pregnant. This is more accurate.

He showed me all of the follicles on the screen and said that because I did not have a dominant one that I may not O. I have not gotten my smiley yet. I do have a lot of pressure and pain on both sides. I assumed because I have 10-12 follicles just on the one ovary he could see. He showed me the follicles and I have more than 2 that were more than an inch wide. I watched him measure my lining as well it was 6 mm. I asked him if 6 was too thin and he said no, that it was fine...........Is there any way I can get pregnant this cycle.","Doctor":"Hello On d13 you should be able to see a dominant follicle. This is presuming your dates are correct, and the ultrasonographer is experienced. Given the findings, it seems unlikely that you would ovulate.

Unfortunately it didnt happen. - Semen analysis for the partner show its fine What can be the possible reasons and possible solution for the same in order to get pregnant? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi Dear, you did not mention your age here nor you mentioned since how many months/ years you are trying for pregnancy. If you have started just recently, please do not label yourself as a case of 'infertility'. In case the try is since more than a few months, still you cannot be labelled as a case of infertility. The reason being your hypothyroidism. With that your TSH goes high and so does your prolactin level. That makes conception difficult. It is very common and hence when you treat your hypothyroidism, automatically your prolactin falls down increasing your chances of conception. Now your TSH and prolactin levels are just fine for you to conceive normally and do not reduce the dose of thyroid tablet eventhough the reading of TSH is less than 0.3. You need to keep TSH before and after conception below 2.5. You also do not need any injections for ovulation. Keep a very normal routine for another 3 months and do not monitor yourself for the ovulation. With healthy diet, weight, exercise and continuation of thyroid replacement medication, you will continue getting normal cycles and hence normal ovulation during these months and there is very high chance of you coneiving on youself without the aid of injections for ovulations. In case you are overweight and in spite of normal TSH you have irregular menstruation then you will need assistance from infertility specialist for induction of ovulation and further management after these three months.

First only one of two tubes is open, which itself reduces chance of pregnancy by half. Second count during IUI of 4 million has very low pregnancy rate.

Sometimes it is related to energy drink and called energy drink related supraventricular tachycardia. PSVT has an abrupt onset and termination and may present with fast heartbeats, chest pain, dizziness, light-headedness or tiredness. Your episode of PSVT has a good prognosis. If it is only related to energy drink and you should stop taking energy drinks. Also avoid alcohol, smoking, drinking too much coffee, excess physical activity, OTC cold and cough medications, cocaine or methamphetamines. When you experience the episode of PSVT you may try coughing, putting your face in ice water or try holding your breath and straining. These are called vagal manures and helps to stop the episode. If the PSVT episode becomes longer (few minutes) and happens frequently consult your doctor for further investigation.I hope the above information will be helpful for you.

Progestreone is a naturally occuring female hormone. Its role is to produce secretory change in the endometrium. During the first half of the cycle there is proliferation of the endometrium and during the second half there is secretory change. Secretory change prepares the endometrium for implanatation. If pregnancy occurs then progesterone maintains the pregnancy for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks placenta takes over. So, progesterone maintains pregnancy. In the absence of progesterone pregnancy cannot be sustained and it results in pre-term labour, abortions etc. Progeserone is also indicated in other conditions like irregular menstrual cycle, other menstrual disorders, infertility etc. The role of progesterone is to regularize the cycle in case you have irregular cycles. PCOS is another issue. It is due to abnormality of ovulation where the ovum/ egg does not mature. Progesterone is not used for that purpose. Thanks and take care Dr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"Hi.

Doctor has suggested Lupigest 200. Why Lupigest...what does it do?","Doctor":"Hello there. Thanks for writing. Lupigest is progesterone hormone tablet. This hormone  thickens uterine lining making it favourable for implantation of pregnancy. It also supports early pregnancy preventing miscarriage. Rupture of follicles on follicular study after clofert 50 use suggests you had ovulation and are likely to conceive if you had timely intercourse. So your doctor has prescribed lupigest to support the fertilized egg for implantation and growth. Lupigest will not harm your pregnancy or baby in anyway. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. my wife has undergone a follicular study on 9th day of her cycle. her result shows: Uterus measures 82 x 38 x 23 mm No follicle lesion seen endomaterial thickness is 4mm rt. ovary measures 33 x 15 mm left ovary measures 34 x 16mm Rt. Ovary and Left ovary shows no dominant follicle and there is no evidence of free fluid seen in pelvis can u pls suggest what this result means. is there any problem in conceving thanking you","Doctor":"Hi, welcome Santosh At the day 14 of cycle a dominat follicle comes out of ovary into uterus which gets fertilised by sperm. However you have just started study (9th day), so dominant follicle will not be seen at this stage. Just continue with daily follicular study upto day 14, then only we can come to any conclusion. You must consult your gynecologist for a ovum inducing treatment and procedure.

I could but was weak and thready. called 911. by the time they arrived he was responsive. he was hightly intoxicated. pupils equal. first responders took a bp over sweatshirt that was 90/80. could not count his hr. when ems arrived took second bp 110/ 80 again over sweatshirt. he refused to go to er but we insisted. I feel they didn't want to take him because of lack of insurance. Were we wrong in thinking he should get checked?","Doctor":"Hello,There are two possibilities, one is syncope and other is seizures. Did he have any abnormal jerky or tightening of limbs, if yes it points towards seizures.I think in his case, syncope was a likely possibility, probably vasovagal syncope. Probably due to fall in bp leading to decreased blood supply to brain. What was he doing just before this episode?  He ll need evaluation, ecg, holter and echo. Monitor his bp and pulse rate. Ask to him avoid risky places and activities like driving, swimming etc. Avoid dehydration, don't strain at micturition and stools.

I was taking this for over 3 years and had been unsuccessful in conceiving a child. I recently switched to aldomet and we shall see if there is any luck. If there is a risk of infertility caused by lisinopril, is it reversible and how long does it take for the medication to be cleared out of your system?","Doctor":"Hello! There is no scientific evidence that lisinopril may affect fertility or cause difficulty in natural conception. However, it is categorized as Class D drug by FDA for teratogenecity, i.e it may cause harm to the unborn fetus, and hence it is certainly advisable not to be on lisinopril and shift to aldomet while trying for pregnancy, as long as your blood pressure is well controlled on aldomet also."},{"Patient":"i am 27 year old , married for 3 years.

Going by your FSH report, that seems to be the case. Occasionally, it may be reversible after a few years of finishing chemotherapy, but mostly it may persist.

It is normally treated with metformin/glucophage and weight loss for most persons. If the person does not wish to conceive then an oral contraceptive pill which can normalise the period is used, if the woman wishes to conceive then additional medication to assist  ovulation (release of a normal ovum or egg) can be used.

When I stretch, I lose my vision, become very dizzy and disoriented, I sometimes fall to the ground, and my extremities become numb for a short period afterwards. Is this simply a blood pressure problem or possible a dehydration issue? Or can this be something more serious? Could it be a neurological problem?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome,It is highly likely a stretch syncope. Stretch syncope  is caused by hypotension (low blood pressure). During a stretching the pressure increases inside the chest which decreases blood flow to the heart and eventually decreases blood pressure. Low blood pressure causes low blood flow to the brain and a person experiences visual blurring, light-headedness, numbness etc. Stretch syncope has a good prognosis.  You should avoid provoking action (stretching).But if you experience altered state of consciousness (reduced wakefulness, disorientation, difficulty following commands etc) after the stretch this might indicate neurological problem (probably temporal seizure). If you do have altered state of consciousness you should see your doctor. You might be ordered EEG or other tests to find out the cause. I hope the above information will be helpful for you.

I was given Vitamin C 500mg, Addyzoa and Vitmin E 400mg. My sperm count at the moment is about 31million, is it possible my wife wil get pregnant very soon. she has been diagnosed and she is ok medically just that they gave her clomid to induce ovulation .","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to HCM, I am Dr. Das For pregnancy you do not need too much sperm count. Along with sperm count, most important is sperm motility and sperm morphology. According to WHO 1999, requirement of sperm count is >20 millions / ml, requirement of sperm motility is >50%, and minimum 60% sperms should be of normal morphology. To fertilize a ovum, a sperm has to go up to the fallopian tube. If motility is lower than required, then the sperms are unable to fertilize a ovum in spite of having normal sperm count. So, for pregnancy you need 50% sperm motility and 60% normal sperm. From the above discussion it is clear that no definite comment can be done regarding pregnancy on the basis of only 31 million sperm."},{"Patient":"I am 33 year old and recently done histoscopy , removed both tubes(damaged) endometrium tissue sent for tb pcr result is positive, doctor advised that we can go directly for ivf , becasue 2 years back i stoped my tb med. course inbetween(only 2 months med i completed) doctor said now again we start there is no effect just we go for ivf directly. my querry is, safe for ivf or if my cycle sucess any effect on baby. please help me i am confused.","Doctor":"Write your answer hereHi, Thanks for your query.

Siphene is given to treat excessive prolactin levels, Ovigyn is hCG and Duphaston contains progesterone. Your cycle needs to be monitored for at least one month to see if you are ovulating and if so, at what time. You should have a follicular study for this. Usually, if everything goes fine, ovulation occurs at the usual time of 14 days as in a normal 28-day cycle. Please get further advice from your doctor.

Its because, as per WHO, normal volume of semen is taken as 2 ml. But  The morphology is quite devastating. Required motility is >25% active motile and total motility is > 50%. Morphology of the sperm is very bad. So, over all you have low sperm concentration with low sperm motility and mostly abnormal sperm. The semen analysis report is not OK.  The problem is very severe.

Duphaston is dydrogesterone ,which is synthetic hormone that is very similar to progesterone. Duphaston, because of its ability to regulate the development of the uterine lining, often is used to treat irregular period. It is used to treat and regulate hormonal imbalance ,specifically progesterone deficiency an female sex hormone. It is safe to use while trying to get pregnant because it is designed to mimic a natural hormone that is necessary for healthy uterine lining.

Whate discharge from breast occurs due to prolactinoma i.e. increased production of prolactin hormone. prolactin is produced by an endocrine organ in the brain called pituitary gland. A tumor arising in this gland can cause increased production of prolactin and one of its symptoms is white discharge from nillples. Your doctor has ruled out this possibility by getting various investigations done like serum prolactin levels and X-ray of the head. Presence of a cyst is not a alarming finding as cysts occur in normal healthy females. Cysts do not interfere with conception until they are very large to hamper ovulation.

My pressure is sometimes as high as 150 over 110.  Any suggestions.  Thanks, Patt.","Doctor":"Hello,  You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week then once or twice a week.    If bp is persistently more than 140/90 mmhg, then medicines need to be changed. Occasional readings above 140/90 is acceptable. If majority of readings are above 140 then better to shift on other medicine like telmisartan Amlodipine combination 40/5 mg once a day.   Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according your capacity atleast 30 min a day and 5 days a week. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat.

Due to lack of awareness, my parents did not know the seriousness of the problem and also the local doctor in the small town did not advise them to get my testis descended through surgery well in time. On occasions while I was playing or running during my childhood and adolescence , I used to have swelling and pain on the sides of the root of penis where the testicles were probably stuck. The local doctor advised to rub Iodine ointment and relax. Ultimately I used to get relieved. Anyway, both the testicles were descended one by one through surgeries when I was 28. I got married at the age of 29 and was not aware of my problem as I did not face any erection problems and used to have night falls occasionally. After one and half year of our marriage without pregnancy, we approached our family GP to discuss the issue. I was asked to go through a semen analysis and it was revealed that I have zero sperm count. Following the physical examination of my testis, I was explained by the doctors that the size of the testis is small and that biopsy might not be very helpful. Their conclusion based on their experience was that the azoospermia may be irreversible. As I was following up developments in male infertility on some of the related websites and forums on the Internet, I was very happy when come to kmow from your website that there have been some successes in similar cases l. recently have semen s analysis but no sperms were observed.please let me know what tests report i should send u","Doctor":"hi, i understand your problem. Following is my reply : 1) Unfortunately. Your undescended testis may not give any sperms even if you do biopsy as they are small size. 2) even if you are not satisfied and want to get tested, youcan get tested by doing biopsy. 3 ) if any sperms are found during the biopsy or FNAC,you can undergo IVF / ICSI treatment. 4) If you still have undescended testis, i advice you to get your testis removed because there are chances of undescended testis undergoing cancer in future.regardz, dr.

Disadvantage of IUI-D: Your husband's genetic material is not transmitted to your child. Another theoretical disadvantage might be risk of transmission of infection which is largely avoided by screening donor for infectious diseases which most of sperm banks do. Medication can't be prescribed online. You may not need any medicines if your periods are regular. Just follicular study by ultrasound & properly timed IUI might suffice.

You can get a follicular study which includes series of ultrasound during the mid cycle time to visualize follicles in the ovary. It is these follicles which release egg for fertilization by sperm. In case your follicular study shown no ovulation which is likely possibility in your case as you have PCOD , you need to use drugs for ovulation induction. These drugs stimulate the ovaries to produce follicles and thereby egg release which helps you in conceiving. Drugs like clomiphene , letrozole are used.

Do not use them on your own as if used in wrong doses they can lead to serious complications. take care."},{"Patient":"I am currently taking Bravelle and just finished my last injections of 225 iu yesterday.

The episode of PSVT usually goes away with vagal maneuvers (coughing, deep breathing, muscle tensing or putting your face in ice-cold water). PSVT is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that occurs when a short circuit rhythm develops in the upper chamber of the heart which results in a regular but rapid heartbeat (150-200/min) that starts and stops abruptly. Alcohol, caffeine, anxiety, exercise or sudden movements, bending over may trigger the episode of PSVT. PSVT is diagnosed with continuous heart monitoring (Holter). One time ECG may be normal because the abnormality happens during the episodes. You did great job by avoiding alcohol, caffeine, quitting smoking and eating healthy food.  These are called life style changes which is initial step for the treatment of PSVT. Your episodes are very rare and short in duration therefor additional treatment is not indicated. Try to avoid situation that triggers the episodes (bending over) and use vagal maneuvers when the episode happens. You should seek medical attention if PSVT episode does not go away with vagal maneuvers or the episodes become longer up to few minutes. Also avoid over-the-counter decongestants or herbal medicines that may also trigger the episode.I hope the above information will be helpful for you.

After 4 cycles, if you don't conceive, chance of success in IUI decreases & better to go for IVF. As there are good chances of conception in this cycle don't think of future & relax. That might help.

Morphology of the sperm is reduced. But, there is presence of increased pus cells. Epithelial cells are within normal limit.

The visible pulse in your neck could be related to high blood pressure and tachycardia. Anyway, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a physical exam and some tests to exclude other possible causes that may lead to this clinical scenario: - a chest X ray study and pulmonary function tests- a cardiac ultrasound - an ambulatory  24-48 hours ECG monitoring to investigate for cardiac arrhythmia- complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance.

We underwent certain tests suggested by the doctors which showed absence of sperm in my semen & I have Azoospermia . My Dr. told me to do a testis doppler 1st to see if there s damage on it. The result came as Grade I reflux causing azoospermia. Then my Dr. immediately suggested me to go for a test tube baby and said theres no other option apart from it, which we are little hesitant about due to cost factors. My semen volume is only 0.5 ml & my harmones tests are all normal. I heard a microscopic surgery would cure the Grade I reflux. Is it possible to cure it through that surgery or is there an alternate way(siddha, homeo or allopathy thru medicines) for me to plan for a child. Kindly suggest. Regards, Vijay","Doctor":"hello thanks for writing in to HCM 1. grade 1 reflux really does not require surgery 2 As your hormones are normal - check the semen count at least on 3 occasions to confirm azoospermia 3 Microsurgery will be of use only when you have a obstructive azoospermia - you can recheck with a urologist and confirm the type of azoospermia and plan ahead hope to have answered your query dr nandita thakkar"},{"Patient":"My daughter is twenty six. When I was pregnant with her in the very early stages I ate some undercooked chicken and got opoisioning. Then when was on holidays I contracted thread worms from children we were travelling with. My duaghter was born a healthy seven and a half pounds. When she was sixteen and an avid ballet dancer her periods stopped for five years. she was underweight but then her periouds resumed. A doctor when she was sixteen said she had suffered ovarian failure, yet her periods did return after a few years albeit quite heavy and about every five weeks. I am now worried that as she is a good relationship that this episode has rendered her infertile. I might add I have tortured myself for years over this question and she had to have counselling as she felt like a freak. I feel the doctor should not have told her at sixteIen she would need donor eggs . Was this premature of him considering that her periods did eventually return?

But there is no proven benefit also. Starting aspirin may not solve your problem. You need some investigations to find out cause for repeated miscarriages. Though these investigations are costly, if abnormal some factors can be corrected to avoid miscarriage. You can ask your doctor about those investigations. Some basic cheap investigations are blood sugar level, VDRL, USG (Transvaginal) to find out uterine problems. Costly investigations like karyotype can be done or deferred according to your doctor's advice.

It is nice to know that your hormone levels are normal. If you are strict about your diet and take medications as prescribed by your treating doctor. Your type 2 diabetes will get under control.

In that case your husband can just repeat semen analysis to see the real situation. If its present on multiple occasions, better to go for investigating cause for it. Fertyl might help, but its not a proven formula. Other easy way is to eat plenty of antioxidants in form of tablet/dietary modification, avoid heat exposure to testis(wear loose fitting undergarment, avoid hot bath).

We went to another doctor in March 2012 and she prescribed Lupron depot inj for 3 mths and I got my mensus in Aug 2012..I want to know what are the chances to conceive with endo and should i wait for sometime and try iui or what else can be done..please help..Regards Neha","Doctor":"Hi, As you have already tried 5 cycles of IUI after laparoscopy, its better to try for treatment which gives better pregnancy rate which is IVF. As you have already received Inj Lupron Depot for 3 months, it would have been better to go for IVF immediately after 3rd dose of Lupron as it increases chances of pregnancy in IVF. But still its not too late. You can go for IVF straightforwards or can again take Lupron depot for 1-2 months & then go for IVF. IVF is definitely the best treatment for you. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Dear Dr, i lost my baby 5yrs back due to high B.P so my placenta blast separately. due to that since i am trying for the past 5yrs. but we lost lot money and mentally disturbed.

Now atlast they said to go for IVF . Now i went to MMM Hospitan n chennai and i met Dr.Thangam varma. i am doing all the test for IVF. Reports not yet received. Kindly advice me further process. Regards Abirami Sridhar","Doctor":"Hi, In case of both tubes being blocked, the only possible way for conception is through IVF. You should go ahead with IVF. Only thing you have to do is to find cause of high BP & loss of baby in last pregnancy so that same thing should not recur. You can ask your doctor for detailed investigations, but at least you can do LAC, anti beta2 glycoprotein antibodies & anticardiolipin antibodies. If any of these is positive, the tragedy can be prevented by giving you some medicines that you doctor will prescribe you. wish you good health."},{"Patient":"hi doctor.. my age is 29 yrs.married since 4 yrs.we were trying for conception since 2yrs but were unable to ,did hsg the reports were normal,then went for husbands semen analysis the count was on border line but later with treatment it improved,but still i didnt conceive so finally went for hysteroscopy and laproscopy and was diagnosed tubeberculosis the report says menstural sample from uterus -tb pcr positive ,so since march 9 th 2012 i started akt(rifampacin,isonizide,pyzinamide ,etanobutol) now after exact 6 months i missed my periods and when did upt the test was positive..i was taking akt till 8 sep...is conception safe..will it harm baby...my lmp was 8 august did upt on 22 sep.","Doctor":"Hi, AKT drugs are FDA catagory C drugs.

Also with the follicle size you described, after injection of hCG, there is very rare chance of ovulation failure.

Additionally not all cases of egg rupture can be seen on ultrasound. Sometime what you see is not unruptured egg but the corpus luteum. (Which normally forms after the egg is ruptured).

My doctor said, I will not get pregnant because of this situation and suggested some medication for 3 months. and also said if I wont conceive in these 3 months, she needs to do some tube test. I am really scared that I will never get pregnant. I desperately want a baby. Can you share your thoughts on the above? Thanks","Doctor":"hello thereMenstrual blood PCR positive for mycobacterium suggests endometrial tuberculosis. In the woman, it cause tuberculous endomteritis ( infection of the uterus) and salpingitis ( infection of the tubes). This infection can often be silent, and may not cause any symptoms or signs.Once the histologic diagnosis of TB endometritis has been made(like in your case), then treatment with antitubercular medicine must be started to prevent further progression of the disease. However, usually with TB endometritis,  infection of the fallopian tubes also occurs and the damage caused to the tubes ( TB salpingitis) is irreversible. Infection of tubes might result in irreversible tubal infertility, and the only treatment option available then to conceive would be IVF. In the past some doctors would try to do surgery to repair the tubes, but this is futile surgery, because the tubes never work properly once they have been infected. Tubes which have been severely damaged may form a hydrosalpinx( dilated tubes with infected fluid), and may need to be removed surgically, prior to IVF, if they are very large.Although antitubercular chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, surgery may be indicated where medical therapy has failed to resolve symptoms and in presence of a persistent pelvic mass. So i suggest for now you continue with your antitubercular drugs which has to be taken minimum for 6 months. At present you should not undergo any tube test as in presence of a genital infection, any kind of tube test is contraindicated as it might flare up the infection. Since your diagnosis of TB has been made , theres no use getting a tube test now. ONLY after you complete your treatment and get repeat PCR menstrual blood negative for mycobacterial infection, then you can go for tube test if you dont conceive.After treatment for genital TB, the conception rate is low (19.2%) with a livebirth rate of 7.2%.There is also an increase in ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage rates (when endometrial scarring occurs after infection). In vitro fertilisation should therefore be offered to you if you fail to conceive spontaneously.So dont worry, there are options to conceive. Take your folic acid tab simultaneously which increases chances to conceive and improves pregnancy outcome."},{"Patient":"Hi.
