I am seeing a cardiologist, because I sometimes have incidents of chest constriction, discomfort, sometimes lightheadedness (and now on Losartan I seem to have that every morning). These episodes pass in 10-15 minutes, but they leave me feeling weak. I ve had high blood pressure for several years and have been taking Atorvastatin and Metoprol, now also Losartan. I fear a real heart attack or stroke. This past week I had a chemical stress test and will find out next Friday if it revealed the cause of my condition. I also will let the doctors implant a very small heart monitor under my skin in two weeks. I just hope I last that long! I am really worried. My cardiologist thinks it s either A-fib or a blockage. Neither sounds very good. I haven t passed out yet, but about a month ago one of my constrictive events resulted in a dimming situation. After 3 Nitrostats and putting my head on my knees, I recovered, but that is the episode that got me referred to the cardiologist I m now seeing. Of course I ll be interested in your opinion.Thank you again. - Helene Langtry","Doctor":"Hello,In my opinion, you have two problems with your heart, one that will be treated with a pacemaker (that you call small heart monitor), that would be a blockade in your case because if it were A-fib, you must take medications for anticoagulation.The second is that chest pain, that would come from problems with your heart arteria. There is no connection between using your medications and pain aggravation. Seems that your second problem is becoming more dangerous. If you have chest pain, you should go to the emergency room.Hope I have answered your query.

I am 52 and over 12 months ago my semen (amount and appearance) drastically diminished - I also had blood in the fluid that was ejaculated (sometimes bright red fresh blood or dark brown older blood).  Because there is so little fluid that is produced, there seems to be very little feeling upon orgasm, it feels like because almost nil is coming out, that the orgasm sensation has all but gone.  I have had my prostate checked as ok. I have never have taken any illegal drugs or steroids etc or had any injuries (that I know of).  Recently upon orgasm, the minute amount of fluid can also look like dark urine.  Over the past years I occasionally experienced a sharp type pain that I can best describe as being in the area approx. 6\\" up inside me from my groin.  That pain seems to have gone, but so has 95% of the fluid gone when I ejaculate and what is left is very watery and none of the usual viscosity. Could I have had a bad infection in the seminal vesicle and because it has been left untreated for so long that irreversible damage has been done? My GP is baffled, but has put me on a course of BACTRIM for 20 days (1 tablet in the morning and another in the evening), but my fear is if it was/is an infection that the damage is permanent (assuming this is the problem). Thank you Bill","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCM.I have gone through your question.Your age is 52 and semen appearance is not good as bright red fresh blood seen with ejaculation, I would advise you to do first SEMEN ANALYSIS, then ultrasound of scrotum to see vascularity of testes, varicocele.

Since you are having a nasal allergy it is quite possible, you might be using nasal drops containing pseudoephedrine, sympathomimetic amine or alpha-adrenergic agonist like Xylometazoline which helps in reducing nasal congestion but can cause arrhythmias. Avoid too frequent use of nasal drop containing pseudoephedrine (e.g. Sudafed) or Xylometazoline (e.g. Otrivin). Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

First you need to regularise your cycles by taking oral contraceptive pills for 6 cycles and reducing weight, metformin tablet and multivitamin tablets after consulting your doctor.  With this your pcos will be treated and also cycles get regularised. After that you may start taking ovulation inducing drugs like clomephine .

The growth of fertilised egg and the abortion depends on many factors like your nutrition status, genetic abnormality in the egg etc. Travelling doesn't cause growth retardation.  Instead growth will be normal but abortion chances increase.  In your case I suspect genetic abnormalities in the egg. It is common to happen due to fertilisation with an abnormal sperm.

I went to a scheduled routine appointment with my PCP who did an ekg and found some nonspecific changes and sent me to the hospital. The ekgs were negative and they ruled me out for an MI, then went to a cardiologist and told me eventhough the ekg is neg. he think im having unstable angina and said i need an emergent cath based on my risk factors and one episode of chest discomfort a week prior, he said he does not trust a stress test as it can kill me with unstable angina.

I tried to find possible alternatives such as 64 CTA, but he says I may die if I wait and have to have the angiogram. I know cath is the gold standard, but cta has a comparable negative predictive value. Other studies such as a conventional pulmonary angiogram is the gold standard to rule out pulmonary embolism, but nowadays a pulmonary angiogram is almost never ordered to exclude a pulmonary emboli.   Am I being unreasonable to consider alternatives or is a cath is absolutely needed STAT?","Doctor":"Hello, Brief Answer: Considering the risk factors and clinical condition, you may have ischemic heart disease.Explanation: My opinion is that you have a complaint which is chest pain with effort.

However, I am not obese, in fact, quite fit, exercise often. I usually miss my periods every alternate month. I am 30 yrs now. Was on birth control pills for three months. In May this year, I underwent Ovulation Induction with Clomiphene tablet of 50 mg. On day 13th , my dominant follicle (total 5 in both ovaries) had matured to 24.5 mm. the endomitrium lining was 8.6 mm. That's when I took the HCG injection of 5000. I think my folllicles ruptured between day 15th and 16th. On all these days, I had intercourse with my husband. Unfortunately, my periods started and I did not conceive. What possibly could be the reason?After my periods started subsequent to a negative pregnancy result, I visited the doctor on day 2 again as I couldn't wait to find my answers and retry. The doctor advised me to do TVHSS-Hysterososal...graphy (to see if my tubes are blocked). I did this test on day 8th of my cycle. It was not blocked. Also, my follicle had grown till 13 mm. Do you think it is a good sign that my follicle will mature enough for ovulation to take place this time without stimulation? Since I am a PCOD patient, I am not sure about that. After that I have not done any  monitoring though my doctor had asked me to. My doctor suggested to try the natural way this cycle without stimulation. Today is day 12th. It is a sunday and therefore, all clinics are also closed. My questions are: If I do my monitoring tomorrow on day 13th, what is the size of follicle that is ideal for day 13th in my case where I have not undergone any stimulation? If it is a good size, would you recommend taking an HCG injection in my case? If so, when is the best day to do so - tomorrow itself or wait for another monitoring on day 14th? My doctor was also earlier suggesting that I undergo IUI in order to increase my chances of conception. Her plan was to give me clomid for next cycle, then do the whole process follwed by IUI. However, I am hoping that if the follicles mature well, and if there is a possibility to release my egg (if necessary, even with HCG injection), then I am keen to get an IUI in this cycle itself to increase my chances. Is this possible? Is it possible to get an IUI in a natural cycle with one follicle without stimulation? I also have another question - does taking medications and assistance for increasing chances of pregnancy, such as clomid, HCG, and IUI and so on have any side effects. For instance, I am concerned about the TVS tests. I feel that during the process of follicular monitoring, the gel that is used to scan may have adverse effect on the sperm motility. Can you pleasse provide answers to some if not all of my questions. I will be very grateful to you for the same. Also, if you can do it asap since i am already on day 12th and want to have a baby asap... since i have been trying for too long. last month was a very depressing month for me waiting to take the preg test and then gettign a negative.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing..i understand your concern..This is a case of unexplained infertility.. Dont take tension.. In my opinion this cycle you can try naturally. Tomorrow your follicle size might be around 18mm. repeat follicular study might be required on day 15 and when the follicle size reaches 20mm, hcg can be taken if you are too anxious.. IUI is done after 36 hrs of injection. Mostly it is done in a stimulated cycle as the chance of pregnancy increases with the no of follicles..TVS gel has no side effect of sperm motility. Repeated use of clomiphene has many side effects about which you neednot worry too much now.. Eat healthy and take adequate rest. In the post ovulatory period take progesterone for 10 days for luteal phase support. Hope I have answered your query. Good day."},{"Patient":"hi i have done my semen analysis it shows greyish white in color ph alkaline viscosity high liquifaction time 1 hour sperm count 1million pus cells 8-10 ,rbc 0-1, sperm morphology abnormal 90% actively motile 5% slugishly motile 5% non-motile 90% plz advise","Doctor":"HelloAfter going through your SEMEN analysis report I am writing these measures for you:As far as concerned about color, viscosity , reaction , Ph all are normal in your case .Normal FERTILITY is associated with sperm counts >48 million / mL , motility > 63 & morphology > 12 % exhibiting normal morphology.

Kindly get yourself evaluated by a cardiologist because valvular heart disease can give rise to seizure, tachycardia, blood in the cough. Normal ECG does not rule out any heart disease. You should be taking anti-epileptic to prevent a further episode of seizure. Also, check for your hemoglobin levels. High hemoglobin levels can also give rise to seizures. Please more water. Avoid dehydration. Regarding staying at home, you can carry your routine activities but avoiding traveling or staying alone since you already had two episodes of seizures. Better to be safe and careful.Hope I have answered your query.

The liquefaction time is increased. It means the semen takes more time to get a near transparent appearance. In a normal person, it should take less than 1 hour to get liquefied.

We, clinically take 39 million of total sperm count as normal.Motility of the sperm is very good. Clinically, we consider 40% or more total motility (rapid + progressive motility) as normal. Percentage of normal sperm is also within normal limit. Clinically, 04% sperm with normal morphology is considered as normal.Now, WBC. It is increased.

I started taking it one and a half years ago for high BP. My readings were 130-145/85-95. Since I am otherwise very healthy, my dr recommended daily cardio exercise. I chose stationary bike and walk my dog twice a day (about 1.4 miles both walks). In March 2017 I got a Peloton bike, and love it. I bike hard and noticed my BP returning to normal (ten minutes after bike, 120/77 range). I monitor the BP periodically and highest reading now is 145/90 but that is getting rare. Mostly it is under 120, and lower number ranges 82 to 77 (lowest). I would like to get off the amlodipine and continue my exercise program. I am 5 5 , weigh 120, eat healthy, low salt, natural organic foods, very little alcohol (almost none except special occasions, and that is small), and I don t smoke or use drugs (including over the counter). But I am a little nervous to quit the amlodipine, being on it one and a half years now (Dec 2015-June 2017). The side affect which I get and don t like is flushing. It happens periodically through the day and night. Like I feel this hot flushing feeling and want to rip off my sweatshirt even though I was cold before. I never got the leg swelling, though I read a lot of people get that. I plan to see my dr this summer to discuss but curious for your feedback on discontinuing the amlodipine 5 mg. Thank you for any advice. Debbie","Doctor":"Hello,Firstly I would appreciate your efforts to keep blood pressure in control and doing all the right things which you are currently following. Please continue the same things. Stopping amlodipine can increase your blood pressure since you are taking it for a long period. I would suggest you decrease the dose of amlodipine from 5 mg to 2.5 mg once a day. Monitor your blood pressure if blood pressure increases, then you need to continue the amlodipine 5 mg regularly. If on taking amlodipine 2.5 mg blood pressure remains below 120/80, then you can withhold blood pressure medicine for a few days and monitor blood pressure regularly. If blood pressure increases then can restart amlodipine 2.5 mg. Please do not stop blood pressure medicine suddenly as this is the common mistake done by the majority of patients after the blood pressure is in control. Currently, your blood pressure is normal range because of lifestyle changes and blood pressure medicines. Kindly note blood pressure reading is not sufficient to make a decision about the dose of blood pressure medicines.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Aparna Amritsagar"},{"Patient":"My hsuband and I are both 37 and have been trying for a baby for eight months.

Normal liquefied semen would allow pouring drop by drop from a container . A 5 ml pipette could also be used to test viscocity and the drop formed at the tip of the pipette should not be more than 2 cm long ( you yourself can check at home with this method).The percentage contribution of each of secretions that make seminal fluid is as follow:Testes 5%, seminal vesicles 46-80%, prostate 13-33 % and bulbourethral gland 2-5 %.Number of sperm and speed of sperms move matters with morphology and motility.However a viscous semen  may limit the speed of sperms , so please write down the number , motility , morphology and speed of sperms in detail.Viscocity is not so specific .Hope this will help you.In my opinion consult another INFERTILITY specialist and get his opinion.J pouch surgery is not so specific at this moment.Good luck."},{"Patient":"hi doctor, Im akila .

Yes, you can conceive with irregular periods, only that its difficult to determine the age of the baby and the proximate date of delivery. Regular ultrasound should be able to say it for sure, and also see if the baby is growing as he should. For this reason, do them every 2-4 weeks for now until it has determined it.

Rather you can fly down to the India and get the IVF done and I bet after all expenditure you will still save the money.As you have done your Tubal Ligation the natural path of Ovum is now blocked and hence it is not possible for your ovum to meet your husbands sperms and make you pregnant. In IVF your Ovums are extracted through OPD based surgical procedure and then made fertile with the help of your husbands sperms in a petridish this is now called a embryo and this embryo is transferred in your uterus and the pregnancy proceeds as usual...You are already having two kids.. At Advance age of pregnancy the chances trisomy increases that may make you child suffer from at least Mental retardation.. Talk more with your genetic counselor..

I would advise you not to exercise during an episode of palpitation, instead of a rush to the hospital to get urgent ECG (electrocardiograph ). It will help you to find out the cause of the palpitation. A proper evaluation to find out the cause of palpitation is very important. Goodnight eight hours sleep, healthy nutritious diet, and adequate water intake and mediation along with your blood pressure medicine should help you.

Fastforward 2 weeks, I still haven't gotten my peroid, my breasts are swollen and nipples tender and I have become extremely sensitive to smells. I took another hpt today and it was negative, could my hcg be too low to read on a hpt?","Doctor":"Hello,thanks for using health care magicI have read your query with a lot of concern. The first thing i find is a little ambiguity as to why your hpt were positive and two weeks later negative.It most likely scenario is that the hpt gave false positive results. Normally, pregnancy test becomes positive at two weeks after fertilisation i.e. about the time the next menses was about to start and the first symptom thus is absent of menses in most cases.If truly, the tests were positive, then you might have been pregnant long before you even started taking the drugs and you must have had a miscarriage that has resulted in negative hpt. However, this is also ambiguous because it requires averagely three weeks for the test to become negative after termination of pregnancy.If you recently became pregnant and its less than 4 weeks(you have not yet missed your period), the hpt will be negative.Best regardsDr Achuo"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You are having Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). I want to explain you few sign and symptoms of pcos. PCOS is recognised as an entity occurring in young females with chronic anovulation with estrogen presence and having the following symptoms:1. Androgen excess amnifesting as hirsutism and acne.2. Menses irregularities, dysfunctional uterine bleeding or amenorrhea (as in your case irregular bleeding present with amenorrhea).3. Obesity with glucose intolerance (as you are having over weight, so this is due to pcos).Lab reports: 1. Alteration in LH/FSH ratio.2. Elevated serum testosterone level3. Ultrasound  findings, of atretric follicles with increased ovarian stroma.I mentioned all these so that you can understand more about your disease. Duphastone, for example dydrogesterone is also prescribed for irregular bleeding, for infertility, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and endometriosis.So your doctor prescribed a right dose for your case because you are having irregular bleeding, amenorrhea, and infertility. Duphastone is also indicated for endometriosis. So take this drug and consult your doctor for infertility or another infertility specialist.Hope I have answered your query.

Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) starts abruptly with rapid, regular heart beat and stops on its own. Some patients may also experience lightheadedness, chest discomfort, sweating or breathlessness.Usually, there are no any structural abnormalities in the heart but abnormal electric conduction in the heart chambers causes rapid heartbeat. The diagnosis can be confirmed by ECG, holter monitoring or electrophysiological studies.The occasional episodes of PSVT without any other symptoms commonly have a good prognosis. PSVT is induced by certain risk factor which you should avoid: alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, illegal drug use and stress.Life style changes such as regularly exercising and eating healthy food rich in fruits and vegetables helps to prevent PSVT episodes.To stop the episode of PSVT you may try vagal manures such as Valsalva maneuver (ie, forceful attempted exhalation against a closed airway), breath holding, carotid massage or immersing your face in ice-cold water.But if the rapid heartbeat does not stop in a few minutes, new symptoms develop or the episodes become more often you should contact your cardiologist.Hope I have answered your query.

Please type your query here...                     Where do I begin? I have a LOT of things wrong (C/T/L spine HNP, CM1, EDS, MVP, Asthma, recently developing scoliosis, OSA), and am in pain every day. I am a 25 yo female, 60 tall and weigh 137. My BP was 166/87 today. I wake up 5/7 mornings with a headache and nausea immediatly after getting up (not pregnant). I ve been experiencing this terrible ear pain in my left ear (like something sharp stabbing it) that comes and goes. Can you tell me if this is related to maybe high CSF as I am already on Neptazane (or methazolamide) to reduce the amount of CSF I produce. I also often notice when I change positions that I will have the sensation of sudden pressure in my head and can feel my heart beat. Another problem I was having earlier was my left hand started tingling and curling up (with no offense please, but kind of the way a child with down syndrome s hand might appear). At the same time I was having alot of pain in that elbow, the back of my arm and to my scalpula area on that side. Should I be alarmed? I haven t started any new medication yet, so I m not so sure it was that.

IVF is quite safe procedure so don't worry. Since your husband sperm count is low IVF increases chances of pregnancy.  Here healthy sperms are fertilised with egg and put into uterus.

Once embryo is transferred and you conceive it is same as like normal pregnancy and you will complete it as normal pregnancy only. You will give birth to healthy baby as they screen embryo for many diseases and put only healthy embryo.

Clomid is ovulation inducing drug. But many people with pcos sometimes won't respond to clomid. This is common. So next step would be combining clomid with fsh injection. Duphaston helps endometrium to prepare for  pregnancy.  If pregnancy doesn't happen then period comes. If pregnancy occur then duphastone prevent early abortion. Though you ovulate if sperm can't meet the egg fertilisation wont occur.  I would advice you to get your husband semen analysis.  If it is normal along with clomid and fsh go for IUI.

What steps can i take to be more fertile.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM.Don't worry masterbation in excess doesn't cause infertility. Its better to ware boxers because it will be more loose so that there won't be increased local temperature compared to briefs.

Due to over weight the production of healthy sperms may be hampered and also the motility of sperms may be less.Due to over weight there will be more fat in body so more production of oestrogen which is female sex hormone. This decreases sperms production by reducing testosterone(male sex hormone) levels. Also tend to produce abnormal sperms.Do some some life style modifications like --     Reduce weight, do exercise.-     Stop smoking and alcohol. -     Avoid caffeine.-     Ware loose under garments.-     Healthy diet with multivitamin and zinc.-     Avoid trauma to testis.Hope I have been helpful.Regards     Dr. Ashish Verma"},{"Patient":"Hi,My weight is 57 KG and age is 29 yr, im under treatment for my infertility problem my doctor have prescribed me Myrin P 3 Tab/Day before break fast as ESR level is 43 just 2 weeks ago,I just wanted to know that what else should i take with it or should i have to go with it or not , because i am not sure about the medicine.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM.I suggest you to reconsult your doctor and find out the cause of prescribing myrin p3. Because it is anti tubercular drug which is used if any part of body tuberculosis is diagnosed.Raised ESR is one of minor finding in TB. Esr will be raised in all infections and many other diseases . So only on that basis anti Tb treatment is usually not started. You need to get investigated yourself to know site of TB and also to rule it out. Some tests needed to rule out TB like blood ADA level , chest X-ray etc.For your infertility I suggest you to get your follicular study. By this you will come to know you are producing eggs or not. Here serial ultrasound abdomen done on various day of monthly cycle.  If any abnormality found out can be treated. I suggest to start folic acid daily after consultation. It improves egg production.Hope I have been helpful.Regards     Dr. Ashish Verma"},{"Patient":"hello, i am 30 Yr old and trying to conceive for the past 1.6 Yrs and i have not conceived till now.

Day 12th of LMP: Right Ovary- Only 1 follicle @ 24*21mm, Endometrium- 9.1mm3. Day 13th of LMP: Right Ovary- Only 1 follicle @ 25*21mm, Endometrium- 9.1mm4.

He also said orally that some blood is seen, but both the follicle have not ruptured yet. Please help me interpret all this data. Does it mean that both the follicles have ruptured and filled with fluid. Or is it something else. Please tell.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM .Let me explain you what is happening in you and what should happen normally in a female. Normally the follicles start growing and reach a size of 20 to 22mm and rupture. This is called ovulation.  After rupture the size of follicle reduces significantly and also there won't be any blood inside.In your case your follicles have grown more then normal and have not ruptured and have become a cyst. Since the follicle has reached such a size, the blood vessel will stretch and break leading to blood inside it. The treatment for this is initially conservative with antibiotics . If don't reduce then puncture it. I suggest you to discuss with your gynac . I assume you are not taking any ovulation inducing drugs. In future to avoid such complication I advice you to get your follicular study on day 12 andonce size is more then 20mm  take hcg injection.  This will rupture the follicle .

My doctor told it normally happens like this in 1 or 2 cycles in a year and not to worry. Please advise if this is right.

Let it be any tension it will impair your hormone levels and follicle won't grow. Normal development of follicle depends on many factors like your hormone levels, stress, obesity, high surrounding temperature etc. So don't worry and try to avoid things which are possible.

If this doesn't happen I suggest you to show your doctor and get dose increased if feasible or else add another ovulation inducing drug to it.I also suggest you not to go for IUI until your follicle is grown properly and ruptured . Let me tell you some facts about IUI.  It is intrauterine ingestion of sperms . Here sperms are washed and processed and healthy sperms are placed in uterus . For fertilisation to occur your follicle should be ruptured and ovum should travel into tube where sperm will be there.  If your follicle not matured only then no ovum produced so no fertilisation occur.Also before going to IUI you should get your tubal patency test done. If tubes are normal then you should go for IUI.

Bloating is common side effect of all drugs used to treat infertility.  No need to take any treatment for this.

I saw in internet tht it is very harmful.  Can I take this medicine? Can I talk about this matter to my doctor? I m very confused:(","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM .Letrozole you are taking have harmful side effects . So I suggest you to discuss with your doctor regarding use of alternative drugs.Ovulation inducing drugs like clomephine are used as first line for ovulation disorders. It is comparatively safer then letrozole and can be taken for 3 to 6 cycles. It helps multiple follicles to mature and rupture . Thus increasing chances of pregnancy.  If clomephine fails then second line of drug used is fsh injection along with clomephine. Letrozole   is routinely used at later stages when all other drugs fails because of its harmful side effects. Hope I have been helpful .RegardsDr.Deepika Patil"},{"Patient":"HELLO DOCTOR...i have deficiency of vitamin B12 ansd I'm pure vegetarian plz suggest in medicine what can i have. and plz suggest that medicine which is easily avaible in India and it should be affordable.I'm also suffering infertility. my age is 40 years. plz guide me.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM .For Vit B12 deficiency I would suggest you to take neurowin forte tablet once daily. It is available in India and is affordable.  This contain vitamin B 12 content more unlike regular multivitamins which contain maintenance dose of nutrients.  So can't be used for deficiency. For your infertility I suggest you to get your follicular study done and start with ovulation inducing drugs like clomephine . This will help multiple follicles to mature and rupture . I suggest you to get your tubal patency done and go for IUI as your age is more. IUI is intrauterine ingestion of sperms . Ovulation drugs and IUI done in same cycles. They are related treatment.   You should also get your thyroid profile checked and prolactin level checked.

It is intrauterine ingestion of sperms.  Here sperms are washed and processed and healthy sperms are placed in uterus . This will increase the chances of pregnancy.  You can go for 4 to 6 cycles of IUI.  There are no strict rules to tell exactly when you can conceive.  You should have positive attitude and try your best. Don't take stress. That is major cause for infertility. Hope I have been helpful . RegardsDr.Deepika Patil"},{"Patient":"Me and my wife were undertreatment for last 3years as we dont have kids .

So we want to know is there any treatment to solve the problem of this bend fallopian tube.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM .There is no treatment for bend in fallopian tube. If block is there recanalisation can be done .In your IVF issue I would suggest you to discuss about invitro maturation with yor doctor.  In this  many eggs are removed on day 2 or 3 and they are grown outside the body. They fertilize 4 to 5 eggs and place it back into uterus . By this the problem of not forming egg is solved and also side effects of taking so many fertility drugs is avoided.This increases chances of conception.

My GP put me on fertomid but i want to know how it works and if it is successfull.How long do I have to take it before it helps. What more can I do..?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM .Fertomid is ovulation inducing agent. It means it helps your follicles to grow properly and mature . It also cause multiple follicles to grow. This increases the chances of conception.  I would suggest you to undergo follicular study which will tell you are ovulating properly or not. If your ovulation is proper you can continue min 3 cycles of fertomid.If there is not adequate response to fertomid then you need to add fsh inj with that. But follicular study is must whenever you take fertility tablets. I would suggest you to take hcg inj or leupride after discussing with your doctor when your follicle size is more then 19mm.I wish you concieve with this . But if it fails then you need to get tubal patency test.One more thing I want to suggest is you get your hormone test done if not done yet.

Abortion and D and C may cause adhesions or tubal block. But these things can be diagnosed by HSG and hysteroscopy. If they are not there then your abortion is not the cause for infertility.

If adhesions are still there then in same setting with that hysteroscopy the adhesions can be released.So it would be both diagnosis and treatment . Along with that any growth in uterus or the opening of tube is blocked also can be diagnosed.Other investigations needed at initial stage are follicular study hormone profile- thyroid, fsh,Lh, prolactinhysterosalpingo graphy (HSG).Just go through the list you must have done many among them.

So I generally suggest to have intercourse from 12 hrs after injection to 48hrs later. This is the ideal period. And the sperms have the capacity to survive in uterus for 2 to 3 days .

This indicates that your ovary is hyperstimulted by siphene. Presence of 2 to 3 follicle also suggest the same. So only you are  adviced to take injection to rupture it . As there are more chances that this may grow further and may not rupture by itself. Don't worry hyperstimultion is common with fertility drugs and it is controlled by fertigyn injection.

I read very carefully your problem.As far as you may know the HSG or hysterosalpingogram is the kind of examination used in cases when Tubal Factor Infertility(any anatomic abnormality that prevents the sperm and egg from uniting) is to be detected, which means if the cause of a possible infertility is any of the fallopian tube or both of them. The fact that the fallopian tube,the left one is patent means that it is not blocked, so it is opened and no obstructions are visualized. The right side has a cornual blockage which means that the tubes are blocked at the end near the uterus. This can occur because of infection, endometriosis, dried secretions in the tube, mucus in the tube or scar.Also what I would suggest is that your sister should consult an OBGYN doctor, because there are many clinical management protocols about this problem and this specialized doctor could provide her with a useful solution especially if she wants to get pregnant.Good luck and hopefully my answer would help"},{"Patient":"sir, on feb i go through DndC on march i get my periods But on april and may  i didnt get my period then i take mendate as my gnae suggested and on june 3rd i get my periods by on july i again didnt get my period and i want to conceive what should i do plz help","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM. First you should find out the cause why you are having irregular cycles. I suggest you to get done hormone test. These include serum prolactin levels ,  thyroid hormones and Lh, Fsh. If these hormones are high then it can be treated with medications..I would also suggest you to undergo ultrasound of abdomen to diagnose polycystic ovary disease. This is very common nowadays and causes irregular cycles.  Emotional stress also cause irregular cycles. So first you should be stress free and happily plan for pregnancy.

It is better to go for IVF according to me. Let me explain you why so. You have got 2 IUI failed. You are trying for last 2 yrs also. Since your all other investigations are normal it means there is problem in fertilisation.  In IVF that fertilisation is done outside so increased chances of conceiving. Yes you can become pregnant.

The age gap between you and your husband doesn't matter much . So don't worry .Yes you can use fertility tablets even after your previous abortion. First line of fertility drugs is clomephine citrate which helps in egg maturation.  Before that you should undergo follicular study to know egg maturation and ovulation timing. You can discuss this with your doctor. Under guidance you should take . 2nd line of drug used is Fsh injection if clomephine fails.

Since your 29yrs and also you have tried for  6 months . So better to go for ovulation inducing drugs. These cause multiple egg to mature and rupture so more chances to conceive.

I personally suggest to undergo this therapy atleast for 3 cycles before further investigation is needed. I would like to suggest you to go for intrauterine ingestion(IUI) of sperm along with aromek treatment. This increases chances of conceiving as sperms are processed and healthy sperms are injected. Before getting IUI I sugget you to get tubal patency done. You can discuss with your doctor about this.

He was found unresponsive with a nose bleed and drooling still in his truck and he died.. I was told my EMS that he was gone by the time they got there. They resusitated CPR, shocks, fluids, but they couldn t get his heart started. He was 59. What could have caused the bleeding from the nose and drooling? He was obese and was hypertensive, but it was controlled well. Didn t have usual heart symptoms. I just wish I had answers to what happened to him.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I am sorry about your husband. He seems to have suffered a sudden heart attack. The nose bleeding could be indicative of uncontrolled high blood pressure, probably related to the chest pain. Drooling is a normal reaction to the pain and does not indicate any specific medical disorder. As your husband was obese and hypertensive, which are known cardio-vascular risk factors, a heart attack seems to be the most probable cause related to this clinical scenario. Hope to have clarified some of your uncertainties!Wishing all the best, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"hello dr, i a having pcos problem abt 4 years... first my  prescribed me metformin. but my heath is not improved that much. after that she suggested me a tablet named oo sure... and she td me that the egg is also rupturing.. for that i take fertomid.. now i want to get pregnant.. is it possible? please reply me...","Doctor":"Dear member,Thanks for writing to healthcare magic.The tablet metformin is good for pcos though you may have gut problems like nausea and diarrhea.You need to have a low calorie and low carbohydrate diet if you are overweight.Oosure is good for the quality if egg.

Though your pregnancy test came negative you may be pregnant. This can be confirmed by serum b-hcg level. Sometimes after fertilisation it take time for impaction of embryo.Other possibility is after egg became 22mm it could have become a cyst instead of rupturing.  After one week I suggest you to get one more ultrasound scan done. For increasing chances of pregnancy you can 1)after taking fertyl tablet when your egg is of size more then 19mm you  take hcg injection under your doctor guidance. 2)after confirming your egg is ruptured you  get intra uterine ingestion(IUI) of semen by your doctor.

Infertility in your case is more likely to be due to inconsistent sex. To conceive you need regular sex during your fertile period. By this chances to become pregnant is 80% in 1st year n 95% in 2nd year.Fertile period is normally between day 12th to day 17th for female having regular 30 days menstrual cycle.

The intramenstrual bleeding of 2 to 3 drops is normal when you are taking duphastone tablet. Dont worry for that it will stop.Clomid tablet help for proper maturation and growth of eggs. This is first line of treatment for those having ovulation problem. It helps in pregnancy. Duphastone is given for maintaing initial pregnancy if at all you conceive. For my patients I also advice to take oestrogen tablets from day 8 which helps in preparing endometrium for implantation.  You can discuss with your doctor about this.Also get regular follicular study to watch the growth of egg and when it is more then 19mm you take hcg injection which helps it to rupture and not become cyst instead under your doctor guidance.Hope I have been helpfulRegardsDr.Deepika Patil"},{"Patient":"I had bronchitis and was on zpac, steroid pack, inhaler for wheezing.

As we have not been really trying for long, hardly once or twice, we have had unsafe sex, no record/consideration of cycle etc. So why I am under Infertility medication, without a confirmed infertility (as per internet information  about these meds)? It is really scary at times, please help.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM.

In your case since you need to induce your menstrual cycles there could be problem in ovultaion. I wish you conceive this time. If you couldn't then I advice to get a follicular study. This gives information about your ovulation pattern and time. If you are ovulating normally then no need to take all these hormones  and try for 6 months. If you are not ovulating normally then you should take these hormones.All hormones which you are taking have there side effects like weakness , leg pain etc. But if you get severe side effect like abdomen distension or breathlessness you should inform your doctor and stop medication.

Since by day 12 your ovum has not increased in size means they are not responding to ovulet . One thing I would suggest is for one cycle you can increase dose of ovulet to 100mg and even 150mg under your doctor guidance. Or you can switch directly to ovulet with Fsh injection. This have more chances to ovulate normally. I would  suggest you to get your follicular study regularly and once ovum become more then 19mm take hcg injection under your doctor guidance. This will help the ovum to rupture.  I also suggest to undergo intrauterine ingestion of semen.

Gastroesophageal reflux could be the cause of your complaints. A musculo-skeletal pain can not be excluded too. Coming to this point, I agree with your doctor prescription on the painkiller (ibuprofen) and the PPI for reflux (nexium). If your situation does not improve, I would recommend performing a fibrogastroscopy.
