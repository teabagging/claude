Once you suddenly get up, blood supply to brain decreases and one gets dizziness, fainting etc.   You should get morning serum cortisol levels and sugar levels done And also echo if possible to look for the cause of low bp.   I n treatment, you should make behavioral changes like avoiding sudden change in posture, increasing fluid and salt intake in the diet. You can also wear compression stockings in order to prevent such dizziness. If none is helpful, then you can also get medicine like fludrocortisone prescribed for your low bp.

As fat accumulates in the abdomen, it also accumulates in liver leading to liver damage and elevation of enzymes. Also, you should reconfirm the elevation.  Do you drink alcohol if yes it could be a reason. Also, you should get one viral marker test done like HBsAg, Anti HCV, in order to rule viral hepatitis.

If bp is persistently more than 140/90 mmhg, then you should be on medicines for it like telmisartan or amlodipine. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according your capacity atleast 30 min a day and 5 days a week. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat.

I keep going outside to work on stuff whether it s working here at my place welding together livestock fencing or going to work for other people doing heavy duty yard work. It s cold outside and it keeps affecting me to the point that I feel like I regress into being sick again. Then I get sicker and can t really do much for a day or day and a half til I feel better. My lungs have slightly ached while I ve been sick, kinda like I ve felt in the past when I ve been sick. This morning I woke up and they hurt a little. Today I went to chop down trees for someone and was carrying logs and big branches and was working outside and progressively it became more and more painful to breathe in. So painful it was debilitating. Breathed in, and sharp crazy pain. Way more painful than breaking ribs or anything. Breathed out the pain eased up. If I held my breath there was no pain at all. It s only in the lower right lung. I have had no blunt force injury to the chest cavity. My Mom s a SICU nurse and listened to my heart - said it sounds good. But said that there is a little noise in the lower right lung though where it is painful, like there is a bit of Pleurasy rubbing. But she said that my breathing overall sounds pretty normal. She gave me some ibuprofen and some other anti-inflammatory stuff (prednisone) that should help, and told me to rest and stay away from activity for a bit. She thinks it s Pleurasy. Oh one more thing. I sometimes feel an almost slight popping sensation in that lung when I breathe in deeply. She told me it s most likely Pleurasy and not a lung clot. She said a clot would come on suddenly and not have quite the same symptoms. I layed down for a couple of hours and the pain is tolerable now. I have pain still but not so debilitating. I don t feel like I m going to die now. So overall, pain started around 12noon and got way worse til 4:30, till I could barely walk around. I stopped working, rested, for a couple hours, just woke back up, and the pain has eased up. It s 7:30 now and I feel like I m no longer going to die. It s one of the worst pains I ve ever felt and I do landscape and have been in some pretty painful situations where I put my body to the max. Okay here s the question: I didn t tell my Mom that I m on spironolactone and estinyl. I m not ready to come out to her about being transgendered. A possible side effect of these is that there can be blood thickening. Do you think this sounds like something that could be causing the pain? I imagine I m physically active enough and drink enough liquids to keep from having blood clotting problems. But I want someone s opinion. I mean I have had a really bad cold recently which could cause Pleurasy I suppose but could it be a clot or pulmonary embolism? or something else? I haven t had any real side effects from the hormones I m taking. I don t have insurance and can t afford to go to doc visits or any expensive testing. I asked my Mom about Pulmonary Embollism stuff as a possibility and she said it s most likely not that because the pain has eased up so much. She said that she would talk to the residents at the hospital she works at and see what they say. Anyway, do you think I have anything to worry about regarding taking the hormones? I am an otherwise very healthy person.","Doctor":"Hello According to the history no persistent cold is not sign either of pleuresy nor pulmonary embolism.Probably alergy is the cause.

I had a general anesthetic for an ultrasound guided transperineal implantation of radio-iodine seeds two days ago. That evening when I resumed eating, I almost immediately experienced very severe pain in my chest on swallowing,and, indeed was unable to swallow, as even a teaspoonful of water or my own saliva was regurgitated. This pain became worse and was the most severe I have ever experienced. After a couple of hours it eased and is only a slight soreness on swallowing now. The expert staff at the hospital treated it with diligence,and, being chest pain, checked for heart problems ( ecg, cardiac enzyme blood tests etc. ). No result there. I felt it was esophageal pain/esophageal sphincter contraction, and as intubation was only in the trachea-caused by the G.A.? The guess by the staff was esophageal spasm caused by something in the G.A., but not sure. Would appreciate your advice. Many thanks. John Lannen.

Quit smoking 8 days ago. For the last 8 days, I have been suffering with lung inflammation that has caused constant shortness of breath (it does not stop for even one second), as well as occasional chest tightness/pain. I finally saw a Pulmonologist this past friday who performed extensive lung tests on me which all came back as normal, minus a test which showed I am not exhaling as much as I should be. He said I am not exhaling as much because of the constriction in my lungs brought about by the inflammation. He says I do not have COPD or any other lung disease. He also listened to my lungs and heard a lot of what he calls wheezing and crackling . He prescribed me Symbicort 160/4.5 and said that should combat the inflammation. However, on sunday (2 days later) I had noticed absolutely NO improvement in my shortness of breath so he put me on Prednisone 40 mg (tapered down for 16 days) as well as Singulair. He also told me to continue taking the Symbicort (2 inhalations twice a day). I must add (in case this is important) that a week before the noticeable inflammation began, I was on Levaquin 500 mg and Medrol Dose Pack (2 packs one after the other). I just finished the Medrol a few days ago, and completed the Levaquin today. I have a few questions: A) If I was on the medrol, shouldnt it have stopped or alleviated any inflammation that started? My pulmonologist said that type of steroid isnt meant to treat lung inflammation, but why not? B) How long until I should expect seeing results from the medicine I am currently on? This S.O.B. is extremely debilitating and I would really like to see improvement. WILL I EVEN SEE GUARANTEED RESULTS?? C) If I do not see results from this treatment, what are the next steps to take? Hospitalization? Stronger medication? I would really like to know what I am in for (if this question even applies after reviewing my story). My Pulmonologist just seems so laid-back about everything and told me I should see results with the Prednisone in a week. I wanted a second opinion that is straight-forward because I am not sure I even have the full faith anymore that results will come soon! Please help and provide your expertise to the best of your ability.

Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ecg is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour HOLTER monitoring. So visit nearby cardiologist for these investigation.   Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard.Is there any stress or anxiety associated, as it can also be a panic attack. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab ciplar LA 20 mg once a day.    If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiological studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am Ramesh from Chennai.

Was put on an antibiotic which seemed to take care of the problem. Last night, I was relaxing on the couch and felt a very sudden sharp stabbing pain in my L arm that radiated to my chest. It happened twice. It alarmed me enough to sit up and move my arm wondering what the pain was. Shortly after I experienced a \\" derealization\\" episode and ringing in my ears. It subsided within five minutes. Right after I had hot flashes that were quickly replaced by chills. I did experience very very dull chest pain for about 20 minutes after the episode and I went back to feeling normal. For the past three years I have also had episodes where I feel as If I black out, but it only happens when I'm standing. I know it's coming on be cause my legs will start to lose their strength and in my trying to keep myself up they will start to shake ( and I mean shake a lot). There have been a few times people have been around me and said that I grabbed onto them to hold myself up and was digging my fingernails into their back and wasn't responding to them when they would tell me to stop. I would quickly come to and remember I had an episode. I'm being passed off as an anxiety case which would be okay with me if I had any tests done to show me it's nothing more serious. I did not have anxiety problems until I started with these weird symptoms. While the DR's think the symptoms are coming from anxiety, I think the anxiety is coming from not being diagnosed and dealing with these scary symptoms. What would you recommend?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Since you are active smoker, we should definitely rule out heart diseases for your symptoms. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases.

I think this may be either heart burn or anxiety but dont want to book an appointment at the doctors because I dont want to waste their time if it is only one of the above. Basically a few months ago, I had to run to catch my train home and I experienced chest pain, couldnt breath, had an aching cold pain in my bottom teeth, pains in my back etc so I called NHS direct when I got home as i was wheezing even after a 2 hour journey home and they sent me to the hospital to get checked over, I was in there for approximately 70 secs and the doctor sent me away and said im not having a heart attack. I booked an appointment the next day to see a doctor and he checked my chest and said I had a cold coming on and he could only put it down to a panic attack unless he made me go and do a run. This happens quite frequently when I have to sprint which I advised the doctor. Since this happened, I keep getting twinges in my heart, quick sharp pains, I googled it and found that it may be down to anxiety, but I get it when I walk round the house and often when i run up the stairs. Last night I went to the gym and im quite concerned now as I was fast jogging on the running machine and started to experience this pain in my heart after about 15 minutes, it was quite mild but I continued to run for an extra 5 minutes and the pain got quite painful but only happend when I breath in, it was as if my lungs were pushing against my heart when I inhaled. I obviosuly stopped running and when my heart rate got back to normal, the pain went away.

It was severe enough that I couldn t concentrate and accompanied by nausea. It starts at my breast bone and curves upward towards my right shoulder. It feels like a tube of pain and also radiates into my back between my spine and rt shoulder blade. It also feels as if something is pushing on my windpipe at the bottom of my neck.

Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Ecg should be done and is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need also 24 hour holter monitoring if ecg is not informative. So visit nearby cardiologist for these investigation.   Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard.   Is there any stress or anxiety associated, as it can also cause this.

Last week I developed a high fever with my body feeling extremely cold - it took hot tea, layers of clothes and a wool blanket to feel somewhat warm again.  The strange thing was that my chest, just under the breasts, felt very tight - like someone had tied a belt around my chest and was pulling it tight, more prominent on the right side.  I could breathe but could not take deep breaths because it hurt very badly.  I didn't feel like eating much of anything - just smoothies and ice cream.  After two days the fever and chest pain went away.  The following day the fever and chest pain returned, then went away again. But still, I feel the pain around my chest and it is pains me to take deep breaths. I still don't have much of an appetite, and especially after I eat my chest hurts (tightness) and deep breaths are impossible.  I don't work, have no kids and have no stress in my life - so I know it isn't anxiety.

I have had lap banding (vbg) about 6 years ago and have kept the weight off.  I have trouble keeping food down and have been vomiting it up to relieve some of the pain.  I also have a large hernia (from the surgery), which took over 200 stitches to close.  I am just wondering if I have caused some problem to my chest or throat from all the throwing up I have done.  I do this at least once a day if not more.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Since you had banding surgery possibility of spasm of lower esophageal sphincter is more likely. This sphincter plays very important role in swallowing.

Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ecg is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holter monitoring if episodes are occurring on daily basis so that it can pick it. So visit nearby cardiologist for these investigation.Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard.     Is there any stress or anxiety associated, if yes it can also cause it.   Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab ciplar LA 20 mg once a day which will take care of such episodes and also anxiety.

My doctor noticed that my lung capacity is below the normal, and it appears to be some sort of allergy (he said there was an \\"asthma component\\"). For this reason, I was given a Buventol EasyHaler (salbutamol) inhaler which I was supposed to use each day for a month (it's been nearly a month now). However, in the last four days, I've been feeling a constant discomfort in my chest. I don't have a word to describe this feeling. It's not painful. I think I feel it more when breathing out than breathing in. It feels like it comes from somewhere behind where the clavicles meet, at the base of the throat (but not from the throat itself). On the first morning that I had this sensation, I was also feeling nauseous (it was after having one cold glass of apple juice). I've been taking dietary supplements (1 pill a day), and occasionally allergy pills (Cetirizin Hexal).What is this feeling? I am worried, because so many websites list chest discomfort as an emergency, but I don't want to call a false alarm if this is something else. I have an appointment with the house doctor in about 35 hours; should I wait for the appointment, or call an emergency?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Yes, you can wait for 35 hours as this is not an easy emergency.Possibility of bronchospasm is more for your discomfort. Difficulty in the exhalation is classical symptom of bronchospasm.

So when you meet your doctor, get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to know the severity of asthma because treatment is based on severity only.You may need hormone higher and longer acting bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol).Oral combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti allergic (montelukast) once a day at night is also beneficial.Hope I have solved your query.

About a half hour after eating (usually in the morning, but can happen anytime, its very unpredictable, and I can't figure out what the foods have in common), I get very weak, where I cannot hold myself up, even sitting, I have to lay down. My heart pounds, and my heart rate goes up, I get really shaky, cold chills, hot flashes, and sometimes nasuea. This lasts for about one hour and then I'm completely back to normal. Since I learned I have high bp, I thought maybe it was really high... so, I've checked it on three different occasions, and my bp drops when I have these symptoms. The worst was 111/58, and the other two times it has been around 112/60, which isnt bad, but quite a sudden drop from what it usually is, especially the bottom #. I watch the bp numbers drop as the symptoms get worse, and rise as I start feeling better, so there is definately a connection.

So you need not to worry about your bp anymore.Increased heart rate & palpitations can have a lot of causes.It can be normal sinus tachycardia due to anxiety or stress or it could be abnormal supra ventricular tachycardia. For the diagnosis, you need to do ECG at the time of palpitation & tachycardia. If the duration of palpitations are short enough to reach a nearby hospital, we put a 24hr ECG monitoring (Holter Monitor).

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis and IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) are different lung diseases with different etiology and prognosis.Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is caused by chronic exposure to allergen or organism.

It's like my lungs in the back need to be massaged before I can get my body and heart working properly and before I can really move. Why is this?  After the massage, I'm fine every day.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Fibromyalgia can cause muscular spasm. So when you massaged that muscle, it releases and you feel better. So possibility of back muscle spasm is more likely in your case. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in muscular spasm. 1. Sit with proper back support.2. Avoid sudden jerky movements of back and forward bending.3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise.4. Apply warm water pad on affected areas.5. Take muscle relaxant thiocolchicoside if needed.6? Take calcium and vitamin d 3 supplements. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

While i was in mexico they heard a wierd sound but here they never heard it. Im scared it might be my heart because i get shortness or breath, and also i have recently been told i have asma. The pain feels like if somebody is stabbing me from the inside i cant feel in on the outside but i know its deep inside my left chest. It hurts at anytime. When im running,sitting,or doing nothing. It hurts for about a few minutes and it goes away on it own. When its hurting and i breath out it hurts more. I have an appointment with the cardiologist soon but they dont know when yet.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely rule out cardiac cause for your left sided chest pain.

Uncontrolled asthma can also cause similar kind of pain with breathlessness. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.

By your history and description, it is evident that your asthma is not controlled. Treatment of asthma is based on severity. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will need long acting inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Oral combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti allergic (montelukast) once a day at night is also beneficial.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

Yes, both doctors are right. Bronchitis may take several months for complete cure. It may be lifelong if provoking agent (dust, pollution, chemical fumes) is exposed continuously.So better to take drugs and inhalers given by pulmonologist regularly. Avoid dust and pollution, wear face mask. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation 4-5 times a day. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.Refrain from any form of smoking.  Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi. My son is 4yr and 2month old. He is having cold n fever past 2 days.

He is having severe hypotension which is causing dizziness. Chronic lung disease can cause heart failure. He also had bypass surgery and have diabetes. So he is at risk of heart failure. So his hypotension is mostly due to heart disease. So immediately take him to hospital and consult cardiologist and start treatment.. He will need inotropic drugs like dopamine or dobutamine to raise blood pressure. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your husband.

In my opinion, we should definitely rule out heart diseases for your symptoms because you have history of smoking. So get done ecg, 2d echo, stress test and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of Ecg).If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause sudden symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't smoke again. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Diabetes and asbestosis (lung involvement by asbestos) make lung defense weak.So patients are more prone for lung infections like MDR (MultiDrug Resistance) pathogens, tuberculosis etc.MDR infection also causes septicemia and kidney failure.So best treatment is to cure lung infection. So get done bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) culture and sensitivity report.Sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. Once this infection is cured, vaccinate him with pneumococcal and influenza vaccine to prevent recurrent respiratory tract infection. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father.

It is very common to have residual pain after thoracic surgery. This is because of nerve trapping. So no need to worry for death or anything serious. Tell your husband to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest. 2. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid sudden jerky movements of chest.3.

Since you are active smoker, we should definitely rule out pleurisy (inflammation of pleura) for your chest pain.Common causes for pleurisy are lung infection, bronchitis and pleural effusion. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).Chest x ray is must for the diagnosis of lung infection and effusion. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry much. Musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest.

You both will improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you both will be alright.

Your treatment will depend upon the pathology detected. Avoid addictions if any, stay away from alcohol, smoking, caffeine, nicotine or energy drinks. Avoid anxiety & stress as they may trigger palpitations & worsen your symptoms. Sometimes dehydration can cause palpitations. Stay properly hydrated. Maintain the electrolyte balance of your body.

Doctor advised me inhaler which i took for six months and have left now since I have put on a lot of weight. Please advise if its ok to continue taking citrizine everyday,","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Cetrizine is antihistamine drug. It is used for allergic condition. Since your wheezing is improved by taking cetrizine, possibility of allergic asthma related wheezing is more likely. Cetrizine is very old antihistamine drug. Now a days, newer antihistamine drugs (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) are available which are more effective and less toxic than cetrizine on longer use.So start levocetrizine or fexofenadine instead of cetrizine. These drugs are safe for long term use. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I am 22.... drinking has never done anything to me!","Doctor":"alcohol intake and palpitation are common, alcohol causes Atrial fibrillation which are paroxysmal that means fast irregular heart beating and episodic. that develops suddenly and ends on its own with out any drug.some times it causes chest pain due to reduced blood supply to heart,giddiness due to poor supply to brain,blurring of vision. I would suggest you to quit alcohol,the reason is both alcohol and fast irregular heart beats causes enlargement in synergistic way which is dangerous to life and may be fatal. 2nd reason of faster heart beat in alcohol users may be hypoglycaemia,try to take some carbs along with ur drinks to avoid sugar levels down.."},{"Patient":"my father age 65 years good health and no smoker or drinker but past 1 year he is suffering from chronic cough at night the intensity of cough is high . all the reports related to this is normal and the treatment is going on from a physican of med college lucknow  will you suggest me some better","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.

The next day though we were informed that he was having trouble breathing and he had to be out on a Bipap machine to help him breath. He has been in the hospital for about a week now on this machine. The family was told that he had been aspirating food and that it is in his lungs which is causing the breathing issues. He cannot swallow so he cannot eat anything or drink anything because the hospital is afraid that this may go down to the lungs as well and cause more issues. There was talking about using a feeding tube (which he had once before but was taken out) to get him more nutrition in his body but this causes an issue because he cannot breath on his own so the hospital does not know what procedure he can endure.

In my opinion, you should definitely consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

You will need 24 hour holter monitoring if you are having episodes on daily basis, otherwise you should rush to hospital or at least measure pulse rate during the episode. So visit nearby cardiologist for these investigation.Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard.Is there any stress or anxiety associated. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab ciplar LA 20 mg once a day. If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiological studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases."},{"Patient":"sir I'm a final year MBBS student from Bangladesh. I'm suffering from left sided small pleural effusion which was diagnosed by USG & CXR. now i've prblem of shortnaess of breath after sleeping and there is no h/o asthma and tb in my family. i've done anti tb antibody which was also nagative. my esr is 6 mm in 1st hour. what can i do now?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Most common cause for pleural effusion is pneumonia (lung infection).So better to start broad spectrum antibiotic like amoxicillin clavulinic acid with azithromycin. Take these drugs for 7 days.Get done repeat chest x ray and ultrasound. If effusion is resolving then no need to worry. But if effusion is worsening then get done pleural fluid aspiration and send for microscopic examination. Possibility of tuberculosis is more likely if effusion is not resolving with antibiotics. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have been having a cough for about 4 months now with some headaches and have been very tired and week. Just this month I got pheumonia. Im trying to figure out why i have been getting this way. I am a pack a day smoker for the past 6 months but before that was a very light smoker. I work in a warehouse office that has water damaged ceiling and had mold and still does...can this be a cause of my lung problems?","Doctor":"Hello Thank you for trusting HCM Dear  mold exposure most probably won't cause pneumonia and there is a possibility of Hypersensitivity to molds to develop  Hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The condition might seem like pneumonia, but it can't be cured by antibiotics, and its symptoms include cough, chills, fever, fatigue, muscle aches and shortness of breath.Smoking, immunocompromised status, diabetes conditions may cause prone to lung infection. So please avoid smoking, alcohol and just consult your physician /pulmonologist he will examine and treat you accordingly. I think I answered to your question if you have more questions please feel free to ask me."},{"Patient":"My Mom has COPD and Emphysema with seriously dimished lung capacity. Has also had pneumonia 5 times in 15 months, she is 82 yrs of age on 3 liters of Oxygen 24 hr a day. She has a buildup of carbon dioxide due to lung condition and her home health nurse has suggested  morphine a long acting low dose 15mg @12 hrs and a short acting .25 mg dose for short acting to help slow her breathing and keep her more comfortable as she panics when she can't get a full breath. I have been unable to find any information on this subject please advise. Her Pulmonologist appt is not for 5 weeks.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Morphine should not be given to your mother. Morphine is CNS depressant drug. It reduces respiratory drive. So it can even worsen hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide in blood).So morphine is contraindicated in her case. In my opinion, you should not wait for pulmonologist appointment. She needs urgent treatment to reduce high carbon dioxide. So better to take her to emergency room and start treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi. I have concerns about what I may be inhaling at work.

Single time exposure of these kind of chemical dust is usually not harmful.But if you are having recurrent exposure of such dusts then you are at risk of lung diseases.

Since you are having continuous cough, you should definitely get done fresh PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis.If new PFT shows decline in lung functions as compare to previous PFT then you should definitely start inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Family members are also at high risk of lung disease when they are exposed to second hand smoke.So consult pediatrician for your daughter to find out cause for her cough.Hope I have solved your query.

But I am thinking of a more probable cause, something related to heart, as the symptoms you have been experiencing may be paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, but given your age, heart disease is still a possibility. You might also be having some breathing difficulty due to the excess weight and may be realated to the Obesity. At the same time it is possible that you may have some depressive illness and sleep related problems or a panic attack.So, at Home, you can measure your Body mass Index, try to normalize it, by reducing your weight, minimize the stressors mental or physical and if the difficulty breathing continues, contact a physician nearby."},{"Patient":"NAME: Brent AGE: 22 SEX: Male SYMPTOMS : I have a cough that seems to be reccursive. It occurs usually at nightime, or if I gave a very intense sneeze or laugh. When this cough occurs, it is very dry, that it would sound like a yelping dog. Also, besides cough, I do experience a reccursive runny nose, sometimes coupled with watery red eyes and itchy throat. The runny nose discharge is transparent, almost like saliva or tears. Ironically, after a while, these symptoms would disappear, and when they do disappear, I feel completely normal. I have already consulted a doctor and was diagnosed of allergic rhinits. She adviced me to take anti histamines, either zirtec or iterax, which ever do i prefer. Unfortunately, it works at often but not at all times. HOW MANY DAYS?:Reccursive cough has been going on since april of this year. As for the runny nose, since november of last year ALLERGIES: not that i know of, When I was five years old, I remember being diagnosed of Primary Complex, but was able to be treated before it goes into something else. Also, TB runs in the family, as my uncle had it before, and so as my mom (although the doctor said it was already a scar). As for me, 2009 was a stressful year. There were months, when my hours of daily sleep was only around 3 to four hours due to school work. Also, for a period of time I was involved in smoking, although it has been a month since I stopped.","Doctor":"Thanks for your concern. The dry cough basically has a few causes....First is Post nasal drip, second  Gastroesophageal reflux'heart burn', third Cough variant aasthma, forth Heart failure and finally Interstitial lung disease. Based on the information if you don't have a heart burn or reflux of food or sour brash into your mouth, you are having a cough variant asthma, make sure you do not have difficulty breathing. There is something called cardiac asthma, but it's not much of a likelihood given your young age.I advice you that you give up on smoking as it causes a multitude of problems and may well be related to the cough you've been having now called as 'smokers cough'.It's time that you stop smoking, avoid animal dancers, mites, pollens and any thing that would exacerbate the illness, make sure you don't have a heart burn, and if still the cough persists , meet a pulmo neologism and get a Pulmonary function test with methacholine challenge"},{"Patient":"hello.

The exercise seems to help because I feel reduced pain when I climb stairs. 2 months ago, I was diagnosed with mild high BP and was placed on Amlodipine 5mg. I have just taken the drug for a month.

Also, I there is any stress, anxiety, then try to get relieved of it by using relaxation techniques like yoga and deep breathing."},{"Patient":"I had this really bad chest pain last night and my arm was hurting as well and then I just thought it was a heart burn so I went to sleep.

You need to get serious specially if you have the risk factors like male sex, older age, smoking, HTN, diabetes, lipid problems...You need to be cncerned if you have pressure sensation on your chest on exertion r a heavy meal and that subsides on rest.....Also be alarmed if you have a sensation of impending doom and excess sweating during those chest discomfort....lIf these alarm symptoms are there please contact a cardiologist."},{"Patient":"dear doctor i m 32,female. lately i have diffulty to breath n often come along with sharp right chest pain .  i had do all necessary test on cardio n doctor confirmed my heart is ok but my problem still on n i often need to rush to hospital bcos of this problem. please advise what others test do i need n what type of doctor should i see. many many thanks for your help","Doctor":"Thankyou madam, So you have this Rt ades chest pain and you are 32. Given your age and no fever and other symptoms, you likely have some problem related to lungs, since you have a chest pain , I fear that you might have some pulmonary vessel problem( as cardiologist must have got an Xray chest done and seen the lung fields. You might have a Pulmonary Hypertention, whether Primary pulmonary Hypertension, or secondary one due to Chronic Thromboembolic PE. I advice you to visit a pulmonologist and get a Pulmonary function test and if necessary a Pumonary Angiogram CT"},{"Patient":"I have been coughing over the past few days.

Normal lung appears clear or dark on the Xray because it contains only air.The nodularity in your son's case according to the Radiologist who has reported the X Ray is either due to a pneumonia, which is an acute infection of the lungs or due to Koch's, also called  Tuberculosis, which is  a chronic infection. Both these conditions could look similar on the X Ray. Definite diagnosis has to be made by the doctor who sees and examines the child in correlation with X Ray and other tests.In the case of Tuberculosis, this is a special type of chronic infection, the source is always another human being and it could be through the placenta  from the mother also if she is a case.

A few points in my life I have had a sharp chest pain for a few hours but then it passes and doesn't come back for a few months. Well on 10-10-10 I left work around 2pm and got a burrito from chipotle, came home felt nausea all night long until finally I threw up. The hardest I have ever thrown up in my life, my parents said I sounded like a monster. I felt better after and finally was able to sleep, the following day I had sharp chest pain but just assumed it was from a strain. Towards the end of the day it got to the point I couldnt breath and I had the cold sweats and was holding my chest until finally I went to the ER. They did an ekg on me and blood work and said my heart and lungs were fine and it was probably an anxiety attack or indigestion. Not satisfied with their diagnosis I saw a doctor 2 days later (I STILL had this pain and pressure in my chest) He ordered an Upper G.I. Barium swallow, chest xrays, ultrasound of the abdomen, and a scope test. They found that I had a Hiatal hernia and a significant case of GERD and gave me prilosec and said I'd be better in a few days and it was simply indigestion. It has been over a month and I still have these pains and the Prilosec did nothing for me, so finally I went back and he perscribed me another medication similar to prilosec and I am on day 3 of that. What really irritates me is he also gave me medicne for depression and anxiety and said I needed to take that because I was probably just stressed out, but if you knew me you would know I am the happiest go lucky person in the world. I still have these chest pains and I am truly scared, when I requested he send me for testing on my heart he simply said I was too young to have heart/lung problems.

I can see where he would think this is GERD or something with my stomache but why am I not feeling better with this medication?I drink quite often and I just picked up smoking cigarettes this year, can anybody give me any advice?

GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause chest pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pressure, tightness etc. Only drug (prilosec) is not sufficient. You have to follow below mentioned lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief.1. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm.2. Quit smoking and alcohol.3. Go for walking after meals.4. Avoid junk food. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

It is radiated to both shoulders and arms in association with chest tightness. X-rays at that time revealed straightening of cervical spines indicating muscles spasm. The condition progressed in severity and , in 2010, neurophysiological study revealed C6,7 root lesion bilaterally more on left C6 root. CT and MRI revealed C4/5 and C5/6 spondylosis with marginal posterior osteophyte and disc bulging causing mild to moderate mass effect on thecal sac and cervical spinal cord. Treatment prescribed by many specialists on repeated visits from the start of the condition includes: steroids, NSIADs, muscle relaxants, Microlactin®, and treatment for the associated neuropathy ( carbamazepine, gabapentin,..etc) without significant improvement. One more point to mention about this patient. He has family history of similar condition affecting his uncle. Moreover; his son has attacks of spasm affecting his neck; which resemble ( as the patient remember ) the start of the patient condition in his youth.

In my opinion, we should first rule out heart diseases for your left sided chest pain.

The area that hurts is just under my left breast in the left upper rib area. My doctor dismissed it as chest wall pain and suggested I see a chiropractor. After 2 appointments with a chiropracter 5 days ago I feel ten times worse. I feel as though it is something major, because it does not feel like a bone issue, it feels like it is an organ pain to me. (it hurts underneath the rib bones) The pain is increasingly worse: when I take a deep breath, upon waking up from laying down, and when doing just mild physical activity. It has also come along with dizzyness and frustration with having no energy and not feeling well. It started off as mild pain about 25 days ago, and I assumed it would go away but it has progressively gotten extremely unbearable. I have been sleeping 18 hours a day, and the pain is awful. I am a healthy 24 year old female, im 5 11 , i weigh 155. I am currently prescribed by a psychiatrist 60mg cymbalta daily for mild depression, and 50mg vyvanse daily for ADD. I have never had major surgery or major medical problems. I had blood work done one week ago, and everything came out fairly normal. About 15 days prior to the chest pain starting I had great pain in my neck. I had x-rays and was told that I had tortecollis/dystonia due to no curve in my neck. After 5 days of muscle relaxers the neck pain felt better and has not bothered me since. I am now concerned with the upper rib pain. I have negatively tested for mono, which is what they thought it was initially. I also have no skin rash, because they thought it might be shingles.

Do you upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning, if yes it further supports the diagnosis. You should avoid fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. You can get prescribed tab Pan DSR 40 mg beforebreakfast once a day for 2 weeks.    If none of the above symptoms are present, then there is a possibility of cardiac arrhythmia like psvt or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ecg is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holter monitoring. So visit nearby cardiologist for these investigation. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard.

I exercise regularly and am taking numerous heart meds.  I would like to know if there are foods that can help increase a heart's ejection fraction?","Doctor":"Unfortunately, there is no diet that will increase your heart's ejection fraction (an estimate of the muscle strength of your heart).  Assuming you were diagnosed with a cardiomyopathy, there are some causes of \\"dilated cardiomyopathy,\\" such as postpartum (occurring after a woman gives birth) or certain viruses or heavy alcohol consumption or after a prolonged tachycardia (an arrhythmia that causes a very rapid pulse that goes untreated for more than several weeks).  In some of these cases (approximately one-third of them), the heart's ejection fraction will return to normal spontaneously--on its own--for reasons that are poorly understood.Other than in stopping the consumption of alcohol for alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy, there is no dietary change that can improve one's ejection fraction (EF).Some people believe that antioxidant vitamins, such as Coenzyme Q-10, can help to heal a cardiomyopathy, and possibly improve the EF.  There are no large-scale reliable studies that prove this, but it probably won't cause harm.Of course, managing the SYMPTOMS of low EF and of heart failure can be done by lowering the sodium (salt) intake in one's diet, and also by reducing or avoiding caffeine.  They won't improve EF, but those alterations can decrease exacerbations of heart failure, hospitalizations, and accumulations of fluid retention.  Good luck, and let us know if this information helps, or if you have other questions."},{"Patient":"Hi, last night when I was gettin ready for bed I laid down on my back, all of a sudden my chest tighten up, started to have shortness of breath and my upper stomache started giving me pain.

I have had to take a tablet every day when my potassium was low but I do not remember the name of the drug. But my potassium may be low again because sometimes at night I get terrible pain in one of my legs. I am not a diabetic and do not have heart problems. You should know that I started back walking in the early morning 5 miles daily three weeks ago. I have been doing this off and on since 2005. My question: I have been experiencing pain in my chest area just above my right breast for two days. It started yesterday about 30 minutes after I completed my 5 mile walk. The pain is not constant and feels more like stings when it occurs. When I touch or rub the area, it stops for a while but still comes back. It may stop for even an hour or two before returning. On each return, I repeat the touching and rubbing. It is not the first time I have experienced this. It happened some months ago but I do not remember the exact time before iit finally stopped. What could this be? Thank you very much.","Doctor":"Hello dear , hiWelcome to Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .*  This seems in relation with muscular ache , still needs to confirm  by     clinical examination and EKG  to  rule  out  any other cardiac  issue .Hope this clears your query .Wishing you fine health ahead .Regards dear take care ."},{"Patient":"Hi,f mraiy eI nandswer your health queries right now ?

I started working out this past week doing a lot of upper body stuff. Today I was doing wall ball squats where you throw a 10 lb medicine ball at the wall, catch it, and do a squat & repeat. After awhile I started getting a pain in the center of my chest about 3 inches down from my collarbone. I told my coach and she said to keep going. I did but was slowing way down because everytime I would catch it, it would hurt/stab (and not like I was sore from working out). Finally after awhile I started to become short of breathe and had to stop altogether because I couldn't breathe. This isn't the first time it has happened in the last few years & I have seen a doctor who was of no help. For added information I am a hair stylist and have my arms up most of the day. I also have silicone gel implants that I got about 3 years ago. I have no idea if there is a connection. Also once in awhile I take a prescription  called provigil for Narcolepsy. I don't take it often though because it is a pretty mild case.  Please help!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.

Is there any side effect if I start now onwards to complete the course? Waiting for your advice please.Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Montek LC is having levocetrizine and montelukast. Levocetrizine is antihistamine drug, montelukast is anti allergic drug. So it is beneficial only if your breathlessness is due to allergic asthma.So my suggestion for you is to consult pulmonologist first. If pulmonologist says that you are having allergic asthma then you can take Montek LC. I also don't feel that only Montek LC will help because asthma needs bronchodilators to cure breathlessness.

So doesn't look like a matter of worry.   For your high heart rate, we need to find out the cause because it can be simple anxiety and can be a cardiac arrhythmia like psvt or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ecg is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holter monitoring. So visit nearby cardiologist for these investigation.Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard.Is there any stress or anxiety associated. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab ciplar LA 20 mg once a day. If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiological studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases."},{"Patient":"hello,my mom has trouble breathing,brought on by anxiety sometimes,but the doctor she went to suggested she has asthma,so she has been using a nebulizer (not sure of the spelling)almost daily for a few years now...almost out of habit..to \\"make sure\\" she won't have any breathing problems,any ideas of where to go with this?","Doctor":"Hello dear , hiWelcome to Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .*  There are different  reasons  for  the  difficulty in breathing  as    -  stress , anxiety  -  lung  problems  of  infection , inflammation ,  pneumonia  ,  tumor , allergy , others .*  If  her  condition remains  stable  with  nebulizer means  that  her  lungs    are  somewhat  weak , requires  ongoing  support of the same .*  Still further work up with clinical evaluation and co relation of the     available  reports  are  highly recommended for deciding further  line  of      action .Hope this clears your query .Regards ."},{"Patient":"i suddenly feel extremely tired and dizzy. ive had a cold for a few days now and the only symptoms ive had today are a hoarse voice, coughing and congestion, and stuffy nose. i felt weak when i got up this morning, took the garbage out, vacumed, and thats when i suddenly got extremly tired with a weird pressure in my head. i feel dizzy and faintish if i move around, any idea wgats going on?","Doctor":"Hello dear , hiWelcome to Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .*  This seems in relation with low blood pressure most likely from the     underlying  respiratory infection and pyrexia .*  Strongly recommended  to  immediately  consult  your  family doctor .Hope this will help you .Wishing you fine recovery .Regards ."},{"Patient":"I was fine yesterday, i woke up this morning about 10'oclock was completely fine, went back to sleep because i was feeling drowsy woke up about 12.30pm i had a sore throat didnt think much of it, now i am coughing so bad it makes my stomach like crunch up.

The night I received my antibiotics I coughed and heard a slight pop sound. It has been about 2 weeks since the sudden rib pain; and I have a hard lump where the pain is. The lump is slightly tender to touch. There is no visible bruising. I feel constant pain during the whole day but it is not unbearable. I dont want to get xrays if its just a common bruising of the ribs. What is the most likely case that I have? Bruised, fractured, or cracked ribs? What is the major differentiation in pain between those and what is causing the hard lump on my right rib?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Excessive coughing can cause costochondritis because of straining of costal cartilage and ribs.So pain and tender swelling at local chest area are mostly due costochondritis.No need to worry for fractured rib and hence no need for chest x ray. Honestly speaking, there is no such difference in treatment whether it is bruised rib or fractured rib or cracked rib.Follow these steps and you will be alright in 1 - 2 weeks.1. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid sudden jerky movements of chest.2. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise.3. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest.4. Take painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or acetaminophen.5. Wear rib belt for minimal mobilization of ribs.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

Should i see a doctor?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. You are having chronic cough (cough for more than 2 weeks).Common causes for this are bronchitis, lung infection, tuberculosis, asthma and lung cancer. All these are curable. But you should first diagnose the problem and then start appropriate treatment. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).Chest x ray is needed for lung infection. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis and asthma. You will need antibiotic, antihistamine,  inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I don't understand why I get pain in my chest. Its like someone is holding my heart and squeezing so tight, knocking the air right out of me. I can't breathe when this happens..Hurts to breathe.  I have a constant heaviness in my chest and I have a hard time breathing in and out.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Heaviness in chest, difficulty in taking breath in and out are commonly seen with heart diseases. So first get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test).If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes undiagnosed stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am a cross country runner, I am 15 and I run 2 times per week.
