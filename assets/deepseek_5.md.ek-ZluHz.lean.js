I had a test with a scope and my urologist noticed some inflamation or something on my bladder and I am scheduled for a biolpsy tomorrow. i understand that it may be inflamation or bladder cancer. Is this typical after radiation? What is the cure if it is scarring and what is the cure rate if it is cancer.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Scarring is more common after radiation than cancer. So for your symptoms, possibility of bladder scarring is more than bladder cancer. But biopsy is must to differentiate between these two.

But if it turned out to be malignant then you need to get done staging of the cancer. Future treatment will be decided on staging of the tumour only.

I would not consider myself a heavy user, but an everyday user.  Most likely about an hour a day on average of having a chew in the mouth. I recently felt some pain between my lower lip and gum where I would put the chew and immediately stopped chewing and went to my dentist.   I told him and he was not worried at all after doing an oral cancer examination.  He said it should just go away.  It has now been going on for about two weeks and almost completely goes away during the day, but flares up at night with a burning sensation between the lip and gum.  Enough that it makes it very hard to sleep. However, there are no visible signs of sores or anything in my mouth and I feel fine otherwise.  Is this just a coincedence that the pain is in the same place I usually put the chew? I even called my dentist on the phone to tell him all of this a week after my appointment and he still was not worried, (at least for anything cancerous).  Any ideas???","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are not having any visible ulcer or growth, possibility of oral cancer is very less in your case. The pain sensation you are feeling is mostly due to hypersensitivity of nerves in that area. Tobacco locally irritates the mucosa and so nerves in that area become hypersensitivity and cause painful sensation. So you need to quit tobacco as soon as possible. Start multivitamin tablet containing folic acid, niacin, vitamin b12 and zinc. All these are helpful in nerves regeneration. So discuss all these with your doctor. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello Sir Good evening My mother is diagnised with CERIVEX Cancer . She is undergoing treatment like radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

It is important to get him evaluated for any medical condition that might be causing the symptoms. First please get PSA done and then match his result for any suspected elevated PSA levels.Though the cause for the problem might include benign problems like stricture, it is important to do tests to evaluate the urethra and urinary bladder and see if there is any benign problem. I hope infection has been looked for by doing a complete urine examination.Rarely, stones in the urinary tract might also cause problems of passing blood clots. Doing an ultrasound scan will help.

Leaving for Israel on Wednesday for 12 days. Praying the lower back pain and night cramps stop before then. Went to Urgent care this morning and was given a shot to relieve inflammation but didn t do anything. Urine sample showed white blood cells so doc prescribed ciproflaxin. Should I go to the hospital for some tests before the trip or do you think the antiobiotic will help? Have had normal pelvic exams and I can t get in to regular doctor before the trip. Course, if I get worse, I suppose Israel has the best doctors! I take minocycle 100 miligrams (skin related) and aspirin (low dose) and occasional vitamins. That s it. Your thoughts and suggestions? Much appreciated. Deborah","Doctor":"HelloThanks for posting to HCM.Do Urine Examination.SonographyTake Tab.

As he has been in pain and is unable to even drink water and this means that there is dehydration it is important to start intravenous fluids and give anti vomiting medication. His blood electrolytes are also important and it might take a day or two to stabilize his condition.Once he is stable, you can get a consultation from an oncologist and then depending on the present condition, treatment can be started with chemotherapy. Usually liver cancers are not operated up on unless it is in early stage. There are also other techniques like TACE which might be use to reduce the tumor volume. Pain relief is important and you might discuss the pain relief measures in detail with his doctor. Please try and know why his condition deteriorated and give him adequate fluids and nutrition when he recovers from the initial vomiting and dehydration.

Since then, each month I have problems that are progressing to almost debilitating.  Every day I feel as if someone is pressing a sweet gum ball below my right breast near the gallbladder region.  The pain goes all the way into my back.  These areas get worse during ovulation and after my menstrual cycle.  The pain becomes so severe and often feels like burning in the back.   It hurts to place my back against a chair, and it flares up greatly during the night, so I find myself sitting up most nights crying.  This month the pain is so bad that it feels as if someone has beat my back to the point of severe soreness.  I feel as if I have a knife in the upper right back shoulder and sometimes left one.  I have also pain in my right lower back and front upper side, under the rib cage.   My blood pressure is normally 120/70; however the bottom number is now at 94-97.  Therefore, my back of my head feels burning and I have a nagging headache on and off.  I am nauseated and have diarrhea, which never happens for this constipated person.  I feel as if I am about to pass out.  I have had numerous tests done this past year: colonoscopy, EGD, ECHO cardiogram, stress test, liver enzymes tested, pancreatic enzymes tested, full blood work up (which came back with abnormal written by a couple), vaginal sonogram, and a handful of CT tests from various doctors, one including a dual phase CT of my pancreas and appendix.

One of my patient's is a cancer survivor. Her Doctor would like her Hgb to be kept between 10-11. I see that the therapeutic level is 11-13 for quality of life in cancer patients. What can you tell me about this?","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  In cancer patients also hemoglobin should be kept above 12. There is no harm in that.  In spite it is necessary to maintain hemoglobin above 12 for healthy living.  So it has no relation with thicker blood and all that.  Myeloproliferative disease can cause thicker blood but for that aspirin and hydroxyurea should be given.  But  I m not agree with that theory of  low hemoglobin.

The bones affected are my right ulna, left humorous, right femur, left foot and pelvic bone.

I don t want to go into a new doctor and demand testing, but what is the best way for me to encourage my doctor to rule out anything serious?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Bone cancer might involve any bone and rarely also affect multiple bones. The usual signs of bone cancer are swelling which is sudden in onset and rapidly progressive with pain in the region. Some bone cancers can also cause signs of inflammation in the region.Since you have been diagnosed to have mastoiditis therefore it is almost certain that your condition is infective in nature. Mastoiditis occurs due to chronic infection of the middle ear which involves the mastoid bone. Treat with medicines is recommended and in some patients surgical treatment is required and it is not a bone cancer.. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Good day.

The tube is made of chemically inert material that does not get affected when radiation passes through it. Radiation has to be given if your oncologist feels that tumor has to be reduced in size after chemotherapy with dexotel and cisplatin.Nasogastric tube is a simple tube that is a passage of liquids from mouth through throat and esophagus and in to the stomach lumen. It does not get affected though you might have a slight discomfort when they put it inside. This will help to provide feeds regularly.

The tumor is usually malignant but in rare cases can also be a benign one. What happens is that the autoimmune system is triggered and there is a cascade of chemicals in the system which cause various symptoms that are identified with paraneoplastic syndromes.She might be requiring a long course of steroids which will be reduced slowly.

And also is there chances of having tis type of cancer again?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to know what tumor your relative is having and the stage of cancer. Most testicular tumors are of a group known as seminoma and this is the most widely occurring tumor. Seminoma has a good cure rate if detected early and this shows good response to treatment in patients.There is another group of testicular tumors known as non seminomatous germ cell tumors and this group has many sub tumor types.  They tend to be more aggressive than seminomas and invasion is common.The prognosis of non-seminomatous germ cell tumors is variable and depends on the biological behaviour of individual tumors. Prognosis can be inferred from tumor markers, location of the primary tumor and of course presence of metastases. Treatment at any cancer research institute is recommended depending on his location. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My wife is 49, 5'2\\" and weighs about 140.  She had a stage 2 melenoma on her right thigh almost 2 years ago.  For three days now she has had what feels like a small round ball like irratation under the skin on the bottom of her right foot.  There does not seem to be a break in the skin, so we believe it must be a gland or lymph node or something?  It is painful to the touch and to walk on and she said it was itching some.  what do you think we should do, give it time or have it checked.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Any patient who has malignant melanoma in the past must consult a doctor immediately if there is any lump, swelling, skin changes or any suspicious symptoms. Please get her examined by the oncologist at the earliest and get her condition confirmed.Malignant melanoma is one of the violent tumors and can spread to any where in the body without any particular signs or symptoms. Even if the area looks more like an inflammation and without break in the skin it should not be ignored. There are symptoms like irritation and itching which means some pathological process is taking place.

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Chemical stress test might be done if his general health condition is satisfactory. His doctors will confirm his tolerance level and check his vital parameters before doing the chemical stress test. This will make sure that the test will not compromise his health and the fact that he is under chemotherapy for small cell cancer lung.Please follow instructions before the test and in case of any discomfort or weakness he can inform the doctors performing the test and then if he is not keeping fit then he can reschedule the test. Many people get the test done without any risks to their health.

Therefore the microscopic observation of paucicellular and show scan blood means that there are not many cells. It is important to know if the report gives an impression of any benign tumor containing fat components with decreased number of cells. If a complete report is not possible then it requires a biopsy from another similar tumor any where else on your body under guidance of an ultrasound. The tumor otherwise appears to be devoid of cells and therefore likely to be a benign tumor.

The only medications he is currently on are Hydrocodone for pain and Gabapentin Should I be concerned as I am?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Please re confirm the body temperature again. If the body feels warm and the reading is low then there is a possibility of instrument malfunction. It will help to calibrate the thermometer and then check the temperature again.Usually people taking treatment for cancer will have a normal body temperature. You too confirm this after touching him.

This has taken me two years. Are there any different treatments, like, a cream?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.If your symptoms are present for more than two years with no signs of aggressiveness and spreading then it is unlikely to be a cancer. There are few conditions involving hair follicles and these give rise to la broad group of neoplasms called skin adnexal tumors. Hair follicle tumors can be benign or malignant growths.It is important to consult a dermatologist and first confirm your condition. If a malignancy is suspected then more testing like a FNAC or biopsy might be indicated. Treatment depends on the type of cells found and any infection if present.

Please wear a disposable face mask when you work close to the patient so that there is a barrier. You can also add a few drops of a strong aromatic oil like eucalyptus or mint or any other variety of your choice to the mask so that the odor is suppressed.You can explain to your employer and avoid sniffing the odor deliberately.

She was diagnosed with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) two years ago and has also had trouble with blockages in her upper arteries. She had a successful surgery to clear one of the blocked arteries and her cardiologist assures us the rest of the blockages are NOT life threatening and are not getting any worse at all. The concern is she now has a rash that originated on the back of her head and moved down her arms (the blockages were in her subclavian arteries). It has been 3 months and she just told me now. I have a BA in biology and the symptoms don t seem to fit either of her major problems. If it were arterial, I would expect necrosis of the finger dermis, not a rash. The CLL apparently may cause rashes but she has no swollen lymph nodes in either her neck or arms. I have a picture to accompany that shows the rash. I m sorry to trouble you but I am deathly afraid and don t know what I would do without her. She is also quite scared to go into the doctors and hear that she has weeks left to live (I considered stress as a cause for the rash)? She also had shingles 4 years back, but does not describe this rash as as painful as the shingles virus. Please help, I would be forever in your debt.","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She has chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Her artery blockage has no relation with rash.  Her rash may be due to low platelet count.  In CLL it is very common to have low platelet count and it causes rash.  She should go for complete blood count with platelet count.  If it is low then take treatment for that.  If needed platelet transfusion can be given.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic.

Unfortunately the survival of a patient in this condition is from 6 months to 2 years. Since he is under treatment, it is possible that his immunity is low ans that is why he is getting infections. The fluids in his nose and eyes might be due to paranasal air sinus infection. Fluids get collected in air spaces around eyes and nose and this drips continuously.The fluid in chest is due to persisting infection in pleural cavity.

I am concerned that I still have a small amount of bleeding and wasn't sure how little or how much activity I should engage in.  I did see my surgeon a few days after the surgery and she said everything looked good, but it seems to be taking longer than I thought it would to heal.   Any suggestions/comments/advise would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Lipoma is a benign tumor and not a serious concern. It is hoped that your suspected lipoma was sent to pathological laboratory and confirmed to be lipoma which is a benign fat containing tumor. A lipoma is easy to operate on and the entire tumor is excised.The ankle is a complex part of anatomy and contains lots of small muscles and ligaments. Such an operation can take 4 to 6 weeks to give you back your normal strength and range of movements at the ankle joint. The ankle is a joint which is used a lot and is among the most important joints for locomotion. You might get in touch with a rehabilitation clinic and start doing physiotherapy exercises. Please keep your operated ankle over a pillow when you lie down to sleep. Getting heat and cold pack will also help. Application of ointments will reduce any dull pain that is present.

All occurred within a month of each other (normally, I am in good health but did have breast cancer 6 years ago resulting in a mastectomy and chemotherapy). My primary physician wanted my oncologist to look at the Alkaline Phosphatase level was was 180 to I think make sure it wasn't anything to do with cancer but my oncologist just had her secretary call to refer me back to the primary without wanting any more info from me. Do I need to be concerned? What is my next step?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that is found in the liver in good amounts. Its levels show a state of health and disease and is considered an important liver function marker.In conditions of the liver, damaged liver cells release increased amounts of the enzyme into the blood. This test is often used to detect blocked bile ducts because alkaline phosphatase is in cells of bile ducts. In jaundice patients the alkaline phosphatase levels are raised.In some cancers the sudden rise of alkaline phosphatase by more than 120 units over 4 to 6 weeks is a concern and might require more detailed evaluation. If your earlier alkaline phosphatase was less than 60 and now it is 180 then it is a concern. If past reports show the enzyme almost same as the present level then there is no serious concern.

Rarely it can also cause ovarian cancer.Your skipped period might be due to stress or a gynecological condition due to hormonal imbalance but it will help to do required tests including ultrasound scan pelvis and CA 125 estimation in blood.

I was put on medrol dose pack on June 3 (when radiation stopped), but continue with severe diarrhea, weight loss, and severe abdominal pain and cramping ( despite GI muscle relaxants).  What can I do?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Colon is another name of large bowel and rectum is terminal end of colon. Therefore colon and rectal cancer is dealt similarly and called colorectal cancer. Surgery is the first treatment choice depending on the disease location and spread. For cancer that is limited to the affected are in large bowel then surgery is first done. After this chemotherapy and radiation therapy is advised. Some people might develop adverse effect to cancer medicine and then other agents can be used.Colorectal cancer patients must follow up with their doctors regularly and you must also do that. About half the patients of colorectal cancer might develop lesions in liver, lungs, abdomen and brain. Therefore getting ultrasound scan abdomen and CT scan is most important for you as recommended by your doctor. There is also a serum blood marker called CEA and this tells the chance of spread to liver if it increases in amount. This can be known through a simple blood test.

Can you offer any advice on these & what may be causing them ? Thank you ...","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is not the key hole surgery which is causing stomach cancer. The reason is that there might have been a tumor in the abdomen which caused the benign tumor and some of the cells were still inside after the key hole surgery. With time these cells transformed to malignancy and therefore a malignant gist was formed.The seizures cannot be ignored if she had 4 attacks. A CT scan brain is required to evaluate the brain for any new metastatic transformation. The malignant gist tumor can become aggressive and then this causes secondary deposits in other organs including brain, liver and lymphnodes. It is urgent to do a CT scan brain and look for disease spread. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Its been ruled out gallstones and urinary infection.

Cancer cannot be confirmed unless a FNAC or biopsy test is positive. For vomiting and pain he must be given symptomatic treatment and his general condition is to be improved. A complete blood count is advised to know if he is having anemia. This has to be discussed with the doctor and if he is having low hemoglobin then it has to be treated first.If secondary cancer is confirmed then it is probably stage 4 disease. Treatment must be started immediately to extend survival and regular follow up with oncologist is required. Pain relief medicines should also be given with nutrition and supportive care.

My doctor advised me that surgery is NOT necessary. he advised me that i can have surgery after marriage, when fertility is issue, my question is that can i have surgery after 5 more years? i'm am suffering varicocele more than 3 years now. is my doctor advise right? thanks! :","Doctor":"hello there mate! varicocele is 15-20% mens problem of which only 40 percent has infertility problem.Varicocele is associated with impaired semen quality. why dont you do a semen analysis to see where you stand.its 80 to 90 % left testicle in your case its right, abit atypical presentation.which grade your varicocele is? you did not mention but as you advised surgery it must be grade three. if its just visible on inspection, if occurs with bearing down or valsalva maneuver then its small, if palpable with out bearing down than moderate. so you see for yourself where do you stand.now you said delay, well it can be delayed if indications for surgery are not met and symptomatic treatment is helping you. if testicular volume is less than 20 ml and length remember not all varicoceles lead to infertility. 10 to 15 % of fertile people have it. plus if you early treat it it will prevent infertility plus you are 22 only i believe if you operate now you wont lose your fertility..so if you have pain in testicle , size and volume i mentioned, and your semen analysis comes abnormal i am afraid you would have to go for the repair instead of delaying it. some authorities correlate right sided varicocele with abdominal retroperitoneal pathologies so i would recommend abdominal U/s and CT with scrotal doppler sonography(high resolution color flow) to be on the safer road too.lets discuss some surgical options.there are 3 approaches. 1.through groin2.through abdomen3.below grointhere are interventional radiological approaches too with minimal invasion. providing the expertise are there.So in nutt shell if you fir the criteria for surgery as i mentioned you should have a surgery cause it will involve your left one too if left uncure and it will progress.Its outcome will be good..rest correlating your condition clinically with the situation is the best option and the surgeon whose hand and eyes are on your testicles can decide better, from here i can advise sincerely only with the provided facts which will never be enough compared to one to one confrontation of patient and doctor.Any ways i will be here to help if you need meRegardsDr Shafi Ullah Khanmy patient is my family"},{"Patient":"I have had several episodes of severe abdominal cramps that leads me to the restroom.

(:","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cough is a reflex action by which the body tries to throw out anything that is stuck in the air passage or any focus of irritation in the lungs.When a person has a lung cancer, there might be irritation of the small airways and larger airways. By coughing the person is trying to expel the contents in the lungs, bronchi, trachea or throat. These are the different areas which might get irritated and coughing helps to clear the passages and make the person feel better. In lung cancer there is destruction of the smaller passages and lung tissue. This leads to irritation and stimulation of nerves that carry pain sensation to be brain. Due to cancer the blood vessels also get affected and open up and the patient coughs out blood. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Why would an oncologist order chemo for a 78 year old female with cancer in the liver, lung, kidney adrenal gland ,pancreas ,breastbone and hip? Not sure which organ cancer originated, first tests show large mass in kidney, biopsy of liver showed cancer in pancreas.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a challenging diagnosis and treatment is difficult in advanced stages. Since the cancer has involved more than one organ like liver, lung, kidney, adrenal gland, pancreas, breast bone and hip, it is possible that the person has stage 4 disease. In this case it is not important to find out exactly where the cancer originated but treatment with objective of extending survival is the point to be considered.In the above case the survival of the patient with recommended treatment and supportive care might extend to 2 years. If chemotherapy is not given then even six months survival is difficult. Therefore the doctor has recommended chemotherapy to stabilize the disease and control spread of cancer and  make the patient survive longer. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"can a 58 year old women 164 cm high weighing 85 kilos have cervical cancer (which has also spread to the liver) for the last 10 years and still look fit and healthy, drink alcohol like it's going out of fashion and have heaps of energy for gardening cleaning etc?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is possible that the person in concern is under a strict treatment and follow up schedule. Cancer cervix is curable in the first stage of disease. However disease spread to liver makes it stage 4 cancer with difficult treatment. There are times when a person might have liver lesions which are identical to metastasis of cervix cancer. Therefore she might not have had stage 4 disease and the spread was misinterpreted. On the other hand it can also mean that she has well differentiated cancer which is responding to treatment.Drinking alcohol is not the same for every one. Some people suffer from ill effects of alcohol just by drinking a small amount while there are people who drink a lot and still show mild liver changes due to alcohol intake. Having energy and good fitness is a personal capacity. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Dear sir, My elder brother had tumor just under his spine. It took some 3 iterations to treat the same. However, during this process, he has lost control on his lower part of the body. He can stand but can't sit. He can't eat enough food. His urination and stool is through cathetor. You can imagine the situation, it's too disheartning. Can you please advise on the cure of this problem? We'll be grateful to you! He is just 33 years old.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to hear about the spinal tumor in your brother. It is important to know the size, extent, location and grade of tumor he is having. Most low grade tumors are treated by surgery. However tumors which are aggressive in appearance require a systematic multi step approach. In these cases it is a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy that is used to treat the tumor.Unfortunately it is possible that unintentionally the nerves to his bladder and bowel have been damages because of the tumor. To provide a complete answer, it is important to know if the nerves in his lower back are under pressure and if they can be released and decompressed in any way. Please discuss this with his doctor and if required take another opinion and discuss the MRI scan of lower back with a neurosurgeon.

Any cancer if detected in the early stage can be treated better with surgery and usually this is a curative treatment. If surgeries have been done then treatment with flushing is important to wash out the cancer cells which were left over after surgery. This is a recommended treatment and followed in most cancer hospitals.If you choose not to proceed with recommended treatment then there is a probability that the cancer might return and cause more distress than the pain he is having during the treatment.

These medicines are given because they are life saving and benefit of taking is higher than risk of side effects. These medicines can get cytotoxic to the nervous system. This way it can affect the movements of lips and head causing shivering. There is neurotoxicity to brain including cerebellum which controls head movement. There is release of primitive reflexes as the inhibition on unwanted movements is affected.

This is the presence of cancer cells beyond the cut margins and cannot be seen with eyes. The high dose of radiation therapy tries to kill these cancer cells which are left over after surgery. Since there are some atypical cells after treatment, it is important to continue further treatment till all the abnormal cells have been treated.The last pap smear appears to be inconclusive. This means the results are not clear. You should not worry as regular treatment has been taken and most likely after 3 high dose radiation therapy sessions the cells are usually treated. In doing radiation the cell growth and multiplication is targeted and therefore there is a possibility that abnormal cells have been treated in your case and you have been told not enough cells.

One month back has UTI Infection and bleeding in urine, doctor suggested Radiation so that his bleeding will stop. But unfortunately it is still bleeding now his Hb is 6.0. Can Orofer FCM injection 500 ml is advisable for his . If yes how many days ? How much his Hb level raised. Please advice ?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Since you have said that he is on supra pubic catheter, I understand that he is unable to pass urine through the normal urinary passage after surgery. Unfortunately he has developed complications causing bleeding and his hemoglobin is low if it is 6.0 gm/ dl. This cannot be treated by self medication and in my opinion, after consulting your doctor blood transfusion might have to be given to increase hemoglobin to 10 gm/ dl. Giving orofer only may not increase hemoglobin levels sufficiently therefore it can be given after the hemoglobin increases following blood transfusion.With all measures the target raise in hemoglobin must be at least 10 gm/ dl. The bleeding area also has to be checked and treated if there is no relief after radiation therapy. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi. I am caring for my friend who has pancreatic cancer and is on a PEJ feeding tube. She has a lot of gas and her oncologist recommended putting creon down the feeding tube. Should I crush the contents on the gel cap and mix them with her water flushes or just put the little micropellets into the feeding tube mixed with water. They do not dissolve in water as I have tried. I am concerned about blocking her feeding tube.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Creon is pancrelipase and is given to patients who have abnormal pancreas functioning. This enzyme helps in maintaining digestive functions of the pancreas. The usual recommendation is to mix the pellets with the soft liquid food and push them through the syringe. Following this you can flush the gastric tube and then clear any clogged part of the tube with water.If you mix the pellets with the liquid food then it will form a homogeneous distribution and pass through and even if there is little amount sticking to the walls of the nasogastric tube then it will be washed through the tube when you flush it with water. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I am a prostate cancer survivor since June 2006when I had surgery and radiation in 2008. I am receiving hormone therapy treatment when my psa reaches 10. 2 weeks ago I found a rough spot on the skin halfway between my rectum and testicals. Is this something that I should be worried about it.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A rough spot on the scrotum skin in the perineal region is not a serious concern for the cancer. It might however be an infection or post radiation therapy skin change. The area between the rectum and testis is occupied by fat under the skin. Usually any infection in the fat appears like a soft lump that can occasionally get painful. Please get examined by your doctor should have any pain or discomfort in the area which can be due to an infection and requires proper treatment with antibiotics.If it is only in the skin then please get it examined by a dermatologist for any suspected fungal infection and get treatment. This is less likely to be a serious concern but must be examined and treated.

The legs have deep veins and when there is any pressure effect of the cancer on the veins in the pelvis, it can cause the blood flow in leg veins to become slow.

Since you are having colon cancer with liver involvement therefore its possible that you are taking combination chemotherapy. This involves more than one chemotherapy agent and might be aggressive in action. When chemotherapy works then the cancer cells get destroyed in large numbers. These deal cells are mobilized in circulation and cause side effects like weakness and fever as there is release of low amounts of toxin.Some chemotherapy agents also cause toxicity to the lungs and muscles and please discuss this with your doctor.

Diseases treated include infected wounds, circulatory disorders, geriatric conditions, macular degeneration, viral diseases, rheumatism/arthritis, cancer, SARS and AIDS.In TMJ painful conditions ozone therapy is more effective than medication therapy in patients with high pain scores. Therapeutic modalities for the administration of intraoral ozone include irrigation with ozonized water, gas injection, topical application of ozonized oil, and gas insufflation of periodontal pockets.

The biopsy revealed lung adenocarcinoma , without lymph node involvement and only localized damage. All post surgery ct did not reveal any problems to other organs or the brain. Yesterday she had a brain CT which revealed a 18mm tumor in the left bregmatic area of the brain and was advised to do radiaton therapy which we booked for thursday. Is there any chance for long term survival?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Presence of a tumor spread. in the brain in a patient with lung cancer is stage 4 cancer. Such a case can have a survival of up to 2 years after detection. However the tumor has been detected in early stage in the brain and therefore it is possible that with aggressive treatment and radiation the tumor cells can be completely destroyed and she can survive even for 5 years or more.Please discuss in detail with your doctors and if required then gamma knife treatment and chemotherapy can also be given to completely eradicate the tumor in the brain. The tumor measures 18 mm and is small and can be managed right now. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Soon I will be cancer free for 2 years after chemo for breast cancer.

No more brisk walking. I am 70 years old and feel quite healthy otherwise. No medications.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Good to know that you have conquered cancer and won your battle against it. Chemotherapy has helped you a lot and made you cancer free. Chemotherapy medicines are strong and might cause a number of side effects that includes nerve damage.This is known as peripheral neuropathy and I guess that you hare having symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Unfortunately this might become a chronic condition in many patients and they have to take medications to feel better and make their lives comfortable. There are medicinces to help in peripheral neuropathy and I suggest you consult your neurologist and get your condition confirmed and take medicines. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I am 59. I have a fibroid tumor that measured 6cm in 2013. It now measures 8 cm. my gynecologist is recommending a complete hysterectomy. I have very few symptoms, spotting occasionally. My mother, 79 has just been diagnosed w ovarian cancer. This is a concern for me. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There are two parts to your query.For your fibroid which is progressively increasing in size, it is possibly causing a lot of discomfort and bleeding during your periods. In this case, if you have finished your family and do not desire to have nay more children then hysterectomy is the complete solution. As you say that you only have spotting then you can choose for a myomectomy procedure or arterial embolization instead of hysterectomy. Please discuss the treatment options with your doctor and then take an informed decision.Regarding your mother who is confirmed to have an ovarian cancer, if it is in the first stage then surgery is compulsory. Even after surgery she might be given chemotherapy and radiation therapy to suppress the cancer cells. Since you have not mentioned the stage of cancer in your mother I guess that it is stage 1 cancer. Treatment should be given completely and she should follow up with her doctors when required. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My father has stage 4 liver cancer. He had done the TACE chemo ONCE but is not doing well especially when the cancer growth is progressive. Right now doctors are just giving him pain management because theres not much they can suggest. Is there anymore hope?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.TACE is transarterial chemoembolization and a method used to treat liver tumors from a closer distance. In TACE, a single or more than one cancer medicines are given into the hepatic artery and this causes the drug to be delivered with precision. However it is unfortunate that your father has a tumor which did not respond to treatment.There is a new procedure called SIRT(Selective internal radiation therapy) that can be given to patients who do not respond to TACE as a second line of treatment. This is not available in every hospital and you can discuss with his doctor if this treatment is made available to patients in your place.Please note that stage 4 cancer might have an expected survival of up to two years with recommended treatment and good supportive care. Hope your father responds to treatment. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hai Dr, I have a doubt whether cancer spreads through air to another person?

I am a skinny guy 22 years old 125lb last time i went to the doc was for this about a week ago and now have an appointment with a stomach DR but is there anything i can do to ease the pain for the 4 weeks that it will be b4 i see him","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query to H.C.M. Forum.  If I were your treating for this case of pain in the left rib cage , I would come up with these possibilities , these includes.1 The first possibility is of peptic ulcer disease or Hiatus hernia. Diagnosis can be confirmed by upper  G I endoscopy . Try raising the head of your bed  4 inches above with blocks.It might also help to avoid drinking or eating 2 hours  before you lie down. To help control the stomach acid , one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them or eat chocolates or spicy food or greasy good. Also take some antacid but if, symptoms are severe you may need drugs like proton pump inhibitors.2 As you mentioned that you lost appetite  so this may be due to some disease in liver , diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound of liver . Also get in blood  for liver function test as jaundice is the main cause of  fatigue and loss of appetite. 3 tension is the one cause , which may be responsible your problem , so if you think so , avoid the same. In my opinion antacid with oxetacaine in them will help you till your doctor's consultation. Good luck, Dr. HET"},{"Patient":"I am being treated for c diff with flagyl (10 days); just noticed swollen neck, no other symptoms beyond slight pain at base of ear, jugular; can't feel any nodule (but, then again, I'm not a dr.), also take Victoza for Type II Diabetes (on/off for 3 months.

However a complete clinical evaluation and further screenin of cancer is advised if your swelling in in the region of the thyroid and neck region. Medullary cancer is a sub type of thyroid cancer. Please note that more than 80 percent of swellings of the thyroid are benign and do not indicate cancer.Pain in the base of ear and jugular vein area can be nonspecific.

My question is, if in deed the biopsy reveals a malignancy, and she is staged at stage 1, can it be removed surgery, or better known as curative treatment?  I have been doing some research, and I am finding out that chemo and radiation is always curative> please help us, we are beside our selves with anxiety.  Thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There are certain areas including the head and neck region where the structures are closely situated and it is difficult to operated completely. Epiglottis is considered supraglottic part of larynx. A cancer in the epiglottis is a difficult to operate region and if biospy confirms malignancy then the patient should be given chemotherapy and radiation therapy to reduce the tumor volume.Once tumor volume is reduced then attempts can be made to try and operate the area if it is accessible. If the cancer is free from surrounding structures than an experienced surgeon might decide to operate on the supraglottic component and provide adjunct chemotherapy and radiation therapy for complete treatment. Lymphnode enlargement in the neck should be evaluated by doing a CT scan neck and if present then a biopsy should be done to know metastasis and do staging.

Melanoma colorectal cancer is a rare type that is associated with pigment forming cancer of the colon. This is an aggressive cancer and can spread quickly to other parts of the body.If your friend has melanoma colorectal cancer then it is possible that the cancer might have spread to other organs. A melanoma colorectal cancer might spread to liver, peritoneum, lungs, bones and brain. Since she is having fluid collection in the abdomen therefore metastasis to peritoneum might be present.Melanoma colorectal cancer spreads too fast and sometimes even doctors are able to make a confirmed diagnosis only when it has reached the later stages.

Colon cancer causes liver metastasis in half of the patients even after surgery.

Just be relaxed. Continue with your treatment. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic.

Multiple biopsies were taken and all were negative.  Before having the biopsies, I had no pain or discomfort.  It has been almost 6 months since the biopsies and now have not only continued discomfort in the area where they did the biopsies, but often have pain down the arm and into the neck and behind the shoulder blade.

We asked for more than one medical opinion regarding his treatment and basically we have two options; the first is to conduct several extensive chemotherapy sessions and then switch to radiotherapy or surgery. The second was that his condition was very rare that it can be treated by surgery first and then less sessions of chemotherapy can be conducted. I know that the immunity for a person gets very low after having chemotherapy and I am really concerned of him having chemotherapy first and surgery afterwards, so I want to ask which of the two options is a better one? And whether there are any other options for treatment? My father is 63 years old, a smoker, has type II diabetes, and had successful colon cancer surgery in 1983. I would really appreciate your medical opinion in this case and hope to get your answer very soon. Thank you, Tina","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Hr has lung cancer and spread into adrenal gland.  Treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. According to my opinion first he should go for chemotherapy then afterward he can go with surgery and radiotherapy.  Chemotherapy will reduce the size of cancer and decrease the chance of further spread. So its better to have to have chemotherapy first. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly.

Im trying to spend as much time as possible with her.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a challenging diagnosis and the life expectancy, survival and prognosis depends on the stage of cancer and response to treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.Melanoma is an aggressive tumor and spreads to other organs even after the primary cancer is operated. Your aunt might be having spread to other organs as you have described her condition is in the final stages. She must be a strong willed person and that is the reason she is exceeding her doctors prediction of her life expectancy.It is possible that she might survive for a few weeks more. Coughing up blood is not a good sign and that itself might cause her to give up. This is causing blood loss and therefore the next symptoms might be that of severe weakness, increase in blood loss and probably she might catch an infection in her lungs, a pneumonia sort of.

I know this is complicated and I need to go to oncologist on Monday.  Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Non Hodgkins lymphoma is due to the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells which have altered DNA changes which are usually acquired after birth. Such acquired changes may result from exposure to radiation, cancer-causing chemicals, or infections, but often these changes occur for no apparent reason. Its incidence increases with age. It involves enlargement of spleen and lymphnodes.Among the common cell mutations that are seen in non hodgkins lymphoma, most cases of follicular lymphoma (a type on non hodgkins lymphoma) have a translocation between chromosomes 14 and 18, which turns on the bcl-2 oncogene. This stops the cell from dying at the right time, which can lead to lymphoma due to proliferation. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello.

It has nothing to do with aggressive chemotherapy for malignant mealanoma. It does not cause any serious problem and in most cases is left untreated. Treatment involves complete cyst removal only when there is sufficient problem and symptoms that can be explained purely by the presence of the cysts.Most people have a single cyst and few have multiple cysts. Since he does not have symptoms, the arachnoid cysts are not a concern. However, a close follow up must be done for malignant melanoma and should MRI be done at that time then a record of the increase in size of the arachnoid cyst might be made.

However in a 88 year old with COPD and congestive heart failure, the heart functioning might be seriously compromised.

I can't feel anything but it is uncomfortable. I get really nervous because I have a friend going thru BC right now.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Stinging and tingling around a scar is not a confirmatory sign of cancer. It surely raises a concern since you have had a biopsy in exactly the same region ten years back. Breast cancer awareness has increased over the years and it is important to get a screening test done for your breast. It is most likely that you might not have any disease but it is important to get a screening test done to confirm it.Please consult a cancer screening clinic near you and get a screening mammography and breast ultrasound done at the earliest. While a screening mammography picks up suspicious areas, the breast ultrasound will tell you about the area under the scar and if there is any concern or changes below the skin that might require more detailed investigation. You can also check for any lumps or lymphnode swellings in your armpits and bring it to the notice of your doctor.

We had the doctor diagonize and found the 3rd bone on the neck has been affected by cancer and was decalared at 3rd stage. She is undergoing chemo for past 5 days...what does a 3rd stage mean? is there any special treatment she could recover from","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There are many different types of bone cancer classified on the cell of origin and pattern of cancer. There are locally aggressive ones and ones that spread quickly and affect other organs.A stage 3 bone cancer means that the cancer is large in size and has spread locally. She requires aggressive chemotherapy to control the cancer and see if there is reduction in size and extent after giving few cycles of chemotherapy. Some bone cancers also respond to radiation therapy and this is given after chemotherapy. I am not certain if your aunt has a bone cancer that will respond to radiation therapy. Depending on the extent and response to treatment, survival varies. In stage 3 cancer people who respond to treatment might survive for more than 3 to 5 years however since a neck bone is involved in your aunt, the situation requires to be reviewed in detail. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"For the past six months I've had three trans-vaginal ultrasounds for an ovarian cysts. It started put at six cms, then went down to 2 cms and now it is 3.5 cms. The first ultrasound was suspicious for ovarian cancer, but now they say is a simple cyst. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.If an ovarian cyst is continuously decreasing in size then malignancy is unlikely. A cyst measuring more than 3 cm requires regular monitoring. I guess that in the first ultrasound, the cyst was measuring 6 cm and had no features other than its size to suspect malignancy. It is a regular protocol to repeat ultrasound in 2 to 3 months before doing cancer specific tests.I agree that in the second ultrasound, the cyst reduced to 2 cm which is a good response. You have not mentioned about any treatment you were taking at that time and I guess you were taking treatment and therefore there was a response. This sort of treatment response occurs when there might be any hormonal imbalances causing the cyst and correcting it leads to decrease in the cyst size.In the third ultrasound, it is possible that the hormonal balance again got altered and therefore the cyst increased. However to put at rest any suspicion of malignancy I recommend you to get a CA 125 level test done to  confirm that your cyst is not at risk or a malignancy. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My good friend has 4th stage prostate cancer/bone deterioration.

Pain relief is an important area of concern and I agree that your friend should be spending the time he has in peace and comfort.Opioids are a good form of pain relief and are recommended at variable doses. It is possible that there is significant destruction of the lower spine and this is causing a lot of pressure on the nerve roots.Alternative pain relief measures like accupuncture, steroid injection and nerve blocks are available and he might benefit from these techniques.

Your mother has an early stage of cancer if it was stage 2 and therefore regular follow up is essential to pick up any metastasis if seen in the earliest stage during a follow up ultrasound scan or CT scan.I can see that you have mentioned AST and ALT results but to tell the chances for a liver metastasis the alkaline phosphatase levels are more reliable. If alkaline phosphatase rises more than 12 units in 6 weeks then there is a higher chance of liver metastasis.

If there is an infection then it must be treated first and then the wound healing will progress. By 6 weeks the stitches should have started healing. The time for complete healing of surgical wound is approximately 12 weeks. However since you have an open wound therefore first this wound must be cleaned and resutured. This will permit healing of the skin layers by first intention and progress to normal healing over the next few weeks.Since there is a lemon sized hole in your abdomen therefore it must be repaired by putting additional sutures in the  area. Please discuss about the open wound in detail with your doctor and when he is likely to close it. Healing is not possible with a persisting open wound.

A nodule that is 2.0 cm right now has to be watched for over the next 3 months to know how much doubling takes place concerning the volume of the nodule. A nodule measuring 3.0 cm or more has a higher chance of malignancy. Spiculations are linear strands extending from the lung margin and have been seen in 90 percent of carcinomas and also in some benign lesions.The average doubling time of a malignant lesion is 100 days and that is the reason you have been advised to take PET CT after 3 months duration. This is an investigation which clearly picks out cancer lesions from non cancerous ones. If the lesion has a volume doubling time of more than 6 months then it is likely to be benign.

That is when a patient is recommended to have chemotherapy and radiation therapy. During surgery, microscopic invasion of the cancer to the surrounding areas might persist and this can cause seeding of the cancer. As a result the patient can have recurrence even though she has got hysterectomy done.It is best to suppress the cancer cells with the help of radiation and then giving chemotherapy.

At this stage your daughter requires chemotherapy to kill the tumor from its origin.Dysgerminomas are usually very sensitive to chemo, and can sometimes be treated with the less toxic combination of carboplatin and etoposide. Giving chemotherapy will control the disease and prevent recurrence.Recurrence takes place in few patients even after surgery.

It is cancerous and therefore shows aggressive behavior and appearance with irregular margins and infiltration in to the surrounding areas.In most patients a leiomyocarcoma can be told apart from a leiomyoma only by pathological test. Please get a transvaginal ultrasound scan done to know the exact number and nature of the lesions and if they infiltrate in to the surrounding myometrium. If your symptoms like pain and menorrhagia are severe and if you do not wish to have children later then getting a hysterectomy is the definitive solution. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I finished off a gallon of orange juice a day ago that I had only opened the day before that, meaning I drank the whole thing in two days alone, I also had about six V8 energy drinks.

What are the next steps to take?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Colon cancer is treated completely by surgery if detected in early stage. However, CEA is to be done regularly to know the progressive increase and possibility of a recurrence of the tumor. Colon cancer might cause liver spread and this also has to be looked for by doing an ultrasound scan and CT scan if required.It is important to discuss the rise on CEA with your doctor and then proceed with doing an ultrasound scan or CT scan and if there is a strong suspicion then a PET CT scan might be necessary.

Men are affected twice as commonly as women. Being a benign condition it will not cause any risk to health in any person having it. However there can be slight discomfort due to appearance of lumps of variable size measuring from few mm to 5 cm.Marriage is advisable as it is a rare condition and is completely benign. However it is better if you tell your spouse about your condition and get her to understand that this condition is not dangerous to you in future. Small lipomas can be treated by surgical excision.

Otherwise 100% fit and healthy!I had a low anterior re-section 2 weeks ago to remove a tumor and have an illeostomy. I made good progress and was discharged from hospital a week ago. I have been taking up to 8 co-codamol tablets a day. Yesterday my temperature went up to 38.7C and my GP prescribed Macrodantin for a suspected urine infection. my temperature has lowered but my skin is so sensitive it hurts to have clothing against it, I also have severe aches in almost every joint and a deep ache in my pelvic floor area which I assume could be due to the surgery. Should I go back to my GP or continue with the medication?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer surgery like anterior resection is a complex procedure and involves manipulation of the bowel and nerves. Even after successful surgery, it is possible that some patients continue to experience pain in floor of pelvis and radiation to legs. This is because the nerve supply to legs is from the lower back part of spinal cord and these nerves pass through the pelvis and continue in to the legs.Any pinching of the nerves along their course and irritation of nerve fibers will cause pain and discomfort. After surgery wound healing also occurs and nerve fibers manipulated during the surgery require time to heal. Once healing takes place, scarring of tissue occurs which can cause nerve irritation and perception of pan in pelvic floor and legs. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My daughter is a Hodgkins' Disease survivor--9 years since a successful transplant using her own cells.  She just delivered a baby 10 days ago, and baby has a lump in her left arm, exactly where my daughter had a tumorous cancer in her bones in her left arm and had surgery and radiation to remove the cancer.  Her baby has a lump in her arm exactly in the same spot that my daughter had her bone cancer in her left arm.  Is it possible that baby is having any cancer in her own left arm, since the lump is exactly where my daughter's cancer was in her own arm?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is unlikely that your grand child is having a cancer at exactly the same area where your daughter once had a tumor. However it is important to bring it to the notice of the pediatrician treating the baby and take a clinical opinion regarding the possibilities.Presently we have good imaging techniques and for a 10 day old child, doing an ultrasound scan will help us know should there be any concern regarding a lump in the left arm. If there is a strong suspicion then doing a X ray is also advised.It is more likely that the baby has some asymmetry of arms and this can be verified by clinical examination itself. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello, my dad he is 82 years old and has been sick for the past two years.  He kept telling us the doctors don't know what he has.

Right now it is suggested to study the MRI scan of his spine if done earlier and if not doe then doing it important. The MRI scan will show the changes which might indicate any bone marrow pathology like myeloproliferative disorders.If he has any problems associated to a particular bone then that needs to be investigated in detail. He might also require a bone marrow biopsy to know the exact nature of cells and confirm condition including myeloproliferative disorder or leukemia.

Unable to swallow food but can drink liquids and talk .A stent cannot be fitted as too far up in her throat .The doctors say it would choke her if they did .I have also been told that her previous horse voice was cancer in the wind pipe . What would be her life expectancy .Thank you .","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Survival of a cancer in the throat depends on the staging and type of cancer. To prevent choking, a tracheostomy can be done and she can continue breathing through a hole in the anterior neck. This has to be checked regulrly and cleaned to avoid plugging. She might lose her voice after tracheostomy.Intake of food is a concern and stent placement is difficult as discussed with your doctor. If she is on liquids then she can continue taking it using a nasogastric tube. In most conditions this can be taken as a stage 4 cancer and in this stage a patient might survive for up to 2 years if she takes supportive treatment and gets good care.

I didn't know if this was lymph node or thyroid problems. Should I be worred about cancer?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.If you do not have any ulcerative wound in your mouth or lumps in the neck region then there is no risk of cancer at present. A throbbing pain in the throat and jaw can be due to many reasons including sore throat due to infection.You have taken a good decision to quit smoking but please do not start even one cigarette as it is an addiction and you will get in to the habit again. Most people have craving for smoking after few months but you should avoid any smoking from now.For sore throat you can do gargling and this will help you to soothe the throat and get comfort.

No doctor will give an expected survival of 6 months without the presence of serious illness. It is important that you please gather the medical reports of your uncle and send it to us for review and discussion.Cancer and other serious illness are of multiple types and they need to be reviewed in detail before discussing possible treatments. In earlier days, ayurvedic treatment was done with a lot of research and dedication. It is difficult to find reliable cancer treatment centers in ayurveda these days.

He said they would do routine blood work If liver functions go up they would do a Ct Scan. Her liver was elevated once and then they did CT Scan It showed swollen lymph nodes throughout her stomach but she feels great no symtons went oncologist and he did a CA19-9 the reading was 7 no cancer is this test reliable? The Doctor states that the reason why liver function was elevated because the lymph nodes in the area where the gallbladder was removed was pushing against the bile duct, her labs are good now. Does she have cancer or not?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The normal range of CA 19-9 in the blood of a healthy individual is 0-37 U/ml (Units per milliliter).  CA 19-9 associated antigen levels are elevated in many patients with pancreatic cancer. However not all patients with cancer in the pancreas and gall bladder region will have elevated CA19-9 level elevated.Since your mother has confirmed gall bladder cancer with multiple lymphnode enlargement in the stomach, it is important to treat her on grounds of cancer and provide complete treatment and pain relief. Many patients will not develop symptoms of cancer in the early stages even when there is lymphnode enlargement. There is probably no pressure on the normal structures like cystic duct and bile ducts due to the cancer and therefore she is not having major symptoms , however the liver function abnormalities can be due to lymphnodes causing pressure on the bile duct. It is important to test the lymphnodes for cancer if it has not been done and if confirmed to be cancer then start treatment. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My father's prostrate cancer returned last yr in August.  He has completed 7 rounds of chemo.

His PSA level the last time they took it was 31 and two weeks ago it was 88.  I know everyone is different however the dr would not give us a time frame for my dad.  A week ago the pain was not bad and he could take a few advil and now he is on 5mg of morphine.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a challenging condition and prostate cancer that has spread to bones and liver is difficult to treat completely. It is important to know that the liver lesions can be targeted and treated with new treatments like chemoembolizaton and radio frequency ablation. There are certain criteria to be fulfilled before treatment is given. Chemotherapy also is a good treatment option but radiofrequency ablation and chemoembolization are more target oriented treatments from a closer distance and therefore the success rates are higher.Unfortunately your father might be having stage 4 cancer of the prostate. This requires aggressive treatment and if his bone lesions have responded to treatment in the past then it ids good and there are chances that the disease process can be controlled and stabilized. Pain is due to pinching and irritation of nerves in the lower back due to the spread of disease to the bones. Instead of giving him a regular morphine, it is better to give him morphine when the pain is severe. This way he will not develop tolerance to the medicine and can get pain free.

Unfortunately the tumor has grown to a large size and the mass behind the pancreas is a lymph  node. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are the treatments recommended. Surgery is not possible in stage 4 cancer.If the tumor has grown in to the lumen of esophagus then putting a bare metallic stent might open up the lumen but this is only a temporary solution. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are used in many patients to reduce the size of tumor. The life expectancy of stage 4 cancer is about 2 years from the date of detection and with proper response to treatment and good supportive care most patients can survive.

If there is a person with lung cancer in the household then it is not a problem to inhale the same air. We doctors work all the time with cancer patients and talk to hem for hours without any risk of ourselves getting it. Children also have no risk of developing cancer from another patient by breathing the same air. It is best to provide him with sputum cups which can be safely disposed.However it is important to make sure that he does not have any infection that is causing blood and coughing in sputum.

It is not a must for hepatocellular carcinoma to involve the lungs. Ascites and enlarged liver with biopsy proven hepatocellular carcinoma should still be considered as the diagnosis. Liver tumor markers are not necessarily raised in every patient and serve as a prognostic variable.Treatment should first be towards curative with chemotherapy. It chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation or SIRT are available choices then please discuss at the cancer hospital close to you. Treatment depends on the size, location, number and aggressiveness of the cancer. Pain relief is also to be provided and please give him good nutrition.

In most cases, patients with a tumor in the ovary can have pinching of nerves or nerve irritation that can cause the perception of pain.

Any post-operative changes in the pelvis if applicable might also cause such a pain in the lower back.Another important, but the rare possibility is if you have any condition in the bones of the lower back which might be causing the pain.

Please type your query here...Yes thank you. my aunt in chennai has been diagnosed with non-invasive papillary carcinoma. Will a PET scan help to grade it. do you have pet scan in your institute and how much will it cost?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.PET scan is positron emission tomography which is an imaging investigation that uses a radioactive substance called a tracer to look for disease in the body. In this scan an injection containing radioactive glucose is given in to the vein of the patient and then this goes and gets collected in the area where there is a lot of consumption of glucose. Usually cancer areas have a high energy requirement of glucose and that is the reason the cancer region is seen on a PET scan. It will tell where a cancer might have spread in the body and therefore change the staging.In PET scan it is not possible to tell the grade of cells. However it can pick up areas of active cell multiplication but it will not give a pathological diagnosis. Usually CT scan is also done together with a PET scan to know the exact area of cancer and it is also called PET CT scan. It can cost approximately ten thousand rupees and is done in many cancer hospitals and in private centers across the country.

There are many types of cancer that can occur. They can involve any structure in the body and they are classified based upon the cell that is present in the cancer. The cells are further classified as well differentiated, ,moderately differentiated and undifferentiated.When a cancer is stage one it refers to the size and that it has not spread locally and there is no distant spread. However such cancers can have poorly differentiated cancer and if not treated properly, they can go from stage 1 to stage 4 quickly.Most cancers detected at stage 1 are treatable however there are some cancers which require longer treatment so that they are under control and do not recur after treatment is complete. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I am 24 years of age. I had a tumor surgically taken out. After its biopsy it was found to be pure dysgerminoma. The tumor was confined to one overy. It was a conservative surgey. Do i need a chemotherapy? What is the survival rate with and without chemo. 5 year survival rate means the person only has 5 years to live?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to take chemotherapy for dysgerminoma after surgery. Stage 1 requires only surgery because it is aimmature teratoma. However higher stage is best treated with chemotherapy.Dysgerminomas are usually very sensitive to chemo, and can sometimes be treated with the less toxic combination of carboplatin and etoposide. Giving chemotherapy will control the disease and prevent recurrence.Recurrence takes place in few patients even after surgery. That is why probably your doctors have recommended chemotherapy.With chemotherapy survival rates are high in the early stages. Almost every patient will respond to treatment. In cancer survival 5 year is considered a benchmark for treatment. If a patient survives for 5 years then their cancer is considered treated. Patients can live for a life time.

Most are benign conditions but a recurrence must always be ruled out if you had previous breast cancer and took treatment for it. Radiation causes changes below the skin and this might manifest as a sore. It is not essential for an infection to be discharging in the early stages.Though it appears to be a post lumpectomy and radiation change that has taken place,  it is suggested that you consult your doctor and get ultrasound scan done to screen for any suspicious activity in your breast. Also please feel your axilla for any lymph node swelling and bring it to the notice of your doctors.

In the first CT after 3 treatment, a detention of the illness was observed and the treatment, continued, but after other three treatments we see that the treatment is ineffective: the tumors have grown and there's an additional metastasis in the thyroid gland. How would you continue the treatment? Thank you in advanced. Marilyz","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have cervical cancer and treatment by radical surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Now you have multiple metastatic lesion.  So it becomes stage 4 disease now.

Once the cancer cells are destroyed then they are released in to the circulation. When that happens, a lot of toxins are released in to the system. The liver and kidneys help in clearing these cells. These events make the patient weak and the chemotherapy agents also cause side effects which lead to low immunity and weakness. Some patients also develop anemia and infections after chemotherapy.

The PET scan was negative and the path report showed it to be basaloid squamous cell. Is cisplatin a better choice considering the probability of distant mets?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Neck cancer if detected in early stages can be treated initially by surgery and follow up might require chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Erbitux (cetuximab) is a cancer medication that interferes with the growth of cancer cells and slows their growth and spread in the body. This helps in treatment of head and neck cancers. It can be given along with radiation therapy also. Combining cisplatin or cetuximab with radiation improves overall survival  of patients with stage III or IV head and neck carcinoma.Concerning erbitux or cisplatin, both are effective in treatment of head and neck cancer.

With the rash and cough sounds more like Giant Cell and if so his dose seems low to me. Also could this be leukemia and what tests should we make sure he gets? Thank you....this has been a very long month and a very slow process for us....Jo","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is best to get X rays of the affected knee to be done and analysed for any bone changes. Giant cell tumor and cough are unrelated problems. ESR can be high due to polymyalgia rheumatica. ESR rises with inflammation of any type and does not mean cancer or leukemia.However, should you want a complete confirmation about leukemia then he must get a complete blood count with peripheral smear and if strongly suspected then a bone marrow biopsy.Rash and cough might commonly occur in many conditions. His immune status also needs to be evaluated and if he is having any tendency to catch infections and allergy.In conclusion, for the knee he requires a X ray and for the cough and rash he needs a peripheral blood smear which can be compared with the recently done complete blood count as basic investigations. Other higher investigations depend on the results of basic test.

We have started her on Ayurvedic medicines. Recently, we heard about Cannabis Oil & looked around for it. Unfortunately, we did not find Rick Simpson oil but found Homeopathy Cannabis tincture (Cannabis Indica). She has started taking it since a week now. She did not get too drowsy except for first 2 days. She started complaining about leg/arms pain & started getting fever. Now she is diagnosed with jaundice. She initially had jaundice too due to obstruction & now we are suspecting the same. She will be going for an Ultrasound tomorrow to check the stunt inside her liver for removing obstruction & may replace the stunt with a new one. I am wondering if this was caused by Cannabis tinture? Can she continue taking Cannabis or stop it? The Cannabis tincture she is taking is made with Ethanol using cold pressed method. Any help regarding this will be greatly appreciated. We have no doctors offer any advice when it comes to Cannabis oil. Your advice is very precious.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to hear about your mother having stage 4 cancer of lung and with liver involvement. It is not clear if her liver functions were compromised at the time of giving cannabis oil to her. Cannabis can also by itself lead to liver toxicity and jaundice when given in significant amounts. However since she already had cancer lesions in the liver therefore the possibility of a preexisting liver damage is more likely causing jaundice. In that case her jaundice is due to the deteriorating liver function and a result of biliary obstruction.It is best to wait for a day and check the shunt function in liver and if there is any primary cause of jaundice due to the shunt malfunction. If there is shunt problem then cannabis is unlikely to have caused the jaundice. Please give her adequate supportive care.

At first I recommend that you get a CT scan paranasal air sinuses done and then know if there is any concern in the sinuses. Since people have low immunity after chemotherapy that is why they can catch a number of infections that will not be found in normal people. These can be caused by fungal organisms, bacteria and viruses.Once any problem is identified within the paranasal air sinuses then treatment is targeted after disease confirmation. If a fungal or bacterial infection is found then treatment is with antifungal and antibiotics. Avoid exposure to pollution and dust.

Honestly I feel weird writing this, but yeah I just want answers. On cost and such.. and how I would go about doing this sorta thing in Canada.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Not much is known about the genetic risk factors for brain tumor, and there is little evidence connecting brain tumors with family history. However, it is possible that brain tumors are associated with several familial cancer predisposition syndromes. These include Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis and Turcot's syndrome. In the above list of conditions, a person might inherit a germline mutation in a tumor suppressor gene.Tumor suppressor genes help suppress development of tumors and when these get mutated or if they are inherited from parents then there is always a possibility that a tumor might arise. However this does not happen too often and does not mean that you get worried about it. Should you feel that you have neurological and cognitive problems like memory, concentration and headache then please consult the neurologist and get examined completely in detail.

She also is extremely tired. The main question is when can we expect her to be more like her \\"old\\" self.Thanks,Michelle","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cisplatin is a chemotherapy agent and disintegrates into smaller metabolites within 30 minutes after it being injected. Medical literature says that the platinum from Cisplatin, but not Cisplatin itself, becomes bound to several plasma proteins, including albumin, transferrin, and gamma globulin.Three hours after an injection is started and about two hours after the end of a three-hour infusion, 90% of the plasma platinum is protein bound. This bound form is eliminated in 5 days from the time of injection.Chemo brain is a condition where there might be weakness and brain fog persisting after treatment. This is usually observed a cognitive change in the person with associated physical fatigue and weakness. No medications have been approved to treat chemo brain and patients might do well with psychological support and involving themselves in cognitive rehabilitation.

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The pain in costochondritis is typically in the front of chest next to the sternum and might cause lot of distress. It is a sharp pain.Breast implants can cause irritation of the nerves in the anterior chest wall causing pain perception. This pain is more localized to the area where implants are present and usually does not radiate to other places.Metastasis is pain due to bone destruction. This is diffuse pain which increases on palpation and focused on the area overlying the bone.It is suggested that you get a chest X ray or CT scan done to evaluate in detail the cause and nature of problem leading to the pain."},{"Patient":"I had two breast lumps taken out years ago....both benign....went on tomoxifen to prevent breast cancer for 5 years.

I'm worried about these sensations since my sister got breast cancer at 40 and died at 45.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to get breast ultrasound done to assess the area under the skin where the lumps were earlier present. This can help to know of any recurrent lumps or an infection in the area. Post operative healing and scar formation also causes tingling and pulling sensation. Ultrasound uses sound waves to get a picture of the structures under the skin. It is radiation free and an easy method of breast evaluation recommended for all ages.Please consult the surgeon who operated and removed the lumps in your breast a year back. Get yourself examined clinically and clear doubts of any suspicious cancer by getting ultrasound scan for both the breasts and axillary regions and most likely it will be normal.

Even is colonoscopy will not be done due to insurance regulations, at least ultrasound scan abdomen or a CT scan abdomen must be done to know if there is a concern that requires treatment at the moment.Colonoscopy is to be repeated at least every 5 years in people with polyps and those with family history of large bowel cancer. Presently there is also the possibility of doing a virtual CT coloscopy and please check with your insurance if that can be done for you. The results of virtual CT colonoscopy are comparable to real colonoscopy.Colonoscopy will not evaluate stomach polyps and for that you have to get upper gastrointestinal endoscopy done. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"HiI am currently in sydney, australia. On Wednesday night, I had a terrible stomach pain and later a big vomit.

Please tell your father to visit a cancer hospital and then get examined in detail. If there is doubt then please have imaging investigation and biopsy done. It is best to clarify even the smallest doubt of cancer before taking chemotherapy.Without confirmation no one should take chemotherapy as it can cause serious side effects and damage. First he should get a CT scan or MRI scan done and then a biopsy. In this way the cells from cheeks will be studied under microscope and any abnormal cancer cells picked up. There is usually no doubt in finding a cancer on biopsy. If not conclusive then a repeat biopsy is to be done. Doing a PET scan is advised if doubt persists and this tells a cancer in most cases.

Diagnosis can  be confirmed by upper G I endoscopy , visualize erosion of gastric surface of stomach. Try raising the head of bed 4 inches above with blocks. It might also help to avoid eating or drinking 2 hours before you lie down. To help control stomach acid one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them Avoid fried food , spicy food.

Surgery was the primary treatment for you and subsequently there was a need for further treatment ue to a single lymphnode showing presence of cancer cells.While chemotherapy and radiation therapy are both given for this cancer, it depends on the disease involvement and stage at detection which decides the treatment protocol. In your case, it is possible that your doctor is giving radiotherapy so that any other lymphnode or disease spread can be totally treated and then it can be followed up by chemotherapy if required.

This is treated by surgery in the initial stages. Some patients also require chemotherapy and radiation therapy for proper cure to take place. As you had surgery done and lymph nodes were negative therefore it is possible that the cancer was still localized to the uterus; however in some patients the biopsy of the specimen might show severe grade malignancy cells and this needs to be eradicated with chemotherapy and radiation.If you do not take chemotherapy and radiation then it is always possible that the disease spread might occur to other adjacent structures and then there will be metastasis even in the absence of primary tumor.

CT scan takes detailed images using a concentration of  X rays using a computer. In this way the scans make thin sections through the abdomen and then these studied for any abnormality.If there is a lump that appears more with increased abdominal pressure then a surgical hernia is more likely.

Cancer is a challenging condition to treat and we must try to treat it as much possible and at the same time providing pain relief and avoiding discomfort to the patient.It appears that her general condition is slightly below normal and she can be helped with improvement in her diet. It is usual for patients not to have an appetite and in that case please provide her foods that she likes and will help in weight gain. Once general condition improves then doctors might be in a position to give chemotherapy.For the pain you must discuss with a pain management team and they can suggest powerful pain relief medicines to be taken when the pain is more. She does not need to take the medicines all the time but can take certain medicines like opioids when the pain is severe.

Please type your query here...my mother is of 71 year aged suffering with intestine cancer from last 1.5 year doc says that she is not in such position to operate and face keemotherepy now she is facing the problem in urine also although we are giving her treatment of ramdev please suggest?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a challenging condition and every patient is given a customized treatment keeping in mind the staging and expected response to treatment. As your mother has been suffering from intestinal cancer for last 1.5 years therefore it might be in stage 3 or 4 cancer. In such a condition it is difficult to treat by surgery alone and often even if surgery is done then chemotherapy and radiation therapy are important.It is possible that surgery might have certain limitation due to age and local spread of disease. In this situation it is best to start chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and then give radiation to further limit the disease process. Please discuss in detail with the oncologist. Holistic medicine might keep her mind at peace but does not effectively treat the cancer and its spread. You must improve her general condition by giving nutrition. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello, my nan recently died of cancer, it was very sudden and from being told it was turminal to the day she passed away was only 5 days.

Many thanks Sam","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to hear about the death of your nan from cancer.Duodenum is part of the small intestine just after the stomach. She had cancer of the duodenum. The duodenum is attached to the abdominal structures with the help of fat and behind it there is the retroperitoneum which is a space in the abdominal cavity where kidneys are located.In her case, there was cancer of the duodenum which is the beginning of small intestine and this is adherent to the structures behind it which is called the retroperitoneum.

Appendicitis is a totally different problem and occurs due to infection and inflammation of the appendix located at the beginning of large intestine.There is always a small risk of appendicitis getting ruptured and causing significant problems which can become an emergency and concern to her life. It is best to confirm appendicitis first by doing a CT scan and then to get a surgery done after getting a medical fitness for surgery. This surgery is a simple one and might require her to be in hospital for 3 days. Please approach any government hospital and get treatment done at subsidized rates. Appendicitis should not be ignored.

I dont want to lose him but i need to know how long do u think he has to live?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your father's situation and problem. Oesophagus cancer is very notorious in spread. And it is not having good prognosis. Your father is having liver metastasis, this means he is having end stage (stage 4) Oesophagus cancer. Stage 4 Oesophagus cancer is having life expectancy less than 1  year. Five year survival rate is less than 15-20%.The main reason is decreased oral intake. Cancer in esophagus does not allow food or liquids to pass, so patient is malnourished, immunocompromised and very very weak.

I can understand your grand daughter 's situation and problem. Cervical ribs are considered as accessory ribs. In 80-90 % of cases, cervical ribs are incidental finding without any symptoms.

Being so it  increases the risk of oral cancer in those who chew it regularly. The risk to get oral cancer reduces significantly after stopping tobacco chewing However if you have done chewing of tobacco for many years then you will still have an increased risk of having oral cancer as compared to the rest of the population.If there is any lump in mouth or a wound that is not healing then you must at once consult the ENT surgeon and then get necessary investigations done if required.The relative risk of oral cancer increases with the time duration of tobacco chewing. If you have done tobacco chewing for less than 5 years then the risk is less. Maximum risk is in people who have tobacco chewing for 20 years or more. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"hi I recently went for my mirena coil to be replaced the doctor told me I had a polyp on my cervix and has arranged for me to have it removed. They replaced my coil. Can you tell me is there a risk of cervical cancer, all my previous smears have always been clear I am 39","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A polyp is usually a benign finger like outgrowth. It is at the cervix in your case and should be removed and seen under the microscope. While over 95 percent of polys in the cervix are benign and harmless in nature still 5 percent can get converted to a malignancy.Your doctor has suggested right to get the polyp removed and then checked for any signs of malignancy. Please  get the polyp removed and discuss the histopathology report with your doctor. It is most likely that your polyp will turn out to be benign and harmless. Surgery is advised in every patient with a polyp so that in the rare event of a malignant polyp, treatment ca be given at the earliest. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Is it possible to receive cancer, in your eyes, for being in the computer too longAge: 16Height: 5'11Weight: 185 lbsWhen I was young I was overweight, as I grew I lost it and maintained the average weight. Until I grew to twelve years of age, then I began to eat more junk food, and awful beverages that increase weight. I have gotten all vaccination shots and am perfectly healthy as I write this.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In general eye malignancies are very rare. The common eye cancer is Retinoblastoma. It is common in extremes of age, in less than 10 years and more than 60 years. The most common cause for this is genetic mutation. Retinoblastoma gene is responsible for this. So eye cancers are very rare and if at all occur, occur in susceptible individuals only. Since your age is 16 years, possibility of eye cancer due to excess computer work is very less. But this will certainly damage your eyes. So better to take intermittent rest in between computer work."},{"Patient":"About two months ago I had abdominal surgery to remove an endometrioma mass from my left lower quadrant - it had become surrounded by my sigmoid colon.  Now I am once again having constant pain in my left lower quadrant. I have already had a hysterectomy but still have my ovaries.  During my hospitalization a colonoscopy was normal - my ovaries were normal with no cysts.  What else could this pain in my side be?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood your concerns. I think you need to repeat the scan once again as you have got the scan at the time of admission by now as 2 months went off I request you to have one more again. You can consult your treating doctor to talk about this he may help you for this.There must be some adhesions due to surgery or any other organic cause. Thank you."},{"Patient":"whiples operation on 1/3/11(findings: The distal stomach, bileduct, head of pancreas and proximal jejunum were removed. No obvious metastatsis in lymph node or liver were noted) Histopathology: (Periampullary) Adenocarcinoma, Moderately differentiated what treatement now","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. You are having adenocarcinoma. You are not having lymphatic spread as lymphnodes are negative for malignancy. The best treatment is surgical removal (Whipple 's operation) and post operative chemotherapy. Since you already had whipple' s operation, better to undergo post operative chemotherapy. The main reason for this is to prevent local recurrence and distal metastasis. During surgery, handling of mass can cause local site spillage of tumour cells. So these can cause local recurrence. So to prevent this, chemotherapy is needed. So consult oncologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"My dear friend had a big op for pancreatic cancer a couple of years ago. She is 80 and has just had the bad news it is back and she has lost control of her bladder. She is on morhine for the pain and now waiting to see an oncologist. How long do you think we have here at this stage.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your friend 's situation and problem. Honestly speaking, pancreatic cancer is having very poor prognosis. Loss of urine control suggest spinal cord involvement. So better go for MRI spine to rule out spinal metastasis. If spinal metastasis is present then she is having stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Stage 4 pancreatic cancer has life expectancy of less than 1 year. So better to first rule out spinal metastasis in your friend 's case."},{"Patient":"sir, my cousin 15 yr old is facing some health problems .now she is hospatelised.now her blood count is 6,so they r giving blood.after testing her blood the dr said that in blood lymphocyte count is high..sheis little fatty  .thats y am asking this question...pls explain me..is lymphocytosis is a cancer?or do lymphocytosis leads to cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your cousin's situation and problem. Your cousin is having low hemoglobin and high lymphocytes. This is seen in blood cancer like leukemia and lymphoma. Other causes for high lymphocytes are 1.  Viral infection 2. Chronic infection like tuberculosis or fungal infection. So to differentiate between all these, I advice to go for bone marrow biopsy. In bone marrow biopsy, if blasts are seen than possibility of blood cancer is high. So consult hematologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"my mom was diagnosed thyroid CA in 2001.Radiation therapy was done.she is taking thyrax since then.Last Feb. she went to see a Dr. due to pains in her knee and arms.tumors in both of her lungs has been detected.Dr. diagnosed 4th stage.

Lung metastasis in thyroid cancer is very rare. But when present, suggests poor prognosis. Stage 4 thyroid cancer is having life expectancy of less than 2 years. Five year survival rate is less than 30%.Chemotherapy can increase survival rate in some patients.

I can understand his condition and problem. His symptoms like forgetfulness, weakness, loosing body functions etc suggest possibility of brain metastasis. Throat cancer is mostly squamous cell carcinoma. And it can spread to brain in some cases. So we need to rule out brain metastasis in his case. Get done MRI brain first to rule out brain metastasis. If MRI is normal then following are the possible causes. 1. Electrolyte disturbance 2. Acute psychosis etc. So first get done MRI brain to rule out brain metastasis and then consult psychiatrist."},{"Patient":"Hi My dad had prostate cancer a few years ago and had treatment.

Please consult your doctor without any fear. Without clinical examination it is not possible to guide you in the right direction.Since the moles are finger tip sized it is likely to be a little amount of increased pigmentation and can happen due to benign causes in most people. It is unlikely to be a breast cancer and you can relax about it.Even the rare possibility of skin cancer persists only if there is sudden enlargement in the mole, rapid color change in the appearance, growth of hair on it or unexplained lumps any where else in the body. Please remember that delaying treatment might lead to complications in the rare possibility of it being a condition that requires immediate treatment.

With in 4 days the lump was the size of a hockey puck and extremely painful. They did surgery to remove it, but didn t take it out 2x s. Once before a mri and petscan, and once after, but both times they just sewed him back up and said if they removed it, they would be doing more damage than the tumor. He says he has a non-cell malignancy. He told me today it is stage 4 melanoma. He is in his 4th week of daily radiation, but he said that he has been told he is inoperable, uncurable, but manageable. He originally told me that the tumor was solo, and not attached to anything when he had an ultrasound, but 4 days later when they did the 2nd surgery it has wrapped itself around things in his neck. What kind of cancer does this? Is he terminal?He lives in another state and I think he is keeping information from me to spare my feelings?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It appears that your son has a melanoma that might have spread to neck lymphnodes. This is a possibility and has to be confirmed by doing a biopsy. What happens is that lymphnodes are found in many regions of the body and are small in size unless they are stimulated by disease process. When there is a disease in a person then the lymphnodes of a particular region get enlarged and this is a reaction by the immune mechanism.Since your son has been told that he has a melanoma, it has probably involved the neck lymphnodes. The lymphnodes in the neck are close to the carotid artery and internal jugular vein and it is possible that the lymphnodes have wrapped around these. Doing a surgery in this condition is not possible and radiation usually works. It is suggested that you spend some time with your son by going over to his place and know more about the treatment he should be taking for his condition.

As the cancer is stage 3 therefore the tumor is large in size. Nodes should be searched for in the neck region. The presence of nodes makes is possibly stage 4. In this case there is a need to first give chemotherapy as that can make the node to decrease in size and then surgery might be possible. Some doctors also recommend radiation after chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and then make it operable. First the maggots causing infection need to be treated with medications and the cancer area to be kept clean.For the proper staging, both CT scan and pathology reports are to be assessed in detail. The chances of five year survival in head and neck cancer is better than other cancers with proper treatment and follow up.

And if it has not got bigger he wants me to have another MRI after two years and after that it isnot necessary to monitor this any longer.  Now, my MRI scan has been arranged for tomorrow and on the referral form that he has written out for the Imaging Centre it says \\"Parafalcine Meniginoma\\" found.

This is to be regularly monitored on MRI and if there are symptoms then it is surgically removed. Since it is parafalcine in location therefore it is not in an important area in the brain and will not cause any serious symptoms.Regular MRI scans help to know if a meningioma has grown enough to cause symptoms and if it requires removal. It will help to know your symptoms in detail to know if the meningioma is symptomatic in your case.Your doctor wants to to keep calm and take things easy.

As the cancer area is 3.0 x 3.0 cm therefore there is stage 3 or 4 disease. The presence of nodes makes is possibly stage 4.

Cervical cancer is common in age more than 50years, nulliparous women, woman with multiple sexual partners, woman with HPV infection etc. Since all these factors are absent in your case, possibility of cervical cancer is less. Symptoms of cervical cancer are1. Lower abdominal dull aching pain with fever, weight loss and anorexia. 2. Bloody discharge from vagina. 3. Cervical mass or ulcer on clinical examination. So better to consult gynecologist and get done 1. Clinical examination 2. Microscopic examination of discharge. 3. Ultrasound examination of abdomen. Infective etiology is more likely in your case.

I also suggest you start oral rehydration therapy (with zinc supplements) as your diarrhea is persisting. If after taking the metronidazole and you still have similar symptoms it will be best to do another stool test + antibiotics sensitivity (stool exams + culture). Another microbial organisms could be present and therefore require more extensive testing to determine them. Hope this helps and wish you the best."},{"Patient":"Hi Doc.

Endometrial carcinoma is highly chemotherapy sensitive. And surgical removal is treatment of choice for endometrial carcinoma. During surgery, handling of mass can cause local site spillage of tumour cells. So possibility of recurrence is high. This is the reason for post operative chemotherapy. Chemotherapy will be effective against not only local site but also on systemic spread. It prevents local as well as distal spread. So chemotherapy is must after hysterectomy in case of endometrial carcinoma."},{"Patient":"hello. sir i was the patient of cervical and the doctor gave me very very strong medicine i took these medicine for about 6 to 8 months, 5 in the morning and 3 at night. after taking the medicine i was feeling very lazy and my sexual power seems to be very low, sometimes i was in mood to have sex but i quit because of no strongness. i talked to another doctor and advised to stop the medicine immediately and recommend me to take Revitale and polybion z daily but i seems no proper improvement. can you please help me for this as i sometimes feel shame.   very much obliged to you. i am 42 years old. my height is 5 feet 10 inches and have strong body","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Cervical cancer damages cervical nerves . These nerves are responsible for all the sensations during sexual Intercourse. So  in my opinion you should start 1. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT). 2. Multivitamin containing vitamin b 12 and zinc. Hormones are required for sexual desire. Vitamin b 12 and zinc are necessary for nerve growth and function. You need to take all these for at least 1 months to see any improvement. Since all these are prescribed drugs, you need to consult doctor for their prescription."},{"Patient":"What causes clear fluid to weep from a squamous carcinoma on neck.  This cancer  has metastasized to lymph glands and other organs?  I am 68 years old, 188 pounds, 5'10\\".  I have had prostate cancer 18 years ago, recurrent prostate 14 years ago, squamous carcinoma three years ago.  I had surgery for the squamous on my temple, then radiation but it metastasized to my lymph glands almost immediatly.  I have had two blood clots this year that were life threatening and supposedly cancer induced (?).  I am on arixtra (anti-coagulant) and Voltaren for pain.  Also Avapro for high blood pressure.  I have always been strong and \\"healthy\\" and exercise.  HF","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The commonest cause for a clear fluid discharge from a squamous cell carcinoma of neck is a secretion or infection. If you had taken treatment with radiation therapy then there is a possibility that certain changes have occurred in the neck lymph nodes and these might have become focus of secondary infection. In the early stages of infection, a thin fluid can appear in the lymph nodes and these can start discharging fluid.Another possibility is a sinus or fistula formation with deeper structures in the neck due to radiation therapy. A sinus is a blind ending tract below the skin and a fistula is a tract having two openings, one on the outside and another in the inside. Both sinus and fistula can discharge clear fluids. Please get examined by your surgeon and take treatment should there be a secondary infection in the neck. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Does pancreatic cancer give you sever burps and passing chronic wind,I have a mass on my pancreas they are doing a lung scan tomorrow and blood test I have had sickness diaharea and lost weight ,my doctor thought it was my hiaiis hernia but now further test have diagnosed mass on ct scan they have said doing more test but have mentioned cancer they are ringing me with answers after tast tomorrow","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, pancreatic cancer (mass)  can cause burping  and gaseous feeling in stomach. Pancreas is situated on the posterior aspect of stomach. So any mass in the pancreas can cause pressure on the stomach. It also causes narrowing of the lumen of stomach. So it can cause burping. If you are also having simultaneous hiatus hernia, this can aggravate the condition. So better to first confirm pancreatic mass. Start proton pump inhibitors for burping. Avoid spicy and hot food."},{"Patient":"My mom has met bone cancer from breast located in her pelvis and femur.  Treatment has been steroids which seemed to have eased her pain  now started aromycin to ease off steroids.  However, she was taking zyprexa for anxiety (long time ADO patient) but because of bad symptoms they switched to Buspar (milder).  However, after 2 weeks she has now become somewhat catatonic and disoriented and has a lot of trouble speaking.  Doc says it's the cancer and we should speak to hospice.  But she was a very much different, pleasant and communicating person 3 weeks ago.  We think it's the meds because of the dramatic change.  Your thoughts ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. There are few possibilities in your mother's case for her symptoms like disorientation, catatonia and decreased speech. 1. Brain metastasis 2. Electrolyte disturbance 3. Acute psychosis due to cancer. So first get done MRI brain to rule out brain metastasis,as breast cancer commonly spreads to brain. If this is normal, then get done Electrolyte levels. If both are normal then she is having acute psychosis due to cancer (terminal disease). So consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. She may need additional drugs too."},{"Patient":"patient: 37y/o female. symptoms: anaemia, raised liver enzymes, smokes 20/day for 12 yrs, widened mediastinum on CXR, ?spinal cord compression.  -> Would you say this presents with lung carcinoma leading to secondary spinal tumor. Or a mediastinal tumor. If mediastinal would it be posterior?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Since patient is heavy smoker, possibility of lung cancer is high. And spinal metastasis is very common in lung cancer. This can lead to spinal cord compression. Another possibility is mediastinal tumour, mostly lymphoma. Lymphoma is mostly seen in posterior mediastinum but can involve anterior, middle mediastinum. So better to get done CT thorax with Contrast to rule out lung cancer or mediastinal mass. Also get done MRI spine to rule out spine metastasis as a cause for spinal cord compression."},{"Patient":"My mum has cancer again 3rd time breast cancer, she has had chemo tablet form, yesterday she started to have a gastric feeling in her tummy which lasted quite a while, she woke this morning ok, but she has told me that she has it again, this time she said it feels higher up?

In my opinion she is having acute gastritis. Chemotherapy drugs are known to cause acute gastritis. It is inflammation of gastric mucosa due to drugs. So patient feels burning pain, nausea, abdomen fullness, early satity etc. She needs to follow these things for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Start proton pump inhibitors and pro kinetic drugs. If she is not improving by all these, consult your doctor."},{"Patient":"Had a bone scan recently.  Found an abnomanily in my skull.

It has been described as a possible likely(i) Hyperiostosis: this is a condition in which there is excess deposition of calcium and minerals on the bone surface. This can be due to many causes and is a usually a benign finding.(ii) Prominent venous lake: in this condition there nonproliferative vascular lesions that are not treatable via medical means. It is a blood filled space between the skull tables. No treatment is necessary/(iii) Metastasis: this is a sign of cancer spread. If you do not have any cancer in your body then this is least likely.

Myelodysplastic syndrome can be causing man if the effects mentioned by you but knowing his heart condition is important.Pulse rate is a reflection of heart beats. It can go below 60 in the elderly. If your husband has been an active athlete in the past then having a low pulse rate is explainable. However if his earlier ECG and echocardiography tests have been normal then this is a concern and must be investigated by a cardiologist. It is possible that his heart conduction or electrical activity is being affected and this is causing slow discharges leading to reduced heart rate and pulse. Swelling of limbs also can be related to heart conditions.Memory lapses need to be evaluated keeping in mind his age if he is an elderly or due to any particular tendency for impaired cognitive function. It will help to get him consult a cardiologist. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi,Doctor I was diagnosed with thymic cancer two and half years ago.I underwent radiation and chemothrapy.

With my best wishes, Ahmad","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The pleural space is a free space between the lungs and thoracic cane. Similarly the pericardium is a free space between heart and its covering. These are potential spaces for collection of fluid in disease.As you had thymic cancer and heart problems, it is important to know the type of fluid getting collected as pleural and pericardial effusion. Little amount of pleural fluid can be taken out with a needle and tested for its nature. If cancer cells or any infection is found then treatment must include medicines for it. If large amount of fluid is collected then it must be drained slowly by using a intercostal chest drain tube. It must be done under medical supervision and slowly. If at anytime you are feeling severe shortness in breath when fluid is being removed then it should be stopped immediately. Slowly removing the fluid will allow the lungs to expand back normally. Medicines can also be given to cause drainage of fluid by creating increased urine production.

You can try making an early appointment and talking to insurance regarding treatment of your fiance at this hospital.His case might be complex and requires a specialist team to properly treat his condition. Cholesteatoma going in for cancer should not be neglected. Once it starts spreading to near by structures and lymph nodes then it gets difficult to treat.

It is important to talk to your doctor regarding addition of a good oral antibiotic to control any infection that might have started at the surgery site. Surgery has been done properly and the cancer is removed. However, there can always be a focus of infection that has started after surgery and this can be due to many causes including multiplication of bacteria which has entered through the stitches.As polysporin is causing reaction, you must immediately add another oral antibiotic which is recommended by your doctor. This will stabilize the bacterial infection and reduce the soreness. Anti inflammatory pills are also to be taken to reduce inflammation and for better healing.

The construction of an ileal conduit remains a tried and tested method of urinary diversion. The two ureters are cut away from the urinary bladder insertions and the bladder is removed. Then the ureters are joined and then punt inside a loop of intestine created for this purpose. Then the bowel loop is diverted into an opening in the abdominal wall and a stoma is created. A catheter can be used to drain the urine formed at regular intervals from this urine reservoir. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I had bladder cancer and they did surgery to remove cancer. I am now at 4 months post surgery. I went to the urologist today for my 3 month check up (cisto). There is either a hole or a pocket as the Dr. said at the surgery site. She would not give me any more info than that she wants me to have an xray with a balloon catheder. Should would not speculate or even answer any of our questions like where is the urine going if it is a hole, or what would the procedure be if it is a hole. I m not feeling to confident with this Dr. that did the original surgery. I am worried. I have returned to work 2 weeks ago. I get tired and have some pain but I manage. After my surgery I was constipated and developed a fissure in my rectum and my sciatic nerve flared up to the point I couldn t walk. I am still taking stuff ( mag citrate) to keep my bowels loose and a probiotic.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a challenging condition and requires long time treatment and support. Since you are post bladder surgery, there is a chance that scar tissue is present after surgery and this is causing the discomfort in passing normal bowel movements. The fissure might have formed due to complex nature of cancer areas involving the space around the rectum. Please discuss the surgery details with your operating surgeon to know why it might have occurred.It is suggested that you take foods rich in dietary fibers and this will cause better stool formation and reduce chances of constipation. Early in the morning you can have a glass of warm water as you wake up and this can stimulate early morning bowel movements once you stop taking mag citrate.The X ray with balloon catheter might be to assess any leakage and communication between the bladder and rectum as a consequence of surgery. Without proper investigation, it is difficult to make a comment and I guess that is the reason your doctor chose to talk at a later date.You can eat small meals at shorter intervals in place of less frequent large meals.

Cancer cervix is a disease that occurs due to uncontrolled proliferation of cells in the cervix of uterus. It is important to know if she has early stage cancer or a later stage. Treatment differs as surgery is best for complete treatment at early stages and chemotherapy and radiation therapy can prolong survival in those with late stage disease.Vomiting and weakness can be treated with maintaining a proper diet and also correcting any deficiencies like anemia. During treatment, patients are known to have anemia and reactions to medicines. This needs to be carefully evaluated and if required regular anti vomiting medicines need to be taken.

Irritation of any such nerve can cause sharp frequent low intensity pains in the region which repeat at short intervals. The nerves also supply underlying muscles in the area. Please take careful note of how and when the pain starts, does it happen on its own or is it precipitated by doing an action like lifting objects or bending down.

In other words can I expect to live a normal life after chemo?   My kidneys were failing, but the last creatin result was a 2.2","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Wegeners granulomatosis is a rare disorder involving the blood vessels. There is inflammation in the blood vessels and this causes restricted blood flow to the organs leading to disease conditions arising from deficient blood supply.Early treatment gives a good response but some patients might need treatment for 18 to 24 months. Treatment is with chemotherapeutic drugs, corticosteroids, immune suppressants and biologic therapy.In your case, the kidney needs to be protected from further damage and saved. With a creatine of 2.2 there is a chance of disease stabilization and response to treatment.The first year after diagnosis is important. If a patient can make it through a year on treatment then 90% of patients improve with aggressive medical treatment and 75% of patients achieve remission. However, the relapse rate is 50% and this happens after 7 to 8 years. This can also be treated when it happens.

The size is important and if it is less than 8 mm then there is no serious concern. Should the nodule be closer to 3 cm in diameter then the probability of cancer is higher.What I intend to say is that a nodule must be followed up for a year or more depending on its doubling time. This is the time taken by the nodule to become twice its volume. A nodule that becomes twice its volume within 30 days or more than 6 months is most likely benign. Less than 30 days doubling is likely to be due to an infection.Rarely there are nodules due to bronchoalveolar cancer that might double over 2 years. Therefore follow up is essential when there is a lung nodule."},{"Patient":"hi I have been treated for thyroid cancer with total thyroidectomy last January and rai in april.I was given a stimulated tg level of 1.2I have just had tg level done and I have been given 2 readings tg level of .1 and 2.2 and thyroglobulin antibody 23.3 and 24.3 .I would be grateful  if you could explain what this means.

Depression is defined as persistent low mood and inability to appreciate the joys of living under normal circumstances for more than 21 days continuously. If you are have slight mood variations then that is not depression but an adjustment to your variable life events taking place due to your illness. If there is persistent low mood then it can be classified as depression and you can talk to a psychologist to make you feel comfortable.From the medications mentioned, steroids can cause depression but this is subjective and not the same in every person taking it. Medications commonly prescribed for cancer patients can be one of those risk factors. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"repsected sir, my father is supposed to have liver surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma.. due to hepatitis B (HBSAg positive).. doctors have advised surgery.. what should i do?

If the cancer is small and is restricted to segment 6 of liver then there is possibility of good outcome after surgery if it is done at a hospital equipped with proper facilities. At the time of surgery, platelet infusion, sugar control and HbsAg precautions are to be maintained.Liver surgery required experienced surgeons and please have a discussion with your doctor and then proceed to surgery if it can be resected. After surgery, care needs to be take for good recovery of patient and this also requires follow up for months to years. Surgery can be done after risk assessment.

Complete evaluation must be done to rule out spread of disease to other areas.  Neck lymph nodes also need to be evaluated and operated during surgery. When cancer is limited to the thyroid gland, the prognosis is excellent.External beam radiotherapy and palliative chemotherapy are recommended in advanced disease. External radiation therapy has been used for palliation of locally recurrent tumors. Chemotherapy involves giving more than one medicine and this can help is stabilizing the tumor and preventing it from spreading fast.

They also doubt whether she can withstand radiation therapy since she is too weak and weighing only 35 kgs. Is there any other treatment available? How long is the life expectancy?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and if your aunt has stage 4 cancer then survival even with the best care can vary from 6 months to two years. It is important to know the exact area of cancer involvement. Cancer in esophagus happens due to the growth extending in to the lumen and then proliferating to cause obstruction to ingested foods.Surgery cannot be done at this stage and therefore radiation therapy has been recommended by her doctors. To increase passage of flow through the cancer area, you can discuss with your doctors if she can be given monitored doses of radiation followed by inserting a metallic stent to cause improvement in swallowing. Radiation is best and chemotherapy may be even more difficult for her in this case. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I had a cancerous tumor removed from the upper part of my rectum in june. I had an ileostomy and in august I was reconnected. I started chemo the end of August and everything was going well. When I started radiation October 2 I started having problems having a bowel movement or passing gas. I was admitted to the hospital with small bowel obstruction. I was given enemas everyday and laxatives to remove the blockage. After being discharged and now being finished with radiation I still can't eat a regular meal or have regular bowel movements. I asking for any recommendations or helpful hints. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a challenging condition and requires long time treatment and support. Since you are having an ileostomy, there is a chance that scar tissue is present after surgery and radiation and this is causing the discomfort in passing normal bowel movements. You have also had an intestinal obstruction and given regular enemas and laxatives.It is suggested that you take foods rich in dietary fibers and this will cause better stool formation and reduce chances of constipation. Early in the morning you can have a glass of warm water as you wake up and this can stimulate early morning bowel movements.You can eat small meals at shorter intervals in place of less frequent large meals. Reduce the amount of oils in your food.

A stage 4 cancer can have a survival from 6 months to 2 years. She must fight the battle with cancer till the end. As it is not clear from your query regarding the area of cancer involvement, Tarceva is given for many cancers including those of lung, pancreas and I think she is having one of these. While a lung cancer patient might have a longer survival and unfortunately a pancreas cancer person does not survive much.For her appetite, it is important to give her frequent small feeds containing good amounts of proteins.

If your family member had a cancer near bladder mouth then she must have had locally infiltrative disease requiring exenteration. This is a surgical procedure by which most of the tumor and its adjacent structures are removed. Even after surgery, seeding of cancer cells might take place and has happened in her case.If there is recurrent growth of cancer then she must take combination treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. As you have mentioned that she is too weak for chemotherapy therefore focused radiation remains the most tolerable treatment at the moment but this depends on the general condition and local recurrence of the disease.Please have a discussion with the cancer surgeon and radiation oncologist and proceed with treatment as per the outcome of discussion.

And we decieded to do xrays yearly. Now after an xray this year, my doctor told me we need a cat scan, because the tumor is growing. I was shocked and could not ask any questions. Is it possible that after this many years of checking and never told that it was a tumor, that in one year it could develop into a tumor (fibroid), and can it now become cancerous. I am female and now 61, and extremely shocked to learn this now. Thanks Maxine ps did not realize that I had to pay, no credit cards.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done either fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)  or transthoracic lung biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. For the diagnosis of cancer, tissue sampling and it's microscopic examination is must.  Without this, one can not stamp the diagnosis of cancer. PET scan can be false positive in infection. So only on the basis of PET scan, cancer is not confirmed. And you are having this opacity since 15-16 years. So less likely to be due to cancer. It must be chronic infection like fungal or tuberculosis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done either FNAC or biopsy to get the tissue diagnosis."},{"Patient":"I am 61 year old man who has lung cancer told me it is non small cell Cancer at a stage 3b ..I went to the cancer center of America kin tulsa ok....I had 5 chemo teartment and 40 radation and the dr for radation bruned my lungs so bad .i got my last treatment for radation on April 23 2014 .and 6 day after I was done .i was put in hospital for radation prioning .and now I have done nothing but went down hill ..now on dec 27 2014 I had my right lung to claped on me ..I am being told that there is nothing else that can been done ....can surgery be done to patch the hold like the do for some one who has a hold in there heart ,,by lapsrop surgery","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  with stage 3b is inoperable and hence incurable. Only treatment option is palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Lung surgery is contraindicated and carries life threatening risk. Since, you had taken plenty of radiation and chemotherapy, better to start palliative treatment in the form of nutrition and pain management. Better to discuss end of life issues with your family. Start centrally acting painkiller for pain relief. There is nothing  much to be do in your case, so accept the situation."},{"Patient":"hi my dad was diagnosed two years ago with the colorectal cancer and he has an issue with Peeing very frequently he feels the sensation to P but no time to actually go to the bathroom it s a feeling and then he just goes ...does this have anything to do with the sickness","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.

In his case following are the possible causes for prostatism. 1. BPH  (Benign prostatic hypertrophy). 2.  Prostate infection 3. Spread of colorectal  cancer in prostate. So better to consult urologist and discuss all these possible causes. He may need urine microscopic examination, urine culture to rule out infection.

After radiation the calibre of the canal may decrease because of fibrosis due to radiatiton. This can cause constipation.

Decreased libido and pain on Intercourse are common side effects of pelvic resection and chemotherapy. The reason for this is hormonal imbalance due to removal of ovaries and damage of pelvic nerves due to surgery and chemotherapy. Both these cause poor pelvic sensation and dryness of vagina. So patient feels decreased libido and pain. The best treatment is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). If this is not working than you can try lubricating jelly also.

No, tooth and gum tenderness are not direct side effects of chemotherapy. But it can be  indirect side effects of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy causes immunosuppression.

Amyloidosis is slowly growing, chronic infiltrating disease. In this disease amyloid (protein substance)  accumulates in almost all organs of the body. But the common organs are1. Liver2. Heart3. Brain4. Kidneys. In heart it usually affects conduction system. So this can cause sudden stoppage of heart and sudden cardiac death due to cardiac arrest. Another possibility is brain involvement. If amyloid involve certain vital areas of brain like pons and medulla where all vital functions like respiration, blood pressure, pulse etc are controlled than sudden death can be seen.

Your brother's recent biopsy report is suggestive of inflammation and absence of malignancy. This is actually good sign for him. His first biopsy confirmed the presence of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. After this he underwent chemotherapy. And now his recent biopsy is not showing  any malignancy.

One every other monday and then a cat scan to see if it is shrinking.  Shouldnt she be having a more aggressive treatment? Also, the Dr did not want to show her the Pet scan results. Is the Dr trying to save my sister from knowing the full truth?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Your sister is having stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Stage 4 means it is inoperable and incurable as well. The only treatment option is chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is not indicated in pancreatic cancer. So we are left with chemotherapy only. And chemotherapy drugs have their own side effects and can not tolerate by all patients. So we need to check it's response after 2-3 cycles. Your doctor is doing the right  thing. So stick to his treatment. Better to discuss end of life issues, palliative care and nutritional things with your sister."},{"Patient":"Over the last couple of weeks at various times I have been getting sharp, grabbing even contracting pains in either side of my abdomen.  This happens sometimes when I lean over a certain way but have even had it during the night while I am asleep.  It has awakened me like a twisting pain.  I have had gas pains in the past but nothing like this.  I have had my gallbladder out now for almost 2 years and currently take 30 mg of prevacid daily for my gastric reflux.  All of this started within the last 6 months or so but doesn't do it with any regularity that I can put my finger on.  I also take propranolol for migraine headaches, synthroid for hypothyroid and celexa.","Doctor":"Hello! Thanks for putting your query in HCM. I am a Gastroenterologist (DM).It appears that you have intestinal colic pain. So for this take some antispasmodic agent like drotaverine for few days. It will relieve your symptoms and continue with rest of the medicinesI hope I have answered your query and this will help you. If you have any further query  I will be happy to answer that too.

Oncologist want to do chemo once every three weeks. Why if all the cancer was removed and lymph nodes were clean. What drugs should be used IV or oral.","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice for stage 1b lung cancer. Post operative  chemotherapy should be given in all patients. During surgery, handling of tumour mass cause spillage of tumour cells in the operative site. So there is risk of tumour recurrence. To avoid this complication, post operative chemotherapy is advised. So my suggestion is to give him chemotherapy cycles. Usually chemotherapy is given intravenously and most commonly used agents are cisplatin and etoposide. So no harm in post operative chemotherapy. This will reduce the chances of recurrence."},{"Patient":"How quickly will a patient with stage IV renal carcinoma deteriorate when last hope drugs (Sutent) begin to fail?  Patient is 42 year old male, has taken Sutent for 10 months with some tumour regression, but recent scans show a reappearance of lung mets.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Honestly speaking, stage 4 renal cancer with lung metastasis  carries very bad prognosis. And failing chemotherapy adds further poorer prognosis. So better to discuss end of life issues with the patient. Start palliative treatment in the form of nutrition and pain management. Life expectancy is less than 1 year. And five year survival rate is very very less (less than  10%)."},{"Patient":"My mother has one kidney after nephrectomy due to renal cell carcinoma. She is out of state on a trip and ct has revealed mutiple organs with tumors as the cancer has spread. She was released from hospital thursday and we have a flight for tomarrow to bring her home.

I am a 5 hour plaine ride away, help","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion your mother should avoid flight journey. There are many causes for her ankle swelling and pain.  But the common causes are1. Renal failure 2. Hypoproteinemia 3. Liver metastasis 4. Heart failure due to heart metastasis. So better to consult doctor and get done renal function test, liver function test,  serum protein level,  2d echo to rule out above mentioned causes. Prognosis in her case is very poor as she is having metastasis in other organs. And ankle edema will further deteriorate her life expectancy. So better to consult doctor and first treat her."},{"Patient":"I am going to stop Hormone replacement since a questionable mammogram last fall. Am due another mammogram in July. Have been on HRT for approx. 10 yrs or more. Originally placed on it due to menopause symptoms but those symptoms have almost completely disappeared. Need to wean off or just stop?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should continue hormone replacement therapy (HRT) till follow up mammography. And if follow up mammography is improved or same as previous mammography than you can taper down HRT. Don't stop suddenly. This will cause you more trouble. You need to taper it down slowly over 2-3 months to avoid rebound effect.

Pain and fever have subsided but I still have the mucus discharge.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. No it is not normal to have mucus discharge from anus. You need to evaluate this. Since you had prostate cancer treated with radiation and diverticulitis, possibility of internal disease is more. So you should consult gastroenterologist and get done 1. Microscopic examination of discharge 2.  Lower GI scope. Microscopic examination of discharge is needed to rule out infection. Lower GI scopy is needed to rule out diverticular disease. So better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment."},{"Patient":"My uncle was diagnosed with prostate cancer a year ago.  He is now at stage IV and the doctor told him that his chemotherapy is only making him sicker and his immune system can no longer take it.  The doctor advised him to get this personal life in order and live life to the fullest.  It’s been a month now without treatment.  How long can he go on like this before he dies?","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your uncle 's situation and problem. Stage 4 prostate cancer means it is inoperable and distal organ spread is present. Chemotherapy is the only treatment  option for him. But chemotherapy has its own side effects of immunosuppression and opportunistic infections. So decide wisely about chemotherapy. Life expectancy in stage 4 prostate cancer is upto 2-3 years. If he tolerate chemotherapy  well then this can be increase upto 5-6 years. So better to discuss with patient and oncologist about initiation of chemotherapy."},{"Patient":"Hi.  I was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, on April 19th.  It is in my left lung, and my liver.  My question is, can tumors move?  Normally when I have pain, it is in the left lung area, about 2-3 ribs below my breast...but the past several days, it has hurt, pretty much constantly, at the bottom of my rib area.  Thanks in advance!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. No, lung and liver malignant  tumor can not move. They certainly enlarge in size and involve more surrounding areas. So your worsening of pain at different site suggest possibility of tumour spread. So better to consult oncologist and get done fresh CT thorax with Contrast  and PET scan to rule out spread of tumour.

The neouologist seems laid back but I am at my wits end as I can see my husband s personality changing and we are both losing confidence. He doesn t have another hospital appointment until May 15th which is for an EEG. We still await a cognitive assessment and then the neurologist will view the results and we should see her in 3 months! Help please. What do you suggest we do?","Doctor":"Hello dear,thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion your husband is having mostly  hydrocephalus. It is narrowing of ventricles in brain. Ventricles are CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)  transmitting system. So any narrowing in it can cause fluid accumulation. This fluid accumulation cause raised ICT (intracranial tension) and this can further cause compression on vital brain areas. This is the reason for personality changes and other neurological symptoms. Honestly speaking, lymphoma with neurological complications carry worse prognosis. You can ask for VP (ventriculo peritoneal)  shunt to divert the excess fluid and thus reducing ICT. So discuss all these in depth with your neurologist."},{"Patient":"What treatment is suggested for a mast cell tumor that was a grade 2 mitotic index 9?  The tumor was on his back leg and they were unable to get better margins because of location.  Would you recommend radiation, chemo, palladia, or just let it heal?  I have a 10 yr old chocolate lab.  Just wondering statistical outcomes on each treatment.Thanks for your information.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Mast cell tumour is aggressive skin tumour. Without  treatment it will surely  worsen. The best treatment is enblock surgical removal of involved skin. Since you have irresectable margins, we can try preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy to decrease the size of tumour. By doing this, we can achieve good margins and thus surgery  can be possible. With enblock surgery, life expectancy is almost 3-4 years.  Five year survival rate is 50-60%.So better to first go for chemotherapy and radiotherapy to decrease the size of tumour and then go for enblock surgery for better outcome."},{"Patient":"(34yo Female) MRI showed well-circumscribed, low attenuating, hypoechoic liver mass.

Thoughts on what this could be? Hemangioma? Can cancer be ruled out due to the characteristics?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion it is more favouring benign etiology. Following are the benign causes for slowly enlarging liver mass. 1.  Liver cyst2.  Liver abscess3. Hemangioma  etc. Possibility of malignant lesion is less likely  because mass is well circumscribed and low attenuation, hypoechoic. This is less likely finding in malignant mass. But we need to get done biopsy  of the lesion to confirm the etiology.

He is doing well and cancer free at the moment. The oncologist suggested chemo therapy to delay any future development of cancerous tumors. We are looking into homeopathic treatments. I have known about the qualities of zeolite for many years, but using it for cancer is new to me. Would you recommend we try instead of chemo. The dog is 11 years old. Thank you, Margarita","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Chemotherapy is always recommended after surgery as an adjuvant treatment. You should proceed with chemotherapy as suggested by the doctor. Zeolite has antioxidants and can help in reducing the cancer but chemotherapy is a must. As it is confirmed to be adenocarcinoma and this means there might still be cancer cells in the area even after surgery.Cancer surgery usually involves excision of the growth along with a thin margin of normal appearing tissue. However in some cases there can still be tumor cells around the excised part and this can form another cancer if you ignore giving chemotherapy. What you can do is give zeolite with chemotherapy for best result.

I am 61 years old and in good health except for the obvious cancer I have. Thank you for your reply.","Doctor":"The chemotherapy you received with radiation would have been low dose chemo. The chemo dose is reduced during radiation so that you tolerate the treatment well without much of side effects.This chemo you will be receiving now will be heavier doses and they will be giving you combination of drugs also. Also ask the treating doctor the drugs he will be using to treat you. the side effect profile will be different for different drugs.In general the fatigue will be little more. You have to be careful about the possiblity of neutropenia.

It is normal to go through various levels of stress when taking treatment for a condition like CML. It is unfortunate that your husband is not interacting with you in a positive manner and this is making you spend months at your mothers home to get peace and make a recovery.Valium is diazepam that is a benzodiazepine and its maximum dose is 10 mg 4 times a day. You have taken a much higher dose at once than recommended. Though nothing will happen if you take it on one occasion but taking it on a regular basis can cause harm to your body and mind.

I m wondering if I should be tested for MS.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.MS or multiple sclerosis is not an easy diagnosis to be made only by the presence of prickling sensations in various areas of the body. While MS is not hereditary, having a first-degree relative such as a parent or sibling with MS does significantly increase an individual's risk of developing the disease.Therefore if your mother had this problem then it will certainly help to get examined clinically and and investigations like MRI scan of brain and spine done if required. This condition might be slowly progressive and therefore you should keep a close watch your your symptoms and write them down in a diary for discussion in detail with your doctor.

Having psoriasis could triple the risk of developing a group of cancers that affect the lymph nodes, as seen from a recent medial research.Should you have painless groin lymph node enlargement then there is a  higher risk of lymphomas, which are grouped together as non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphomas. They are cancers of the lymphatic system, part of the body's immune system.Please discuss in detail with your doctor and get a detailed imaging and FNAC or biopsy of the enlarged lymph node done.

This might not be able to be treated by surgery and chemotherapy and radiation therapy might be required to stabilize the disease. Chemotherapy drugs are very strong and some of them are cardio toxic. These medications cause elevation of heart enzymes due to the stress on the heart.It is also possible that her cardiac function is otherwise on the decline due to aging and she might have been prone to cardiac ischemia. To make sure that there are no future cardiac events, it is important to evaluate her cardiac rhythm and function in detail. This is the reason she has been kept under observation. An echocardiography is important to be done and the left ventricular ejection fraction to be evaluated.Treatment continuation with chemotherapy depends on the cardiac reserve to function properly.

As the prostate cancer is biopsy proven therefore a MRI scan prostate with whole body PET CT scan is required for proper staging of the condition. While MRI scan will tell the accurate local spread of disease, the PET CT scan will tell about distant spread of disease if any.Since it is Gleason 7 category lesion, complete removal might be possible at the moment. Doing a cancer surgery is more about skill and also the stage of disease. I guess robotic resection is a better option than radiation, radiation might be required subsequently depending on the response to initial treatment.If the surgeon has done the qualified training and has the ability of doing a robotic surgery then even a younger surgeon is reliable with the skills. Statistics on incontinence and erectile dysfunction might vary with technique and stage of disease. In early stages and with a skilled surgery, there is low incidence of side effects.

In the brain there is ependymal lining in the ventricles and in the spinal cord it is present in the spinal canal. Since there is fluid along the ependymal lining, it is easy for these tumors to seed elsewhere and regrow, even after surgery and radiation treatment. As a result the patient can have recurrence of the tumor at the same site or another place.The main treatment is surgery to remove as much as possible of the tumor and then follow up closely to include chemotherapy. These treatments can slow down the growth of the tumor and help to reduce symptoms.Chemotherapy involves treating with medicines like the followingCarboplatinCarmustineCisplatinCyclophosphamideEtoposideLomustineMethotrexateVincristineUsually you would have a number of these drugs together as combination chemotherapy.

Tumors on any type can originate in ribs but Ewings sarcoma is the commonest and seen in young adults. However bone malignancies can occur in variable age groups. Ewings is one type of bone cancer that is due to uncontrolled proliferation of round cells. This tumor responds well to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and patient survival is good. I suggest the person should get a CT scan done and then an image guided FNAC or biopsy is required to confirm diagnosis.Once confirmed, treatment is by a team and might include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.

These cells proliferate and become cancerous. When cancer is formed, it is aggressive in nature and even if the primary tumor is removed through surgery, the cells remain and spread to different parts of the body through blood flow and lymph nodes. When the cells reach the lymph node then it starts to proliferate once again and then the cancer spreads. Therefore your doctor is right in saying that the cancer is elsewhere and has spread to lymph node. This requires to be treated at the earliest.

A few days ago I was coughing a lot, I also had developed neuropathy of hands and feet....I noticed my neck started to hurt, as if perhaps I had pulled my port loose from my artery after all of the coughing. I asked my Oncologist to look; She ordered an ultrasound from Cardiology. It confirmed that I had developed deep vein and superficial clots in my neck. I am on my 3rd self injection of blood thinner(2x per day). The pain has spread into a wider area and is more intense. Should I be concerned(?) What symptoms should prompt a closer look from a Dr.(?) What should I expect as a Prognosis????","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There seems to be deep vein thrombosis involving veins in the neck. This needs to be treated on time to prevent further problems. Blood thinners are essential to dissolve the clots and prevent new clots from happening. Please go to ER should you have breathlessness or chest pain from within. The clots already present must be treated and not allowed to progress further and reach the lungs. If they reach lungs then complete blood supply to the lungs will be cut off and this can cause respiratory distress and failure. In severe cases it can also be life threatening. It is good that your doctor has given you blood thinners. However any time you feel difficulty to breathe and cardiac chest pain then do not hesitate to go to the ER and talk to your doctor.

Both his Radiation Oncologist and Oral Surgeon said he is fine .....should I be concerned and if so, what further steps and/or opinions should we take?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.I suppose your husband got left half of his tongue removed surgically and followed by chemotherapy and radiation. Since his first pre operative CT showed a 1.1 cm lesion, it was an early stage cancer and that is why surgery was recommended. After surgery, the operated area can develop in to a healthy scar. He has received 33 fractions of radiation and that will control any microscopic extension of the cancer in to the healthy appearing tongue.The soft tissue thickening measuring 1.1 cm is healing scar. The radiation has given an appearance of a scar formation. He must continue visiting the oncologist as required. Also the operated wound must be regularly examined to see if it is healthy and showing healing in progress. Chance of recurrence from early operated oral cancer is less.

This might indicate that his thinned down and leaking some place in the intestine. This is an emergency. You have understood the incident slightly wrongly. What has happened is his blood is thin due to medications. This will prevent blood from clotting usually. He has started bleeding at some point in his bowel. This is causing bleeding to occur.

It should be remembered that PSA can also be raised in non cancerous situations like infection involving the prostate.Perceived stress significantly lowers PSA screening likelihood, and it seems to partly mediate the negative relationship of depression with screening likelihood.

It should be remembered that PSA can also be raised in non cancerous situations like infection involving the prostate.The PSA circulates in the blood in two forms either free or bound to certain blood proteins. If you have a high PSA level but a low percentage of free PSA, then close follow up and ruling out cancer becomes important. This test is  used for men with a PSA level in the borderline range between 4 and 10. Research shows that if more than a quarter (25%) of the total PSA is free, there is less chance of having prostate cancer. I recommend you also get a free PSA test done to know the risk of recurrent cancer if any.There is no time limit for PSA to rise fro 0.2 to 0.35. However there is PSA velocity which is important and this is calculated as the increases in PSA on a monthly or yearly basis and gives a risk of disease.

Could exposure to sunlight while taking these pills do that? She is reluctant to seek any treatment and always tries to avoid it at best of times... Advice?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer treatment is by surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. In your mother, the doctors are treating her cancer with chemotherapy or radiation. Often the immunity of the patient goes down after taking chemotherapy. It means that she can bet mild infections which can cause flaring of the infection which can get difficult to control. It will help to make a temperature chart and then record her temperature regularly every 4 to 6 hours. If there are spikes of fever as seen in the chart then she might have developed an infection that is causing all her symptoms. In this case she needs to take proper treatment for her infection. She can also have mild cold and infections involving the nasal cavity and paranasal air sinuses. She can take tylenol for occasional pain and fever but if she is having continuous high grade fever for 3 or more days then detailed investigation is required.

My PSA test three months later showed no trace of cancer cells remaining. However, I continue to have excess fluids in my legs, ankles, feet, thighs, etc. I also had a six-month injection of Lupron in October of 2014 prior to beginning radiation treatment. Is there anything I can do to reduce the excess fluid in my body? Thank you for the courtesy of a reply. David","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Collection of fluid following radiation treatment is seen after radiation treatment in many patients. Collection of fluid in the soft tissues of legs is known as pedal edema and can be seen in people having problems with heart or lungs or those with excessive fluid retention following cancer treatment. This happens due to the collection of water in the extra cellular compartment in soft tissues below the skin.It will help to consult your oncologist and then get a prescription of water pills. These will allow the extra water to be diverted to the  vascular compartment and then excreted through the kidneys. This is a temporary phase and completely treatable.

The survival in this group of patients is from 6 months to 2 years and this depends on the response to chemotherapy and any complications that she has. Few patients can survive for bit longer but peritoneal cancer is a challenging condition in most patients. Regular check up and close observation of her problems might help.

No male relative (father, grandfather, uncles) has had prostate cancer to my knowledge.  My history of PSA readings during 2010 was that I had 4 tests (Jan 2.5, June 2.3, Nov 16th 4.75, December 1st 2.5).  I am 48 years old, I weigh 145 lbs, I'm 5'11.  In July 2010 I had a prostate ultrasound, which showed a darkened area, but the doppler test that was part of the exam did not show blood flow in that area.  I have not had any urinary symptoms. I have had some erectile dysfunction but I am otherwise healthy. I was constipated at the time of the PSA test. Unfortunately all the journal articles and risk calculators I've found apply mostly to men 55 and over, so I'm not sure whether the PSA results are worse because of my age or better.","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. PSA is the marker of prostate cancer.  PSA level more then 4 indicate suspicious for prostate cancer.  However pSA level can increase in benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatitis.  So definitive diagnosis depends on biopsy.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Considering all the points in your history, even though this may be a simple case of hyperacidity or acid reflux disease, if I were your treating physician, I would have advised you for a thorough cardiac check up in relation to your shortness of breath and chest pain. This will include an ECG, and a stress echo if need be.If the cardiac angle is excluded, then I would have prescribed a proton pump inhibitor with a prokinetic agent and a probiotic for you. This will probably will relieve your symptom. Apart from this, some changes in your life style will also be advised, like more of roughage and plenty of liquids in your diet, avoiding fatty,fried,and fast food. A daily routine exercise depending on your medical capacity will also help in relieving your symptom. Also I would advise you to raise the head  end of your bed, so that regurgitation will be controlled.After all these efforts if the condition persists, then I would advise you for an ultrasound abdomen, and an upper GI endosclpy for further management.I hope this information will help you in deciding on the further course of action.

Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive condition and requires close supervision. As there is metastasis spread to the brain therefore there is abnormal electrical discharge happening. The steroids have been given to reduce the brain swelling. This will decrease the brain swelling and prevent development of symptoms.As you might be aware that the brain is the center of all nerve connections and any irritation to nerves in the brain can have consequences like trembling of arms. It is a sign that her nerves supplying the brain have got irritated and there is stimulation of the nerves supplying the muscles in the arm.A person might survive from 6 months to 2 years but survival depends on the general health condition and the positive outlook towards the condition even though long term survival is difficult.

If this was for a cancer in head and neck or chest region then repeat detailed evaluation with CT scan or MRI scan is required. It is possible that your cancer might have had a recurrence if you have recovered from cancer recently.Another possibility is that your immunity is low after taking the radiotherapy and therefore you might get infections easily. There are many infections which will not affect the normal adult at your age but those having a low immunity might develop these infections and its complications.Please have your chest and throat evaluated in detail by your doctor and also get CT scan or MRI scan to investigate the origin of blood in the phlegm.

Back pain is the only symptom and this requires detailed investigation by imaging like MRI and PET scanning. Awareness is difficult bu if a person has unexplained fever, nightsweat and weight loss for two months then they should get detailed clinical examination done. If his tumor is staged and treatment started then it is likely that the tumor will respond and in many cases it can be cured.To know the exact situation in your husband, staging the condition is important and in early stages more than half the patients are completely cured.

The esophagus is divided in to the upper, mid and lower thirds. If there is a cancer in the upper and mid thirds of esophagus then there might be difficulty in swallowing of food and the food stuck can regurgitate and be pushed upwards and make its way in to the airway. This is a concern and can cause choking or get aspirated in to the lungs.Once food particle is aspirated in to the lungs then it can develop in to an infection and pneumonia. This persists and with time can also transform in to severe bacterial infection.

Any time I try to go off of it now, that lump feeling comes back, I lose my appetite mainly because I feel like heaving, and can't really burp, or it's foam..","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Esophagitis is a condition where there is an inflammation of the lining and there is development of an ulcer like condition. Rarely a person having esophagitis can develop a cancer and the risk for this is around two to five percent. As biopsy is normal for you therefore there is no need to worry.Please take nexium as prescribed by your doctor and avoid taking spicy and oily foods that might increase your esophagitis. The lump in throat might be due to the esophagitis or can also be a psychological thought that persists in your mind. Please be reassured that if the biopsy is normal then the chances of transformation in to a cancer is remote.You need to take a bland diet and also eat small meals every 4 hours in the daytime and avoid fasting. Avoid lying down after having a heavy meal and also try to raise the head end of your bed by 6 inches to reduce symptoms and dependence on medicine."},{"Patient":"My aunt had esophageal cancer a few months ago, she beat it, was cancer free.

The treatment changes with response to therapy and the appearance of any clinical sign including lump any where in the body during recovery must not be ignored.As there is biopsy proven cancer in the bump on her head, it looks like the cancer has spread to that area. Please get a full body PET CT scan done to know if the cancer has spread to other areas as well. As the cancer has spread to the head region therefore presently she has stage 4 cancer and in this situation the survival is on an average 6 months to 2 years though few people with this problem can survive for a longer duration if treatment is started at the earliest and the cancer spread can be controlled.

Then, in January i had to have a 2 surgeries because of infections after starting chemo and they ended up removing one of the ovaries.  i had hot flashes then but they went away eventually.  i then started chemo again and stopped in may.  i now still have hot flashes and they will not go away.  i consulted the doctor today and she said it looked like my last ovary was dying.  is this true?  is it possible it might perk back up or is the end of it?  Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Since you had soft tissue cancer of uterus therefore removal was required as a life saving measure. If the uterus was not removed then the cancer would have infiltrated and survival would have been a problem even with treatment.It was unfortunate that you had two infections which required surgery and then your ovaries are also affected due to the treatment. Since the other ovary is also almost non functional therefore you can opt for hormone replacement treatment to help treat the hot flashes and other symptoms due to the hysterectomy and non functional ovaries.As your age and treatment details are not mentioned therefore it will be difficult to provide the exact answer regarding the possibility of the remaining ovary to be normalized. However present day hormone replacement treatments can help you perk back your hormones to normal state as before when your ovaries were functioning.

If you have developed lung metastasis then please return to your doctor who has treated you earlier and then continue treatment for the parotid swelling and lung metastasis.As lung spread makes your condition stage 4 cancer therefore, attempts are to be made to control the progress by giving chemotherapy and radiation.

I am 67 with a history of cardiac problems. I was born with Fallot s Tetralogy which was corrected in 1964 in Bristol. It was very successful and I have had nearly 50 years of almost complete health, firstly as a teacher, and then as a vicar. I retired 2 years ago sadly because I had devloped an alcohol problem so I now live in care and haven t drunk since last August. When the wheezing began I automatically assumed it was due to a worsening of the residual faults from my Fallot s correction. I have lived with a small VSD, pulmonary stenosis and some atrial regurge. But having spent a week in hospital having echo tests , e.c.g, x-ray etc. the team failed to find any deterioration that would cause the things I am experiencing. A few weeks ago , however, I became aware of a hard lump under my right nipple. Not really painful but a bit sore. So I wonder if it s possible that I might have Male Breast cancer (however rare) and whether the wheeze, tightness of chest and breathlessness might be due to that. I don t want to bother my GP unnecessarily but on the other hand if it is a carcinogenic lump I would like to seek any treatment that might be available to me. Thank you. Rev.

So bad, he has to go to the ER.  it is random, sometimes after a month, sometimes within the week it will happen twice.  He is scared to eat, thinking eating is causing the problem.

It looks like your brother had external beam radio therapy and this was spread over 8 weeks and 5 days a week making it 40 fractions. He was also given chemotherapy in 3 cycles. While it is unlikely for a soft palate cancer to be treated by radiation treatment to be causing severe pain in lower back and stomach, possibility of cancer spreading to other places cannot be ruled out.

I think pain is on both side of abdomen left and right side. As you stated that there is sometimes diarrhea , sometimes constipation , so pain must be on both side of abdomen on lower part , so may be ,1 Amoebic colitis as sometimes diarrhea and constipation present in this condition. Diagnosis can be confirmed by physical examination by a physician . Get in  stool for E . histolica . 2 If pain is on the left side in stomach as you mentioned then may be due to Peptic ulcer disease . Diagnosis can be confirmed by  upper  G I endoscopy .

At first, the results were not good but he had since better results, and the tumor markers have gone down. He has been complaining however of pain in the stomach, has an enlarged liver , severe constipation. Had diarrhea this time after this chemo for a couple of days, severe digestion problems for a few months now, cannot eat meat now apart from chicken and cannot consume food in the evening as it takes him a really long time to digest his food. I know that the chemo used for colorectal cancer is not really good for the liver but he has been given liver functions tests. What is his liver so enlarged then and why he is in pain? are serious is his condition now. He has to have his chemo treatment every two weeks for 3 days, and I have noted that once we went in holiday and he did not have chemo for 3 weeks that he lost then more than a stone. Please let me know how serious it is. Thank you. R. Bellis","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to hear about the progress of colon cancer in your husband and metastasis to the liver. In about half the patients being treated for colon cancer, even after surgery, there is chance of spread to the liver. Oxiplatin and Capecitabine work in such cases and are recommended for treatment. At that time he has been diagnosed to have stage 4 cancer colon and this means 6 months to 2 years on chemotherapy and supportive treatment.  Portal vein embolisation is a well known complication after liver resection.Irinotecan is a medication that is given as a second choice drug in resistant chemotherapy and most probably that is working. Most chemotherapy medicines have side effects and liver enzymes have to be regularly monitored. The cause for his liver enlargement can be the disease itself causing appearance of new lesions or that can be due to the chemotheraputic toxicity of drugs. Follow up ultrasound scan is needed to confirm the cause.

Bile is an important digestive juice and is essential. For the bile generated in the liver to reach the intestine, it has to flow through dedicated biliary channels. First the bile from both lobes of liver collects in the gall bladder and from there it is again let out in to the intestine through the common bile duct. This common bile duct is a tube like structure and is surrounded by the head of pancreas at its termination. Therefore any pressure in or around the pancreas will cause hold up of bile.The cholangiocarcinoma can cause blockage to biliary passage within the liver leading to pooling of bile in intrahepatic location."},{"Patient":"Hi, I had recurrent stage 4B cervical cancer and has metastasis to both my lung, abdominal area.

Most cancers are evaluated by 5 year survival rate. This is a proportion of people who can survive up to 5 years from the day the cancer is first detected. If your father has survived for more than ten years then he has successfully fought and won the battle with cancer logically. Very few people fighting cancer are known to stay alive after 5 years and his doctor has surely given him the right treatment to keep him alive.Any ways presently there appears to be a problem with the cancer and it might have spread to vital organs like brain, lungs and liver. It is difficult to guess the present state of cancer that he is having without additional details. Whatever be the situation, the fight with cancer is till the end.

Irrespective of whether there is any other disease spread, the patient is usually treated only by chemotherapy and radiation for stage 4 cancer.Surgery if required is to be done to avoid bleeding from the ulcer and in many cases patients can bleed a lot and this must be taken care of in your mother. As she is in good general condition right now, it s important to discuss with the oncosurgeon if there is a need to treat the stomach ulcer by surgery to give her pain relief and prevent bleeding.Rest of the treatment is to be given by medical oncologist and radiation oncologist.

In some cancers there can be rapid progress and in some the disease can take two years. Gall bladder is located in a trategic location and this permits a gall bladder tumors to proliferate ann involve adjacent structures. It can also cause biliary obstruction within the liver and gall bladder and this will also reduce the general condition of the patient.Patient is kept on pain relief medicine to provide comfort.

But people who have particular genetic syndromes have a higher risk of some types of bone cancer than other people.There are conditions like Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome and Retinoblastoma that can have increased incidence of osteosarcoma.Multiple exostoses is a benign condition can be found in families and appears as multiple bone swellings. People with this condition can develop chondrosarcoma.Chordomas seem to run in some families. The genes responsible have not yet been found, but familial chordoma has been linked to changes on chromosome 7.Therefore it will be good if you can have a discussion with your doctor concerning the tumor your father has, though it is unlikely that you have a similar one.Please consult a doctor for your blood in urine, weight loss and pain in tail bone area.

Cancers can affect bones in two ways, either there is breakdown or there is excessive calcium deposition. In breakdown the process is called lysis and in deposition of calcium it is called sclerosis. In prostate cancer, there can be sclerosis seen in the bones of the spine usually in the lower back region. However bones of upper spine can also have sclerosis.I would suggest you to first get a low cost insurance and then take tests for prostate cancer like ultrasound scan, serum PSA and free PSA values. If there is probability of cancer then further detailed tests are required. Please talk to your doctor to arrange for the tests keeping in mind your ability to pay upfront for the various tests.The tests must be completed within a month and you can also try and find out healthcare support groups or from your employer if your tests and any treatment can be funded by external resources.

This condition is usually seen in immunologically weak and in elderly. As your mother is taking chemotherapy and is also elderly, this reactivation of the chicken pox virus has taken place with a higher magnitude.Patients with suspected shingles have to be given a course of antiviral medicine like acyclovir or valacyclovir within 72 hours of first appearance of rashes. If not given then the rashes take a longer time and the patient is in more pain and discomfort.If the rashes are not responding to acyclovir or valacyclovir then it might be resistant to treatment and this has to be followed up with other medicines.Though the rashes usually fall off in a week in most patients, it is difficult to predict the course of this illness in a patient having lymphoma and in elderly age group. Some patients also require treatment with IV medications and this can reduce the flaring of symptoms.Shingles pain and discomfort might persist for up to 6 months and there is herpes neuralgia in which the patient might have burning symptoms for a long time.

If the lung cancer has involved the stomach, brain and adrenal gland then it is in aggressive form and has spread to more than one organ and this makes it stage 4 cancer.As there is a metastasis to the brain and that can cause seizures, it will help to give her anti epileptics and anti edema medicine. Dexamethasone is a steroid and will reduce brain swelling.Unfortunately the survival in a stage 4 patient is from 6 months to 2 years.

In your aunty there is probably a malignant mass in the esophageal wall that is causing limitation to the swallowing of solid food. In this condition there are few ways by which she can be helped.After evaluating the malignant stricture, a metallic stent can be put in the esophagus. This works in many people but the risk of subsequent block persists. This will again cause a block to food.The other option is inserting nasogastric tune and this is something they must have done. The food is made in to viscous consistency and then given using a syringe. Th third way is operating and introducing a feeding gastrostomy. In this method the food goes directly in to the stomach and there is no requirement to feed by mouth. She can continue taking sips of water.These methods are put in to practice after evaluating patient needs and different cancer treatment institutes follow their own methods to support patient nutrition in cancer of esophagus.

Forum.If I were your treating doctor for this case I would up come up with the following advice as,1 Accidentally you took 3500 mg acetacminphen and stated experiencing pain in the right rib cage.First of all I want to clear that maximum you can 4000 mg ( 4 gm ) of this drug without side effects, so all these symptoms may be due to gastric trouble . As in large single dose this may develops acute gastritis and all symptoms developed . Diagnosis can be confirmed by a physician  by physical examination.Take antacid & if severe symptom take proton pump inhibitors. 2 Next reason  of your problem is blunt injury in the esophagus due to toothbrush . As this developed esophagitis , this causes heart burn and stomach pain . Try raising  the head of your bed about 4 inches with blocks. It might also help to avoid eating or drinking for 2 hours before you lie down. To help control the stomach acid, one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them or eat chocolates or spicy food or greasy foods. Also take some antacid but if symptoms are severe then you may need drugs like proton pump inhibitors.So in my opinion consultation with a physician will be helpful for you. Good luck.

It is a substance that is secreted in larger amounts should a patient have cancer of prostate. It can also be secreted in conditions like infections of the prostate gland in elderly men. A single PSA level is not very reliable but follow up levels are important. As your father has regularly got PSA analysis done therefore it will help to know the duration between the tests. The normal level of PSA in less than 4.

Sometimes such tumors can remain hidden in locations which are not easily accessible for evaluation.

A single test might not help in locating these tumors and this requires that the person should be under observation and series of tests to be done.

Blood cancer might occur in many types and the patient symptoms vary. The new blood cells are produced in bone marrow. It is possible that the bone marrow in your friend is producing immature cells and this prevents formation of normal blood cells.In this way there is no new blood cells that are normal and all the cells released from the bone marrow are immature.

So you have to get complete disease information from your aunts. Most inherited cases of breast cancer are associated with two abnormal genes: BRCA1 (BReast CAncer gene one) and BRCA2 (BReast CAncer gene two).When these genes contain abnormalities or mutations that are passed from generation to generation, the genes don't function normally and breast cancer risk increases.

At first I couldn’t really eat anything I had zero appetite, but always felt hungry. Then I started eating just fruit; worked my way up to chicken nuggets (from home not fast food). I was feeling better until I ate a fast food cheese burger, I threw it up an hour after eating it and was back a square one. Finally I discovered that grapes helped me feel better and be able to start eating a little again. I did good for about 5 days and then started feeling abdominal pain and nausea again. I was able to keep homemade yogurt fruit smoothies down and fruit. The feeling of hunger and no appetite to eat was overwhelming. I took to taking walks or pacing my hallway and that helped a little with the pain. I went to the chiropractor and after he pushed in and down my stomach the pain and nausea was immensely better and I was able to start eating again. Then I started getting extreme back pain (like I was stabbed between the shoulder blades and couldn’t get the knife out). I had a MRI, ultrasound, and blood tests done.

Survival for 5 years after first detection of cancer is a milestone and with best treatments patients can survive 5 years or more with stage 3 stomach cancer.However the staging has changed after 17 of 20 lymph nodes shoow metastasis and presently it is in stage 4. Unfortunately, about 8 out of 10 (80%) people diagnosed with stomach cancer are stage four, meaning the cancer has already spread when they are diagnosed and this is the case with your father in law.

Cancer will not appear quickly and takes time. Another point which is important concern if you had pain in the lumps. Any pain is usually an infection and cancers are usually not painful in the beginning. It is most likely to be lymph node enlargement at the back of the ear. This is because there are retroauricular lymph nodes in that location and they can get enlarged due to infection.If possible, please get an ultrasound scan of the area to know exactly the findings and cause of lumps and continue taking medicine given by your doctor for a week.

The doctor will see the hidden areas in the mouth and then confirm that you do not have any suspicious wound or ulcer. Apart from the mouth cavity, you also need to get checked for any neck swelling on both sides. A cancer can appear first as lymph node swelling and this is seen as small nodules on both sides of neck.The chances that you have oral cancer are very less but since you have been dipping for sometime and we do not know your habits completely, it will be a good decision to consult the ENT specialist and get checked for oral cancer."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, I wanted to know whether you have heard of the plant, Simarouba and it's cancer cell killing abilities.

Cancer is a difficult disease to treat and must be treated till the end.Your mother has a morphine port in place and therefore her pain might be taken care of. Ovary cancer usually spreads to abdomen and involves liver, peritoneum and omentum. There is also a collection of fluid in many patients. I think she is provided good care at the hospice and can survive for another 2 months as long her eating and drinking are taken care of. Her confusion might be due to many reasons including a sense of psychological distress or disease spread to the bone. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I am a 35yr old female. recently I went in for a scope to see why I have acid reflux, I ended up getting a second scope and a colonoscopy. They found a 2 inch polyp that was not cancer, but said it couldnt be any closer. It was also sent off to get a second opinion that I am waiting on. I also have had a tumor on my ovaries from endometriosis and had them removed 2 years ago. I was advised to get a mammogram asap. Im really starting to freak out. I want to know if I can get chemo treatments to just get rid of everything even though I dont have cancer","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Chemotherapy is given only in the presence of existing or pre existent cancer in the body. It cannot be used as a general treatment to eradicate all cancer cells even before they occur. These chemotherapy medicines are strong and focused to work against rapidly multiplying and proliferating cancer cells containing altered cell nuclear material.As you have a 2 inch polyp, it will be best to get it operated and sent for biopsy. This will pick up even the slightest abnormal cells and then a chemotherapy might be recommended. In the absence of such features, giving a chemotherapy is not justified. You can also get serum cancer markers to know if you still have risk of any specific group of cancers and then become vigilant and get detailed testing done. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"hi.. I am 28 an dhave been diagnose with Uterus cancer stage 2. I've had 2 D&C's in the past 3 months and have been on Megace 160 mg. Our sex life was fine until after my last d&c. Sex is more painful now. I feel like something has swollen in my lower abdomen area and that is kind of acting like a barrier and making the intercourse more painful.. Is this common??? In other words it is as painful as sex during the yeast infection..","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Megace is a hormone which is similar to the hormone progesterone produced by the body. It is used in the treatment of certain types of hormone dependent cancers such as breast or endometrial cancers. It works by reducing the effects of certain hormones including oestrogen.Taking megace in uterus cancer will take care of hormonal functions associated with low levels of progesterone and restore the level. It will also cause lowering of estrogen levels to normal. A painful intercourse can have many causes with uterus cancer. It will help to do an ultrasound scan of your pelvis if it has not been done after D and C. This will show any particular abnormalities in the uterus that might be contributing to your pain. Please use enough amount of lubrication jelly and also have a discussion and clinical examination with your doctor. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I have pain in my left lower abdominal area.

The MRI scan will also show the areas and can be compared with the CT scan to get a better picture of the cysts being harmless.The kidney lesion is confirmed to be containing a fat component and this is a benign lesion."},{"Patient":"hiii I am Dinesh Lakhani I HIV vairous .And I also have Non-Hodgkin s lympoma concer.I started chemotherapy but it does not recover because of some problem in blod.in blod CD20 is minuse therfor chemotherapy in not improving in body so answer our questions.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There are different types of treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Five types of standard treatment are used presently as follows:Radiation therapyChemotherapyTargeted therapyPlasmapheresisBiologic therapyNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.Vaccine therapyHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantPlease discuss the stage and grade of the non hodgkin lymphoma you have and the treatment options other than chemotherapy that might work for you.

Its only in 3 areas, hip bone lower back and upper back.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Loss of appetite can be due to many causes. In a patient diagnosed with bone cancer who is taking chemotherapy, the loss of weight is usually due to a side effect of chemotherapy it self or can be a psychological response to the disease condition. Please get a diet plan based on what the patient likes and dislikes. This diet plan should include 1800 to 2000 kcal per day in divided meals.The patient might not like to have large meals and this can be solved by giving small servings of meal every 3 to 4 hours in the daytime. Adding fresh juices and fluids will also help. You can also add cereals and energy foods and fruits. Avoid giving artificially flavored and processed foods."},{"Patient":"Hello, My dad (69 yrs old) was recently diagnosed with Prostate cancer -- stage 4.

In my opinion following are the possibilities for your symptoms. 1. Side effects of chemotherapy and immunosuppressive drugs.2. Chronic infection. Chemotherapy and immunosuppressive drugs are very toxic to the normal healthy cells of the body. So they show many side effects.  So your symptoms might be due to side effects.

It is important to know the exact location of the hematoma ans if it is superficial or deep. Hematoma is formed due to pooling of blood. If left alone, the blood components will separate and leave the fluid in the location. If this happens then the fluid can be easily aspirated under ultrasound guidance using a small needle. This is a non surgical approach and works in many patients. Most of the fluid is taken out and a little amount left inside will get absorbed on its on.If it has calcified then it is difficult to remove using a needle.

As you have had a bowel cancer, there is less likelihood of having a cancer in the tubes if this finding is present for many months. It is important to know if you suffer from low immunity and whether there could be a chronic infection like tuberculosis due to which you are having this problem of fluid collecting in your tube.However a cancer in the tube can cause obstruction and hydrosalpinx. Most primary fallopian tube cancers arise from ampulla with endoluminal growth that leads to obstruction and distension of the fallopian tube (hydrosalpinx), which explains why the majority of these patients are rarely asymptomatic.

I have been told that it can move to the brain and he has been experiencing more than normal memory loss for a 49 yr old men.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is unfortunate to know about the disease progress and discomfort in your spouse. Thymoma responds the best to radiation treatment and he is getting treated regularly. It is important to know the field of radiation and any chemotherapy that was given to him during last few months. There are certain medications that are toxic to the lungs and might cause lung fibrosis. A CT scan is a must to assess any lung changes due to chemotherapy and radiation. Any spread of disease must also be evaluated in detail.It will help if he also gets a brain scan to know if there is any condition that is causing loss of memory."},{"Patient":"My friend was given 6 months to live after being diagnosed with stage 4 of liver cancer. she stopped chemo and has now a sharp decline on her health. It s only been 1 month. Is it the end or is it a withdrawal from the chemo and will she get her energy back to last 6 months?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Having a stage 4 liver cancer can have a life expectancy of 6 months to 2 years. It is important to know if she has developed problems due to fluid collection in abdomen. Fluid collection is a common problem in those with advanced cancers. There is fluid retention which happens in the chest, abdomen and legs. This is because the fluid transport mechanism is compromised and therefore there is lot of fluid coming into the extra cellular space and this is increasing with time. The treatment choices in a patient like your father in law is limited. The main goal should now be to slow the progress of disease and give him pain relief. I understand that he might be having a lot of pain and this requires a detailed pain relief prescription by his doctor. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I am wondering if I need to contact an Oncologist for a hypoechoic lesion (11x6mm anterior mid body) from an ultrasound test. Done 5/30/14 I was sent for a cat scan which showed low attenuation lesion in the pancreas measuring 7mm. Done 6/11/14. Thank you. Joann","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A hypoechoic lesion in the mid part of pancreas measuring 11 x 6 mm is usually a fluid filled structure. CT scan is required in such cases and you have got it done. The CT scan shows a 7 mm low attenuation lesion in the same place. A low attenuation lesion again is most likely to be a cyst. It is important to know if this lesion is showing enhancement. There is also a technical parameter called HU value in CT scan. If the HU value is less than 20 then it is confirmed to be a fluid containing cystic structure. It is important to have at least one consultation with the oncologist and discuss the reports in detail. Repeat ultrasound scan might be required in 6 months. This is to make certain that it is a benign cystic lesion and not a serious concern. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I have had abdominal pain during the night quite strong, which I needed to breathe through.  I thought it may go away but still persistent, at moment a dull pain continually.  Don't feel hungry, feel bit chilly, when stomach pressed by me it does not hurt.  I thought perhaps appendicitis, but don't want to waste the hospitals time if nothing to worry about. I'm 64years old, female,","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query,Abdominal pain, especially when experienced only at night is generally from gastroduedenal ulcers. gastritis of stomach inflammation occurring mainly at night, or in the early hours of the morning are every characteristic of this condition. This is because there is excessive gastric acid secretion at night and early hours of the morning. It might useful to get tested for Helicobacter Pylori, a bacterium known to cause this condition, and to get a fibroscopy done to better ascertain the state of your stomach. This shall guide your doctor in either instituting a treatment or doing further tests. In my opinion and experience, the above propositions could be a good starting point. Thanks and hope this helps.

The last 3 days are of him non-stop talking, from things he wants to do to god knows what. Not a person can get a word in and if you try he will walk away and get sick.... I told him it was like dealing with a spoiled rude baby... he just kept on talking about the sewer system. Is this a sign the cancer has spread to his brain - He said he will not go back to the Dr. cause the chemo is the problem.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and depends on the individual case. Your husband had a surgery followed by chemotherapy that has been on for last 6 months. It is possible that due to side effects of chemotherapy he is unable to have a good meal because of lack of appetite. Along with inability to eat there is also decreased liquid and water intake in many people on treatment with chemotherapy. In this situation you must see that he has an adequate fluid intake of 2.5 liters every day to keep his hydration normal. Since a colon cancer can cause liver spread in half of the patients therefore complete follow up is required and ultrasound scans and CT scan might help.Regarding his talking irrelevantly, it is important to know if his serum electrolytes are normal as you have said about his possibility of dehydration. Please get his sodium, chloride, calcium and potassium levels checked. He also has little amount of anxiety that is present due to continuous treatment and not being able to lead a normal life. A spread to brain is less likely if you think about the way he is behaving. If he continues to behave this way and his electrolytes are normal then consult a neurologist. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I am a 50 year old female, I recently had a mammogram and breast ultrasound, had a small cyst( aspirated) have a mass,core needle biopsy done negative result.recently I have found a different lump,my right breast is a little swollen and runs into my armpit. Is this cause for concern? Also is it possible to have scar tissue inside your breast from the biopsy and cyst aspiration that would be a hard lump?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The breast is a fatty and glandular tissue containing organ. When in the younger age, it contains more glandular component and less fat. As a woman gets older the fatty content increases more than the glandular one. Sometimes, due to hormonal factors, there is development of cysts in the breast. While they are usually soft and slip under the hand on clinical examination there are cysts that can get infected and then become firm and painful.Breast cysts can be usually made out by ultrasound and mammography when done together. A biopsy is a confirmatory test and can cause a small area or scar and fibrosis that appears as a hard lump on healing. It will subside by itself. To confirm the presence of a breast cyst, you can get a repeat breast ultrasound done and this will show a collapsed cyst with scar tissue. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"We live next to a house with an inground pool the water is only about 3-4 ft deep in a 12 foot pool. It has been this way for over a year.

They also have several feral cats there.","Doctor":"hi,Thanks for writing in.It would help to talk to your neighbors and highlight the health condition of your husband to them. If the pool contains less water and is not drained regularly then there can be deposition of mosquito larvae in the dirty water. This can spread mosquito borne disease in the neighborhood. It will help to bring to the attention of the house owner and active steps taken to clear the pool of stagnant water and creatures like frogs and small animals. Once the pool is drained of its water, it can be chlorinated and covered until such time that it will be used regularly by the occupants of the house.

His taking terazosin cap 5.MG","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Prostate cancer is confirmed by doing certain tests specific to the prostate gland. At first the serum PSA level is important and if this is high then the patient is recommended for a transrectal ultrasound of prostate. This will show any suspicious lesions. Any lesion in the peripheral zone of prostate is to be biopsied and this biopsy is done under ultrasound guidance. A little bit of tissue from the suspicious region is taken out with a needle and sent to the lab to study the cells. Only if there are cancer cells then a diagnosis of cancer is established. Once a patient is confirmed with caner of prostate, it is better to do a bone scan and ultrasound abdomen and chest X ray to know the spread of disease. If there is no spread and the tumor is smaller than 3 cm in size then it is in first stage. Terazosin is a drug prescribed for the treatment of symptoms due to an enlarged prostate caused by benign prostatic hypertrophy. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My boyfriend has CLL. He is currently in his 6th year with the cancer. He is currently undergoing a series of 6 chemo treatments. He just completed #4 after a six week rest to bring count back to normal. This weekend however he has awaken with a swollen throat and a fever. He says that is the only thing bothering him but he is so weak that he can t stand or eat or drink. Is the throat associated with the CLL? Or has he picked up an infection from somewhere? He had a very similar experience after his second chemo and it landed him in the hospital. I am trying to be proactive with this. Please advise....","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The CLL is a type of cancer affecting the lymphatic system. This is directly related to immunity of the patient. Taking chemotherapy for CLL is also causing compromise of the immune system. Due to taking 4 cycles of chemotherapy, your brothers immunity might have come down and he has got a sore throat. This is causing him discomfort and fever. It will help to consult his doctor and take medications for any suspected bacterial infection causing the sore throat. Gargling with warm water is suggested twice a day to soothe the throat. He should also protect himself from dusty atmosphere and pollution till he=is chemotherapy is over. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My wife was diagnosed 3 years ago with Stage 3 Ovarian Cancer. Things have been going well. Her recent ca-125 done yesterday was 58, up from 38 in late Feb. She has been fighting a major sinus cold, with congestion amd mucus, could this affect the Ca-125 level","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer antigen 125 is a substance that is produced in the ovary, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and the lining the lining of the chest and abdominal cavities (the pleura and the peritoneum).The CA 125 level measures a sugar protein that may be released when cells are inflamed or damaged. CA 125 levels under 35 kU/ml are considered normal.Since the CA 125 rise can occur in inflammation therefore a common cold and sinusitis can certainly cause a slight rise in the level. I suggest that she takes treatment for the sinusitis and repeats the CA 125 level after a month when she is free of symptoms. This will help guide her during the next follow up visit with the oncologist.

I work for a naturopath, but his specialty is not chemo or radiation, but would like someone who will work with him in my care.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and treatment differs in every patient depending on the location, size, staging and post surgery biopsy findings. Since you have had surgery only 9 days ago, it will help to discuss with your oncologist and depending on the biopsy report, go for a comprehensive treatment. Even is the margins are clear, there is estrogen/ progesterone positive nature and this requires you to have chemotherapy and radiation. The earliest this is started the best outcome it will have.I wish you reconsider the benefits of chemotherapy and radiation in your case and start treatment on time. Naturopathy can give you comfort and detoxify your system and it is best to discuss your treating doctor on when to take simple naturopathy procedures and wait until you are done with initial chemotherapy.Even if the margins are clear, there can still be persisting microscopic invasion of cells and this can lead to flaring of cancer an a few months. Radiation is precise and specific to the region of cancer. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My father of 78-year of age has a Stage IV esophagous cancer for over 20 months. He has completed 35 Chemos and 15 rounds of radiation. He suffered fever on the last day of his radiation 10 days ago and the medical team has determined that the infection that caused his fever was due to pneumonia resulting from Tracheoesophagel Fistula. The pulmonary specialist, and the surgeon do not recommend surgery due to cancer and both doctors think my father has short time left to live (about 1 to 2 months). However, the oncologist thinks that there is a possibility that with time, though very slowly, tracheoesophagel fistula may heal itself with the ongoing antibiotics treatment given the pnumonia my father is suffering is not sever. What are your thoughts on differences of opinions among the doctors and what is the best care for my father going forward (LTAC or Home Health Care)? Thank you in advance for your help.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to hear about the progress of disease in your father and the development of tracheoesophageal fistula. In this condition, there is a communication between the airway and food pipe and the patient can aspirate food contents in to the lungs causing a severe infection.As early as 10 days after radiation, the area might still be raw and surgery is not a good option. This can complicate the situation and worsen the disease. If the fistula is small then with time, the area around the tracheoesophageal fistula can heal and form fibrosis. This is a healed scar tissue ad can help in spontaneous closure of the fistula.Also the pneumonia is not severe and antibiotics are being given to take care of the infection. At this point in time, your father must be made comfortable and his pain reduced as much possible. The first step remains curing him of the pneumonia and extend his survival by a few months. I understand that he is taking ryles tube feeding. Then next we have to provide him adequate pain relief and that can mean increasing his medications to make him feel comfortable. This can be followed by waiting for the tracheoesophageal fistula to heal.If the initial part of pneumonia can be taken care of in a hospital then he can be provided home health care after he is stable."},{"Patient":"Hello I am in need of some information My husband had testicular cancer in the Marines in 1985/86, he had severe after affects from the radiation treatments.

However at that time, providing radiation therapy had more benefits and risks and has helped in treating the testicular cancer and your husband has been free from symptoms almost 25 years.Plasma cell dysplasia can be seen in such patients but saying with confirmation that it is indeed the radiation that is responsible is difficult. Radiation effects are both dose dependent and non dose dependent. If your husband was exposed to radiation in error at his workplace then things would have been different but in the present case he has been given radiation therapy as a treatment and that has been successful to a certain extent. There are also patients who develop a second cancer that is unrelated to the first cancer. To know the chances of the prior radiation treatment causing the plasma cell dysplasia, all his medical records have to be verified and that will only give a risk.

IF TUMOR IS AGRESSIVE ?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade III) constitute about 10% of all gliomas. Definitive data on predictive and prognostic factors are lacking for these neoplasms that are considered the most enigmatic entity among the whole spectrum of astrocytic tumors because of their unclear biologic behavior and variable clinical outcome.Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and the progress of disease can be predicted only after initiation of treatment and response. Anaplastic astrocytoma is more on the aggressive side and shows behavior that requires a close watch. As there is only a small part showing anaplastic features, the cancer can still be controlled and aggressive treatment must be given in the beginning.In a cancer lesion having both aggressive and low grade areas, the tumor must be treated as an aggressive one and measures should be put in place to control tumor growth and control cellular proliferation.

I had an mri done and was told I didn t have cancer. now I have another tumor in the same area. it was soft as first, like the first one I had, but turned hard about 1 year ago. After it became hard it has been beyond painful. I m scared. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There is a little bit of confusion in your statement. It is not clear if the path reports consistently said it was a liposarcoma. MRI is a good investigation tool for tumors and shows the size, location, infiltration and any associated structural involvement. The path reports are confirmatory and always have to be matched with the MRI results. If path reports say it was malignant then there is no other way to tell that it isnt one.In view of what is written above and considering that the path reports were altered subsequently, the appearance of a new tumor in the area requires CT or MRI scan and an image guided biopsy from the active region of the tumor. This is essential to know if there is a locally aggressive process going on and if it should be treated. The pain can be due to nerve entrapment by the tumor and that must also be looked in to. A biopsy is the final confirmation in your case. There is no need to get scared as it can also be a focus of chronic infection in the operated area.

I meet with oncologist tomorrow. (Past hx of Br CA x 2-18 yrs apart; family hx of multiple cancers including pancreatic). All enzymes normal. CA19-9 = 10. all other blood work nl. My question is: I suspect that I will next have the pancreatic tumor diagnosed to confirm malignancy and cell type. If this is the procedure used (rather than EUS) will it be usual to take samples of the tumor and other surrounding areas to determine if tumor has affected surrounding areas? Also is this procedure more used for this type of situation than EUS-how much difference? Thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Stage of the cancer is known by the size and extent of the tumor. Techniques like CAT scan and endoscopic ultrasound help a lot in staging of cancers in the pancreas. Since you have no other features of cancer spread other than the mass in the head of pancreas measuring 1.5 x 2 cm hence ultrasound or CT scan guided FNAC or biopsy is a must for making pathological diagnosis.EUS is one of the ways to accurately target the mass and take out the cells. In a transabdominal USG or CT guided procedure also the abjective remains the same. The only difference is that EUS is a minimally invasive technique and transabdominal approach is an external technique. If a tumor is better accessible externally then this approach is used. However if the tumor is thought to be better sampled with EUS then that method is used. You will be given pain relief medications in both procedures.The CA 19-9 level is normal and this means that there is less likelihood of the mass to be a cancer. It is a cancer marker and a high value indicates probability of cancer. However you should discuss the mater with doctors at the cancer hospital and get a biopsy scheduled quickly. This is because a normal CA 19-9 can rarely be a cancer and it must be treated should it be one."},{"Patient":"Throid removed 2009 papillary cancer contained within thyroid no treatment after surgery.

It is not round, and it is multi-colored . I am nervous that it may be skin cancer. I think I remember it being like this when i was younger as well, but I am really nervous about it being cancer.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A mole is an area in the skin surface where there is an excess of pigment deposition. Our skin gets its color from melanin pigment present in the skin. In a dark skin person, there is a higher quantity of melanin produced by the cells on the skin surface. In a light colored person, the melanin produced by skin cells is less.When the melanin is secreted in higher quantity in a particular spot on the skin surface, this gives rise to a mole and there can also be associated increased cell growth. The multicolor nature in a mole is due to the variable concentration of pigments in it. A mole is benign in most cases. However if it develops sudden increase in size, appearance of hair on surface or pain sensation and ulcer formation then you should consult your doctor immediately. They will scrape the cells from mole surface if required and then confirm it it is a concern. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 41 and taking thyronorm 50 mg since last 1 month.

Thyroid swellings can remain dormant for many years and suddenly might develop increase in size with appearance of cancer like features. Please get a scan done and any nodules or suspicious areas in the thyroid will be known. It is important to know that most patients with thyroid swelling will never have cancer. However since you are having a swelling, to be safe it is always better got get completely evaluated. Thyronorm must be taken for long duration till your thyroid hormone level is not balanced.

Most of them are from benign causes and only some have a malignant cause. Without knowing the details of the spots with respect to size, appearance and location, it is difficult to confirm the health concern. This is the reason you had to get another scan done with contrast dye injected through intravenous route and this will help delineate the characteristic features of the spots under evaluation.

The results they said were that i was not pregnant and according to my blood work i had no infections, in fact the PA said my blood work came back perfect . so they suggest going to see a gyno to get checked out. but when i called around town and surrounding towns the next day, every OB/GYN i called was completely booked for weeks! so... if i have some kind of infection, wouldnt that have shown up in my blood work??? also think ill mention that i started doing meth, IV/injecting it, several weeks ago (approx 6-8 weeks ago). ive lost a lot of weight and my already small breasts have shrunk down to barely anything now. could all this be the cause of a hormonal imbalance due to using meth?? could a hormonal imbalance cause fibroids, cysts, or anything of the sort? and bc been doing meth i hardly ever sleep and barely eat anything either. so i was shooting up the other day and couldnt keep the needle inside my vein bc i was so shaky (from doing all the meth id done and lack of food or sleep over several days in a row) but some blood that had entered the syringe began to coagulate and block up the tip of the needle so i took it out, put it all back on spoon (including the coagulated blood) added some burning hot water to it, attempted to break apart and dissolve the coagulated blood, mixed it all up again and proceeded to shoot the crap into my vein anyway. which it took literally a couple of hours for this entire process and by time i actually found good vein and injected it so due to the coagulated blood and the fact that it was all sitting in the open air on the spoon and/or in a syringe for over 2 hrs before i put it in my blood stream, wondering if this could have caused some bacteria or infection to enter my body...? but once again wouldnt this have shown up when my blood work was done?? and even if did cause infection or whatever then why would it go straight to my vaginal/uterus area and my colon area? plus with the pains/inflammation in my vaginal area, that began weeks ago before this coagulated blood incident, and has just recently gotten much worse, with the blood clots and such... one more thing along line of drug use is that prior to the recent meth use, i was clean and sober for about 2 months but before that id been addicted to and was an IV heroin user for about 6yrs... Anyway last thing ill mention, just in case this has anything to do with any of whats going on with my body, is that i started dating my current bf about 2 months ago and been having unprotected sex with him since then (btw no he most certainly does not use meth or any drugs), but i know for fact he cheated on me once but i do not believe they had intercourse, she gave him oral... but if he did that once, he could have cheated another time and actually had sexual intercourse with someone else, gotten STD or STI and then given it to me... but i do not know. also if i have an STI or STD then once again wouldnt an infection have shown up in my blood work or urine sample...? or do they only test for specific kinds of infections...? and if sti or std then why the problems with my colon area...? idk what could be wrong?? or if possibly multiple problems??

Thank god after the removal and biopsy, no CA.  This January was my last menses cycle and I was having menopausal symptoms, so I went to my doctor about a month ago and my FSH test came back that I am in menopause.  This past Tuesday I had a tranvaginal ultra sound and my uterine lining is 16.6 mm, and I have a cyst on my left ovary.  My doctor was concerned for both since my blood work came back that I am in menopause, and this is unusual for the cyst and thickness.  I am scheduled for an D&C, plus biopsy in two weeks.  I am of course concerned that this is CA, but everything I read states you bleed if you have uterine cancer, and I have not had any bleeding since January.  Can you shed some light on why this is happening during this time in my life?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your doctor is right in recommending you a D and C followed by biopsy. Any abnormal vaginal bleeding must be evaluated in detail considering your age and ultrasound scan findings that you are having. A 16.6 mm thickness of endometrium is increased and this can indicate abnormal cells, hormonal imbalance or polyp in the endometrial cavity. A polyp is less likely as it is not mentioned in your transvaginal ultrasound scan report. It will help to know if there is a history of gynecological cancer in your family and if you have been taking hormone pills in the past. In most cases this bleeding is due to benign causes and called dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The cyst in left ovary if smaller than 2.5 cm is not a serious concern. If it is a complex cyst then your doctor might ask for CA 125 level to be done. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello, Dr.  I Khisal MIrza from Amroha (Uttar Pradesh) Actualy my Father(61yrs & diabetic patient) suffering from PROSTATE CANCER.

Having a stage 4 liver cancer can be expected to cause swollen feet. This is because of the fluid retention in his body. Fluid collection is a common problem in those with advanced cancers. There is fluid retention which happens in the chest, abdomen and legs. This is because the fluid transport mechanism is compromised and therefore there is lot of fluid coming into the extra cellular space and this is increasing with time. The treatment choices in a patient like your father in law is limited. The main goal should now be to slow the progress of disease and give him pain relief.

Her nurse said although noted as rather normal scan my endometrial thickness was 8mm. What home remedies should i take to prevent endometrial cancer?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The inner lining of uterus is called endometrium. At 67 years age, you might be having an overactive endometrium. The endometrium is shed suring the periods in women of the reproductive age group. At your age, it is important to get an endometrial biopsy if your gynecologist has advised one. Hormonal changes can cause vaginal bleeding in elderly women but if you had a continuous bleeding for 5 to 7 days then it is a concern for endometrial polyp or cancer. Since no large polyp is seen, it can also be that the endometrium is altered due to many reasons. Early stages of cancer cannot be seen on ultrasound. I suggest you also get a MRI scan of your pelvis with the recommendation of your doctor and then do endometrial biopsy. If the biopsy results are negative for malignancy then benign causes must be thought of. If the bleeding repeats frequently then you might require a surgery. There is no home remedy to prevent endometrial cancer.Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"For about a month now I've had swelling in my lower abdomen, on both sides, next to hip bones.

This is not related to chemotherapy or its outcome. The recovery after chemotherapy remains unaffected irrespective of whether a patient had polio. The polio is an irreversible paralysis due to an infection which you probably had during childhood.The manifestations of polio will no longer matter in the present scenario. Since you have weakness of muscles from before due to polio therefore it might take a little longer to get yourself in to normal physical work. This is not due to the effect of polio but a generalized reduced ability to adapt yourself for normal regular daily activities. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello.  I've fought with a heangioma of my left lower lip for my whole life and had 3 laser surgeries done on it when I was 10-12 years old done by a great doctor named Clayman from Detroit, Michigan.

It has grown over the years and now I am having complications with it aka swelling of half of my lower lip and pain. I was wondering if there was a doctor in Florida maybe even at Shands in Gainesville who was willing to treat my case. The little research that I have done suggests that there still are not many doctors who will treat and do surgery on my type of hemangioma. Please help.

The last 5years I seem to have stomach pain.   The Doctor says it could be a floating hernia, what is it and can it be cured either thru an op or medication .  Iam 88 years old","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Stoma is an artificial opening created in the left lower anterior abdominal wall to allow the remaining bowel after surgery to empty itself. The stoma opening is harnessed to a bag externally. It is likely that you have a stoma that is of permanent nature and is required to be functioning at all times. The part of bowel which is present in the stoma might not be fastened to the underlying abdominal structures and is therefore floating.Due to the mobility of the floating bowel in the abdominal cavity it is possible that the bowel can be causing an internal hernia and this is happening intermittently. A CT scan of the abdomen will help in knowing the exact location of any such occurrence. If confirmed it can be repaired by doing a surgery. Medicines do not help permanently in hernia.

Which practice is followed as most appropriate in the case of person below 32 yrs of age suffering/suffered with NHL bone (LCA) Positive and no sub type.........Whether Knee Replacement with prosthesis technique is more appropriate or bone grafting arthodensis is more appropriate in case of NHL bone Tibia ?Wh","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.NHL means non Hodgkins lymphoma. LCA is leukocyte common antigen and is  a marker for disease type in NHL. World Health Organization broadly classifies lymphomas into Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is further subclassified based on the stage of maturation (immature vs. mature) and cell of origin [B cell, T cell, or natural killer cell (NK) cell]. A panel of markers is decided based on morphologic differential diagnosis (no single marker is specific) which includes leukocyte common antigen (LCA), B-cell markers (CD20 and CD79a), T-cell markers (CD3 and CD5).LCA is used to classify the NHL to be of a praticular type and to guide the treatment to be given. Knee replacement or bone grafting depends on the area of involvement. Knee replacement and arthrodesis are two different procedures. If there is sufficient uninvolved bone surface to allow knee replacement then it can be done."},{"Patient":"If symptoms of stomach cancer have been present for x amount of years, can one tell how many years it takes to get to a certain stage of stomach cancer or is it dependent on the type of cancer cell or is there no way to measure and its really case by case? Is there an average (measure in time) for each stage? ie. 5 years to get to stage 1, 2 years to get to stage 3 and finally 1 year to get to stage 4?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer happens when there is uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells anywhere in the body. A cancer can be of many types cased on grading and staging. Grading is the type of cells and histopathological variation in cancer. A well differentiated cancer is a less aggressive cancer than a poorly differentiated one. Cancers can take any course and do not follow any fixed course as you have asked. However it is true that later the cancer stage at the time of presentation, greater is the aggressiveness leading to higher morbidity and mortality in the later stages. Stage I and II of cancer stomach are well treated by surgery and then follow up chemotherapy and radiation. Stage III and IV cancer are less likely to be operable and treatment involves chemotherapy and radiation. Patients with stage 4 stomach cancer might survive for 6 months to 2 years when provided treatment and follow up."},{"Patient":"When I lean my head forward there is a large knot at the top left of my spine it does not hurt and I did go see a chiro and I was just scared it was cancer but he said from the X-rays it didn't look like that but he really didn't tell me what it could be I'm going to a reg dr on Monday and he said my neck is a little out of alignment so he adjusted me back and neck but I know one wont make a difference but I'm still worried","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.If your doctor has examined you clinically and said that the know is due to a malalignment of the spinal vertebrae then most likely it is not a cancer. The spine is made up of many small bones aligned on top of each other. This is further supported by small discs in between any two vertebrae that provides cushioning to the bones.It is best that you get a MRI scan of the concerned region done as a part of evaluation of the problem you are facing. MRI scan will give complete details and there is no ambiguity of the presence of any abnormal tumor or cancer. Any malalignment also requires a MRI scan to be studied in detail.In conclusion, it is best to do a MRI scan of your spine in the region of the knot. This will show the malalignment in vertebrae and if there is any pressure on the spinal cord. Cancer of the spine will also be rule out by this way.

It is important to know the size of the meningioma in the earlier scan and how long it is since that scan. If the earlier scan is less than 6 months old than doing another scan is not required.Amixide contains amitriptyline, an antidepressant and will not cause any change in the size or appearance of the meningioma. This will help relieve tension and any anxiety. It will help to know the exact location of the tumor and if it is pressing on important structures to cause headache.Survival rate for meningioma is excellent. If not removed entirely, some meningiomas might recur and this can be treated again by radiation therapy.

In my experience with patients of lung cancer stage 4 have a survival of 2 years might be expected. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and every tumor behaves in a different way. However we must fight cancer till the end. As it is stage 4 therefore surgery is not a treatment. Chemotherapy and radiation can be given to control the disease and prevent it from spreading in to new areas. This treatment can add few months to a year and that is significant.Parallel treatment with siddha medicines can be given as long they do not interfere with chemotherapy or cause any side effects which will slow his recovery. Most siddha medications are made from herbal sources. Research has shown that aswagandha has potential against cancer-related fatigue, in addition to improving the quality of life.

Gliomas are of different types depending on the cell of origin. Glioma is an umbrella term used to describe the different types of gliomas: astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and glioblastoma. Gliomas vary in their aggressiveness, or malignancy. Some are slow-growing and are likely curable. Others are fast-growing, invasive, difficult to treat, and are likely to recur.A 2 mm or 5 mm glioma is small and it is possible that due to it being located at a strategic location therefore surgery is not possible.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Having a kidney removed 8 years back is rarely associated to cause a lung nodule after so long, However, any patient with history of cancer treatment in the past must be completely evaluated should they develop any lung nodule. The size and appearance of nodule is important. If it is less than one centimeter then it can still be observed. Proper diagnosis of nodule must be made after doing CT scan chest.As he is in good health and has no other signs of cancer, it will help to consult the oncologist and surgeon. It is better to do a CT PET scan to make sure that the nodule is a cancer. PET scan will pick up rapidly metabolizing or growing nodules as bright spot. If this feature is seen in the PET CT scan then the possibility of a cancer is confirmed. If the nodule is bigger then a biopsy can also be done to confirm with a pathological diagnosis. If cancer is present then chemotherapy and radiation can be started if he is not keeping fit for surgery. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Thank you.

There have been patients with spread of cancer to the brain and in many cases it is malignant melanoma that has spread to cause headaches.The bleeding from lips might be due to a different cause and her general blood counts need to be checked.

This should not be neglected as she is unable to walk properly and therefore it might be a concern. A blood clot in the deep veins of the leg has to be ruled out first. Please tell her to consult the doctor an get the painful thigh examined clinically. Clinical examination is required and this might need a Doppler scan of the lower limb to see for any clots.Alternatively it can also be inflammation and bleeding from the superficial veins in the thigh and this is not a serious concern.However a clot in the deep veins of thigh and leg can be a threat to life and she should not neglect herself.

In certain conditions as your father, there is excessive collection of fluid in the abdominal cavity. In smaller amounts such fluid can be allowed to get reabsorbed on its own. However when the fluid collection is high, the chances of it getting reabsorbed is less.For excessive ascitic fluid, doctors usually prescribe a diuretic pill and that helps to drain the fluid. In large collections, the medication might not give the adequate response and in this case ascitic tap has to be placed. This is a slightly thick needle inserted in to the anterior abdominal wall and connected to a tube. The fluid is allowed to slowly drain out over hours or two days. Sudden decompression of the fluid might lead to distress and should be avoided. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"52 154 lbs squamous cell carcinomas had surgery remove what im concern is what happes after you had the biopsy it came back cancer did surgery why do they send it to the lab and what if it comes back bad had some on hands and big one they grew fast after shaved","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A cancer diagnosis requires detailed evaluation and confirmation. The final diagnosis is made only after a biopsy. A biopsy involves studying the cells under a microscope by the pathologist and confirming them to be cancer. A cancer cell is one that multiplies without control and in an irregular fashion. This can be seen under microscope. Cancer cells are also of many grades like low grade, intermediate grade and high grade depending on the aggressiveness. A low grade cancer has better curability than a high grade. These will be known after the biopsy test.During surgery a small area of normal appearing skin is also taken out to make sure no cancer tissue is left behind. However, in high grade cancer the cells can re appear and this needs to be closely observed. Therefore if high grade cancer cell is seen on biopsy then additional treatment like chemotherapy and radiation is also given.Recurrence chances of cancer is more with a higher grade of tumor. If there is recurrence of squamous cell cancer then more aggressive surgery, chemotherapy and radiation might be required.

I am experiencing extreme anxiety over the past four weeks due to an ovarian cancer scare and the kidney result. I am otherwise healthy, except for acid reflux and high cholesterol. I just started taking lipator and am using dexilant for GERD.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.If you have got CT scan and MRI scan of abdomen and pelvis that confirms normal ovaries then it is unlikely that you have a ovarian cancer. The 2 cm ?cancer in the kidney is a concern. A 2 cm lesion in kidney is a small one but requires complete evaluation and treatment as the report says about a probable cancer in the area.Any cancer can cause symptoms like weight loss more than 10 percent in two months that cannot be explained, generalized weakness and fatigue, swellings in the body, blood counts going down, easy tiredness. In addition, ovarian cancer can cause a swelling that is rapidly growing in the lower abdomen that might cause little pain. It can also cause fluid collection and ascites. At 65 years age it is menopausal so menstrual disturbances might not be present. There are blood tests for tumor markers like CA 125 which tells the likelihood of ovarian cancer in women.Since your report does not say anything about ovaries please do not worry.

This is NOT something that I can live with.","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your pain is mostly due to carcinoid tumour.  So you should take treatment of carcinoid cancer.  Treatment depends on the location and stage of cancer.  In terminal stage chemotherapy is the treatment of choice.  For terminal pain you can take morphine for pain relief. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer.

She has three small tumors on her brain and they are starting radiation tomorrow. In addition she has two tumors in her lung and another on her vocal cord or esophagus...she isn t sure and hasn t said whether they are treating that along with the radiation or what they will be doing with her lung tumors. I will be going to Boise Id. where she currently lives to try to help her through this. I can t see a good outcome for this and wouldn t ever let her know that. I would like to know your feeling about treatment as I know from what I ve read and heard from a close friend (Dr.) who practices in in Fla. that the future with going through treatment will make her very sick and her quality of life not good at best. Do you feel the prognosis is such that she could go through all of this if there isn t a good chance that she ll survive? I know it s not a yes or no questions....I should also tell you she is in stage IV. I am not very hopeful. Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Treatment of choice is chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  However despite of treatment prognosis is very poor.  Life expectancy is very low.  Chemotherapy and radiotherapy definitely make her more sick and quality of life is also bad. It is better to leave her without treatment.  Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly.

My brother recently commited suicide and the autopsy revealed he had liver cancer that spread to his brain. I looked into a lab test done over 4 years ago to see if he had any indications back then of trouble. His AST was 183 and his ALT was 173. Albumin was OK at 4 and bilirubin 1.3 Is the fact that the ratio is over 1 indicative of cerrosis even thogh it is only slightly above 1? Are the values high enough to indicate definitely liver disease at that time? Thanks!!!","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. He has high AST and ALT.  They are liver enzymes and their level increase in any kind of liver damage.  It may be due to hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcohol, drugs or toxins.  So it need complete liver function test with ultrasound abdomen. From that result we can not say that it is due to liver cancer.  But liver disease should be surely diagnosed and should further investigate.Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic.

I m being referred to one of the medical teaching schools for further evaluation. Can they biopsy this? IF it is benign, what is repercussion of not doing anything with it... or is that an option?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The clivus is part of the bone in the inside of the skull. This is a small bone that has a pea sized area in front where the pituitary gland is found. The clivus is a bone located behind the pituitary,A chordoma is a tumor of bone origin and is regularly noted in relation to the clivus. It is part of a family of cancers called sarcoma, which include cancers of the bones, cartilage, muscles and other connective tissue.Chordomas are thought to arise from remnants of the embryonic notochord and might have cell origins since birth and start proliferating at a later age. They are usually slow growing and recur after treatment. Because of their proximity to critical structures biopsy is difficult and requires skilled approach. Often it is diagnosed on CT scan or MRI scan and treatment is given. Having it evaluated in a teaching school will give you more options of treatment and cure."},{"Patient":"my six yr. old got bit by something on her leg above knee I think three day ago it has a puss head in middle and now puss pockets are farming around head she come plan belly hurt two nights ago but nothing from that point on been putting cortisone 10 for itching & triple antibiotic ointment need to know if I should bring her to emergency room or make appointment with doctor","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query,She will need to consult a doctor. Formation of pus after using the antibiotics you gave means the treatment was not very appropriate. Your doctor shall need to evaluate the child again, get the pockets of pus drained, and prescribe appropriate antibiotics. Drugs through injections or through the oral route would be most appropriate in this case. The abdominal needs careful and urgent evaluation, considering her age and clinical environment (infection/pus).I think taking her to an emergency service is a brilliant idea. Administration of Anti tetanus serum should be administered for the state of the agent that caused the wound could be a threat.

She s now had a stent placed (although only could get a small one in)...Itching seems to be getting a little worse and jaundice is improved (after stent) but still there. What kind of time do you think she has...at first I was told 1 - 2 months...then same dr. told her maybe 6 months? What is the normal expected progression for someone in this shape/situation? What can we expect? Trying to decide where/how to handle care from a financial and physical standpoint.. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a difficult condition to treat but one should fight it till the end. Bile duct cancers are very aggressive and can quickly spread over the involved area. The bile duct conveys the bile generated in the liver to the small intestine through the bile duct. This bile secreted in to the intestine helps in digestion of food.The cancer in bile duct might have caused obstruction to flow of bile and therefore there was jaundice. It is important to know if the entire affected area was removed by surgery and confirmed to be cancer.The stent in place is allowing the bile to pass through without any obstruction and this is reducing the jaundice. If she has not developed cancer any where else in the body then she can continue having the stent in place. Most likely every gall bladder and bile duct cancer might spread to the liver and that is seen on ultrasound scan or CT scan. Once this is done then the survival of a patient is around 6 months to 18 months. If there is no spread to the liver than a patient with a bile duct cancer which has been operated can survive for 2 years."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, had three surgeries as I had invasive breast cancer.

Some of the side effects of chemotherapy are the following.Feeling sick (nausea) and being sick Hair loss or thinningA sore mouthTaste and appetite changesDiarrhoeaConstipationChanges to your periods (menstrual cycle)Sore eyesOvary cancer is less likely to occur for you as the radiation was given to breast and chest region."},{"Patient":"I had cancer in the stomach, stronger cut it out. this was a year and a half ago. I have a quarter of a stomach. Went out to eat yesterday knowing I cant eat that much but did anyway, went to a buffet, stomach cramped so bad I through up bile all night, was that because I had to much food in my stomach,","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.You might have had an early stage of stomach cancer and therefore recommended surgery as a treatment. It is not clear if yo also received chemotherapy or radiation as a treatment. As you might be aware, your stomach volume has been reduced after surgery and this requires you tho have small light meals throughout the day to be taken at frequent intervals.The symptoms you experienced are due to dumping syndrome post gastric surgery. Also called rapid gastric emptying, dumping syndrome occurs when the undigested contents of your stomach move too rapidly into your small bowel. Common symptoms include abdominal cramps, nausea and diarrhea.Most people with dumping syndrome experience symptoms soon after eating. In others, symptoms may occur one to three hours after eating. Some people experience both early and late symptoms. It is important to avoid eating too much at a time as in the recent buffet and then you will feel comfortable after taking meals.

Treatment of stage IV colon cancer includes the following methods1. Surgery.2. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy.3. Local ablation (eg radiofrequency ablation).4. Adjuvant chemotherapy.5. Intra-arterial chemotherapy.Treatment for metastasis is often guided due to criteria evolved to administer various treatment methods.Survival in this situation depends on his general condition. he should be provided with adequate nutrition and good food.However the final outcome of the situation in colon cancer stage IV might not always be completely curable; however we must fight the battle with cancer till the end.

I recently got married and am curious if the chemo or radiation I had could have made me sterile.  The tumor was in my sinus and so the radiation was focused on the head and neck regions.  The chemos I took were, Etoposide, Ifosfamide and Vincristine and Doxorubicin.  Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Etoposide can cause reduced ovarian reserve in females and infertility in males.Males appear more susceptible than females to ifosfamide gonadotoxicity. There may be a dose in males below which the risk of subfertility is low. In females there is preliminary evidence of reduction in ovarian reserve, which may potentially lead to an early menopause and a reduction in the window of fertility.Vincristine is typically less likely to harm fertility. Some of these drugs also may interrupt menstruation in girls and/or cause early menopause.In females of reproductive potential, Doxorubicin may cause infertility and result in amenorrhea. Premature menopause can occur. Recovery of menses and ovulation is related to age at treatment.Doxorubicin may result in oligospermia, azoospermia, and permanent loss of fertility. Sperm counts have been reported to return to normal levels in some men. This may occur several years after the end of therapy"},{"Patient":"My husband has gleo blastoma brain cancer...been under treatment for over 1 year following surg.  5 days ago had \\"bubble\\" to come up in his vision that has been coming and going.  CT scan showed nothing,,,eye exam....nothing.  Will go to Neurologist this week...do you have any answers?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to hear the progress of disease in your husband. In my experience with patients of GBM I and II have a higher survival than those with GBM III and IV. It is important to know the size, location and if there is any pressure effect due to the tumor. Most tumors cause brain pressure, swelling or edema due to slightly increased electrical activity in the surrounding brain.The bubble in his vision might be due to pressure on the optic pathway. This has to be carefully evaluated by doing a CT scan or MRI scan since the clinical exam is normal. This can be controlled by giving steroids and mannitol.The real problem is any change in appearance of the tumor and its pressure effect on adjacent structures. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and every tumor behaves in a different way. However we must fight cancer till the end.

About two months ago I started having intermittent pain in my lower left abdomen. One day it became constant and more severe so I checked my temp and it was 100.4. I was sure I had diverticulitis again but a CT showed it was not there. My white count was at 19.1 and my neutrophils were in the 84% range and lymphocytes were about 12%. Everything else was good except my platelets were a little high at 440. I was prescribed Flagyl and Levaquin, a 10 day supply of each with instructions to come back if symptoms persisted. 4 days later it was back to the hospital because I was maybe a little worse, but this time my WBC was 14.3 and everything else back in the normal range. They gave me IV of each and extended my regimen to 17 days. 3 weeks later, still a low fever at about 99 when I wake, up to about 100 during the day, and dropping off at night to near or at normal levels. Pain is now in many different places. It had gone from lower left quadrant, to over naval, sometimes lower right quadrant, up to left clavicle where it feels like there is a pressure almost at times. This time white count was 11.1 but the neutrophils and lymphocytes were beginning to raise and lower respectively. I have had two more CBC since then and both times the WBC has been 11.1 and the as of a week ago the neutrophils and lymphocytes are near their original levels. At this point one of the doctors I was seeing, as my Primary was on vacation, is thinking infection still but doesn't want to go to more antibiotics because that would be the \\"shotgun approach\\". He seemed convinced that was the case until he did a physical exam. He didn't say much but when laid me on my back and sort of pushed my stomach towards the center of my ribcage he seemed surprised to hear it didn't hurt. I had told him the pain is now all over, rarely is it real bad and it is always at about 2-4 places at once. If I push on it in the abdominal area it actually relieves the pain. He seemed surprised to hear that  as well. He sort of changed directions after that and ordered 4 new blood tests, one for EBV, and three others that test for inflammation or clues to an autoimmune disease. Has this become the favorite at this point? I know at one point infection, lymphoma or leukemia, or immune disease were all considerations. As I type this I am waiting for results that I can take them to my Primary so he can take over the case. I still have a fever, rarely over 100, but everyday. I started having seizures about a year and a half ago, I don't think they are considering that as connected, but my neurologist wants the temperature under control because they can cause seizures. (The cause for the seizures was never determined) Tylenol or Ibuprofen don\\"t get rid of them, but if I take a lot I can go from 100 to 99.6 or something.I guess I am kind of wondering if anybody can have a little insight to what they might be thinking. The pains have gone from mostly left side to almost as much right side now. They are sharp, mostly intermittent pains, usually not severe. The doctor said they could just be from my body fighting the infection so hard but it just doesn\\"t add up to me. They have continually gotten worse regardless of test results. Also, I have been having this pain/pressure feeling mostly everyday under my left ribcage. It is a lot to process, I know. Comments would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Namasthe Welcome to Healthcare-MagicGreetings of the dayI would suggest that you get a Colonoscopy done , as CT scan may not pick up the things which are inside the lumen of colon.

It is possible that you had a cancer involving right lobe of thyroid and there was also retrosternal extension. As the cancer was detected in the nodule from right lobe, you doctor was right in taking out the entire thyroid and the part of thyroid gland projecting in to the sternum. Retro sternum thyroid is the presence of thyroid tissue behind the sternum and this is seen in few people. Finding of this requires it to be removed when there is a cancer.There are aggressive cancers that require chemotherapy and radiation after surgery.

If she has had the cancer for 2 years and has had 3 surgeries since then, it means her cancer is aggressive in spite of treatment and is infiltrating locally. There is no mention of any spread to other organs so I understand that the cancer is still contained within the intestine. People with cancer limited to local infiltration around the intestine have a higher rate of survival than those who have disease that has spread to other organs like liver and lungs.For local infiltration, the survival rate might be 2 to 5 years or more. For disease that has spread to liver and lungs the survival rate is 6 months to 18 months with treatment."},{"Patient":"The last two times I had surgery (both this year, both related to breast cancer) I woke up with \\"hysteria\\".

This sort of behavior is seen rarely in some patients after surgery and those coming out of anesthesia.Medical literature says that it is usually observed that the patient is anxious prior to the procedure and no history of hysterical behavior in the past.

In your case as  far as known to me may be due to,1 Hyper tension as you mentioned in your query that after  eat  of any thing abdomen become full and distends .I have seen in many cases where due to hyper tension patient feels fullness in epigastrium region ( as you  are complaining). Diagnosis can be confirmed by blood pressure examination by a physician , so get it  . 2 Hyper acidity ( gastritis ) , diagnosis can be confirmed by upper G I endoscopy . Try raising the head of your bed about 4 inches with blocks. It might also help to avoid eating or drinking 2 hours before you lie down. One should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them or spicy or greasy food . Also take some antacid ,if symptoms are severe then you may need proton pump inhibitor.3 As far as concerned about ovarian cysts , only they causes pain on both side in groin area. In my opinion above  mentioned reasons may be responsible so consult according to condition. Good luck.

This is usually caused by anxiety. It can also be caused due to the problem in the heart that your girlfriend has. Since you have not mentioned the heart problem in detail, it is possible that she has valve problem or rhythm related disturbances. Such conditions can cause palpitations in her.Since she is taking treatment for stage 2 leukemia, it is possible that her hemoglobin is less and she is also having anemia. That can cause palpitations also. It is unlikely that she is having palpitations in heart due to taking supplements as a treatment for leukemia. She can get help from doing mental relaxation exercises. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"hello, my name is Rania im from egypt i want to ask about im going to get married to some one, he told me thAT  he had cancer when he was 3 years old and he was taking hard treat ment for two years now he is ok but the doctors said that he can’t have any children and he had a test for that , but i want to ask is that only for not having children or we can have non-good children ?, and is he able to have sex normally or he also effected by this treat ment. thanks","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A person who has taken treatment for cancer at age 3 years and is now an adult is completely cured. There is no likelihood of cancer in him right now but complete details are required and if his doctors have told that he is free from cancer the he certainly has recovered.About having sex and children after taking treatment for childhood cancer, there are laboratory tests and scans to evaluate in detail. On having children, sperm analysis helps to know if an individual has chances of becoming a father. There are certain parameters in fertility standards where a man can have oligospermia meaning low sperm count or azoospermia meaning absence of sperms. If he is having oligospermia then he can have children after repeated efforts. If there is azoospermia then he might never be able to have children. Once the egg is fertilized by sperm the child developing is usually normal.Regarding the quality of sexual life, you can directly ask him if he can achieve a normal erection and orgasm by masturbation. If the answer is yes then he can have normal penetrative vaginal sexual intercourse. He can also take penile Doppler scan to confirm this medically and the results are reliable."},{"Patient":"Hi my husband is 35years old, 8 month ago was diagnost with an 8cm GBM Grade 4th; he has been treat with Radiotherapy and Temodal. The tumor is stabable, hasnt grow, but lately has started to show the initial symptoms convulsions and sleepyness our doctors only recomend to reduce de edema with manitol but it does look just like a provisional solution, what else should I ask our doctors to consider? Thanks Neurologist or Oncologist","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to hear the progress of disease in your husband. In my experience with patients of GBM IV a survival of 2 years without any serious consequences can be seen in about half of them. It is important to know the size, location and iff there is any pressure effect due to the tumor. Most tumors cause brain swelling or edema due to slightly increased electrical activity in the surrounding brain. This can be controlled by giving steroids and mannitol. The real problem is any change in appearance of the tumor and its pressure effect on adjacent structures. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and every tumor behaves in a different way. However we must fight cancer till the end. Praying for a quick recovery for your husband."},{"Patient":"hello sir my mother have brain cancer meddel part of the brain she is 52 year old in last moth she have problem of speach and her rihgt hand and leg are not working proparly so doctor sugges us to use rediation tretment b'coz he said that the surgery of that part is not possible so i want to ask that what is ur opinion?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Brain tumors are of many types and it is important to know which type of cancer is present as per CT scan or MRI scan done. The location and size of brain cancer is also important and helps to decide on treatment. It is easily approachable and the tumor can be operated then surgery is recommended followed by chemotherapy and radiation if required.Should the tumor be in an important area and involving the surrounding structures then radiation is the first choice of treatment. There are cancer that respond better to radiation and then chemotherapy can be given to stabilize the cancer.

Stage 4 cancer is when the growth is large and the cancer has spread to other organs like liver and lungs. Operating in such a situation will not help to control disease and might further reduce life of patient.Right now your mother first requires chemotherapy and radiation if recommended. Then she should get medications for her pain. It is possible that she will not be able to tolerate any thing given by mouth. If possible a stent like device might be placed in the cancer area but it is difficult to say if it will work unless complete details on exact location of cancer are available. If stent cannot be put then she has to take ryles tube feeding or total liquid diet.Radiation treatment might help and you can discuss this with your doctors.

She had tumorectomy and lumpectomy with 40 lymph nodes removed (after previous sentinel node biopsy) of which 37 resulted positive. I have never heard of so many positive lymph nodes.  She has been diagnosed with a 1.2 mm DCIS with a large radius of IDC. The tumor was really small, but it seems it has already  attacked the lymph nodes. The diagnose after surgery showed that MIB-1 was 10%, ER were 100% positive and the PR receptors were negative. The results for the Her-2 receptor are still unknown. The main diagnose was: breast cancer T1 N1 MX. The doctor told her she will have to undergo chemo, radio and hormonal therapy.All these results seem quite contradictory. On one hand she had a small cancer (T1), while on the other hand she had 37 positive lymph nodes (diagnosed as N1...which I do not understand).

We used to blame the tachycardia on my hyperhtyoidism but they believed it was very high for just being a thyroid issue.  They couldnt find any underlying issues and we cant blame it on my thyroid now.  They believe this lung tumor is either a carcinoma or a neuroendocrine tumor.  They are also checking for pituitary tumors.

Is it cancer?  what will they do with me next?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your symptoms might be related to the presence of a neuroendocrine lung tumor. These are tumors which secrete chemicals called neurotransmitters. This causes about 1 to 2 percent of lung cancers and can cause cardiovascular problems, mental confusion and increased heart rate.Your diagnosis needs to be confirmed at first. Confirmation requires doing additional tests. The basic test usually includes assessment of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in a 24 hour urine. This test can pick up a neuroendocrine tumor in 75 percent cases. If you are ordered this test then you must avoid eating tryptophan rich foods (chocolate, certain types of cheeses) for a couple of days before the test.There are other blood tests to be done if urine test is positive. This includes blood tests can be used including tests for 5 HIAA, chromogranin A, bradykinin, kallikrein, and substance P among others.

A brain hematoma is an area of bleed for which he had a surgery. It is important to know if the epilepsy and neoplastic lesion on MRI are in the same area as the hematoma or at a different location. Neoplasia is a general term used to describe a tumor. Complete review of his MRI is essential and that will tell the exact size of the tumor, location (?right posterior parietal region) and the pressure effect it is causing on the brain.An electroencephalogram can also be done to know what exactly caused his epilepsy.

Chemotherapy side effects are usually observed 3 to 4 weeks after treatment. Your father might be having the side effects of chemotherapy right now.

In India such non resolving cough is likely to be due to tuberculosis or cancer unless proven otherwise.The first step in evaluating such a condition is by doing a X ray chest and looking for any signs of disease. If there is any suspicious area then it requires that a CT scan of chest be done. This is a detailed investigation and shows problem areas which are small in detail.Any finding in X ray or CT scan should be evaluated further by doing tests like bronchoscopy or biopsy if required.Confirmation of diagnosis whether it is TB, cancer or any thing else is certain after doing a biopsy. Since you have got a biopsy done for your father, you have to wait for the report to know final diagnosis.Biopsy is a skilled technique and if the area of biopsy is small or the cells have not come properly then repeat test is required. Please get a X ray done if your father still complains of chest pain after the biopsy. Any complications of biopsy need to be ruled out.

Even though cervix biopsy rarely causes complications, it is not recommended that you should take chances.The pain in the gall bladder region can be evaluated by doing an ultrasound scan of your abdomen. This will show any pain causing condition in your gall bladder and abdomen.

Follicular lymphoma prognosis varies with the risk factors. The high risk factors are age above 60 years, stage III or IV disease, more than 4 groups of lymphnodes involved, blood hemoglobin less than 12 gram/ dl and raised serum LDH level. As you have at least 2 of the above therefore you are under intermediate risk.At intermediate risk, patients with follicular lymphoma under treatment might have 78 percent survival at 5 years and 51 percent survival at 10 years. Follicular lymphoma is a slow growing type of lymphoma which responds very well to treatment, but can rarely be cured. Despite the fact that it cannot be cured, the prognosis is generally very good and the median survival is about 8-15 years in many people who have it."},{"Patient":"i'm a 70 yr old woman with stage 3 breast cancer that has matastisized to 4 lymph nodes.  seriously, will chemo really help me - couldn't I live a better quality of life for a while without the treatment.  and by the way, I had a mamogram a year ago with no sign of cancer, so what's the deal with that.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a difficult condition and curability depends on the response to treatment. Sometimes one or more treatment methods have to be implemented to make sure that there is better survival. As you had no sign of cancer a year ago, the 4 lymphnodes might be a recent development and require immediate attention. It is best if you consult your treating oncologist and discuss the treatment in detail after a complete followup imaging. This might include chemotherapy with newer medication and that way your disease might be controlled. For widespread or significant lymph nodes radiation might also be indicated."},{"Patient":"My friend is in Bosnia-Herzegovina and scheduled to return to the U. S. in mid-July.

He must get a biopsy done to confirm the diagnosis. Following that if he is having stage I disease then he can be allowed to wait for about a couple of months. If he has disease stage II, III or IV then he must return back to his US doctor immediately and treatment started at once. Any cancer patient appears normal in the initial phase of cancer.

So you may feel a relief, but only temporarily.Upper middle abdominal pain, discomfort are most likely caused by stomach issues including stomach inflammation, peptic ulcer, Helicobacter Pylori infection. The pain is dull, usually appears after a meal. Nausea and vomiting can be present.If the pain is more on the left abdomen, and radiates to the back, gallstones can be the reason.I suggest you to find out the reason first, than choose correct treatment. Otherwise, medicines can delay the diagnose. You should have abdominal ultrasound and gastroscopy done. Stomach cancer should be always ruled out with such symptoms (gastroscopy will do it).In a meanwhile please avoid fatty foods, spicy foods, fried foods, coffee.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am 61 yr old female, diagnosed with peritoneal cancer, had total hysterectomy one year ago, followed by six months of chemo, now on Avastin for maintenance.

The normal cell is called well differentiated and regular. When there is cancer, the cells become less differentiated due to increased abnormal activity and is called poorly differentiated. This is a pathological observation and the real staging is by the appearance of the tumor, its measurement, spread to adjacent structures and involvement.Cancer is one of the conditions that requires a slightly long term treatment of months to years and in early stages it is curable in most patients. Please take things one step at a time and encourage your husband to fight his battle with cancer in the best way possible. Get him treated at a cancer hospital with specialist treatment options. He might require surgery, chemotherapy and radiation to control the disease. You have to be his constant support during his treatment and after that.

I was left with a tucked under scare and a resulting apron looking tummy.  I want to have a tummy tuck and lipo.  Is there any link between invasive trauma such as lipo and cancer recurrence?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Liposuction is a safe procedure that helps in taking out the excess body fat under medical supervision. It is involving the suction of fat from the upper layers of the body and does not involve fat inside the abdomen. If you have been treated for ovary cancer stage Ia and got operated then there is no increased risk of disease recurrence due to liposuction. You must continue to get regular health check done as in any other cancer patient. However liposuction will not cause any added risk to your disease recurrence.

In the initial stage, a cancer of endometrium can spread to the ovary and fallopian tube and therefore the doctor has recommended surgery. If she is in stage Ia or Ib then complete cure can be expected.After surgery, the uterus and ovary must be sent to pathology laboratory for confirmation of cancer and the type of disease. If the cancer is aggressive then she might require additional chemotherapy or radiation. Whether she requires more treatment or not, she must follow up with her doctor and get regular scan done for few months to make sure that the cancer is cured completely.

The liver contains small channels through which bile passes and then when the cancer starts infiltrating the area, the bile channels get blocked. This leads to impaired biliary drainage and exactly what has happened with your cousin. As far treatment is concerned, surgery has been done but there was infection in the area for which they have given medication.Regarding diet and food, it is best to give healthy food cooked at home. The food must cause the least stress on the liver. A low oil and non spicy diet is  suggested. You can give lots of fruits and boiled vegetables.

Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and we must fight it till the end. Pain relief is one of the pillars in cancer treatment. The main function in the living is breathing and feeding and if these two are taken care of then the patient can survive for some months. Since he has got a tracheostomy tube inside, his airway is no longer a problem as long it remains patent and free from infection. Feeding is taken care of by ryles tube feeding. If he is free from infection involving any major part of the body then he can survive for 2 to 6 months. However, if the tracheostomy opening is getting infected and if the infection has reached the lungs then survival beyond a month is tough. It is best to say good bye when he is still able to recognize his loved ones are there around him. Instead of saying good bye it will be better to just meet him and make him forget his pain for sometime.

The 5-year survival rate refers to the percentage of patients who live at least 5 years after their cancer is diagnosed. Of course, many people live much longer than 5 years (and many are cured).

The right management would be to report at an emergency room of a hospital, where they may admit him, and give intravenous antibiotics, IV fluids, and nil by mouth till it gets controlled and reduced. Sometimes, the response is not good enough, and emergency surgery might have to be performed with all its possible difficulties.Infrequently, the mass can be from other organs of the abdomen, like stomach, or retroperitoneal lymph nodes with super added infection, but all these can not be differentiated without clinical examination and so I would advise you take him to a surgeon for an opinion on the management.

About 58% of local recurrences manifest within 1 year, 83% within 3 years, and 95% within 5 years.Please consult your doctor at the earliest and take treatment should there be any recurrence. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi, My sister has been diagonised with stomach cancer stage 4. She under went 6 chemos but nothing worked. But the cancer did not spread anywhere. Now she has vomiting, yellow eyes and has been passing yellow urine. She is very tired. Is she nearing her end stages?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to hear the disease progression in your sister. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and we must fight it till the end.'A stage 4 stomach cancer can mean that the tumor is large in size and has spread to remote regions. This cannot be slowed down but I hope the doctors are doing their best to slow down the growth by giving 6 chemotherapy sessions and pain relievers.Vomiting and yellow eyes might happen due to obstruction to food material in the stomach due to the growth and spread of the tumor to the liver and gall bladder area. This can also happen as a side effect to chemotherapy. Please discuss the problem area with her doctor and this might require understanding her imaging scan and liver function test.If she is having side effect to chemotherapy and that is why the symptoms have occurred then it might subside with cessation of treatment. Complete blood tests are also important to know the general condition."},{"Patient":"A dark spot was found in my breast, with a ultra sound. They did a biopsy. Does that mean it's cancer, because the spot wasn't white? Age 42, 5ft. 3 in. 105 lbs. A spot was discover two years ago, and it was white and is ok. This is a new area that was found with ultra sound.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A spot in the breast that is totally black is most likely to be a cyst. In the ultrasound scan fluid appears black and fat appears white. I understand that the previous scan showed a white spot that was regular and might have been a benign finding. Regarding the recent black spot, it will help to know if the area is completely black or not, whether the shape is regular or not and if the margins are clear. If the black spot is completely black and has a well defined shape with regular margins then it is most likely a breast cyst. To confirm this finding it is best to do a FNAC test by inserting a needle under ultrasound guidance and taking out the fluid for study under a microscope Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"y I need your guidance and help as my mom was diagnosed with Mullerian cancer after which she was operated in Jan 2014. Along with her uterus the doctor removed her lymph nodes as well. After this she got 3 cycles of chemo followed by 15 cycle of Radiation. At this stage she has gone very weak and needs lot of care and attention. As per the CT scan it was found that she has Ascitis in her abdomen. The doctors have decided that she should go for a cycle of Chemo but seeing my mom s condition, her immunity is very low. I ready about B17 in your story. Could you please let me know more about this? If possible I can speak to you over phone if that s fine with you. Please help me at the earliest. Regards,","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your mother has got a debulking surgery done by removal of uterus and lymphnodes. Chemotherapy and radiation were given to stabilize the cancer. Laetrile (i.e. amygdalin or Vitamin B17) therapy is one of the most popular and best known alternative cancer treatments. It is very simple to use and is very effective if used in high enough doses and if the product is of high quality and if it is combined with an effective cancer diet and key supplements.Laetrile works by targeting and killing cancer cells and building the immune system to fend off future outbreaks of cancer. It uses two different methods for killing cancer cells. It involves a strict diet (as do all cancer treatments) and several supplements.Her ascites needs attention and B17 can be kept as a standby. This is to be discussed with her doctor and guarded chemotheraphy might be given and if she is unable to tolerate then it can be stopped."},{"Patient":"Mother has Pancreatic CA, stage 4, and it has reached the liver.

Has a blood clot near her aorta.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Having pancreas cancer stage 4 is a concern. The most important condition is right not to control clot formation and somehow prevent it from reaching the lung. I suppose the clot is in the IVC. Blood clot reducing medication might be required to be given under supervision of her doctor. This can be a risky case. Next comes the kidney function. Her blood urea and serum creatinine need to be kept under observation and if required dialysis is to be started. First peritoneal dialysis and then hemodialysis.Treating of the cancer is also important but for this her condition should be stable and fit to take treatment. Chemotherapy or focused radiation might help in increasing survival. Surgery is ruled out for pancreas cancer stage 4 because that will cause more spread of cancer by seeding and shorten the survival."},{"Patient":"My dad has hep c about 4 years ago he had varaces in his esophagus bust and he almost bleed to death. So niw 4 years later he has been diagnosed with throat cancer. The symptoms have been going on for months tho. His ent dr was saying he can t go through treatment because of his liver. They was going to put him to sleep to do a biopsy and while he would be asleep go ahead and do the breathing tube, he decided against it out is a risk to put him to sleep let alone cut on his throat and not be able to control the bleeding... to sum it up he won t eat cause it hurts he s lost like 30lbs in about 2 months. If they was to succeed in putting a breathing tube and a feeding tube in. What would his quality of life be and how long could he survive with no treatment","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to hear the disease progress in your father and praying for his recovery and pain free survival.Throat cancer needs to be staged first when deciding on treatment. There are 4 stages in any cancer and stages 1 and 2 are almost completely treatable. Stages 3 and 4 are difficult to treat. If he is unable to get a chemotherapy session, then he can go for radiation therapy. Radiation works wonders in prolonging the survival of a throat cancer patient. This will kill the cancer cells and any lymphnodes involved in the area of radiation.Chemotherapy might not help him much if his immunity is low but it can surely be tried. Surgery is a problem if he has bleeding tendency. You can discuss the possibility of giving him radiation and chemotherapy. The breathing tube and food tube are important to make sure he gets his nutrition and keeps his airway open. This are vital functions for his life. In this way a patient can survive for about 12 months to 2 years without any surgical treatment and if the tumor shows response then survival can be even longer."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctors! my brother 52 years old had been diagnosed with prostate cancer 4 weeks ago and had all tests done and MRI bone scan and was told it is inoperable and will have to have hormone replacement and radiation treatment and today was told he had two black sports on the hip bone and more MRI on Friday and the results next Thursday. He had been told he has type 2 diabetes and he is on blood pressure tablets for a very long time and also has high cholesterol and on tablets for that. His weight is around the 85 mark and is about 5.7 in height. Born in South Africa, Chinese mum and German dad and been living in Australia for 37 years. I would like to know what the outcome would be when the MRI is positive that the cancer had spread to the bone....how soon would they start the treatment and how severe will it be... He had previously done all test on his prostate and nothing showed up and suddenly when diabetes was detected he was sent for prostate cancer test. Please Advise... thanks Selinah.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Prostate cancer can spread to hip bones and lower back in many patients. Since they are evaluating disease spread, it is best to get the MRI done and then start with treatment within about 15 days. As stage 4 prostate is inoperable, it is best to give radiation and hormone replacement and guide treatment progress regularly. As he is diabetes, he should not get any infection during or after radiation treatment and care should be taken. The radiation treatment is usually given in fractions. It can be 15 days or 20 days with or without breaks. The cancer will be exposed to a medical dose of radiation each session over days. Most people do well after radiation treatment though his general health must be closely watched during and after radiation treatment. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello, my name is Mary.

Constant headaches, even light makes me sick, and I am losing clumps of hair on a regular basis. Could it be that I have some type of cancer?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to know proper details about cancer in your family and how many relatives had it. Pain in the legs and tiredness can be due to generalized weakness and anxiety. Cancer is not one condition but a group of many conditions involving uncontrolled proliferative cells in various organs. Your headache might also be due to anxiety.Highly suspicious common symptoms of cancer are a swelling that is painful or painless of recent appearance and growing fast, fever, loss of weight, generalized weakness, vomiting, blood in stools, sudden change in bowel habit.If you want to get peace of mind concerning you having cancer then please approach a cancer screening clinic at any cancer hospital and inform them about cancer history in your family and get the important relevant cancer screening tests done."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with Squamous cell carneinoma, ? stage 3, I am going to begin the second round of cemo July 2. How do I know if the treatment is working. The Doctor said I have 1 year maybe 2 to live. Will I know when it is time to contact Hospis or will I just stop breathing? My name is Zola.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a difficult disease to treat but many have survived even after having stage 3 squamous cell carcinoma and you should not give up. Praying to God for your quick recovery.Chemotherapy is a method used in treating cancer by infusion of medication that act only against cancer cells. This causes reduced growth and tumor volume. The best way to make sure that cancer treatment is working is by comparing CT scan of the region at the start of treatment and 3 to 6 months after treatment. This will tell the exact reduction in tumor volume and lymph nodes that are present in the cancer area. This is followed by most doctor and it can be used to guide treatment.Every cancer has a 5 year survival rate. In your case it does not mean that you will survive only for 2 years but the doctor means to say that with a tumor that you have, survival in some people is limited to around 2 years. I wish your tumor will respond to treatment and you will have a longer than expected disease free survival.

As described above, there is a dark area as seen on ultrasound at the 9 O clock position. This is marginally taller than wider if we take measurements as 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm. In some research studies, it has been found that 74 to 80 percent breast lesions which were taller are malignant. This way breast biopsy is the best confirmation and you have already got it done. By appearance, I will say that please do not worry as the lesion is slightly taller than wider and we can still hope for a benign finding. The final result is by biopsy.

Cancer is a difficult disease to treat and is based on individual patients following response to initial treatment. It will not be wrong to go for another round of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is not one single treatment, it is a combination of medications that are infused in to the system to cause the cancer process to slow down and control the proliferation of malignant cells. There might be other treatments available for your father but every method is not suitable for all patients and a review of his past and present medical records is necessary. There are treatments like transcatheter arterial chemo embolization, radiofrequency ablation, focused radiation among others.

It is possible that after removal of thyroid, the cells have persisted in adjacent tissues and multiplied with time. This has happened even after you have been given radiation treatment following surgery. It will help to review your scans and know the exact anatomical location of the hypopharynx mass and its relating to the post operative site. Any lymph node swelling also needs to be evaluated and treated.In your case it is more likely that the tumor in hypopharynx is part of the cancer process that started in the thyroid a year back and continues to infiltrate in to the surrounding structures. Please have a CT scan or MRI scan of your neck after discussing with your doctor and take more intensive treatment for the mass in hypopharynx."},{"Patient":"Hello, my brother was diagnosed today with hepatocellular carcinoma.

This condition is more common in those who have active alcohol intake or might be infected with Hepatits B or Hepatitis C. In my opinion, there is no direct negligence on part of the doctor but doing ultrasound scan of his abdomen at that time might have helped. Even if the hepatocellular cancer is most likely to be a recent development, any suspicious activity in the liver might have been known if this investigation was done earlier.It is not usual that all people with swollen feet have hepatocellular cancer but swelling in feet can be due to problems involving liver, kidney, heart or thyroid and other conditions. It will help to know the size of the hepatocellular cancer right now and then seek the right treatment at a cancer hospital in your area. Early stages of cancer can be treated by surgery and intensive chemotherapy. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have lipomass spreading in my arms legs and belly.

On clinical examination they slip under the skin. Neurofibromas are nerve related tumors and appear at many placer all over the body. Since they are related to nerves, these tumors can get painful.It will help to do ultrasound scan on the swellings which have now become painful and to know their nature. Please consult a surgeon and get clinically examined to make diagnosis. A needle testing called FNAC might be required to study the cells in the swelling. Some of the neurofibromas trap the nerves and then this causes pain. Severe pain requires the neurofibroma to be removed and the pressure over the nerve released by doing a surgery.

However there are methods to take care of your fertility before starting chemotherapy and radiation. This can be done by taking the services of a fertility clinic and getting your eggs removed and stored at cold temperatures in the cryogenic laboratory. When you wish to have babies, the egg can be fertilized with sperm from your partner and then the embryo can be implanted in to your uterus. This technique is offered by many fertility clinics and will work best for you.

Thanks for your attention!","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMThe reason for your hair fall may not be the removal of your bladder but could be something else, you have not mentioned your age and gender here, this was very necessary here because hair fall highly related with age and gender, like if you are male and above 30 years then this could be Male-Patron-Baldness, hope this information helps, take care."},{"Patient":"my bood work showed a 1 pt. increase in my potasium levels.

She has various symptoms which seem associated with the cancer, most notably difficulty swallowing (liquids, not solids). However her difficulty breathing has seemed to worsen since she started taking Xalkori. I have read that is a possible side effect (albeit rare) of Xalkori. At what point is the difficulty breathing associated with the cancer, vs. a side effect of the drug? The website makes it sound like I should contact my healthcare provider immediately. It s not like she s gasping for air, but it does seem worse (wasn t really a symptom before). How concerned should we be? Thanks.","Doctor":"hi,am very sorry for your mothers problem..does she run fevers?yes crizotinib(xalkori) can cause breathing problems..it can be due to drug induced pneumonitis..as it is a common side effect you cant avid it..approach you doctor if she ihas moderate to severe breathing problem..its no wrong if you can bring this to the notice of your doctor now (if possible)hope my answer helped youif you have any more queries i would be happy to help you.."},{"Patient":"HI, I have been having mid abdominal left side pain  it started off only with a stabbing pain when i bent over and now it has been a constant stabbing and very uncomfortable feeling, some swelling has occurred. upward motion bothers it the most like sitting, bending over, wearing a belt and getting in my truck. I have had a CT of the upper abdominal done a week ago.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query to H.C.M. Forum. If I were your treating doctor for  this case of  severe pain on the left side of abdomen , I would come up with these  possibilities , these includes as, 1 The first possibility is  of pancreatitis as it may cause upper left abdominal pain which is worse when bending over or sitting. Pancreatic enzyme like serum amylase & lipase should be measured to rule out any pancreatic  cause. 2 May be due to kidney stone which may  present such sharp pain ( however in some case this type of pain radiates  to back) . For this purpose you need to get an ultrasound abdomen and kidney area. 3 Least possibilities may be acute gastritis and for this get in upper G I endoscopy . Avoid fried food , spicy food  , junk food , alcohol . . I suggest you to consult a physician and get his opinion and treatment .Good luck.
