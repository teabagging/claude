Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

As an Expert I understood exactly what happened, after an extraction we warn the patient of not rinsing vigorously only warm saline gargle as softly as possible after 24 hrs . If this is not follows the clott at the extraction site dislodges exposing the bones , day to day food acumulations also adds up leading to the level of pain you are under . So your Dentist to heal the socket places a gauge with medication which is not ment to be taken out by you . As its heling the wound healing and will eventually reduce the pain and also donot allow food particle to accumulate at the extraction Site. The smeel can be too annowing as one can be deeply iritated by it , due ti clove oil it might feel burning sensation too . But donot worry that will fade off as soons as the extra medicament which might got rubbes on your gums gets risned out( do it slowly or you might disloage the gauze too thats not good ) .

I have seen your attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The condition looks like poison ivy. There are few blisters evolving, it may go on for one to two weeks without treatment. Poison ivy usually requires oral Prednisone to keep it under control. Another possibility is, herpes zoster - the reactivation of varicella virus presenting with blisters in a group with areas of redness. I am unable to make out with these pictures if the rash is on both your thighs or if it is only on one thigh. If it is only one thigh, with burning sensation and pain, it favors herpes zoster which needs to be treated early with oral antivirals (Valacyclovir). In both cases, I would suggest you visit your doctor as soon as possible. To keep itching under control, topical Calamine lotion with aloe and oral antihistamines like Zyrtec (Cetirizine) will be helpful.

She was treated for the flu, so the fever went away on the fifth day, but she had a very noticeable swelling around the left clavicular area. Her blood work showed normal WBC, but with a differential lymphocytes of 7.4 %. She was sent for a CT scan of the chest where the swelling was, which showed possible injury or trauma. She had not been injured or struck, but she did have a chair massage the day before her fever started. After the CT scan, she had a chest MRI with contrast, and the area showed chest muscle infection and no indication of swollen lymph nodes. Since then, she has had no fever, however very limited mobility in left arm making it difficult even to dress. The swelling is still there, and you can see it spasm or tighten upon performing any activity with the left arm. What is this? She currently takes Topamax, Prednisone, and Bactrim medicines.","Doctor":"Hello. For further queries consult an internal medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been very worried about my health lately. I would like to preface this by saying that I have been experiencing anxiety off late and I have a suspicion that some of these symptoms could be related to that. I am currently weaning off of Prednisone, which I have been taking for an allergic reaction. I have noticed slight depression and a lot of fatigue as a result. I also quit using smokeless tobacco about 10 days ago, after about nine years of use. I am currently using nicotine patches but, they are very low dose compared to what I was used to. The patches are about 10 mg of nicotine per day. Also, one last thing, about three months ago, my doctor put me on Zantac 150 for acid reflux. I also had an EKG, chest x-rays, and blood tests and everything came back normal. I am not sure if all of this matters but, I just want to be thorough. Now, over to my main concern. I randomly had an allergic reaction to Advil about a month ago. I had swollen lips and hives. So, my doctor put me on 50 mg Prednisone for five days. This, along with my recent acid reflux diagnosis, had really started to give me anxiety about my health. A few days after I finished the Prednisone, I had a very strange experience in which both of my lips went completely numb. I immediately went to an urgent care center for treatment. The doctor thought that it could be related to the previous allergic reaction and put me back on Prednisone, but this time on a taper such as 60 mg for three days, 40 mg for three days, and 20 mg for three days. The lip numbness faded and only lasted for an hour or two. At this point, I had become very stressed and started wondering if the lip numbness could be related to oral cancer due to my smokeless tobacco use. So the next day, I went to the dentist to get a checkup and an exam. He checked my lymph nodes in the neck area and inspected the insides of my mouth. There were no white patches or lesions or sores or any visual sign of oral cancer. Through all of this, I had still been experiencing the tingling in the lips which kept me worried. It only happens occasionally and never lasts, which made me think that it could be anxiety. Then, about three days ago I noticed that I would randomly get a feeling of a lump in my throat, which I know can be caused by many things including acid reflux but, oral cancer is also one of them and this made me even more worried. This only lasts for a few hours each time and goes away. In fact I have only noticed it twice. I tend to take a Zantac 150 when I feel it. What is currently causing me worry is a constant tingling under my chin, in the area in the front of my neck. It is not painful but it is rather uncomfortable. It feels like someone is constantly lightly rubbing a feather against my neck. I am constantly checking my lymph nodes as I am paranoid at this point but, there is no visual sign of swelling. Can this be caused by stress or anxiety? I will say that my mind has been absolutely consumed by the thought of oral cancer over the last couple of weeks. I feel like I may be over-thinking things and causing myself a tremendous amount of stress and anxiety. I have a history of panic attacks and anxiety, although I have never been on medication for it. I do not have any pain in my tooth, mouth, or jaw otherwise. I also recently sent an image of the floor of my mouth to an oral surgeon here because I was paranoid and thought it was whiter than usual, but she said that it was absolutely fine. Sorry for the long question. I guess I just really want to know if these symptoms I am feeling are something real or just anxiety. As I said, I have been healthy my whole life and these recent problems have been very stressful for me. I would hate to keep bothering my doctors for something that is not even there.

It is a well-known fact that Prednisone causes insomnia, but it is not permanent. It may take a few days to return to a normal sleep pattern as the sleep cycle is disturbed.

Make sure you drink at least 3-4litres of water. Excessive urine while drinking plenty of water will flush out the infection from the body. Regarding your urine culture, it would be advisable to check if you had given the sample prior to starting the antibiotics course, as once you start the antibiotics and then submit the sample it may not show any bacterial growth on culture , plus you are likely to develop Antibiotics resistance infection because of inappropriate antibiotics.

Is he worried about his mother's health? Have you spoken to the young boy's parents about his recent fear of dark and anxiety sleeping alone? You can try some strategies to alleviate his fear to an extent. 1) You can leave a small light switched on his bedroom or leave his door slightly open with the light switched on in the corridor. 2) Read some gentle bedtime stories. Perhaps a bit more time can be spent than usual for a few weeks to allow him to settle back to normal. 3) Avoid watching TV or computer atleast an hour before bedtime. 4) Stick to the usual sleep routine. Boundaries need to be firm regarding bedtime. 5) Encourage him to lots of play activities during the day and let him have fun with his peers. 6) He can take a comfort toy and object to his bed with him to contain his anxiety.

I have irregular periods from five years.

In these two months periods are regular. Last month I used only Ovacet tablets I missed period in this month I have white discharge and back pain. The pregnancy test was negative. I am married since two years. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Patients with PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease) are advised low dose hormones for regularisation of cycles. In your case, you were given estrogen (Ovacet) and progesterone (Regestron) to be eaten separately. Ovacet forms endometrium and progesterone matures it into secretory phase so that on stoppage on 25 th day, the next five days you may have your menses. Now, this cycle you took only ovacet so only proliferative endometrium is formed, and if you are continuing ovacet even presently then in a few days, you may have some breakthrough bleeding but not what you can say menses. This missed period is because of not taking Regestron. A pregnancy test is negative, so not to worry. Start your Regestron from today for the next 10 days and wait for periods after that in the next seven days. Another advice instead of using the hormones separately, please use tablet Ginette one od (once a day for 28 days). For six months in toto for PCOD. Maintain a menstrual calendar as well for these six months. Lose some weight. Drink plenty of water. Ginette offers better compliance and better cycle control. So rest assured you are not pregnant.

I wore the retainer for five years every night, and then I reduced it to one night per month after that, as instructed. My front four teeth shifted a lot (they are crowded, so it was a quite visible shift, some were pushed out, and some pushed back). The retainer could make a big difference in one night when I wore it, but I was advised to get a completely new brace. So a few days ago, I got a lingual brace on the front teeth (the social six). My concern now is the speed of shifting. A couple of hours after getting the braces, my teeth were significantly straighter (1 to 2 mm difference). A day after they look almost perfect, I was told I would be wearing the braces for six months to a year. How is such a drastic change possible so quickly, and is it healthy or normal? It hurts always, but it is not unbearable. And could I have used a new retainer instead of getting new braces then? I hope you can help with my worries.","Doctor":"Hello. All the movement and everything depends on the bone density in your oral cavity so no issues if it is going faster, it is a good sign that it is showing you benefits so soon. And braces and retainers each have their course of works so you should not be regretting on putting braces, there might be some issues your dentist would have observed through X-ray that is why she or he felt the need for braces. If you have been told six months, does not mean six months always, if there will be good results, it might be reduced to four to five months even.

I have injured my left shoulder three times in horse riding accidents over the years but never got it checked. I then recently carried a heavy bag with the arm hanging down for roughly 10 minutes, four times over a few hours. The next day I had severe general pain in the back of the shoulder or scapular but had full and no more pain in moving shoulder. General pain increased after use of the arm though. Pain gets worse at night. I also have a tingling sensation down the back of the tricep, from the armpit to elbow and one spot roughly above the radial nerve when using the arm. X-rays have been taken. I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow, but I have copies of the x-rays. They appear to show an AC separation with posterior displacement of clavicle. Can you tell me if I may be correct from the scans? And, is it possible that I had previously injured the AC joint, but the bag carrying tore the ligaments?","Doctor":"Hello. I will answer your last question first, the answer is no. You can strain your ligaments but cannot tear them by carrying heavy loads unless you have strained a poorly healed torn ligament. Unlikely if you had no deformity to start within the shoulder and no immediate pain after carrying loads. The issue of posterior displacement of the A/C joint can only be confirmed on an MRI or a CT scan as the plane of the movement is challenging to assess on the X-ray films. Tingling sensation at the back of the arm points towards a neck problem while night time symptoms look to shoulder pathology. You should have the answers following the review by an orthopedic surgeon. You could upload your films for better treatment."},{"Patient":"I am observing viginal burning and not regular but white discharge also.

Here are my questions and concerns, 1) Is the progressive tightening always a sign of BXO (lichen sclerosus). 2) If the opening is only about 4 mm and I went for an initial visit to a urologist, how would they visualize the glans for any suspect lesions? 3) If I wanted to confirm the health of my foreskin and glans (especially the presence of BXO or cancer), how can the urologist carry out his tests such as visualizations under the foreskin and taking biopsies without performing a circumcision? 4) While I know that BXO is a risk factor for penile cancer, I would like to get an idea of my risk in terms of numbers if possible. Is it possible that my BXO if present could have turned to penile cancer without me exhibiting symptoms? The only symptoms I usually feel are the foreskin tightening even in the absence of stretching it and occasional frenulum pain. 5) When I roll back my foreskin, the part behind the opening looks lighted (I have attached image). Could this be an indication of lichen sclerosus?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your case, and the following are my pointwise answers. 1. The progressive tightening foreskin is not always suggestive of BXO. Instead, gradual tightening is an age-related process when a male does not retract foreskin often and clean the undersurface. 2. Proper inspection of the suspect lesion is only possible after adequate circumcision. Hence the first step in such cases is circumcision. 3. As I pointed out before, the histopathological examination of circumcised skin is the only evidence to prove or disprove BXO. Any other method is incomplete and inconclusive. 4. Though BXO is a risk factor for penile cancer, the occasional pain and tightening on its own does not amount to cancer. However, his to pathology is the only proof for definitive diagnosis. 5. As you have phimosis, you are unable to pull back foreskin completely. Hence, the undersurface of the foreskin is not visible. However, the discoloration and fissuring are indications of BXO, though it needs to be confirmed histopathologically. I hope I have answered all your queries."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having pain in the right lower abdomen for a week. Ultrasound suggests subacute appendicitis. CBC, LFT, and KFT are normal. I do not have a fever. What are the treatment options? Is surgery necessary? Can this be treated with medicine only? Currently taking Oflox 200 twice a day. Will Oflox 200 cure this? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello.  Subacute appendicitis is the inflammation of the appendix. The usual treatment is surgery after a course of antibiotics. The best judge of this is a surgeon who has examined you as clinical signs of local guarding and peritonitis are of utmost importance for the timing of surgery. Treating only with antibiotics gives a possibility of not recurrent symptoms. Untreated appendicitis and partially treated also has its complications. So my opinion would be to be in touch with your doctor who can examine you to see signs."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have chronic neck and back pain that can cause either severe neck stiffness or sharp pain. Most of the pain seems to originate in the front of the neck (SCM muscle) or the cervical spine area. Pain radiates to mid-back and causes spasms of my shoulder blades. Lots of popping when turning my head. This also flares up every couple or few months to the point of being unbearable and requiring a visit to urgent care. Lots of other symptoms some of which include, profuse night sweats, sweating during the day for no reason (profuse), weakness in shoulders and arms (very hard to play tennis anymore), occasional stiffness in ribs, tightness in chest, jaw pain and weakness, forehead numbness, random movement of limbs during day but usually at night (kind of like little seizures but has not been diagnosed) and general neck swelling (neck looks big). I know it is a lot of symptoms, but it is so frustrating. I have a copy of a cervical MRI with me. Curious to know if these symptoms stand out as anything in particular. Working with doctor's now, but I am mentally and emotionally drained as I have been dealing with this for years with no answer, and it is difficult for the family to understand. Being an athlete could not compete in college anymore due to this. My body could not perform anymore.","Doctor":"Hello. I have studied your case. Due to compression of this nerve root, there can be a sharp pain in your arm and back with a shoulder. I will advise you to send your MRI cervical spine for better diagnosis. For these symptoms, analgesic and neurotropic medication can be started. Till the time, avoid lifting weights, Sit with support to the back. You can consult a physiotherapist for help. Physiotherapy like ultrasound and interferential therapy will give quick relief. I will advise checking your vitamin B12 and vitamin D3 level. Shoulder symptoms can be due to rotator cuff injury or arthropathy. If required MRI shoulder may help in diagnosis. I hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries, then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is this something I should worry about? I have been hypothyroid for 25 years and have recently gained about 25 lbs.

About two weeks ago, I was sitting in class, and I started having these excruciating stomach spasms. It was not an out of the blue thing because I had been having issues concerning my abdomen for about three months before this incident in class. The pain was so bad I had my mom pick me up from school and take me to the doctor.My mom explained that my sisters and I have been under a lot of stress-causing indigestion issues. My older sister was diagnosed with IBS about two weeks before this visit. The doctor prescribed Hyoscyamine, and I have been taking that every four hours, and it has not helped at all. The doctor also took blood and urine tests and discovered I had a blood glucose level of 111 and had a high level of carbon dioxide.This is almost five months of feeling completely awful. This past week I got a cold on top of what I assume to be prediabetes and IBS. My question is, do you think my prediabetes symptoms are caused by IBS or do you think I maybe do not have IBS at all and the symptoms are due to prediabetes?","Doctor":"Hello.  The IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) has a familial association, and it usually causes pain in the left side of the abdomen and sometimes in the epigastrium with dyspeptic symptoms. The diagnosis of IBS does not doubt in your case. The blood glucose of 111 is average. We need blood pH, not the CO2 for this conclusion. I need more information regarding your diabetic query, is there is a family history of diabetes? Frequent urination? Rapid breathing? And you must have other investigations done if you attach that it could be beneficial to conclude. So the crux is, there is no doubt regarding the diagnosis of IBS. For IBS, we give a high fiber diet and methylcellulose to regularise the bowel habits. In case somebody does not respond to this and have vomiting or headache, then we provide other medicines but not Hyoscyamine. Follow, 1. Methylcellulose three spoons two times a day in 200 ml water or milk, continue it. 2. High fiber diet, at least seven-liter water in a day. 3. Do not sit in the toilet for more than five minutes. 4.

The common complications are viral pneumonia (self-limiting), and another one is croup. The second one is having problems and characterized by a sick looking child and barking cough. If your child is not sick looking and breathing is normal and no fever, you need to apply nasaoclear drops in the nose every two hourly along with cough syrup (one teaspoon three times a day).

I have the symptoms of 1. Nasal congestion. 2. Pressure or plugged ears. 3. Pain in the right side of the face.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome in icliniq.com. About your query having a chain of symptoms for cold to sinusitis is correct, and here I would like to tell you the underlying pathology in this development is as under. Initially, the patient develops cold that may be allergic or infective. If anyhow cold gets prolonged, the nearby sinuses start developing an infection due to loss of ciliary movement of their lining mucosa. In this way, sinusitis develops, as soon as sinusitis appears, which in turn secretes mucus that remains collected in the sinus cavity, and the patient feels heaviness in the head and later headache. The collection of sinuses than move to the nasal cavity and move posteriorly to the throat that is named as postnasal drip. By this drip, soreness appears in the throat and from here (throat) there is a tubular connection to the middle ear (eustachian tube) which gives way the infection to reach to the middle ear and at this stage patient feels clogged ear. Similarly in treatment 1. Treat the infection of nose and sinus (by suitable antibiotic). 2. Liquefy the collected fluid (by steam inhalation). 3. Treat the swelling of inflammation by anti-inflammatory drugs to restore the ciliary movement of cilia of lining mucosa. I hope your query is answered, but if still, anything is not clear, please free to re-consult us."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I went to do a blood test as part of imitating a weight loss program, but I have some elevated GGT, alkaline phosphate, etc., so need some clarification about it.","Doctor":"Hello.

I feel like I have a beast inside my mind to which I have to fight to make myself in a normal state.

I have seen people with severe depression, where it is difficult to get out of bed also a difficult task. This is not for me. At least I can talk to people, and I go to work every day. For me to feel better, I have to sleep or distract myself with songs. I thought it might be bipolar, but I am not sure.

I have worked through your attached query in detail. As per your symptoms, you possibly seem to have subsyndromal depression otherwise called as dysthymia. If it is not treated on time, it may convert into depression. (Please note mild, moderate and severe are grades of depression but not dysthymia).

We both have the same type of herpes, but my partner only experienced oral herpes before, and I have genital herpes. Can someone who already had oral herpes develop genital herpes themselves? Or does herpes only occur at the place of infection? I want to know how high the risk is of me infecting my partner genetically (same type) when I am not showing any symptoms.","Doctor":"Hello. Genital herpes can be transmitted to your partner sexually because it is an STD (sexually transmitted disease), whereas herpes simplex (HSV-1) can be transferred from one person to another via infected oral secretions while in close contact. But at times, there is a possibility of getting genital ulcers when you are infected with HSV-1. Hence, I would advise you to undergo lab test to know if you are infected with the virus or not. And if you are positive for HSV, then you will require Acyclovir, which is an antiviral medicine. Till then, I would advise you to take preventive measures to avoid transmission to other partners.

I received a kidney transplant 16 years ago. I am in a very good health, and I had no bouts of rejection. I eat well and exercise. I just started a new job in another city, so I had to move. Two months back, everyone in the office seemed to be sick, and they had lots of coughing. So, when I noticed a swollen left tonsil approximately a month ago, I was surprised as I had never experienced this in 46 years, but yet with everyone seemingly sick, I was not terribly surprised. I did not feel much discomfort the first week, and I felt like I had a cold. So, I went to a walk-in clinic. The doctor swabbed my throat, but I had no strep infection. So, no antibiotics were given. The doctor told me to gargle with salt water. Approximately a week later, I woke up in the middle of the night, and my throat was very sore. I also was starting to feel unwell and believed I was starting to get a bad sinus infection. I have had several since my transplant, but not recently within the past year or two. Post-nasal drip has been excessive along with general malaise and extreme fatigue. This has been the sickest I have been since pre-transplant 16 years ago. I went back to the walk-in clinic. The doctor prescribed Clindamycin for 10 days at 300 mg. He also sent me for a throat ultrasound due to enlarged submaxillary glands to see if there was an abscess. The medication made me sick at first and a bit of facial swelling, but after 2 to 3 days, my body got used to it, and it seemed to start helping. I was very sick overall for about a week and then started to feel back to normal including energy and no more malaise. The sore throat seemed to dissipate. However, my left tonsil was still swollen. I started to experience blood in my phlegm first thing in the morning when I would clear my throat and only in the morning. My ultrasound came back normal. I finished the 10-day course of antibiotics. My throat started to become sore again, only on the left side. It has been over a month, and it is still swollen. So, I went back to the walk-in clinic, and this time the doctor prescribed Azithromycin 250. Again, I gargled with warm salt water. And I just started the new antibiotics. But, I still do not feel better. I have never had a swollen tonsil in my 46 years nor am I one to deal with a sore throat for any more than a day or two, and I am now going on at least 2.5 weeks, I feel it every time I swallow and yet eating does not bother me. I have ingested more throat lozenges, popsicles, and gargled to no avail. I am becoming frustrated and concerned at the same time. Please help. Two years ago, I developed vertigo suddenly when on vacation. I had extreme allergy attack with a choking post-nasal drip at night. I never had allergies before. The doctor at that time said it was a bad year for non-allergy sufferers and worse for those with allergies already. I was prescribed nasal steroids.","Doctor":"Hi. Enlargement of tonsil on one side is not usually a good sign. Infectious or inflammatory causes usually cause enlargement on both sides. The constant post-nasal drip points to some cause in the sinuses. Constant post-nasal drip can act as a cause for enlargement of tonsils, like in your case. To know more about the tonsillar swelling, I suggest you get a CT scan of the head and neck. I want to rule out any pathology in the sinuses, as well as clearly delineate the extent of the tonsil swelling. Until then, I suggest using Benzydamine mouth gargle, especially after meals rather than plain warm saline gargles for the throat infection. I suggest you also take an antacid medication, Pantoprazole 40 mg, twice daily before food. This will prevent any acidic irritation of the throat mucosa. Secondly, I would suggest some anti-inflammatory medicines like Trypsin and Chymotrypsin tablets to remove the swelling. But, you must check with your doctor if they can be administered to you since you have had a kidney transplant. Meanwhile, the pain can be kept in check by using Tylenol (Acetaminophen), once or twice a day. I would like to see a picture of your throat. If you can click one with open mouth showing details about the tonsils, posterior pharyngeal wall, and the oropharynx, it will be helpful for us to see the swollen tonsil. In renal transplant patients, we encounter fungal infections more. So, I want to rule that out in you. Do revert with the necessary details.

And every time I have to poop or wipe it, it is very painful. It is very uncomfortable when I sit or lay on my butt.","Doctor":"Hello. There might be a small tear in the anal region, which is commonly called as an anal fissure. Even a small fissure can be really painful as it causes a spasm of the anal opening. It heals slowly, as it gets irritated repeatedly during the bowel movement. You might even notice blood on the toilet paper or in the stools. I suggest you get examined by a physician. Warm water sitz bath, which involves sitting in a tub warm of water, to soak the painful anal area, helps a lot in this condition. The other recommendation is to take a high fiber diet. Your physician, after an examination, can prescribe you analgesics and a stool softener. Hold off on more anal sex until you recover from the current problem. Hope your query is answered.

If your family members or room partner complain of snoring while you sleep then, this could be the reason for your symptoms. Another condition that presents with hypersomnia is depression.

I suspect I may have a parathyroid disorder. About two years ago, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. Doctor did blood work and also told me Vitamin D was very low. He prescribed high dose Vitamin D. I suffered from my first battle with kidney stone about a month after the Vitamin D was started. I have terrible pain that feels like my bones in my thighs and behind my shins. My joints in my hands hurt so bad I cannot grip things. I had gastric bypass before six years and since have lost 135 lbs. My symptoms have only gotten worse since then. I always thought I had fibromyalgia, but the medication has never helped me. I suffer from chronic migraines which my neurologist has me on Botox every quarter. I am deeply depressed because I was always in terrible pain. The ER is starting to think I am a drug addict and need to see if it is something else other than fibro that is causing my pain.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to icliniq.com. Your symptoms of fibromyalgia can be explained by Vitamin D deficiency. Now why vitamin D deficiency is there has to be evaluated. There are many causes of Vitamin D deficiency, and yes, hyperparathyroidism is one of the reason. But the prevalence of hyperparathyroidism is less. The other causes of Vitamin deficiency are the low intake of Vitamin D rich food, less exposure to sunlight. Also, your Roux-en-Y gastric bypass decreases Vitamin D absorption from food. So presently, I do not consider parathyroid as the cause of your problem.  Coming to your kidney stones was any urine analysis done to find out what kind of stone you had? Because the intake of Vitamin D increases absorption of calcium from the gut and high calcium can cause kidney stones. Also, because of your Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, there can happen increased absorption of oxalates which can cause kidney stones. So it is essential to know what tests were done for kidney stones.  Till then continue your Vitamin D supplementation, get serum uric acid, serum PTH, 24-hour urinary calcium, and oxalate tests done and revert. You can start Gabapentin for your pains. Any clarifications feel free to ask."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Two years ago, I had a problem with one of my wisdom teeth.

I have now been told to drop it back to 30 mg a day. I also have been taking Xanor 0.25 mg for past six months. For the first two weeks, I took two tablets a day then was told to increase to three tablets a day which I did for two weeks. Now the doctor says to drop down to 1.5 tablets a day (in two daily doses). My question is that is it smart or safe to drop both of these medications down at the same time? I have had bad insomnia with anxiety. Was given Melatonin 2 mg yesterday to take at night.","Doctor":"Hello. If he is asking to reduce the doses, then no need to get worried. Mirtazapine has different actions and is a different drug than Xanor (Alprazolam). No need to get worried about that. Even Mirtazapine is a unique drug which has great effects on sleep at 15 to 30 mg doses compared to high doses. So reducing the doses of both drugs simultaneously will not cause any serious effects on you. A slight reduction of sleep due to reduced doses of Xanor will be compensated by melatonin. Melatonin is a drug that has no abuse potential and is safer than Xanor. For more information consult a psychiatrist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 23 years old.

I do not take any Alprazolam or any other benzodiazepines during the day. Also, I started taking Alprazolam about 6-8 months ago. Originally this was for a short period of insomnia due to a life situation where I was so worried about life that I could not sleep. The situation has long passed, and everything is fine now. I would like to slowly wean completely off of the Alprazolam so that. I no longer will take it. I am also being treated for bipolar depression, and I no longer feel depressed at all. But somehow, other benzodiazepines with longer half-lives such as Diazepam, Clonazepam and Clorazepate make me feel quite depressed within an hour or so of taking them. Actually pretty much any benzodiazepine besides Alprazolam makes me feel depressed. So, it seems like I have to wean off of the Alparazolam without substituting longer-acting benzodiazepines. I will go from 1.5mg to 1.25mg for a couple of weeks, then down to 1mg, then 0.75mg, etc., until I am not taking any anymore. At any rate, I am not sure if I am having interdose withdrawal symptoms during the day. I do not think I feel \\"anxious,\\" though I am not sure exactly what \\"anxious\\" means, to be honest, even though it is such a common term. I know I do not really spend much time worrying. I generally feel calm and at ease in life and about life. There is really nothing to worry about life because everything is going well for me. But perhaps I *would* be feeling more interdose withdrawal-related anxiety were it not for the antipsychotics and antidepressants I am taking. Perhaps they're ameliorating the anxiety that would have been there during the day between my evening alprazolam doses. But I have noticed lately that I am somehow a bit emotionally labile, at least when it comes to dealing with situations with my girlfriend. It is like she does something little that upsets me, something which I would ordinarily perhaps feel a bit poorly about or get a bit emotionally stirred, and ordinarily we would potentially have a conversation about it to solve this issue, or perhaps we wouldd get into a small fight or something. But lately when something happens which upsets me, it really, really upsets me. I can get easily angered or have some other odd negative emotional reactions. I wonder if this is a problem of interdose withdrawal from Alprazolam? It is possible, too, that it is just a development in my psyche, some kind of psychological problem only manifesting recently. But I wonder if it is possible, too, that I am having this experience as a withdrawal symptom between bedtime doses of Alprazolam. I can be in a perfectly good mood, or in a great mood, or in a normal mood, and one little thing happens with my girlfriend and everything is terrible all of a sudden, I feel terrible and I end up making her feel terrible. Have you heard of anything like this in terms of emotional lability/reactivity or anger or irritability something like that as a result of benzodiazepine withdrawal? Also, if I wanted to test this idea out and divide my bedtime alprazolam dose into, for example, three doses of 0.5mg each, is it possible that I experience insomnia as a nighttime withdrawal symptom? What I mean is that I only had insomnia for a short period due to some anxiety in my life, but that anxiety is over. But now, if I forget to take my 1.5mg alprazolam at nighttime, while I do no start worrying about anything, I just cannot fall asleep. And oddly, if I do start to fall asleep, I am suddenly sort of shocked/jolted back into being awake. This is not the type of insomnia I was being treated for where I just could not sleep because of worrying. I no longer worry or have much to worry about, and I think if I were not dependent on the Alprazolam, I would be sleeping just fine without it. I might be having trouble making this subtle point: It is that while I cannot sleep without my 1.5mg bedtime dose, I do no think it is due to an underlying insomnia, but rather a result of my being dependent on the Alprazolam for sleep after all these months. Is this is possible because of 6-8 months of use? And especially is the feeling of the insomnia is super different than how it was before. Before I just worried and could not sleep, but now there is no worry, I just feel awake in an odd way and cannot sleep, or if not, then I half fall asleep and suddenly startlingly awaken before I am fully asleep. So, now I am thinking of spreading my dose out, and instead of 1.5mg at night, maybe I would take 0.5mg in the morning, 0.5mg sometime later in the day, and 0.5mg before bed. If it is the case that I am experiencing insomnia as a consequence of my dependence on the drug, then would it be probable that I experience the same \\"rebound insomnia\\" (or whatever it is called) when I spread out the drug? That is, when I spread it out throughout the day and night, should the level of the drug in my blood be enough at nighttime that I do not experience this rebound insomnia? So that if there is some kind of insomnia at nighttime (during this experiment), it is not because of my Alprazolam dependence but rather due to an underlying insomnia? I wonder because I would not want to try this if you think it is probable that I would still have this rebound insomnia. I would only do it if the idea of it makes some sense to you. That is because I am only prescribed enough for 1.5mg per day, and the doctor is not willing to give me some extra during this period, so I have to be careful not to waste any if at all possible so that I'm not missing nights of sleep. Of course, if there's no way to know unless I try it, then I'll try it. But I would only stay away from the experiment if you think it does not make sense. So, if my brain is used to having 1.5mg at bedtime, then even if I took 0.5mg in the morning and 0.5mg in the afternoon, would I still need a whole 1.5mg at bedtime even though I already took 0.5mg morning and 0.5mg afternoon? Would my brain expect the whole amount at night because that is what it is used to, or would it accept that I already had 2/3 the dose morning and afternoon, and so the other 1/3 could be taken before bed? And finally I just want to say that I would like to try this because I am concerned that: 1. This emotional instability is an interdose withdrawal symptom. 2. The longer I am on the drug, the stronger the dependence gets so that it becomes more likely that I develop more severe interdose withdrawal symptoms during the day like panic attacks or something. If either of these are possible, then it would seem like a good idea to spread the dose out in order to avoid these things. Please explain.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for your detailed query which is self explanatory about the problem. It was lengthy but it contained only relevant thoughts necessary to express your deep rooted concern. First of all feeling nervous or anxious is common term and if you do not know what it means, I am sure you have never had that feeling. If you had that feeling you will know it throughout your life. I must inform you that common terms are difficult to define but almost everybody experiences that. What you are calling as emotional lability/unstability is normal reaction. That happens to any human over the earth. Your calmness and composure with others (except girlfriend) indicates that you are not labile and this is not rebound anxiety. It is possible that you are not satisfied with her relationship to one or another reason. Other than that with partners, having disputes is a normal phenomenon. So, stop calling it emotional lability and set a dialogue with your girlfriend about her doings which upsets you. By doing this you will be identifying the cause and rectify the problem all together. Since it is not rebound insomnia doing experimentation is not advisable. Your question is that if you take 0.5 mg in morning and afternoon what dose will you need in the evening. Since you are doing well with other drugs gradual reduction of the dose of Alprazolam is possible and it can be accomplished successfully by you.

I often got admitted in hospital for this reason. I visited many reputed doctors, but none of them was able to reach any conclusion. At last I was declared celiac, however, it was not the case. Suddenly, without any medications my loose motion has stopped. It was weird, but I was relieved. Soon after two to three days my right chest started hurting a lot. I could not walk, breathe or sleep. I got an x-ray done and it revealed that I had pleural effusion in my right side of chest. Doctor took out 20 mL of urine colored liquid and sent it for laboratory testing. My ADA was high, but malignant cells were not present. So, the doctor reached the conclusion that I have closed TB. I took the TB medicines for four months. I had very ups and downs in my health in those months and suffered through loose motions often. I changed my doctor for a second opinion. He said that I have major swelling in my lungs and it can get worse if I inhale air pollutants as I was allergic to smoke and dust. He told me to get a good amount of rest and not to climb stairs or walk much. At first, I daily had mild temperatures and had shortness of breath the whole day.

She was diagnosed with an initial stage of SLE before six months. For the past six months, she is taking MMF tablet 500 mg three tablets per day, Flunil 20 mg per day and Wysolone 5 mg per day. She is also having chronic problems such as hair loss, finger numbness and frequently getting tired. Since we are planning for a child (first), the doctor told to stop the medication for six months before pregnancy. We would like to have some clarification for the following:  If she stops taking medicines during pregnancy, what kind of adverse effects will be there? Are there any other complications to the mother or child because of SLE? Is it advisable to have a pregnancy with or without tablets? Even without pregnancy, how SLE have the impact on her health?","Doctor":"Hi. She cannot stop taking medicines during pregnancy but, the tablet MMF (Mycophenolate mofetil) can be replaced by HCQS (Hydroxychloroquine), and low dose steroids can be continued. SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) disease activity increases during pregnancy in some patients especially, they develop low platelet count. With proper medication, she can have a good life expectancy unless her kidneys are affected by SLE. She should get examined by a rheumatologist for SLE disease activity and decide to change MMF which is used as add-on medicine unless her kidney is involved.

She is being treated for osteoporosis currently for which we are already consulting a specialist. I am attaching few other reports towards which would request you to evaluate the same and let me know your interpretation and concerns and treatments if any. For cholesterol and kidney levels findings what should she do? Regarding osteoporosis (revealed through DEXA scan), she has been advised Terifrac injection 20 mg (8 units) daily for a year plus a calcium supplement. What are the side effects of Terifrac at her age and with regards to her other reports, especially ones related to kidney, creatinine etc.? Is it safe to use for her? Any suggestion for her rheumatoid results? My mother also is under medication for BP. Currently, her BP was 130/8. Should she continue with her dose of Losacar H one per day or modify the same?","Doctor":"Hello. I have checked the attached reports thoroughly (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Here is my comment: Fortunately, there are no autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis or SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) as both ANA and anti-CCP are negative. Unfortunately, the DEXA scan shows there are osteoporotic changes which increase the risk of fracture and requires treatment. Calcium supplements and Terifrac (Teriparatide) are suitable medications for the osteoporosis. Terifarc may cause some depression, gastric upset or muscle weakness, but generally, it is well tolerated by postmenopausal women. There is no rheumatoid arthritis. Her blood pressure is well controlled and there is no need to change the medication. Regarding the kidney function, it is the high normal level with evidence of hydration (could be the effect of Losacar H). So, I recommend good hydration and follow up of renal functions after two weeks. I have noticed that she has anemia as well as high cholesterol levels which require medication to be controlled. Her blood sugar level is normal. Best wishes. For more information consult a general medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 40 year old male.

Can you please explain me about gout?","Doctor":"Hi.I have gone through your query and also looked at the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Initially, I would like to throw some information about gout. It is a condition of altered purine metabolism in the body in which crystals of monosodium urate deposit in the joints leading to inflammation comprising of severe pain, redness, local warmth, etc. In the foot, the great toe is usually affected although conventional gout does not easily involve the knees. There are ways to keep uric acid value low in your body. General recommendations are: Nowadays there is a medication by the name of Febuxostat which helps in lowering uric acid levels in the body. But, kindly check out that it suits your body. Although I have provided information about gout in detail, it may not be necessary that she is suffering from gout as the whole foot appears to be swollen. Anyway, kindly get some blood tests done immediately from a good pathology laboratory and send reports across to me. Tests are preferable to be done in an empty stomach. Kindly start with an anti-inflammatory medication which suits her body. Give intensive ice packs and keep the limb elevated at night while sleeping to manage gout. Also, can you kindly tell me whether she is having any systemic symptoms like fever? Can you send me a picture pointing to the exact site of pain in the foot and also the knee? Does she normally take medications for any other pathology? What has been her past medical history? Does she suffer from any significant allergic history? Metabolic causes. Infection. 1.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

It started with unilateral tinnitus. MRI of the spine showed moderate to severe stenosis spine. I do exercise, and running, and my neurologist says this might be normal. I had a concussion when I was 17 and spent a day in the hospital. My MRI brain is obviously abnormal with white matter. What is the likelihood of MS? I had an MRI in 2015 and said chronic microvascular changes. MRI of a couple of weeks ago said no tumor on auditory nerves. Please explain.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that your MRI findings (head and spine) fulfill the radiological criteria of MS (multiple sclerosis). There are many old lesions in the head and spine and there is a new lesion in the left parietal lobe, which explains the tingling in the right toes. Although you have no past medical history for paralysis or limb numbness and weakness, these brain lesions are compatible with MS. I recommend discussing with your neurologist about that. As there is a new lesion (with light contrast enhancement), steroids would help to relieve the tingling in the right toes. Regarding the mild spinal canal stenosis, it does not explain the spinal cord lesions in the upper levels which are probably related to MS. I recommend performing a spinal tap in order to examine your cerebrospinal fluid and visual evoked potentials.

You would not have done any damage to your toe or made gout worse by running on it. The pain and tenderness are likely to last for a few more weeks but should gradually resolve completely. The attack was probably brought on by the beer and the dehydration. If you avoid those precipitants, it may never happen again.

I do not take Vyvanse when I am not in school. Between, I am sixteen, turning seventeen soon. This summer, I began smoking marijuana nearly every single day. I want to say it was not a coping mechanism, and in many ways, it was not, but I felt (and still feel) like I was smoking to avoid feeling lonely, anxious, and depressed.I am very aware of the dangers of marijuana and the effects of using it every day. My main concern is the way my body will react on being on a combo of an Amphetamine, an SSRI, and a psychoactive drug. I highly doubt the outcome is positive. Is it a very dangerous (life-threatening) combination? Will it have significant effects on my well-being or my physical health?","Doctor":"Hello. 1. You are right in recognizing that smoking marijuana may not be safe when you are taking Escitalopram and Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) description. Occasional smoking is relatively common but to smoke marijuana daily is harmful at your age. 2. Try to reflect what made you experiment with marijuana this summer. Are you still feeling depressed and anxious despite Escitalopram? You can consider a review with your prescribing doctor to check your emotional wellbeing and optimize medication if needed. Have you had CBT to manage anxiety or depression and develop healthy coping strategies? 3. Marijuana may have a dulling effect on your feelings and emotions. It will increase the risk of developing a psychotic illness. It can aggravate mood swings and make you more restless. Marijuana is known to cause tachycardia (fast heartbeat) and high BP when you are taking an antidepressant and stimulant, and it can make you more susceptible to developing these problems. 4. Also, there are concerns about long term adverse effects of marijuana on the growing adolescent brain. There are many more unanswered concerns about the long-time adverse impacts of marijuana use. So I will advise to refrain from smoking marijuana at this age and seek additional support to manage any emotional needs. Keep yourself active, engage in sports or martial arts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I feel weakness, fatigue all the time. I feel sleepy at day, but at night there is no good sleep.

If not, then also go for it. Because this problem can be due to disturbed thyroid hormone. For now, improve your lifestyle. Take fresh, homemade, and healthy food. Make a schedule for taking food and take food at the same time. Avoid tv, laptop, and mobile two hours before sleeping because they hinder the normal sleep pattern. Try to sleep around 10 pm and sleep in a dark and calm room. Even if you do not feel sleepy, go on the bed at the same time daily. Your body will ultimately become habitual to it. Wake up around six to seven am in the morning daily. Do not wake up late in the morning. Try not to sleep in the afternoon. Do pranayama and breathing exercises in the morning after waking up. Do walk daily at least for 30 to 60 minutes a day. Adopt these habits, and you will feel better results within a week.

My eye health is otherwise perfect (had them checked out a week before this came on). After a few days, it spread to the other eye. I expect the first eye will heal first, even though the second eye is not as bad. One question is when the first eye heals, do I need to protect it from re-infection from the one that is still healing?Also, on the typical length of healing, I am not quite at two weeks yet (this is day 11 for the first eye), but the lack of improvement in my condition is becoming frustrating to me. Today the vision in the first eye is smudgy, and the vision in the second eye is better, but not perfect. The specialist was aware of the vision problems, and she said that it was normal (though I think they have worsened).I was told this could take weeks to heal, beyond the normal one or two. How many weeks are weeks generally? I was told I have a mild to moderate case, but all I know is that I have seen no real progress, and I think the virus might have even spread to one of my sinuses. My mental health is suffering from not knowing how long I am going to be cooped up, partially visually impaired and contagious. Am I impatient or should I have them looked at by a specialist again?","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed your history. It seems from the history that you are having viral conjunctivitis involving both the eyes. Coming to your first question, viral conjunctivitis remains infective in the initial three to five days hence no need to worry about the reinfection from the one eye that is still healing. Usually, viral conjunctivitis follows a self-limiting course of 7 to 10 days. Since you are having vision problems in the eye, probably it has involved cornea resulting in viral keratoconjunctivitis.  If it has involved the cornea, it takes about three to four weeks to heal. However, the involvement of cornea is not because of infection, but because of immunologically mediated reaction, hence it will resolve even without treatment. However, symptomatic relief can be obtained by using artificial tears, and some severe cases may require the use of steroid eye drops under the supervision of your eye doctor. If possible, send a photo of the affected eye so that I can confirm the diagnosis and answer your question more accurately. I hope the information is helpful to you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I missed the period last month.

Due to lumbar puncture for giving spinal analgesia, I lost sensation below the knee in both my legs.Due to the continuous loss of sensation after the operation, I developed severe wound and was treated with intravenous antibiotics. My right leg was amputated below the knee before six years. After the surgery, my left leg was affected by lymphangitis. Three years before due to long term retention of the suprapubic catheter, a two huge bladder stone of 5 cm and a small 3 cm was operated. Due to loss of spinal puncture, I am suffering from parenthesis till date. The photos of my leg are attached here along with the lymphoscintigraphy test report which shows a block in lymphatic vessels.

It is too tight and painful during sexual intercourse and please suggest me a piil for opening my vagina. Please help me. It is too hard.","Doctor":"Hello. I think your partner is rushing too much when having sex. You should collaborate with him, and give time to get a full orgasm along with your partner. If you do so, your vagina will get loose too. However, if persisting, there are two main reasons: 1. Your partner is not ejaculating inside the vagina but to the external opening of urethra (check this out, make sure he penetrates inside the vagina). 2. You have imperforate hymen, should check out with gynecologist to open it up (cannot open with penetration)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 60 years old.

I will say moving my head from right to left down to shoulders does feels like I am stretching something. I elbowed a thick wood door with my right elbow, and I had pain in arm and hand for a long time. And have had shoulder (orthoscopic and removed a bone, so they tell me) but all in the right side so I can understand but not both arms. And the weird part is it goes into my chest. Sort of like heartburn is the best way to explain. All blood work came back perfect. Do have high blood pressure but under control with a mess. Any thoughts or help would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello.I can tell you that such a radiating pain usually is an indication of a nerve impingement either in the spine region or somewhere along the course of the nerve. If there is only a radiating kind of pain, nerve tests sometimes may not reveal much although I would be interested in seeing the report of your nerve conduction test. Also, X-ray could show some degenerative changes in the form of osteophytes, disc spaces, etc., but if you want to see, MRI of the cervical spine will be a better investigation as it will enable us to view the spinal cord and any associated compression if present. As far as your other query about elbow and shoulder is concerned, I would like to know and understand your current problems, the latest investigation is done and ongoing treatment, so that I can appreciate and opine accordingly. Also, any radiation of pain to the chest region should be seen by a general physician so that cardiac and gastrointestinal causes can be ruled out. To start with, I can advise for your left upper limb symptoms for which you can start with tablet Gabapentin or tablet Pregabalin along with Methylcobalamin for nerve-related signs. Intensive physical therapy in the form of TENS (transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation) also helps to get relief from neuropathic symptoms.

Three days ago I started getting a really sharp pain in the lower left abdomen. It came on sudden and was gone within seconds but still bad enough to have me doubled over in pain. Thought it was related to period that was due following day. Happened on and off all day.Next day period did start as expected. Normal flow, normal cramps, etc. Then the sharp stabbing pain came back. It is stabbing in a very precise location, down and to the left from the belly button, kind of in-line with the hip. It was radiating hellfire to my low back, groin, thigh, hip, and left flank. I was on the floor in pain for four hours before it faded away enough for me to even stand. That night it happened again waking me from sleep. Lasted for hours, stabbing in the same spot, burning pain spread to the other areas. Later that day my toddler laid across me and his elbow got that same spot and started the pain up all over again but it only lasted about an hour. The area is very tender. I still get the brief stabbing pain when walking or coughing or bending over. I am thinking it is a ruptured cyst. I have never been diagnosed with one before but I think it fits the bill.

What can I do at home for it, since I am unable to go in to see a doctor?","Doctor":"Hi. I went through your complain which I must say you have very nicely written down. As per the location of the pain that you mentioned, there are some conditions that need to be ruled out. First is appendicitis. It is followed by vomiting and constipation. Second is renal calculi or stones. This pain comes from behind while passing urine. Third, as you mentioned ovarian cyst but the ruptured cyst is a medical emergency and is unlikely. Get an abdomen and renal ultrasound is done to get a proper diagnosis.

I also experience a burning sensation on the outside of genitals which makes it difficult for us to insert the penis.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. Yes, you may have sperm allergy, that can be easily found by using a condom. Next time use a condom during sex and check whether you have discharge after that. Other cause can be due to 1. Gonorrhea and chlamydia are two of the most common causes of vaginal discharge, early diagnosis and antibiotics will help you. 2. If there is urinary tract infections with increased frequency of urination, irritation during urination, lower abdominal pain then urine culture will help to diagnose these conditions. 3. Urethritis is damage to the urethra from intercourse or masturbation, irritation from a product such as soap, deodorant, or detergent, and it can also occur due to adenovirus, and genital injuries. 4. Candida infection can also cause watery discharge with itching. Smear from the discharge will help you diagnose and start early antifungal medication. 5 Trichomoniasis infection (sexually transmitted infection caused by a parasite) can cause vaginal discharge too, and it can be diagnosed by swab or urine sample.

Since your baby is just 3 and a half-month-old, I wanted to know whether the child is exclusively breastfed or on any formula milk. If the child is on breast milk, then there is no issue, but if the child is on any formula milk, then there is a chance of contamination leading to stomach infection. Generally, it takes five to ten days for this to settle, meanwhile continue Enterogermina (Bacillus Clausii) and add some Zinc supplement also.

I do not know how I will hold a job as I hate others observing me and hate confrontation and I am worried about interacting with customers, etc. Is social anxiety an essential one to get treated? How to tell my mom without making her worry.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand you are quite worried and frightened about your problems. Social anxiety is common, and it is all about what it does that affects the people more. Your worries about your inability to hold on to a job and avoiding social situations are valid. It is very important to treat social anxiety because if left untreated it will gradually keep increasing and you may end up feeling frustrated and depressed as well. Regarding explaining this to your mother, you can read and find it easy to understand articles regarding social anxiety and ask your mother to go through that. First of all, you need to make her understand that it is an illness like diabetes or hypertension. If it is an illness, it has some symptoms and a proper course and treatment as well. If you had diabetes, would your mother pity you? No, she would ask you to consult a doctor. Similarly, in this case, you will need medicines as well as therapy to overcome your symptoms and gain some control of your life. No one needs to pity you for anything. Once you start viewing this from a rational point of view, you will be able to explain it better to your family. I hope this helps.

I am now pregnant (4 weeks and 3 days) and taking 400 mg Progesterone suppositories once per day due to low progesterone levels both in the last pregnancy and in the weeks leading up to the confirmation of this pregnancy. However, my doctor has told me that my estradiol is very low, and that is concerning me. My results so far: 14 DPO Hcg 69 U/L Progesterone 77 nmol/L Estradiol 220 pmol/L. Two days later: 16DPO (yesterday), Hcg 129 U/L, Progesterone 75 nmol/L, Estradiol 239 pmol/L. Is my pregnancy doomed because of my very low estradiol? I was hoping my doctor would prescribe estrogen medication but he does not seem to think that would be an option. Why would he decide that? Do you think estrogen supplementation would help? Instead he is having me take 25 mg daily of DHEA. Do you think this will help and is it safe to take in pregnancy? Will eating foods high in phytoestrogens e.g. soy help increase my estradiol? Also, do you think my low Hcg levels are a bad sign? At 12DPO they were 15U/L so they increased rapidly to 69U/L on day 14 but then slowed a bit to get to 129U/L on day 16. I am due for another blood test tomorrow. I really do not want to lose this pregnancy, but these low numbers are making me worry.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iclinq.com. I saw your concern. The normal levels of estradiol in early pregnancy can vary from 188 to 2400 pmol/ l. Similarly, progesterone can vary from 12 to 90 nmol/l. HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) has doubled, which happens only in a healthy growing fetus with good trophoblastic activity. Do not worry much about estradiol, it has no big significance in treating previous early miscarriages. Everything looks normal.

You may have compulsion but you have not mentioned in your symptoms so it seems to be only an obsession. For example, having an obsession with contamination and compulsion of washing unnecessarily with frequent hand washing. In obsessive thought disorder, it is difficult to control your thoughts though you know it is unnecessary. You must start taking antidepressants medication which can help you with both obsession and depression. Your obsession will increase with stressful situations. Capsule Fluoxetine 20 mg daily in morning after breakfast can be started. You need to monitor for a long time and increase medication doses to control your obsession. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicine. It is a very minimal dose. You may need higher doses.

Nothing I do seems to make it go away. Three weeks ago, I went to the hospital for chest pain and they did a D-dimer and it came back negative. I feel the tightness in my lower calf and upper back of the thigh. It is in both legs but I mainly feel it in the left. It is not unbearable more of an annoyance. I have tried Epsom salt baths, Ibuprofen, etc.","Doctor":"Hi. I see you are suffering from calf tightness and pain for the past two weeks. One reason could be due to your overweight. Other, could be blood clot formation in the veins as you are at high risk for it. Or, it could be because of salt imbalance in your body if you are not taking adequate nutrition and water. I would like to know, do you exercise regularly or go to the gym for weight reduction? Do you take any medicines as a part of weight-reduction plan? Are you in any regular medicines for any issues like high cholesterol, diabetes, or thyroid problems? What is your job? Do you stand for long hours in a day? CBC (complete blood count).

Corns can be painful by themselves, but more so if they are infected. Try to do the following measures: 1. Use padded footwear at home and outside, use silicon feet pads inside shoes. 2. Try corn caps which are like band-aids. Leave each one on for as long as they stick, which is usually for a week or so. Slowly over three to four weeks, the corn will soften and fall off. 3. You can take tablet Combiflam (Paracetamol, Ibuprofen) if the pain is severe as and when required after consuming food. 4. Use warm compresses over the corn in severe pain. If the above measures do not work, the corn may be infected, and you may require antibiotics. If pus has collected in it, it needs to be drained. So if there is no improvement, kindly consult a general surgeon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was in a car accident four years back. After one week while I was having bath, I felt one small lymph node in my left neck. I did not feel it before. It was little bigger that time. By the time it is getting smaller but not going to its original size. I cannot see it now but I can feel it. So, I am worried and popping it all the time. Recently, I found one gland in floor of the mouth in left side and it is very small and not growing in size. Sometimes I feel swelling in left side of mouth and left leg. I got no night sweat, no fever and no weight loss at all. I got five small petechiae (red blood spots) in right chest. I have attached my complete blood test history for three months. Symptoms: Constant left shoulder pain, bone pain, hand pain. extreme fatigue, and tiredness. I feel something struck in throat. Bowel habit change. Medications: Doxycycline Hyclate 100 mg for two weeks. Amoxycillin 500 mg for one week. My questions to you are as follows: 1. Do I have lymphoma or leukemia? 2. If your answer of no. 1. is no, then why the lymph nodes are not going back to their original size after completing whole antibiotic dosage? 3. Why my WBC and lymph % are fluctuating too much? 4. Can lymphoma be ruled out from CBC test? 5. What is your opinion about my blood report?","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows:  No, it is neither lymphoma nor leukemia. There is no cell predominance (either neutrophil or lymphocyte or any immature cells) or the counts are also not high enough to think of leukemia. Lymphoma lymph nodes are usually multiple and do not regress in size. Lymph nodes usually take longer to regress and sometimes, mild infection in the location could be making it to be active. It could also be chronic lymphadenitis, with variable amount of fibrosis inside it, due to which, it may not regress back to its original size. If it was lymphoma, it would be increasing and multiple sites and multiple nodes together would be enlarged. WBC are cells related to fighting infections and inflammations. As the body is fighting some infection or other in everything (food, water, air, etc.), it will vary. Also, stress and hormonal variations can affect it too. If the count is not shooting excessively over the normal range, not to worry. No, usually lymphoma cannot be ruled out from CBC test. Fine needle aspiration cytology of lymph node or biopsy of lymph node is essential. However, at present, it will not be essential looking at small lymph nodes. Blood report, overall is good. Mild neutrophil increase, indicating possible mild infection or stress. Stress could be responsible for all the symptoms at present. Nothing in the blood report, can explain the symptoms you have. Check calcium level once. As the platelet count is normal and you do not have any bleeding, petechiae could be due to small pressure spots. It will disappear. Not to worry about it. If it starts occurring at multiple spots, then prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time evaluation may be necessary."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am having continuous dry cough for a month. I took antibiotics and cough syrup, still no improvement. What should I do next? Need to undergo TB test or X-ray. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. In the pictures sent, there is no obvious large abnormality seen (attachment removed to protect patient identity). However the X-ray image quality is not very clear and if you are having dry cough not responding to antibiotics therefore more detailed investigation is required. TB usually causes chronic cough with fever and weight loss and should be confirmed clinically. Right now I suggest you get a CT scan of chest done to investigate for causes leading to cough for more than a month. Complete blood count is also important to know if you are having any infection or allergy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been sick for a month, lost weight, cannot eat, no energy. Left side is killing me when I have bowel movement. Yesterday, it looked like spiders, I am serious. I have no energy to get out of bed. Can you help me, please?","Doctor":"Hi. You mean you have noticed weight loss because you have lack of appetite. You cannot concentrate, you are feeling weak, cannot even get out of your bed. Your left side of body pains when you defecate, your abdomen pains. You have been having lose stool. If I got you right then you might have infectious diarrhea. Gastroenteritis or infectious diarrhea is a medical condition characterized by inflammation and infection caused by bacteria specially. The key treatment is get enough fluids (for mild to moderate case). Typically oral rehydration solution is best. More serious cases need patients to be admitted and get IV fluids. The other posibilty could be of celiac disease, but proper diagnosis need investigation and third reason could be giardiasis. Again stool culture can give us diagnosis. Listening to you it looks like you are feeling very much sick. I will advice you to go to hospital and get examined. In between keep yourself very well hydrated. And visit hospital as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son's age is 9 months, 12 kg, having fever since yesterday, we have given liquid medicine two times as of now (Paracetamol). After taking the medicine, fever came down and again back to 101 F, can you suggest any other medicine?","Doctor":"Hello. When we see a rise in body temperature we call it fever. Fever is a symptom and not the diagnosis of a disease. Fever can be caused by various reasons most commonly due to some infections. Fever is the body's response to infections, rise in body temperature, helps prevent the spread of infection in the body. But we reduce fever by drugs because it causes discomfort and may induce convulsions in some children. Paracetamol reduces fever only and does not treat the cause of fever. So once the effects of the drug come down, fever rises again. So I want to know what other symptoms are present along with fever-like cough, cold, pain in the abdomen, etc. Which will provide a clue about which infection is likely. So continue Paracetamol every sixth hourly and if fever persists go for blood tests like CBC CRP urine microscopy or chest X-ray, blood cultures and if needed antibiotics will be started."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 3.9 years old. He had stomach pain with vomiting last week. His doctor gave Lanzol junior tablet and Sucrafil syrup, for vomit Emset syrup.

Today since evening 4 PM he has passed urine 20 times. Overall comes 750 ml. Also saying back pain and near above side hip pain too. I stopped Lanzol tablet, only giving Sucrafil and cough syrup.

Two days back your child had stomach pain and vomiting which appears to be due to food poisoning, you have given Lanzol (antacid), Sucrafil (antacid syrup) and Emeset for vomiting. But no antibiotic was given. The food poisoning seems to have corrected. Now your child is feeling hungry, drinking more water and passing more urine. Back pain and headache is also there. These are not related to food poisoning and are different from it. Keeping in mind the symptoms there is possibility of diabetes, urinary tract infection, renal stones. I suggest you to do urine routine microscopy and culture test, blood sugar levels, urine ketones level, X-ray KUB and ultrasound KUB. These investigations will confirm the diagnosis. Stop Lanzol, Sucrafil, Cough syrup, just give Syrup Ibugesic 5 ml three times a day for two days to relieve headache and backpain.

I have also checked my lipid profile which are normal. I request you kindly suggest further action required. I am currently taking Lipicard.","Doctor":"Hello. I have to have more information about this pain before I can tell you what is the cause of this pain. Usually, the gall bladder stone of such size (less than 10 mm) in size does not cause pain, and if it does, then the pain has to be characteristic one like pain starts within half hour of meals and gradually increases in intensity within next 1 hour and then start declining for the next three to six hours. Vomiting can occur with increased severity of the pain. If you have any of symptoms as mentioned, then it is possible that pain is coming from gall bladder stones, and the definitive treatment is cholecystectomy i.e. removal of the gall bladder. Again, I want to emphasize that most of the stones of such size usually do not cause pain and remain asymptomatic doing no harm to the patient throughout their life. The other cause of sudden and severe abdominal pain are ulcers within the stomach, food pipe or small bowel, inflammation of the pancreas called pancreatitis, diabetes and its complications, lead poisoning, drugs such as pain killers, and few other causes. Your lipid profile is normal, and ultrasound is otherwise normal except that stones which are clearly visible. You can start capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg half an hour before meals, it will resolve the pain if coming from ulcers in the stomach.

Alcohol is a known teratogen for the human fetus. Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy is associated with abnormalities in the fetus. The problems can occur in many systems, most importantly facial changes, heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities and neurological (structural or functional) abnormalities. Three findings are common in facial abnormalities: 1. Smooth philtrum (a groove seen from the bottom of the nose to the upper lip will look flat). 2. Thin upper lip. 3. Narrow palpebral fissures of eyes. Short collumella can be an associated feature, but that alone cannot be used to label the diagnosis as fetal alcohol syndrome."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Will a cavity tooth that hits the nerve hurt worse than a necrotic tooth?

Her periods were finished on 16th and we had this on 18th and today is 19th. Do I need to give her a pill or not? Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, your apprehension and concern are completely understandable. But the fact that you both were involved in sex after two days post her menses had stopped simply puts her in her safe period when chances of pregnancy are minimal as ovulation had not taken place. Secondly, there was no ejaculation involved before you fingered her and also you touched just the prepuce skin before fingering, again decreases her chances of pregnancy. Thirdly, you ejaculated over her butt and before the sperm could trickle to her vagina, you wiped it off. In this case as well, chances of pregnancy are minimal and do not qualify for any need for an emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of sex. As there was no unprotected intercourse involved, so you can be sure that there are no chances of pregnancy in this situation."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My breasts are as developed as a woman.

I never had any negative symptoms and had an overall good experience but I decided to stop taking it after ending my relationship because I would no longer be sexually active. About four weeks after my withdrawal bleed, I had my first period again and everything seemed to go right back to normal. I have been off the pill for a year now, and my periods are totally regular, but I have noticed some slight differences. Before BC, my cervical mucus seemed to change throughout the month but now it stays the exact same. Thick and milky. Occasionally, it will be a little more watery, but it used to get that egg white consistency around ovulation and such. It does not seem to do that much anymore, if at all. Although I am pretty certain I still have ovulation pain around the middle of my cycle. Should I be worried? Did BC mess up my body? Or is that not cause for concern? Everything else is completely normal. My cycle is a perfect 28 days and my periods are back to how they were before. The only difference is that I used to still have some light spotting on day five, but now it is mostly gone by day four other than a bit of light spotting. I am not trying to conceive, but I was wondering if this was something I should be worried about. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, birth control pills do not have this kind of lasting effect which might be over or after a year, so the change in discharge is not because of pills. Secondly, changes in consistency of vaginal discharge over the cycle are totally normal. These changes are due to hormonal changes which are taking place in different phases of the cycle. Thirdly, if the discharge is not smelly, itchy or associated with any abdominal pain or painful voiding then it is nothing to worry about. If any of these problems arise, you have to seek expert advice then only. Another general advice is to use cotton undergarments and wash area frequently with plain water only."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 38 year old man, 280 lbs. I have a 4 mm kidney stone that I went to the ER for on 12th last month because of the pain. The CT scan said \\"A 3 x 4 mm calculus is present in the proximal left ureter at the level of L3. There is mild dilation of the proximal left ureter and renal pelvis, but no hydronephrosis. Left proximal ureteral calculus measuring 3 x 4 mm. There is mild associated dilation of the proximal left ureter and renal pelvis.\\" On 25th, I was back in the ER with bad pain and had another CT scan. The scan said \\"The lung basis are clear. There is no fluid in the pleural space on either side. No pneumothorax is seen. A 4 mm stone is again seen in the proximal left ureter in unchanged position causing mild dilatation of the ureter and the renal collecting system. Again, there is only minimal stranding in the fat surrounding the proximal ureter. No interval change. Partially obstructing stone in the left proximal ureter. Fatty infiltration of the liver and borderline sized spleen. I went back to the ER on 26th due to pain and they recommended against another CT scan due to radiation. I got Morphine and survived but I do not know if the stone moved. Now, on 10th this month, I went back to the ER because of pain and did not do a CT scan so I do not know where this stone is. I do not know what to do. I think it may be in my bladder waiting for me to pee it out, but what if it is stuck in the exact same spot from 30 days ago? Should I go ahead and do another CT scan? I am in no pain now. Each time I went to the ER, I was blood and urine tested and my kidney function is fine and there are no infections. I am just worried this stone is sitting there. Or do you think it has passed to the bladder? I do not think there is any way to know unless I get another CT scan but I am a little worried about radiation. Thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. You have a tendency to form kidney stones repeatedly. It is something that you need to get evaluated once the treatment for the present condition is complete. Regarding your present problem, a 4 mm stone will be passed out spontaneously in 90 % of patients, with good hydration and medication. If you are not symptomatic, it is reasonable to wait for a period of three weeks to assess again. For you, it is possible to do an ultrasound scan to check whether there is any dilation of the ureter, which if present, then a CT scan will be necessary. If absent, you can avoid a CT scan if you are asymptomatic. Also, if the stone has not passed out during this time, you may require surgical stone removal, even though the stone is only 4 mm.

As you mentioned that you are not responding to itching medicines like antihistaminics, you need to be started on steroids like Prednisolone. But before starting steroids, I suggest you visit a dermatologist for examination, confirmation of diagnosis and get some blood test done like hemogram including WBC count and ANA (antinuclear antibody) levels, liver function test and renal function tests to rule out infection as steroids may be detrimental.

The left eye causes pain and discomfort if I spend more time in front of the computer or while trying to read distant letters that can be read easily by right eye. I contacted the doctor again and he says nothing more can be done about power in the left eye. He says the left eye will adjust automatically after a few days of using new glasses. He suggested using Eyedol twice daily for one month to reduce discomfort in eye. I have been using Eyedol for last 20 days along with Softdrops but it seems not that effective. The discomfort in left eye goes after using Eyedol and feels better, but returns back if I read small letters from a distance in the computer screen. These are some queries I need your help. What is the exact problem in my left eye? What does the eye test report suggest? Whether the left eye needs more power lens? Why am I still having discomfort in the left eye even after using new glasses? Is Eyedol good enough to cure this problem? Is there any other medicine or treatment for my problem? Looking forward your reply.","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms are suggestive of dry eyes (computer vision syndrome). There is no permanent cure for dryness. Power on both your eyes is negligible (attachment removed to protect patient identity). In my opinion, if there is no headache then you can avoid these glasses. You may keep using them if you feel comfortable with them but make sure they have an antiglare coating. You need a lot more things like cold compresses, antiglare glasses, restrict the use of the screen, frequent lubrication by lubricating eyedrop, breaks in between computer work, proper hydration, etc.  The eyedrop is anti-inflammatory eyedrop which will not cure your problem but will decrease the inflammation that is induced by dry eyes and so you feel comfortable for a limited period. This will not cure your problem. Keep using lubricating eyedrop more frequently but also restrict screen work, blink a lot, follow 20-20-20 rule, use antiglare glasses, cold compresses. All these measures will help you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My friend recently got a blood test done and they told her that she had a large number of schistocytes. However, she was not found to be anemic and has no other history of serious health issues. She is 30 and thin built. She has been anemic on blood tests occasionally in the past. I do not know if it is related. They also did a CT scan because of abdominal pain and found a 10 mm lesion on her liver and inflammation of her uterus and stomach. She saw her gynecologist for an annual checkup last month and everything was normal. She had some acid reflux and gastritis problems on and off in the past. She also has been using the NuvaRing birth control for the past two years. They recommended her to see an oncologist for the liver lesion and a gastrointestinal specialist for the stomach inflammation. My question is, everything I have read about schistocytes says that they are caused by either trauma or by disorders that cause persistent anemia. Since she was not anemic, what could be the cause for schistocytes?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. Schistocytes are nothing but fragmented or broken red blood cells, which are formed due to trauma to the cells. There are many causes of schistocytes in blood, One of the causes is microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. But, you have mentioned that she is not anemic. Other causes are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in which there is a defect in platelets and fibrin, which causes destruction of RBC's. But, in these conditions the peripheral smear will show other abnormalities in platelets also. Other causes are aortic stenosis and prosthetic valve. As she has lesion in liver, I suggest to get her evaluated properly as some systemic diseases and malignancy can also cause disseminated intravascular coagulation and destruction of RBC's. In my opinion, she needs liver function test, kidney function test and ultrasound of the abdomen to confirm the diagnosis. Also, get her ECG and 2D echocardiogram done. If the morphology of liver lesion will become clear, then it will be easier to reach the diagnosis.

Dryness is a prevalent complaint encountered in your place because of climatic variation, dust, and prolonged use of a computer. Sometimes dryness is associated with convergence weakness of eye muscles. If you are a computer user then better take frequent breaks preferably after every 20 minutes for say about two minutes. If you travel a lot then use protective UV goggles. Better to get your tear formation checked by an ophthalmic surgeon on Schirmer strip and check for the wetting of strip. Normal is 25 mm degree of severity of dryness depends upon the maximum limit of wetting of strip in five minutes. Also please get your fusional range checked for muscle weakness so that necessary eye exercises can be advised accordingly. Also, get your refraction done so as to be sure you do not have a refractive correction. A minor cylindrical error can also disturb while reading. Dryness associated with convergence weakness.

Eptoin (Phenytoin) causes many things like the slow performance of duties, confusion, and decreasing the intellect of a person. But it is a perfect drug to prevent fits. You are correct. The cause of increased GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) and ALP (alkaline phosphatase) is due to Eptoin only. They are liver enzymes, and they get elevated in liver disease. Please do not be alarmed. Eptoin has not injured your father's liver. See, it is difficult to explain. The liver has many functions. The liver produces these enzymes. They elevate when liver cells are damaged. But they also raise when their production is more. Eptoin increases the production of these enzymes. It is entirely harmless, and their levels become normal when we stop Eptoin. But you cannot stop Eptoin. It is an important drug. So my suggestion is to do nothing and not to worry. These enzymes can be elevated by drinking alcohol or if your father already has a liver problem. Kindly clarify those. If he is having any of these problems, please contact me.  1. Liver enzymes increase when the liver is damaged. 2. But your father does not have a liver problem. 3. The elevation of enzymes is due to increased production, stimulated by Eptoin. 4.

There may be a socio-cultural element that is driving this behavior, but the young girl's safety needs to be prioritized. Developmentally she is very young to be indulging in these type of practice and will not be mature enough to handle the unwanted attention. She may be putting herself in a vulnerable position by posting age-inappropriate videos. How is she doing in other aspects of life generally? How is she managing at school? How is she getting on with her friends? She needs more support and supervision from her parents or responsible adults in the family. Are you directly related to this young girl? 1) Try to discuss your concerns with the girl's parents or responsible adults in the family. Make sure there no safeguarding issues. 2) Try to be friendly and supportive of the girl. She should not be handled punitively but offered support and encourage her to talk. 3) Try to limit access to the internet and social media without supervision. 4) Encourage her to participate in healthy sports and play activities. 5) If there are any other emotional or behavioral problems, try to get her seen by a counselor or school counselor who can explore further and support accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My wife is suffering from endometriosis and adenomyosis. We had four failed IVF cycles, and the doctor is saying it is due to adenomyosis. Please let me know the Siddha treatment for this.","Doctor":"Hello. No one understands the difficulties of endometriosis expect the sufferer. I may request you to strictly go for IVF (in-vitro fertilization) as the uterus has adenomyosis and fibroids. Considering your age, IVF protocol with an experienced doctor may give the baby, that is the first goal now. After getting a baby, herbal medications can be taken continuously for many months for gynecological issues. Suppose, if you want to give a gap before the next IVF procedure, then I suggest the following drugs to prepare the uterus and to reduce the inflammations so that the success rate will be relatively more. a) Tablet Turmeric 100 (two in the morning, two in afternoons, and two in the night after food). b) Capsule Nandhi Mezhugu 100 (morning one and night one after food. This capsule should be put on the mouth after which a cup of buttermilk should be taken).  c) Tablet M2 Tone 100 (two in the morning, two in afternoons, and two in the night after food). You continue these Ayurvedic and Siddha drugs until the next IVF procedure starts. You stop these drugs once Allopathy injections started for IVF. These drugs will reduce inflammation, fibroid size, and improve the health of the uterus. You may ask nearby Ayurvedic medical shop to get these drugs for you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

If you do not release the semen, then the brain will switch off production. No matter how many years you hold the semen, the quantity will not increase. You will not gain anything. On the other hand, the sperm cells inside the semen will lose their functionality. Finally, there are no procedures to stop releasing semen and sealing it off permanently within the body.

You may require some tests based on symptoms, and other tests even if there are no symptoms.

How can it be treated by psychotherapy?","Doctor":"Hi. As you might be aware, OCD is a chronic, relapsing, and debilitating disorder. It has four themes of manifestation that decides the nature of treatment likely to be effective. So, to determine which form of therapy is more suitable for you, a psychiatrist can guide you after having a complete assessment. Regarding psychotherapy, the most commonly used technique in the psychological treatment of OCD is exposure and response prevention (ERP). This is a psychological method which involves exposing a patient to an anxiety-provoking situation and then stopping them engaging in their usual safety behavior. This helps them confront their anxiety, and the habituation leads to the eventual extinction of the response. So, if you are interested in the treatment of your problem, kindly contact any efficient local psychiatrist or book for an online therapy cum counseling at icliniq.

I read on the internet that, it may be PUPPP or cholestasis or neither both of them. Is it something to worry?","Doctor":"Hi. If the itching is present with rashes, it can be PUPPP (Pruritic Urticarial Papules and Plaques of Pregnancy). But you need to see a gynecologist or a dermatologist before we can come to a conclusion. Itching alone without any skin rashes can be cholestasis in pregnancy. But few tests need to be done before we can reach the diagnosis. More important is to keep an eye on the baby's movements. If it is PUPPP, then usually there is nothing to worry. If it is obstetric cholestasis, we will deliver the baby as soon as possible, as the benefits of continuing pregnancy after 37 weeks are less compared with the unpredictable risks to the baby due to cholestasis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My wife is having a refractive error of more than 6 in both the eyes.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 32 years old and weigh about 65 kg with a height of 5.5 feet. I have a problem in my anus, Actually, I had anal fissure before and when it is gone there is a skin tag and warts develop. But the crucial thing is an unexplained thing that looks like a wound near in my anus. I hope someone could tell me and answer my problem.","Doctor":"Hello. I will definitely help you with your query. Skin tags are formed in long-standing anal fissure. These are nothing but accumulated skin due to fissure usually nothing to do for that but if you have any problem because of it like pain, bleeding, or pus discharge, you can opt for surgery. It is a very minor surgery. No side effects or any problem after removing them by an experienced surgeon. A raw area will form that will heal on its own. It can reappear if you have another formation of anal fissure. So avoid the conditions that will cause it again like spicy food and constipation. I will advise you to start a sitz bath in which you have to sit in lukewarm water for 15 minutes twice a day, 10 ml Betadine can be added to it. You will get a better result in some time. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?

The first three days my maximum HR was 150 on the treadmill and I felt fine and I would do 40 minutes on it and today I only did 30 minutes because I started to feel a little dizzy and my HR went up to 158. Why is that?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. It is normal for the heart rate to go as high 300 bpm. You are exercising the wrong way for someone with your weight. You have to start exercising by taking a five-minute walk on the treadmill before gradually increasing the pace to a speed of 5/6 for 10 to 15 minutes. You should do this routine for two weeks before gradually increasing the duration to 20 minutes. Increase the speed gradually as you get used to. You get the dizzy feeling because your heart is having to pump more blood as you run, which it is not used to. You will over come this feeling as times goes on."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am worried about my daughter. She is 14 years old and suffers from anxiety, often triggered by being in a crowd or busy environment. In recent months she has started avoiding food.

She admitted that skipping meals started after a girl at school called her fat. I am not sure if skipping meals classes as an eating disorder but this has gone on too long to be just a phase. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi. Teenagers go through difficult phases of mental, emotional and physical growth. It is really good that as a parent you are paying full attention, now here are some suggestions. Do not be critical of your child's behavior. Gently try to introduce the idea that health and being thin are separate. If the child is unable or unwilling to eat proper breakfast or lunch, ask what they would prefer. Use the internet to show the required calories and their sources, try substituting healthy food with her choice and consent. Talk to the school counselor and maybe their help can solve the issue."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a very dry skin to the point that it is stinging and very uncomfortable. Kindly give me recommendations for managing very dry skin. I am taking Iron supplements now. Previously, used to take Hydrocortisone.","Doctor":"Hi. Extreme dry skin can be because of cold weather or part of eczema or low thyroid hormones or ichthyosis (fish like scales). Do you have a history of eczema? Let me give you a few skin care tips for dry skin in general. Avoid a hot shower, use warm water instead. Use mild soap with moisturizer, like Cerave, Cetaphil. Use a moisturizer that has Ceramide in it, Ceramide protects the skin barrier. Apply moisturizer soon after a shower, when the skin is still partially moist or wet. Drink sufficient water, ( 2 to 3 liters per day). Eat fruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin A like carrot, beet, watermelon, mango, papaya, pumpkin. Vitamin A has a great role in skin health."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from cavities since childhood. And have got four teeth removed by the dentist. My age is 25 years old. What suitable treatment should I take for cavities?","Doctor":"Hello. To avoid dental caries, the most effective thing is proper oral hygiene. It means brush two times a day using floss, clean your tongue in a proper way. After that, we come to the treatment part. The best thing when you see a single black dot in your tooth, see your dentist without delay, in the initial stage of cavity your dentist can remove it and fill it with tooth color material. This is the best cheap and painless way. But if you have an old and deep cavity in your teeth then your dentist will take a dental X-ray and could advise you for a root canal treatment followed by dental crown. These are ways to save your natural teeth against cavity. So always care your teeth and routine dental checkup."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am 28 years. I had my period on the 24th of last month and I had unprotected sex on 2nd of the next month. I took Primolut on the same day and I had been bleeding again on 5th to 7th. It was not like usual bleeding. After that bleeding, I sometimes take Primolut on my own, like, when I take it today, I will not take it tomorrow. Till now today is 29th and am still not having my period. I have tested three tests and all are negative. I am confused about it.","Doctor":"Hi. It would be better if you would send me a detailed history. Primolute N is actually used for delaying periods. It leads to withdrawal bleed but you have taken it as an emergency contraceptive pill actually. You got a withdrawal bleed as well although medicine was not taken properly with proper dose and days. After that also you took medication haphazardly. This medication is a hormone and can give side effects as well. These disturb cycles as well. Urine pregnancy test and transvaginal scan are not very good to diagnose pregnancy in very early stage actually. Better have beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) to check your pregnancy status. If it comes negative then have tablet Primolute N 10 mg twice daily for complete five days and wait for bleeding in coming 1 to 2 weeks. If you want to have contraceptives and proper hormonal support for your cycle for regularity, have combined oral contraceptive pills for three months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am experiencing pelvic pain for the last few days everytime and my period is late for 1 week as of now.

It started bothering me since end of February and it was slowly worsening. I daily travel by crowded trains, approximately 25 km to my workplace and back. By middle of March, while travelling (by standing) in train holding overhead handles my shoulder was hurting with every push from the crowds at various stations. During day time, there was not much pain I felt, but in the night, my sleep was disrupted frequently with pain (like pulling with a hook) on the shoulder. I applied \\"DYNAPAR QPS\\" (Diclofenac Diethylamine and absolute Alchohol Non-Aqueous Topical Solution). My mother was using it for joint pains and she asked me to try it but I got no relief with it. Then my cousin practicing Homeo medicine advised me some Homeo medicines and it provided only a slight relief. In the 1st week of April, I consulted an Orthopedic (Joint pain/bone specialist) and had taken X-ray of my right hand in 2 different positions. He suggested it is due to frozen shoulder problem and advised rotation of hands, shoulders, neck, etc., along with some medicines (mainly pain killers and anti-acidity medicine). Even after taking it for 25 days, still I am having pain, mainly in the inside bend of the right-elbow. If I raise my hands straight, it hurts very little, but if I bend it to comb my hair or putting my hands through the sleeve of my shirt it hurts very badly. During day time, the pain is very minor but in the night after the sleep of an hour, it starts paining badly. What I assessed is, while the weight of the upper body rests on the shoulder or around the area (including back side) while lying down, the pain radiates from this region and it hurts mainly the shoulder joint, forearm muscles, elbow joint and the wrist. After trying various positions to rest the hand and shoulder with pillows/soft towels, the pain eases little and I fall asleep again. This repeats throughout the night. I use Laptop extensively at work and at home also. Sometimes I feel a pulling pain in the wrist when I use the mouse more, but no problem with key board. Now I am working from home due to Covid19 lockdown, but afterwards, I may have to travel again by train and I am scared of the pain I will have to suffer.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems to be frozen shoulder, as told by orthopaedic earlier. Primary treatment of frozen shoulder is physiotherapy. Pain killer and muscle relaxants are given temporarily, start on tablet Neorelax MR 8 (Aceclofenace + Thiocolchicoside) two times a day for 5 days along with anti-acid tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast for 5 days, stop remaining medicines. After 3 to 4 days start physiotherapy of shoulder, you may consult physiotherapist, he may suggest better physiotherapy excercise. Diabetes has to be ruled out, please check FBS and PPBS for sugar. If not relieved with above then get an ultrasound of that shoulder done."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 28 years old. Suffering from premature ejaculation. I used to ejaculate within a minute.

I have gone through your history, as you have stated that you are having pain, swelling and bruising on dorsum (top) of foot region. In that event, I advise you to get: X-ray of affected foot (AP and oblique views) because we have to rule out any bony injury as management changes if there is a fracture. Do not put weight on affected foot as your swelling might increase further. Intensive ice packs need to be applied (10 to 15 minutes every 2 to 3 hours) to keep swelling to bare minimum. You can take OTC analgesic like Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, Paracetamol whichever is available and is not a contraindication for you. Keep your limb elevated over pillow at night while sleeping.

The doctor found totally occluded LAD, opened it to 50 percent with angioplasty. He recommends bypass surgery and am waiting to see cardiac surgeon. I am concerned with diagnosis which were almost non-existant. I was discharged from hospital with the following medicines: Before breakfast: Omeprazole, Antacid. After breakfast: Losartan, Angio ll, Aspent, Aspirin, Spironolactone, Diuretic, Ismo, Vasodilator. After dinner: Losartan, Angio ll, Ismo, Vasodilator. 8 PM: Flomax, Tamsulosin, Sennakot. Before bed: Semvistatin 140 mg, Statin, Lorazepam, Relaxant. I am concerned that he did not include a Beta-blocker and a Calcium Channel Blocker. I have variant angina which is quite severe at times. I also am not sure as to the ability of my heart to function and whether I am in danger of pulmonary edema or having liquids around the heart. I will not be able to have surgery for another 2 to 4 weeks and am wondering of my prognosis until then and is it possible to exercise like riding a bicycle at this time. I have included copies of angiogram and echogram for your study and comment.","Doctor":"Hi. The diagnosis of variant angina and STEMI due to total occlusion of a vessel do not go hand in hand normally. The documents provided by you also do not mention that you have variant angina (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Please provide more clarifications that how you concluded you have variant angina. If you really have variant angina, you can still be given Calcium channel blockers. Tablet Ismo also deals with variant angina very well. If you do not have variant angina, Beta-blockers may also be prescribed, provided there are no contraindications like heart failure, etc. Your problem may be managed by bypass surgery or angioplasty to both the vessels provided you are not a diabetic. If your RCA can still be opened by angioplasty is the issue to be decided by interventional cardiologist. In view of recent STEMI and EF of 35 %, you should not ride a bicycle or do strenuous exercise. Pulmonary edema, recurrent angina and heart attack are all possibilities for which you are being treated. Do not worry much. Keep yourself relaxed. You must seek a second opinion from an interventional cardiologist. Discuss risk and benefits both of angioplasty and bypass surgery."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My age is 23, I have undergone a surgery for bladder augmentation nine years back, since then I am doing Bicarbonate wash every week. Please suggest an alternative for this procedure.","Doctor":"Hi. The point of bicarbonate washing off bladder is to create alkaline nature, which is not a good environment for harmful cell to grow thereby inhibiting cell growth. And it will strengthen the bladder. Yes, what you can do is limit sugar, meat, dairy products, etc., which make our body more acidic. There is no substitute for the method. Bicarbonate washing is the best method. I will advice you to continue it, I understand it may be tiring, but the method itself is effective. Also ask your doctor how may total bladder wash you will be needing.

I put a small pen into the urethra, only about 2 to 3 inches in. Since then, I feel I may have done damage to the smooth muscles in the corpus spongiosum or the tunica albuginea. I can feel, right inbetween the corpus spongiosum and corpus cavernosa what feels like an enlarged muscle and seem to run the entire length of the urethra, maybe compression damage done to something there. As a result, I have slight difficulty urinating and very very bad premature ejaculation which did not ever happen. I also have nocturnal emissions frequently on a full bladder. I know I may need to have an MRI, but if the muscles are damaged here, what are the surgical options? Can anything be done? I also tried Priligy and it made no difference (10 to 20 seconds).","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, let me assure you, premature ejaculation is due to excessive sensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system and not due to any trauma. If the urethra is damaged because of foreign body insertion, then the only problem will be urethral stricture, which will cause difficulty in urination. Also, nocturnal emissions are natural, although frequency might vary. If you still have doubts, you can proceed with ultrasound Doppler study of penis and cystoscopy. That would reveal whether you have suffered any injury in the past."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have treated tinea cruris for the last six months with all allopathic medicines ranging from Terbinifine for six weeks to Itraconazole and Fluconazole and all the zole category ointments but there is no relief.

I have gone to the eye doctor multiple times, for eye dilation exam which came back normal, and then told I need to see a neurologist, which my eye doctor would not refer me to. My primary care physician has put me on antibiotics, which have made me sick and have done nothing for me, and now wants to put me on anti-seizure medication because she will not take the time to figure out what is causing the headaches and does not think I need an MRI. The headaches are all one-sided (the right), as well as the dizziness - all within the same spot. It gets worse with movement, and I have a job where I am constantly bending. Sometimes when I turn and then stand back up, I will be so dizzy I will stumble and then have to stand still and wait for the dizziness to go away. I have nearly fallen seven times within a week and almost got into a car accident because I was so dizzy. I was also at the hair salon getting my hair washed, and when leaning my head back into the deep sinks, there was so much pressure on that one spot of my head. On the ride home, I got my ophthalmic migraine, which I am sure was from that (I will see little black wisps like smoke that pulsate in front of my eye. Sometimes it is so severe it will nearly cloud my whole vision, and there have been almost three times. I have lost my sight twice entirely. Once when we were digging and once when I was walking around the zoo. The other time I came close, I was working at a nursing home, merely walking down the hall, and my vision started to go. I am not sure if the first two times were from heat, but I cannot stand the heat, and I will get very grouchy if I get too hot, even if others are not). Also, on the same night, that side of the head was so dizzy that I could not even walk and I could barely hear because my ears were so muffled. I also notice that at my job when one of the trucks go behind me and beep their horn, that side of the head will hurt. Also, if one of the big fans blowing on my face, I will make that side hurt as well. I should say I work in a plastics manufacturing plant working. There are loud grinders, but we all have eye protection and ear protection. I worked there for six months the first time, but I had to quit because I was feeling too horrible. I kept bumping into things. I have only lasted a month this time, and yet I still get dizzy. The nearly falling spells have only happened there. At my previous job in the nursing home, I was standing in a residents room waiting for them to finish in the restroom when, without warning, I nearly collapsed and had to stumble over to their bed. I need any advice because I have no support from either my family (who have told me straight out that I am simply making this up, so I do not have to work when I have never given them a reason to mistrust me) or from either of my doctors.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your question carefully and would explain that your symptoms are suggestive of migraine. Thank you for the detailed information, which can undoubtedly help direct me as a doctor toward the right diagnosis. As the headache is always in the same part of the head, it is advisable performing a brain MRI. It is also advisable consulting with an ENT specialist to exclude an inner ear disorder as a possible cause underlying the dizziness (as head movements trigger it). In the meantime, I would suggest treatment with Verapamil or Propranolol for the headache. Anti-epilepsy therapy like Topiramate can be a treatment option if Verapamil does not help (this is a commonly used drug in migraine). If the dizziness persists, while headaches subside with the above treatment options, I would recommend starting Meclizine or Dimenhydrinate for the dizziness (these drugs are usually used to treat vertigo). I hope to have been helpful. I remain at your disposal for any further questions whenever you need."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just turned 18 two months back. I am 5'8.5\\".

About 20 days ago, I started feeling pain after sex. I noticed part of glans penis and foreskin (near frenulum) is red, inflammed, and swollen. I thought the problem could be caused by hard and vigorous sexual acts (protected sex) I had in the previous days and weeks. I received oral sex (without condoms) with some girls in the previous days or weeks. In the 1st case, the friction of sex could have irritated skin of my penis. In the second case, I guess the pain and the red spots could be related to infection (bacterial or viral). The first doctor I visited (general practitioner) told me to apply Canstean cream and use Ciprofloxacin to treat urinary tract infections. After two days, I felt sick and pain in the testicles. Also, the cream did not improve the conditions of my penis. So then I visited the urologist who told me to interrupt Canesten and Ciprofloxacin and to use a Zinc oxide cream. I applied that on foreskin and glans. After two days the problem got worse because the cream was too thick and I felt pain just touching that area. I called the urologist who suggested me to stop with that product and to use a cream that contained Chlorhexidine. After one week, the problem was not solved. The urologist suggested me to contact a dermatologist, and that is what I did. He noticed just like a cordon in the foreskin, near the frenulum and so he told me to apply advanced cream that is a topical corticosteroid for two weeks. Moreover, the doctor prescribed an echo to check the cordon. The echo was negative. Even if I was told, this examination is not complete. I should have done a penile ultrasound with a penis in erection. Next week I consulted a dermatologist again, but the situation is still bad. What can it be?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your case. In my opinion, your first treatment with Ciprofloxacin and Canesten (Clotrimazole) was fine, but it should be taken at least for five to seven days, and some oral antifungal has also been added for proper cure. Ultrasound will not help in diagnosis and treatment.Please follow this treatment for five to seven days. I Hope you will be fine. 1. Tablet Ciprofloxacin 500 mg two times a day for seven days 2. Mix Canestan cream with Advantan (Methylprednisolone) cream in equal amount and apply two times a day for 14 days. 3. Take capsule Fluconazole 150 mg once in a week for two weeks. 4.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary.

I felt a little comfort. But for getting more effectiveness I increased myself the dose of Clonazepam upto 2 mg for anxiety, panic attacks, etc. Now I am quite well using the above-mentioned medicines and I do not miss my dose (Escitalopam 10 and at night 2 mg Clonazepam). Now I am facing serious problems of sexual erection due to which my marriage life is disturbing because my libido is too much low. It is requested to kindly help me or advise me in the matter.","Doctor":"Hello. I am sorry to hear about your situation. I can imagine how hard it must be for you. I would put forward a few things you need to consider right now. First of all, Clonazepam at a dose of 2 mg if used for long duration can be addictive. This medication should be used only for initial few weeks or months to stabilize the anxiety symptoms. Escitalopram unfortunately can cause sexual side effects, what you can do is, if medication is working for you, ask your doctor to add something for sexual side effects or you can ask for changing the medication. Please do not worry as this is a common side-effect and only stays till the medication is going on and it gets normal after a few days of stopping the medication. Please do not stop medications suddenly, you need to taper them off and also take an alternative medicine otherwise your OCD symptoms can come back. You can start therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy will help you with OCD symptoms and this will help you getting off of medications soon."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis.

In cases of gestational diabetes mellitus with gestational hypertension at 36 weeks of gestation, there are chances that there occurs delayed maturation of fetal lungs which can prevent the baby from baby breathing after birth due to immature lungs. So considering your history and placental separation or abruption, Betnesol or betamethasone injections have been prescribed for intramuscular use as a prophylactic measure to promote fetal lung maturity with these antenatal corticosteroids. Ideally, the fetal lungs mature by 34 weeks in a normal pregnancy but in GDM with superimposed gestational hypertension and in IUGR cases, it has been delayed to 37 weeks to 38 weeks, so as a precautionary measure Betnesolinjections are being given for the fetal well-being in case, your condition deteriorates any time hence.

It is now more defined and a lot easier to see in photos. It is still only about 2 to 3 mm and pretty faint.

I am sorry dear, the picture becomes little blurry when I try to zoom it, to appreciate finer features. I am very sure your dermatologist would have looked at the spot with a dermoscope. With dermoscopy, the dermatologist can make out abnormal changes that are concerning. Even if it is doubtful feature leaning towards melanoma, your dermatologist would have done a shave biopsy to rule out that minimal possibility. After cryotherapy, the area becomes dark, it scabs and falls off after five to seven days. I can understand your concern as you had a melanoma in situ removed recently. Observe the treated spot for another week, allow the spot to heal completely. After a week, if you feel it is still there, then you can undergo shave biopsy which would say precisely what it is.

Form history and medication history, it seems he has liver cirrhosis. In other words it is called scarring of liver, shrunken liver, or chronic liver disease. Well the medications he is on, and recent history of tapping of abdominal water, suggest he has advanced disease which require a close follow up and listing such patient on liver transplantation. The liver transplantation is the only definite therapy for advanced liver scarring such as in your's father case.

The one such score require blood investigations, radiological test such as Contrast enhanced CT scan. The reason why you do not see any improvement even after 2 months of treatment is that all treatment is just supportive and does not correct underlying problem within liver, except Entaliv which is used for suppression of hepatitis B infection. To correct underlying liver, it is liver transplantation which could help.

I am a self-employed guy, my work timings are quite odd like 10 pm to 5 am. I wake up by 12 pm and then work from 2 pm - 8 pm (this includes working, meetings, get together with friends and coffee). I do not prefer eating outside, to be safe. My eating schedule for breakfast has bread with vegetables or 2 rotis or parathas cooked with olive oil. Then I go out and have black coffee in a coffee shop close to my office. Then I return by 8 pm and have dinner directly. At night, while working, I have cherries, berries or milk depending on my mood.I think I am feeling a bit weak or sick due to hot weather in my place. Yesterday at 2 pm, I decided to go to work, but I returned back as it was really hot here around 45-degreeCelsius. At that time, I felt like my legs were shaking while driving, and I felt like not going to the workplace. So I came back and slept. After an hour, I felt like super active, but again, when I went out after just an hour, I became exhausted and again felt like not doing any work or talking to anyone. I checked for fever and had nothing. My question is, what is causing this? How to get away from this feeling? How to stay active so that I can work productively? Please note: I do not get time to exercise because of my work schedule.","Doctor":"Hi. Please find my observations below. It appears that your body is not prepared for the heat conditions prevailing in your place. Since you have work schedules which start in the early afternoon, it is possible that you got dehydrated with electrolyte loss which might have resulted in your feeling unusual weakness. The main electrolytes in our body are sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and phosphate. These have to be present at normal levels at all times. If these get low due to any reason, then there is weakness, and people feel unusually sick. Heat stroke conditions might have caused fluid and electrolyte imbalance like symptoms. If you are used to your daily work schedule, then your sleep and food timings are not a concern. However, you should start having lots of fluids with electrolytes so that the balance is maintained when you leave home at 2 pm. Please keep in mind that with a temperature of 45-degree Celsius, there is a higher chance to develop fluid and electrolyte loss. Another point I would like to discuss is the cooler or air conditioner setting at home just before you left out yesterday. If the room cooler was at 20 to 25 degrees Celsius and you had suddenly gone out to 45-degree Celsius, then this itself would have caused a temperature imbalance and precipitated your exhaustion. Please shut down the cooler and then stay in the room for 5 minutes to allow your body to adapt to the temperature outside. Do not rush out. Even when you go to work in your car, please maintain a mild air conditioning so that when you step out, you will not feel much difference in the afternoon. Please keep fluids and fresh juices with you at home and office and carry a water bottle with ORS (Oral Rehydration Salts) solution or juice while driving. If you feel exhausted, then stop safely and drink the ORS or juice to keep you healthy and hydrated."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I recently got a septoplasty and my doctor said that I had a deviated septum.

My doctor has prescribed me a topical steroid cream, Anovate and I used it for about eight months. My fissure was healed, but I was left with constant pain, itching and pricking sensation around the anus while walking. I was not able to walk normally. Every time, when I walk for around 5 minutes, I am developing pricking, itching and burning sensation around the anus. I do not have any fissure now, but my bowel movements are painful. I have even developed stretch marks around the anus. Since, it is a steroid cream, my doctor advised that it will take some time to recover. But, I am really scared and do not know what to do. My main point of concern is whether the skin will recover to normal or not. I just stopped using the steroid cream 1 year ago and now I am using only coconut oil. But, the itching and stinging still persists. Is there any possibility of skin thinning? How long will it take to recover?","Doctor":"Hello. Anal fissure develops due to erosion of anal mucosa during hard straining particularly in constipated person. This is the main cause for it. So, prevention or treatment of constipation is very important. Once the anal mucosa get eroded due to straining, then the normal healing process starts which is similar to healing after any wound on the skin. Continuous pricking sensation and itching is because of this healing process. During this natural process, the eroded mucosa is replaced by a fibrosed tissue. If this fibrous tissue goes little deep up to the muscle layer, which work during defecation, then it affects its function also. This is the reason for the feeling of continuous spasm like pain during sitting or walking. Anal fissure is an irreversible process because once fibrous tissue is developed then it cannot be returned to normal tissue. Anovate cream (combination of Phenylephrine, Lidocaine and Betamethasone) will help during active fissure (early stage of the fissure) and on healing (inflammation) to reduce symptoms. No, Anovate cream does not cause thinning of skin. You must stop using it as you do not have active fissure now. Even stop using coconut oil as it has only soothing effect. You can use only topical anesthetic agent like Lidocaine to get relief from the symptoms. Again, fissure can never be replaced by normal skin or mucosa. If the fissure is so severe and it affects daily routine life, then consider for surgery. I like to know more about your bowel habit and any other associated rectal condition like piles, which may also cause a fissure. Constipation. Piles. Topical anesthetic agent application. Avoid constipation. For further doubts consult a medical gastroenterologist online.--->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 21 years old and my height is 5'7\\" and my weight is 57kg.

It can however be just constitutional. But it is not uncommon to have some organic causes behind this problem. If there is any organic cause, it should be evaluated. If you have any loose stools, pain in the abdomen or anemia then you would require evaluation for Coeliac disease. In case you have fever or weight loss, you would require evaluation for intestinal tuberculosis. I would advise you to get anti TTG (Tissue Transglutaminase) antibody test done to rule out malabsorption syndrome like Coeliac disease. You should also get a thyroid profile done to rule out any issues like hyperthyroidism that can cause weight loss. If you have any cough, expectoration then get a chest x-ray done to rule out any evidence of tuberculosis. If no cause is found, this might be just constitutional and requires just a good diet and exercise. Share my opinion with your doctor. Stay healthy.

The new crown was high and right after that 14 started to ache. My gum is fine and it is not swollen. My dentist checked with a cold test and it was extremely sensitive. My dentist suggested me to extract it and then put an implant after 3 months. He said one of the roots is untreated and have an abscess at the very end of the root, since I have TMD issues. He does not want to irritate my jaw muscles and joints twice because, if the retreatment fails, then I need an extraction. I am super nervous because of my TMD issues.

I took Regestrone to delay my periods because I planned to get intimate the same day as my periods.

I had sex many times the next night but with protection and took an i-pill to be sure. Next week got light periods that were very painful.

It is impossible for a urine pregnancy test to show false negative six weeks after sex. Delay in periods may be as a result of anovulation due to stress or infection as well as because of gaining weight. For regular ovulation and to avoid hormonal imbalance, it is advisable to maintain your weight. Healthy BMI (body mass index) is essential for our overall health as well as reproductive health. No pregnancy will be seen in ultrasound when a urine pregnancy test is negative. If you had regular periods previously, you can wait for a week for the start of menses.

Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. You can have two of these conditions. This is what I can diagnose based on your history that you have given very well. Either chronic ear problem with a perforated eardrum or a fungal infection of the ear canal and drum. Perforation of the drum explains most of your symptoms like hearing loss, giddiness, repeated discharges from the ear and itching inside the ear. Fungal infection of the ear can also produce similar symptoms but it is mostly pain, fullness, ear discharge, and sometimes reduced hearing. Among the two, considering you have been having this problem since a very long time, I would say, it is perforation of the eardrum and a chronic discharging ear. For this problem, we need to check inside the ear using a camera or an otoscope. For the same, you must visit an ENT specialist rather than a physician. An otoendoscope is present in most ENT centers these days which can help you also see the problem inside the ear. Now let us assume you have a perforation. The next step is keeping the ear dry. For the same, an acute infection is treated with special antibiotics (which are better for ear infections) and thereafter you may use a hearing aid or undergo tympanoplasty operation. The relative benefits and side effects of hearing aids with perforation and tympanoplasty can be explained to you if you require. First, let us stop the discharge. If you were to come to me for this issue and if I could diagnose it as chronic perforation syndrome, then I would put you on a course of Ofloxacin 200 mg one tablet twice daily, with Lorfast 10 mg (Loratadine) one tablet once daily, Singulair 10 mg (Montelukast) one tablet once daily and Recofast (Phenylephrine and Triprolidine) tablet half tablet in the morning. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. I would simultaneously rule out nose and throat problems as they can be the cause for recurrent ear problems. You would have to keep the ear dry, with special care during bathing so that water does not enter the ear. Once the ear is dry, I would advise you to go for a hearing test called pure tone audiogram. Any audiology center will be able to do this test. Based on the report of the test, we will have to tune our long-term management. Remember that the test should be done when there is no active disease. I hope I have given you a good picture of the problem. Do write back for more details and any doubt you want to clear.

As soon as he wiped himself, we again got closer and our genitals rubbed and touched although there was no intercourse. I am very much afraid that this can result in a pregnancy.

Should I go for an I-pill or Unwanted 72? I am afraid of the side effects. Please revert soon as I am very stressed.","Doctor":"Hello. If your cycles have been regular, then intimacy on day-20 of your cycle would place you in the safe period. The life of the ovum is only 24 hours and ovulation occurs by mid-cycle. Also, there was no intercourse involved. Pre-cum has sperms, but if the ejaculation was outside and only the vaginal lips were touched, it becomes difficult for the sperms to travel all the way to the tubes without a traveling medium. I-pill is not indicated for this exposure. However, to stop your anxiety, you may take it and shall experience withdrawal bleed in the next five to seven days which will indicate that there is no pregnancy. The earliest you can take a pregnancy test is after seven days post exposure with a serum beta hCG test. So, if you do not wish to take I-pill, you can get this test done after seven days, which if negative, will rule out pregnancy conclusively. For more information consult an Ob/Gynac doctor.

So, I got anxious and took an RNA PCR real time test on the 21st day and the result was 'target not detected (20 ml copies)'. Again, on the 28th day, I took HIV 1 and 2 and p24 CMIA method test, where the result was non-reactive and the index value was 0.08 and again took on the 45th day, the same HIV 1 and 2 and p24 CMIA test. The result was nonreactive (index value 0.12). My question is, still do I need to take further tests or move on with my life?","Doctor":"Hello. The chance of transmission of HIV by the given description is almost nil. The wound in your finger (if at all present) most likely would have partially dried up. The skin is an effective barrier for HIV. The chances of transmission would be almost nil. The HIV RNA PCR test is negative after 12 days is conclusive enough. The antibodies tests are repeatedly negative. The chance of HIV test results coming positive later is nil. But, it may be better to go for HIV antibodies tests after three months to have final conclusive results.

Is there any possibility of getting pregnant or not?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, there are high chances of getting pregnant but you must seek medical attention before getting pregnant to optimize your general health up to maximum so that if you end up with a healthy conception and rhesus negative is important if the mother is negative and husband is positive but in your case it is opposite.

The interval between initiation of sexual stimulus and ejaculation or orgasm is depended upon the many factors and varies from person to person. It can be from less than two minutes to more than five minutes. 2. and 3. The masturbation can be done in any position. There are no side-effects of prone masturbation.

Asthalin (Salbutamol) syrup is recommended for all types of wheezing. You can take up to 10 ml (2 lids) three times a day. If you get increased heartbeat after taking Asthalin, then we have to change to inhaler form. If not, syrup Asthalin is fine. But there are various other drugs to prevent wheezing episodes.

I did not drink a lot but ended up with the worst panic attack. I did not go to the hospital. A week later, everything was fine, but I had some stressful events in my life. Now, I am experiencing anxiety, and it is not controllable. A lot of overthinking and I am wondering if Oxycodone could be the one to blame. I have had anxiety way before, and it just went away. But, now it is occurring again. Could Oxycodone affect my brain terribly? I had a blood test a month ago, and everything was normal.","Doctor":"Hi. It is not due to Oxycodone because its plasma half-life is 4 to 5 hours. It is completely eliminated or metabolized by the body after 12 hours, so there is no question of the previous drug causing such anxiety episodes. I would suggest you consult a physician or to take Chlordiazepoxide 10 mg two times a day. Also, include 20 minutes of exercise in your schedule apart from the daily routine activity because the body gets acclimatized to that schedule. Because, that would cause secretion of endorphin, which is an antidepressant hormone. It is very common to have anxiety episodes these days, so do not worry.

Your total WBC count is borderline low. It can be decreased temporarily due to some inflammation. You have to repeat CBC (complete blood count) after ten days to recheck total WBC count. Your low MCV, high red blood cell count and borderline low hemoglobin could be due to some hemoglobinopathy. For that, I suggest you investigate further with Hb electrophoresis by HPLC method (high-performance liquid chromatography) and serum iron profile study. You can revert with reports once done to guide you further.

It is not really in one particular area, but right now I feel like more on the left side. It is a dull, achy pain that does not really go away. I have also noticed lymph nodes swell up for about a week. I am not sure if this is correlated to the chest since I have had that for months.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. Your chest pains seem to be muscular in nature. Another possibility is of acid reflux that can also cause such kind of pains. We should also rule out any cardiac issues in case of chest pains. So, you should get a chest X-ray and ECG done. If the ECG and chest X-ray are normal, the pain is probably muscular or due to acid reflux. For muscular pain, I advise to do hot fomentation over the involved area 3 to 4 times a day. You can also apply Diclofenac gel locally over the involved area. On taking this treatment, this usually resolves in 5 to 7 days. In case you have pain in abdomen, and acid reflux, I would advise you to take a combination of Pantoprazole and Domperidone.

He had around three bouts in six months indicates most probably type D COPD and he may require long term controlled oxygen therapy to further not to deteriorate. Oxyhemoglobin curve is sigmoid in shape and his partial O2 may fall in steep part. The steep portion of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is the range that exists at the systemic capillaries (a small drop in systemic capillary p(O2) can result in the release of large amounts of oxygen for the metabolically active cells and this may result in respiratory failure.

Do not immediately sit or rest after meals, but have a walk for 10 to 15 minutes. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. Also, the sleep pattern should be normal as much as possible.

I have had an MRI and the doctor noted that I have bowel wall thickening in my distal colon. Before that, I did a stool test that was negative in Calprotectin and I had a CDSA it showed no inflammation negative for Lactoferrin. No bacterial infection. I also had a colonoscopy and it showed clear. Why there are pain and bowel wall thickening?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand you must be very upset about your ill health. So the comprehensive stool analysis is well within normal limits-particularly calprotectin and lactoferrin which are inflammatory markers. Their absence theoretically excludes any inflammation within the bowel, hence a good finding. The MRE examination and its reporting is a subjective findings means it is interpreted by a radiologist and may sometime have an error in reporting because of differential enhancement pattern within bowel and bowel movements at the time of scan, plus given your colonoscopy report afterward also showed no pathology, suggest it was possibly an error in interpretation. The colonoscopy is however, the best modality to explain the MRE (magnetic resonance electrography) reported findings. Given normal colonoscopy suggest that the possibility of inflammation is unlikely. Now coming to your symptoms and use of medication that you believe helped for some time. From your history, I understand you have been given Mesalamine for the duration of seven months after a colonoscopy that showed colitis and biopsy showed non-specific inflammation. So first of all, Mesalamine is an anti-inflammatory drug which is commonly being given among patient suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The IBD is further classified into ulcerative colitis (UC) which is a superficial inflammation usually of large bowel starting down from rectum and goes above to involve large bowel. The other one is Crohn's disease (CD) which is somewhat deeper inflammation of the gut wall having a tendency to involve almost every part of the gut starting from the mouth toward the anus. Given your symptoms of mucus or pus discharge and presence of pancolitis on one of your colonoscopy make me think that there is a possibility of ulcerative colitis. Plus the response you observed to Mesalamine is also favoring this diagnosis. Your second colonoscopy did not show any inflammation, possibly because of the remission of the disease. The UC tend to have an intermittent course with flares and intervening remissions. Possibly at the time of second colonoscopy, the disease was in remission. Given your recent stool test and recent normal colonoscopy, make me think that you do not have active disease at the moment. Your disease seems to be controlled with Budesonide or previous Mesalamine you took. The mucus/pus discharge suggests that there may be some other problem such as anal fissure, anal fistula, or anal sinus which may accompany the ulcerative colitis in its course. For this, I want you to examine your perianal (bottom) area and see from where exactly the mucus is coming. The abdominal pain may be just because of stress and anxiety accompanying the current situation and not necessarily the active disease. For such pain SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are helpful. For treatment, I need to have the biopsy report of your colon (both the previous one and recent one), as I can see there is ongoing microscopic inflammation. Budesonide is an expensive drug and it is recommended in UC where the inflammation does not go beyond the left side of the colon. You had pan colitis (inflammation involving the whole colon) and that is why oral steroids such as tablet Prednisolone is more effective than Budesonide. The physician prescribes Budesonide over oral Prednisolone if the patient is unable to tolerate the systemic side effects which accompany oral Prednisolone, or patient has diabetes and bone mineral deficiency. Your physician probably kept this thing in mind. So to summarize: 1. You likely have ulcerative colitis because I did not see biopsy of your bowel, and as you said it was nonspecific. 2. The UC is in remission 3. The pus and mucus have to be closely examined by you or by a physician by doing a digital rectal examination. 4. The UC can frequently accompany depression and anxiety and that should be taken care of abdominal pain possibly related to stress and you consider taking SSRI at minimum dose like tablet Escitalopram 10 mg daily 5. Discuss with your primary gastroenterologist regarding oral Prednisolone if he is convinced enough. You may share your biopsy reports, I can advise you on this as well. One more thing, since you do not have any sign suggestive of active disease, the steroid are not required at the moment. You need to be given some immunosuppressive medications to control and prevent relapse/flare. The one more reason for your doctor prescribed Budesonide is he might have considered microscopic colitis which is entirely a different diagnosis and requires entirely a different management approach. You share me the biopsy and colonoscopy reports that will make me in a good position to tell you what to do now. And sorry for such a huge description and lengthy message.

I am having cramping pain in my left calf. It feels like a rubber band is wrapped around my leg. It is better when sitting but hurts when outstretched. I am on Enbrel and previous medical history includes low blood pressure and low cholesterol. My recent blood work is normal and only a little thing off was anion gap.","Doctor":"Hi.

I have used an antifungal cream on it for one day so far, but I am not sure how to tell if it is actually fungal or not.","Doctor":"Hi. From the picture provided (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it is most likely to be a viral infection like herpes or a contact dermatitis. These lesions are usually tiny grouped blisters and cause pain. They last for about 7-10 days and resolve spontaneously. However, they may get infected secondarily oozing pus and spreading to surrounding area. You can apply Mupirocin cream to prevent further infection.

I was raped six to seven times and faced domestic abuse for four months until I escaped. Each time sex has been hard for me. After the domestic abuse, it is so bad that I have to stop in some strokes and if not then I will throw up on them.Sometimes it happens with just fingers in me. Though I remind myself that I am safe, my body cannot understand it. Why is it like this? It has been happening for years. Does that mean it will happen forever? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I can understand your situation and feelings. I can assure you that this is not going to be with you forever. You would benefit from counseling and therapeutic techniques such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) by a clinical psychologist experienced in handling of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) following sexual trauma. I am sure you may have gone through some self-help resources and may have got in touch with support groups. If you did not, then please do so. Some groups can prove really helpful. A commonly followed helpful technique is to write down the whole traumatic experiences several times (and read them aloud to yourself in privacy, and of course destroy the papers immediately). This can be very painful in the first one or two instances, but soon the pain recedes and you will feel much much better with each rewriting episode. Do this until you no longer experience that intense stress. And every moment, keep in mind that its not your fault and its those who perpetrated that should be guilty. With counseling and therapy you will find positive changes sooner and would be able to improve the quality of life. My best wishes to you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an i-phone application developer. I am suffering from fungal infection for the past one year. It is like ringworms. I am so scared. I am currently on Syntran 200 mg, Histafree 180 mg, Hicope and Onabet B cream. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You have mentioned using Panderm and Terbinaforce plus cream. Both of them contain steroids and lead to worsening of fungal infection rather than cure. You should stop using them immediately. You have not mentioned the duration of use of Syntran capsule and Onabet B cream but if you are not having benefit after 10 days of use then you can consider resistant fungi and change the medicines. Continue with Hicope (Hydroxyzine) and Histafree (Fexofenadine) for itching. You can apply Luliconazole cream on the affected area once daily and take tablet Terbinafine 250 mg once daily for two weeks and then revert back. Also keep your soap and towel seperate.

So you now need to get a serum beta hCG test done, which is a blood test. If the hCG levels are more than 5 mIU then you are surely pregnant and the bleeding occurring hence would be termed as threatened miscarriage. The next step would be to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound to check for location of pregnancy and any sub chorionic haemorrhage exists. If it does, then the best treatment shall be absolute bed rest with Progesterone support to allow support for placentation.

Fibromyalgia has a condition in which the whole body has pain with fatigue. The patient suffers from difficulty in walking, standing, breathing, etc. Neuropathy is a condition in which peripheral nervous system gets damaged gradually causing tingling, prickling, burning sensation in hand and feet. As per Ayurveda such kinds of symptoms occur in aggravated Vata Dosa and vitiated Kapha Dosha. So you can go through Ayurvedic management to this issue along with your previous medications. Infections, degenerative diseases, surgery, traumatic stress physical or mental, autoimmune disease, uncontrolled high blood sugar, unknown etiology, etc. MRI whole body, serum electrolytes, creatinine kinase, blood pressure, and sugar. Myopathy, chronic fatigue syndrome, ligaments or tendons injuries. As per Ayurveda, whole-body external and internal oileation therapy is required.

Bruhat Vatachintamani Rasa 1 tablet + Rasaraja Rasa 1 tablet twice a day after meals with cow ghee. 2. Guggulu Panchtikta ghrita 1 teaspoon thrice a day before meals. 3.

I started taking the pill immediately (the same day as the procedure) and have taken it religiously at the same time daily ever since. I was put on Doxy as an antibiotic to make sure I did not get an infection after the procedure. I finished the full course of antibiotics. I had sex with my boyfriend 11 days after abortion and took the Plan B pill the next morning within 15 hours. Between my regular pill and the emergency contraceptive is taken so soon, how likely is it that I am covered?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for the query. Firstly as you had a surgical abortion, it was any way sure that you would not ovulate soon in this cycle and your menses would be delayed. But, you chose to be on the oral contraceptive, which was correct, but at the same time, Doxycycline as an antibiotic would have reduced the efficacy per se. So after 11 days of abortion when you had sex, it is unlikely that you would have ovulated for another four to five days. But, to cover up, you took a Plan B pill (emergency contraceptive pill) which is again protective towards pregnancy in your case. So, overall you are protected, and I suggest you should stop your daily contraceptive pill as of now and wait for a early withdrawal bleed and then can restart the pills from day 2 of bleeding. You are pregnancy safe. Relax."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 8 months pregnant.

Fetal echocardiography is not 100 percent reliable, so cardiac defects cannot be solely decided on imaging. Comprehensive patient history, other illnesses, medicines taken during pregnancy, and family history are important. If the fetus is normal with regular movements and growth, and no signs of fetal stress, then one should be satisfied about the fetus.

However, if the testis is completely undescended, then it is advisable to do orchidopexy surgery before the age of 2 years."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 16 years old and not good.

Smile is a complex process executed by a group of muscles and nerves. If you are having difficulty while smiling, then it could be because of psychological or organic cause.

Usually, people recover from emotional trauma with support and passage of time. It depends on the severity of symptoms and the trauma involved. Family and friends should offer the patient psychosocial support. Support the person to look after themselves and provide a listening ear whenever needed. Try to distract them from pensive thoughts by joining in music, movies, plays, etc. Encourage them to go exercise regularly. Patience and perseverance are needed in helping them to recover.

It is a process where our white blood cells who are our protectors are attacking foreign bacterial or viral cells. Sometimes these white cells may turn against our own cells leading to chronic inflammation. That is why you are feeling pain all over.   The drug your doctor has prescribed is probably Hydroxychloroquine. We thought this tablet works only against malaria. But it also has other actions like lowering inflammation by our white cells.

As you mentioned, your ultrasound suggested portal vein thrombosis. See, there are several reasons for this condition, but at this age, it may be due to prothrombotic condition in your blood that means due to some reasons like genetic, medication or another disease. Your blood is hypercoagulable and tends to make more clot in internal vessels like the portal vein. Other reasons can be any abdominal infection. As you mentioned blood tests are normal I believe your doctor has done all thrombophilia work up to rule out hypercoagulable state in the blood. You may need to take anticoagulant medication to make the blood thin. If all workup in a blood test is negative you may need to take that medicine for 3 to 6 months till, if any report suggests hypercoagulable state you may need indefinite medication. You also need to follow up ultrasound to see the response of medication. You may also need to do upper GI endoscopy to rule out any dilated veins in the esophagus and stomach secondary to portal vein thrombosis and that dilated vein can bleed, so if it is present, the doctor can give you specific treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, This is regarding my friend's infection condition.

Once that gets treated smell will come back. But in chronic sinusitis, the smell may or may not come back due to prolong disease. 2. Avamys should be helpful. These steroids sprays reduce inflammation inside our sinuses and nose. For steroid sprays to act in our nose we should have wide sinus openings. To see if you have space in your nose for sprays to act you will have to get plain CT scan of nose and paranasal sinuses done. If your nose is very crowded and infected then you will have to undergo endoscopic sinus surgery which will remove active disease and inflammation. Following surgery, you will have to continue sprays for a few months to avoid recurrence and it will make your nasal mucosa healthy and you will be able to smell. 3.

Recently, I took Trazodone for this problem, but I had to wean myself off Fluoxetine completely. I took Trazodone for two weeks, and I started getting full erections, but my depression came back with a vengeance. And I started having dangerous side effects of Trazodone, so I stopped taking it and went back to Fluoxetine. I took Cialis for a week or two, and I was able to get full erections. But this week, again I am not getting full erections, and my mood is very distressing. I was fine for a while after taking 5 mg of Cialis. What should I do? Will Trazodone work for erections while I take Fluoxetine and Cialis? Will it give a boost to get hard erections like before?

Please answer me the following questions to give more accurate treatment. Revert back with the answers to a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, All my life (since as far back as I can remember in early childhood) I have struggled with chronic insomnia. I have tried every sorts of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment you could imagine, having seen at least seven doctors over 15 years. I have tried everything from zolpidem and similar drugs (no improvement with these drugs) and the benzos (tolerance problems, not good for long term use), to hydroxyzine (ineffective) and trazodone (still cannot sleep and makes me feel ill the next day). Also I have tried antipsychotics like quetiapine and all sorts of other drugs, and really either they do not work at all, the tolerance issue makes them unsuitable for long term use, or else the side effect profile is too nasty for daily use. I have even been treated with SSRIs and other drugs to rule out underlying anxiety issues. I find myself a very calm person, and my friends know me that way. Also I have been seeing various therapists for years in terms of learning to deal with modifying my lifestyle. I also meditate, practise yoga etc., and only the yoga/stretching helps, but just barely. Finally I was living in Japan for a while where a local psychiatrist put me on etizolam 0.5mg to 2mg per night for sleep. I tried 0.5mg for a few nights without help. 1mg also did nothing. 1.5mg put me to sleep, but I still had this trouble with constantly waking up in the middle of the night as usual. So finally I tried 2mg, and that did the trick. For the first time in my life I could fall asleep at will and stay asleep all night until time to get up, and then not feel all sorts of sleepy/sickly side effects upon awakening. At least in the moment, this has been a wonder drug for me. Now I am back in the United States, so I get my etizolam sent in from abroad. I have been on it for three months at 2mg, sleeping successfully and living a better life, with no tolerance issues. Now, being that it is a benzodiazepine derivative, there is obviously the potential for tolerance. And while I know that with benzodiazepines tolerance is an issue, I also know that the potential for building a tolerance for each benzo depends on the condition being treated. For example my brother takes clonazepam daily for anxiety for years at the same dosage, and while most of the effects have worn off due to tolerance (euphoria, sedation), the anxiolytic effect is as strong as ever and he remains without unbearable anxiety just as well as the day he started. At the same time, if you are looking to \\"get high\\" on clonazepam, that effect, you might know, is gone pretty fast. And the anticonvulsant effects only last for a certain amount of time, too. I am sure none of this is new to you, and I only mean to point out that with the benzos the potential for tolerance depends largely on the symptom being treated. Might be a few weeks of good use of clonazepam for seizures, only a few days for getting high, a month for sedation but years for anti-anxiety (making these numbers up, but you see what I mean). And I only put this all here because I am afraid of getting this response that \\"people build a tolerance to etizolam and so it must not be taken long term.\\" Because the question is to which effect do people build a tolerance, and how quickly, and what percentage of the people, etc. So Iam wondering if there is a strong tolerance effect to etizolam for its anti-anxiety and (in Japan, at least) anti-depressant effect, how does it do for its anti-insomnia abilities? What is the consensus on this matter, and what is your own personal opinion? And has there been any research done on it at all, or is it all based on clinical observation/clinical wisdom? If there have been any studies could you point me to one or two? Have you personally prescribed etizolam for sleep? And if so, have you ever done it for daily use? And is it always, in your case, used only in the short term? And if you have seen patients use it for more than a few weeks/months, was there a point where it just was no longer effective? And how long did it tend to take for it not to be effective anymore? And finally, is it the case that it tends to work quite well for long term use for some patients but not for others, and if so, any idea as to whether it tends to work well that way for more patients or for less? Thank you so much for any help you can give me.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all I would like to congratulate you and your doctor for finding a solution for your long standing problem which caused lots of impairment at your end. Regarding your statement \\"people build a tolerance to etizolam and so it must not be taken long term\\" I like to clarify that it is only partially true. Although tolerance is a major issue with all benzos, research has found that etizolam is associated with \\"Reverse Tolerance\\" a phenomena in which requirement for dose decreases with passage of time in contrast to tolerance. In two different studies reverse tolerance has been found for anti anxiety effects and anticonvulsant properties. In one another study etizolam was found to be associated with no tolerance for anti convulsant properties. Regarding its antidepressant properties, I am unable to comment at this moment as there are no studies which conclusively state that it has antidepressant properties. But if you extrapolate findings from available studies I am of the opinion that etizolam is significantly not associated with tolerance for its sedative, hypnotic and antidepressant properties. There is no consensus about development of tolerance for insomnia treatment as it is not available in countries which drive research in psychiatry. Other than this at present, it is recommended for short term use that might be the reason that no one knows its effect or side effect over long term use. According to your history that states you are maintaining on the same dose (2mg) for last three months, it is unlikely that you are going to develop tolerance for its sedative properties, as development of tolerance is affected by particular drug along with genotype of individual. Regarding my personal clinical experience with Etizolam: I started prescribing Etizolam in June 2010 when an Indian pharma company launched it in India. Since that time I used this drug for anti-anxiety properties in majority of individuals. Two of my patients who were prescribed etizolam are maintaining on the same dose for more than two years on the same dose (1 mg at bed time for insomnia and 0.25 mg twice a day for GAD Generalized Anxiety Disorder). Fortunately till date both of them are maintaining well till date and none of them complained of development of tolerance. Although it is recommended for short term use for the insomnia patient (almost duplicate copy of you) has found this drug after almost 1 year of suffering and he refused to discontinue this saying that \\" doctor you know I am suffering for all these years. None of your prescriptions worked for me.\\" After taking all precautions I decided to continue prescribing etizolam to that particular patient. Although my experience is limited (around 4 years) with Etizolam and it is difficult to make statement about etizolam but with available literature and according to my clinical experience I consider etizolam as non tolerance developing drug although it acts on benzodiazepine receptors. The reason behind different property of etizolam in comparison to other benzos, lies in its structure. Etizolam is exactly not a benzodiazepine. Its benzene ring is replaced by thiophene ring. It belongs to thienodiazepine derivative that acts on various benzodiazepine receptors. I hope I answered your query but still if you feel some thing is left, please contact me again. I will be happy to answer everything related to psychiatry. If you feel it is appropriate to have a face to face discussion you can get an appointment for an online video consultation. Or talk to one of our psychiatrist on a phone call -->  Thanks and best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am using Clobetamil G cream since four years. But I did not get any irritations or side effects. But, if I stop using that cream I become very dark. If I consult a doctor, there is no use but if I use that cream again I will become very fair. Maybe my skin is addicted to this cream. What shall I do for this? Please suggest me.","Doctor":"Hi. Clobetamil (Clobetasol and Gentamycin) is a strong topical corticosteroid cream, it is not a fairness cream. Clobetamil makes your skin very thin. That is why you feel you are getting fair. Thinning of skin makes it more sensitive to sunlight. Clobetamil is useful for eczema and other steroid-responsive dermatoses. Topical corticosteroids should never be used for more than two to three weeks at a stretch. There are many serious adverse effects of Clobetasol when used on the face for a long duration such as pimples, thinning of skin, visible blood vessels, rosacea, increased facial hairs (beard and mustache). When there is long-term usage, there can be an internal absorption of medicine causing more serious side effects. You need to see a dermatologist in person for assessing your skin status after four years of steroid use. Depending on your skin condition, you will be asked to reduce the use of steroids. Once you stop using Clobetamil, you should be prepared to notice pimples or rosacea depending on the response of your skin. All the adverse effects start after you stop using it, this is called rebound phenomenon.

So I have been texting so I thought it was just that but around 10 or 11 PM, the pain started to shoot down my leg as well, it hurts when I sit and walk and lift my leg.","Doctor":"Hello. Looking at your problem from very near, it would be sudden bending causing pressure on disc and protrusion to lumbar nerve causing shooting like pain on leg. The cold and even cough increase the inner disc pressure and causing nerve to more pressure which causes symptom worst. So I would recommend you to use lumbosacral belt on lumbar spine at lower back. I would also recommend some medicine to take for this problem and follow up with MRI for further improvement. Zanaflex (Tizanidine 4 mg PO bid for 1 week, capsule Neurontin (Gapapentin) 100 mg PO bid for one week, capsule Pantoprazole 40 mg once daily for one week."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My father is suffering from high BP from two days.

I have seen the echo report you provided (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is a normal echocardiography report. As your father is going through a tough phase and his BP is increased, it is better to give him antihypertension drugs provided by your doctor. (You have not provided drug details).

They did not want to eat from the plate so I fed them by hand, their dog food. I always was an anxious person so I eventually thought about it. Read the ingredients of the dog food and read meat flour. My mind went straight for mad cow disease risk. I thought I am sure these dog food have spinal itssue, brain, bone in the meat flour mix. Did my research and I am correct. Many dog food companies do that. So it is impossible to get rid of every trace of dog food from my clothes, keyboards, pockets, etc. I already did that but you know I was not aware of these for the time I was feeding them. My question is, in the worst case how much time do I have before the symptoms start? First expousure might been two months or a month and a half ago. I am thinking of blowing my savings and traveling before the symtoms start and then after I confirm the disease, do not even know what to do.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that usually cows affected by this disease are isolated and their meat is not used in industry, but it is burnt under specialist supervision. Anyway, the period from the first contact with a mad cow product and the disease symptoms may be as long as 10 to 15 years. So just do not think about it. I am sure that nothing bad is going to happen."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My buttocks got some skin disorder.

I passed carefully through your concern and would like to explain that your ECG recordings do not show any pathological changes (attachment removed to protect patient identity). So relax and do not worry about it. I just would like to recommend you discussing with your attending cardiologist on the possibility of further investigating any possible cardiac arrhythmia.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

In autism, there are issues with social communication, verbal communication, repeated stereotypic behaviours which I do no’t see in your description.

At 38 weeks of pregnancy when the head is a cephalic presentation but not yet fixed in the pelvis and there are no decelerations or fetal distress on CTG monitoring and if you do not have any high-risk factor-like IHCP or gestational hypertension with pre-eclampsia then there is actually no need to be induced before the labor starts naturally. There are certain set criteria for induction at 38 weeks or before as mentioned above, else at 39 weeks gestational diabetes, and at 40 weeks plus three days, if post diatoms and no labor initiated naturally, then induction should be done. I do not see any reason why you should be induced at present with AFI normal and heart rate acceptable. At this stage more than heart rate, CTG tracing is more important to assess the fetal well being. So please review with reports and ultrasound and CTG tracing or please furnish details of this being a high-risk pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am having jock itch for the last 22 months.

Most of the time, irregular periods are part of the normal changes that can happen when you are a teen. Sometimes, irregular periods can be caused by some medicines, exercising too much, having a very low or high body weight, or not eating enough calories. Hormone imbalances can also cause irregular periods. Included in these, more serious causes are ovarian cysts, thyroid problems, exogenous hormones. In view of you gaining weight and experiencing stomach pains I would suggest that you visit a gynecologist to have blood tests done and a pelvic ultrasound. FBC, thyroid function, hormone profile, B-hCG, pelvic ultrasound. Visit your gynecologist before doing anything."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a severe toothache and after getting permanent tooth filling done tiny pieces of tooth started to break. Now completely the tooth is fallen and when consulted a doctor he told dental implant of the tooth must be done because RCT can be done but as there is no root so the cap might come off again and again. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I am unable to understand your question completely. If there was no root then how was the filling done? And which tooth are you concerned about? Answer me with a photograph of the same in your follow up. As far your problem is concerned, permanent fillings do not come out that easily provided it is manipulation and filling and post filling procedures were all done correctly. Secondly, yes you can go for RCT only if there is a healthy supporting root. As far as the implant is concerned, you can opt it will be a perfect choice if you wish you may also go for prosthodontic bridge provided your adjacent teeth are healthy enough to give support. In the bridge, we take the support of one or two adjoining teeth and thus there is a set of 2 to 3 crowns which get fixed on healthy teeth hence your absent teeth gets a crown."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Our unborn baby is diagnosed with hydrocephaly in the 34th week (now).

A pediatrician and a pediatric neurosurgeon opinion should be taken for the same. TORCH infection needs to be ruled out in both the mother and the baby.

How can I make them go away? Please help. It hurts when touched.","Doctor":"Hi. Repeated boils on the body suggest that you may be closer to a source of infection or the treatment has been inadequate. Squeezing of boils may also lead to the spread of infection. If you have not found relief with antibiotics, you may require testing of pus from the boil to see which antibiotic suits you best. Marks that are left behind after the boils are healed will fade eventually. This can be hastened by skin lightening creams. Excess sweating, repeatedly wearing the same clothes and using unwashed towels. Pus culture and sensitivity. Miliaria, folliculitis. Mupirocin cream for the boils. Biluma cream to the marks once healed. Wash clothes in disinfected water and dry in the sunlight. Use a sweat absorbing body talc. Timely treatment of boils."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 53 years old, and have quit smoking 19 years ago. I still have a chronic cough. Each specialist tells me something different. The pulmonologist told me it was asthma, and another doctor said it was acid reflux disease. Now they are telling me it is COPD. I do not have diminished lung capacity or problem in breathing, no wheezing, out of breath when I run but, I am overweight and out of shape. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hello. There is not much of difference between asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is usually seen in a person who has smoked a lot while asthma is seen from childhood, which is not in your case. Acid reflux can cause prolonged duration cough, but it shall subside very well once treated for acid reflux. But in your case, it has persisted. So it has to be either COPD or infection of the lung. I would have favored COPD if you were investigated for Infection and found nothing. Hence I recommend specific tests for evaluating infection as the cause. Kindly get the following test done and revert with reports. CT chest, BAL microscopy (bronchoalveolar lavage) and culture, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), Montoux test. I hope this information was useful for you. Any clarification feel free to ask."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am contacting you on behalf of my grandmother who is suffering from a number of issues and advice from her regular doctors is not coming up with a decent solution. I have asked her to write down from her point of view about the problems and here it is. Ailments are diabetic, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Epileptic till the age of 50, She is 80 years.","Doctor":"Hi. The symptoms you are stating may be due to peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or major depression. Also, there may be associated hypothyroidism. Diabetes affects small nerves of the extremities and results in a non-specific sensory complaint like you stated. Did she undergo a nerve conduction velocity test of extremities? If not, then she should undergo that test to confirm the diagnosis. For diabetic neuropathy, she can take Duloxetine or Pregabalin, Amitriptyline. These drugs are started at a dose of 20 mg, 75 mg, 25 mg, respectively. These drugs reduce the increased sensitivity of your nerve endings and may help you alleviate your symptoms. Also, some symptoms may be due to hypothyroidism. For this, I suggest a free thyroxin and TSH test and TSH is found to be high, she can take a thyroid supplement. For the depression part, I think she is suffering from depressive illness. She can take Escitalopram (10), or Fluoxetine (20) in the morning to manage your depression. Also, she should take Methylcobalamin (500) thrice daily as this vitamin rejuvenates peripheral nerves and may reduce symptoms.I suggest to continue the antidiabetic medications and strict control of blood sugar is recommended."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 16 years old, and I am very worried about the health of my eyes. I have been having two problems with my eyes recently. One of my ongoing problems is twitch with my eyelids. I cannot keep my eye open for too long without this happening. It bothers me and distracts me a lot at school. The other problem I have is a small black dot that seems to float around in my eye. I cannot look straight without it appearing. I have this problem for a couple of months now, and I am starting to get worried. It frustrates me very much and bothers me when trying to learn at school. I sometimes have to use one eye to be able to read or see some things. I am worried about telling my parents and do not know how to say to a doctor without making an appointment.","Doctor":"Hello. Twitching eyes are due mostly to dry eyes in your age because of exposure to the computer monitor and prolonged use of mobile phone, which can be taken care of by the use of artificial tears (lubricating eye drops). The important issue is your left eye redness and black spot, which could be either because of swelling in your eye or a foreign body in the eye. It is a severe problem and should not be ignored. It needs an expert opinion and proper treatment. Once you consult an eye doctor and know the diagnosis we can discuss other issues"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Is it true that you need to expose your face to the sunlight to maintain facial bone structure?

For the past several months, I have been exhausted, had constant headaches, have bruises appearing without injury sometimes in strange places like my stomach, and have joint and bone pain. My dad has lymphoma, and my maternal grandmother died of blood cancer. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Based on your query, my opinion it is as follows, 1. It is highly unlikely. 2. Bruises, if it is appearing, could be platelet or vascular disorder. As CBC (complete blood count) is normal, platelet disorder is ruled out. Vascular disorder, if present requires study. 3. If a lymphoma is suspected, need to look for any lymph nodes enlargement. If there are any swelling in the neck, or axillary region or in the inguinal region, then it requires biopsy or FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology). 4. If there is a vascular disorder, injuries should usually start bruises if it is occurring, without any damage. Being a normal CBC, there is no leukemia. Lymphoma requires a search for lymph nodes.

She had swelling in limbs, private part, stomach, and eyes. She also had slight cold during that time, but no running nose or cough. I have attached her reports. From the last one week, we started medicine, post which the eye swelling (by 90 %), face, hand, legs have reduced and hand have also reduced, but the private part and stomach still have swelling. Overall swelling is still present. Urine check showed improved creatinine results after three days. Her weight has increased 1 kg from the last five days, everyday it is gradually increasing by 200 to 300 gm. Even prior to start of her treatment she had good appetite, she used to eat every few hour either a biscuit or yogurt or a fruit or bread slice. My questions are: In how many days does this swelling reduce? The doctor here suggests albumin infusion if the weight continues to increase or the body swelling does not reduce by five more days. Is it safe to use albumin infusion? Does it require admission into hospital? How many days should we wait before we decide on albumin infusion? Any other alternate to albumin infusion to reduce edema? When will we know if the medicine is working, the doctor say it takes maximum of 30 to know the impact? Whats happens if the child does not respond to the current medication, doctors here are not disclosing but I want to be prepared financially and mentally? What are the scenarios to take child immediately to hospital? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I can see clearly that your daughter’s condition is improving (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is the nephrotic syndrome of minimal change type as usually comes in the children. The reason behind less improvement in the private area and stomach edema is that steroids are causing central obesity and I believe that this is temporary and will subside when she tapers down the steroids (after remission of the disease). Supposedly steroids are reducing the amount of protein filtered in the kidney and consequently, serum albumin will improve with time without the need for albumin infusion. We might use albumin infusion with diuretics when albumin in blood is less than 2 g/dL, if there is marked hypovolemia or acute pulmonary edema or renal failure. Usually, children are responding to the steroids within 2 to 4 weeks, then after remission, tapering down the dose over about six weeks. Take your daughter to the hospital if there is marked shortness of breath or very low amount of urine or when she is severely unwell. Generally, the course of the disease is benign and it usually shows a good response to the treatment, I advise you to be patient with the doctors."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a 15-year-old son who was suffering from depression two months ago but is fine now except for having a few weird thoughts.

Please recommend the appropriate dosage.","Doctor":"Hello. The Shine 25 mg/d is an anti-depressant. You can start from 1/2 a pill at night (one hour before sleeping), if you do not use it then there will be no anti-depressant effect. The Cognium syrup is brain stimulating syrup, start from 1/2 of the recommended dose on the bottle. Give him a month and then if you see no effects then increase the dose to 1 pill of Shine and full dose of Cognium syrup. Lack of interest in studies could be a sign of depression. You may have to put more time and effort into studying with him."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, History: C4/5 and C5/6 disks removed three years back. C5/6 has been fused, and the C4/5 was replaced with an M6 artificial disc. Surgery was conducted by a surgeon. Around two years later, intermittent pains were occurring, with spasming flaring up about once a month. Neck pains, trapezius muscles, upper back constantly very tight, restricting the range of motion. Pain levels ranging from 2 to 8. The same surgeon has now informed me that there has been a malfunction in the M6 prosthesis, and there is now osteolysis that is dissolving the bone surrounding the artificial disk. Questions: 1.\\tIs the diagnosis correct? 2.\\tWhat is your recommended solution? 3.\\tHow soon would you recommend I do something about this? 4.\\tHow long would recovery take? 5.\\tWould you recommend physiotherapy? What type and for how long? 6.\\tHow long would it be before I could take a flight home? 7.\\tWould you recommend that the same surgeon do the procedure?

I have gone through your query, medical history, and attached reports in detail (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There seems to be significant osteolysis around the M6 prosthesis. His diagnosis is indeed correct and I would suggest you to go for physiotherapy session initially instead of going for a re-surgery. Though the results would be unpredictable, still it will give better results as compared to a re-surgery. You can take approximately one-month of physio (Laser, SWD, traction, neck exercises). You should wait for a month or so before you take a flight back home. You should consider another doctor, preferably a physiotherapist."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am in the process of getting ready for a dental bridge, a total of seven teeth order of porcelain fused and then a crown, etc. Now, tomorrow I am supposed to get a temporary bridge.

I was charged including a temporary bridge but now I am not getting one, just permanent.","Doctor":"Hi. Your temporary bridge was just for the time being that your dentist might have thought permanent will take time for fabrication, so temporary was only for your comfort and esthetic issues. Temporary is generally given if there is a delay in permanent and to check if the patient will be comfortable with the size, color and all or not. It is good that your permanent bridge has been fabricated before time, you just need to take this much care that when tomorrow before fixing permanent finally you will be asked by fitting it in your mouth if it is proper in size and comfortable or not, so be very fair to yourself and your dentist and do tell him or her whatever you feel so after that it will be their duty to fix it up whatever problem may arise."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I treated some HPV genital warts using cryogenic therapy, followed by applying a liberal amount of Podophyllin, which I left on overnight.

It has been about 8+ hours and the symptoms have not gotten better, or worse. I washed off the affected area with soap and water with the morning shower. Is there anything else I should do to treat the symptoms, and how much longer are they expected to continue?","Doctor":"Hi.

For the dry skin, first of all, I suggest you rule out hypothyroidism by serum TSH estimation and free T4 estimation. If no specific cause like thyroid is present, then you can use lotion over your dry skin. You can use Nivea or Cetaphil like moisturizing lotion over your dry skin. Usually, your skin texture will improve with any one of these lotions.

I have read that people have coughs after surgery. It is causing so much pain in my stomach.","Doctor":"Hello. In general anesthesia, a patient is put on ventilatory support as he cannot breathe during general anesthesia. To achieve this, we need to pass a tube, known as an endotracheal tube, down the throat to the lungs. This sometimes leads to some swelling or medically known as edema in the throat. Some patients are more sensitive than others, so they have the self-limiting cough till the edema subsides. You can take some throat lozenges apart from steam inhalation to help you. The cough will go once the edema subsides. Endotracheal intubation leading to airway edema. Upper respiratory tract infection. Symptomatic, with steam inhalation and throat lozenges.

I still want to have a professional point of view on it, though, because I only made this conclusion from observations and comparisons.And I only recently (a year or so ago) started realizing that some things I thought to be normal, were not. What I believe to be my symptoms are hallucinations that I remember having since I was 4 (and maybe even before then). Having trouble in telling the difference between shadows and silhouette of living beings, not having any distinction between dreams and memories, and having scrambled thoughts that include conversations with either people that do or do not exist staged out in my head.","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms of schizophrenia are, 1) Hallucinations are hearing voices when there is no one around. 2) False beliefs which one believes to be true despite proof against it. 3) Illogical thinking and speech. 4) Catatonic symptoms like sitting at one place or assuming one posture for long periods. 5) Negative symptoms like lack of motivation, a scarcity of speech, reduced interest, and reduced activities. Though schizophrenia begins typically in early adulthood, it can start even at a very young age. There are different types of schizophrenia. What you describe comes close to paranoid schizophrenia in which there are frequent hallucinations and some false beliefs which are firmly held. I hope it helps.

I have noted the details about your husband and seen the photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I think your husband is suffering from modified tinea or ring worm infection. This is a fungal condition which is commoner in the hot climates. It also tends to invade surrounding areas. It can be itchy in some patients, and alcohol use is known to be one of the factors that can increase the probability of an individual to catch such an infection. Under these circumstances, the following measures best help my patients, 1 To minimize sweating or working conditions in which sweat tends to accumulate over the skin. 2 Antifungal creams help invariable, and these usually contain Clotrimazole or Miconazole. 3 Anti allergic-like Cetirizine for itching. 4 Use of loose garments is recommended as these facilitate evaporation of sweat from body areas. 5 Finally, the role of good hygiene should not be underestimated. I am sure with these facts available to you, and you are in a better position now to help him recover fast."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have always had chest pains and pains specifically in my left arm or chest, but right now, I feel like it is difficult to breathe and I have upper left arm pain to my left breast. It is mainly a pressure a dull ache, but now it is shooting. It is more difficult to breath when I lay down. When I run or exert myself physically or when I am distraught or crying, I have shooting pain down my left arm.","Doctor":"Hello. Your chest pains seem to be muscular. Another possibility is of acid reflux that can also cause such kind of illnesses. We should also rule out any cardiac issues in case of chest pains. So, you should get a chest X-ray and ECG done. If the ECG and chest X-ray are normal, the pain is probably muscular or due to acid reflux. For muscular pain, I advise doing hot fomentation over the affected area three to four times a day. You can also apply Diclofenac gel locally over the involved area. On taking this treatment, this usually resolves in five to seven days. In case you have pain in the abdomen, and acid reflux, I would advise you to take a combination of Pantoprazole and Domperidone. Share my opinion with your doctor before acting upon it.

The serum ferritin level is not high in every case of hemolytic anemia. Your electrophoresis report is suggestive of HbE (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is a case of a mild form of hemolytic anemia. In that case, the ferritin level might not be raised. Along with low ferritin, your red blood cells count is also low. Usually, in hemoglobinopathy, red blood cells count is high. So your wife's complete diagnosis is HbE trait with secondary iron deficiency anemia. So you can give your wife Iron tablets to raise the hemoglobin level and ferritin level. HbE is not a major hemolytic disease, so you need not worry about your child or future child although your child acquires HbE trait. HbE trait patient lives a normal life. I strongly recommend you to get investigated for hemoglobinopathy by electrophoresis because if you have trait then your child can acquire HbE disease. So revert back with your electrophoresis report as well."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

I would like to ask you some more questions, do you have symptoms of acid peptic disease or GERD? Or any burning sensation in the epigastric region, the center of your chest (heartburn). If you do, it could also present as chest pain so I will guide you accordingly. I would also like to rule out any muscular pain, for which I will encourage you to take a muscle relaxant and see if it helps. Take tablet Muscoril (Thiocholchicoside 4 mg) one tablet once a day when you experience pain and let me know in the follow up in a couple of days to see if it relieves the pain. Like you said your Vitamin B12 levels are below normal, it could also be neuropathic pain for which I will only advise vitamin B12 supplements (tablet Methycolbalmine once a day for three months) or B complex supplements. You can also improve these levels with diet. Take diet enriched with beef, liver, and chicken. Fish and shellfish such as trout, salmon, tuna fish, and clams. Fortified breakfast cereal. Low-fat milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs. Since your Hb is also below the ideal levels, take iron-rich foods which are usually Vitamin B12 rich as well. So I will advise diet modification to incorporate these in your everyday routine or take supplements with iron and Vitamin B12 as well. Because anemia can also present with the said symptoms. Lastly, I will encourage you to reduce weight with exercise and changing your diet and switching to a low-fat diet with the addition of more fruits and vegetables to your diet. Try to start with atleast 30-40 minutes of cardio workout every day and work it up from there according to your stamina and you will see the visible change that you feel. You will feel more active and fresh. Try to bring your BMI (body mass index) as close to the normal range as you can. Because obesity itself can cause countless problems as well. I hope this helps.

Sudden onset of pain at this generally indicates traumatic nature of suffering. It is possible that you suffered with some minor injury in last couple of days. The second possibility is an infection in which there may be redness and slight fever over the affected joint. In case both do not apply to you, there is ample possibility of arthritis.

It not only completely changed the shape, but it grew twice in size and went from brown to a pinkish color with dark spots. As of today, the mole has turned entirely black. The swelling went away, but it is pure black. The skin underneath the mole is red, extending about half an inch on the surrounding area. Can I pull this mole off? Is it melanoma? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your history and concerns. What you currently are experiencing is activity in the form of an increase in size, and inflammation of a nevus or mole. The reason for this is pregnancy. As you must be aware, there are hormonal changes in pregnancy, especially near term that affects the skin in various ways, and this includes a difference in the appearance of any moles. Rest assured, the problem in all likelihood would recede once you deliver. However, there might be some element of infection playing in part in the swelling. To control that, one needs to apply Mupirocin ointment twice a day, and that helps most cases.

It even gets to the point where it wakes me up at night in agony depending on when I last had a bowel movement. My actual bum hole is worrying me as well. It started off as a little tear (fissure), now I have got a big tear with what looks like a skin tag hanging off it as doctors in the past have said. It cannot be a skin tag as if you look properly it is actually part of my bum hole as there is a part missing.","Doctor":"Hi. I feel very saddened of your symptoms. I have seen many patients with this problem, which causes unbearable pain and anxiety to them. You may be having either anal fissure or piles, but the treatment is almost similar. 1. Eat lot of vegetables and whole grains. Fiber will heal the problems quickly. 2. Eat a different fruit every day. Avoid spicy and oily foods. 3. Never forcefully defecate. This will increase the tear or hemorrhoid. Use your stool softener twice a day. 4. You can take an ayurvedic drug for a long time basis for complete healing like Pilex tablet twice a day for 3 to 4 months. 5. Take Calcium Dobesilate tablets at night for a month. 6. Buy Calcium Dobesilate containing hemorrhoidal cream. It has an applicator (a cone with hole in both ends), insert it into anus and press the tube morning and night. 7. Is your blood pressure under control? Sometimes increased blood pressure may also cause hemorrhoid or fissure. By doing this you can see your pain and other symptoms slowly relieved in two to three months. If the problem increases, please opt for surgery. It will give you faster recovery."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have pain in my left ear with mild hearing loss. Sometimes I feel some sort of blocking sensation. Since two days, throat is also paining.","Doctor":"Hello. With the details, you have given I understand that you have a throat infection for the past two days and you also have left earache and ear block. Also mild hearing loss on that side. This is most probably a resultant of the throat infection. There is a tube called eustachian tube that connects the back of the nose (junction of the nasal cavity with the throat, called nasopharynx) to the middle ear. All secretions from middle ear drain through this tube and go into the throat along with nasal secretions, etc. Also, this tube helps to maintain equal pressure on either side of the ear drum, that is middle ear pressure is maintained the same as ambient pressure. This is essential for hearing. Due to throat infection, the tube could have got blocked because of which the air pressures are not equalized and secretions are accumulated inside the middle ear. This has resulted in the mild hearing loss and blocking sensation, respectively, that you have described. I suggest the following measures for relief, however, to suggest the exact dose and frequency of the medications, I would require more details as to your age, weight, sex, etc. Also, I would require details about the problems you are suffering from. 1. An antibiotic 2. An anti-inflammatory drug daily twice (depending upon the condition) 3. Decongestant nasal drops daily twice 4. Steam inhalation after putting nose drops 5. Salt water gargling daily three times 6. Avoid Valsalva maneuver till the course of antibiotics is over and after then do Valsalva daily three times for a period of three days.

I would also need to know the effect on the health of baby and mother (including Down's syndrome) and also other points mentioned in the report.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iclinq.com. Basically report is normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and there is no evidence of any heart disease in the baby. However, since it is difficult to completely visualize the baby's heart as it is small and deeply seated, some diseases may be missed especially minors. But at present, there is no evidence of any disease and usually, major diseases are not missed on fetal echo. So nothing to worry at present about the report. Now I do not know why you mentioned Down's syndrome as there is no evidence of it in echo, but routine ultrasound of the baby rather than echo is an investigation of choice for down syndrome. So routine ultrasound of the baby (called as malformation scan) is necessary to rule out down syndrome. Also, in Down syndrome, there are abnormalities in the heart as well, but echo is fine so it is a negative factor for Down syndrome, but still, ultrasound would be more reliable. Down syndrome has severe consequences on the baby rather than mother, firstly because of various structural abnormalities which may be seen in various body parts (requiring surgeries) and baby will have developmental delays, some mental retardation. If it is detected earlier in the pregnancy then abortion may be done. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, It is about my son's health. He is a little over 10 years. At the birth, he had difficulty in receiving oxygen, and ever since he has had occasional seizures and developmental delay in learning. He can walk, talk, and eat like any other normal kid. The problems he has currently are delayed physical growth (height-he is a foot shorter for his age), severely delayed learning skills (difficulty in learning alphabets) and very mild seizures, with occasional rolling of eyes.

Will it have any negative impact on my kid, if I start using it because he already has problems such as seizures and developmental delay. Our worry is this injection might interfere with seizure issues he already has. If my kid is ok with being short, can we avoid using this injection?

A week or so ago, I became focused on a 2 mm mole on my knee. I have always had it as far as I am aware. I noticed a slightly raised bump towards the top with some small hairs coming out of it and was unsure if it had always been that way. I panicked and squeezed it and clear fluid came out. Since then, the mole has scabbed and is now just slightly raised pink skin. I am worried that when it heals, it will disappear completely and I will have hidden a melanoma. I have attached photos of it now but unfortunately, I have not got any of what it looked like before.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). First, you need to understand that for any mole which turns into melanoma require spontaneous changes. It means that any change in color, size, shape, or symmetry of lesions should be spontaneous without any provocation. But in your case you yourself have squeezed the mole. Moreover, in most cases developing into melanoma, the size should be more than 5 mm. So just relax. In my opinion, your lesions does not clinically look malignant.

I take medicines for both. Over the past three months, I had been experiencing a change in bowel habits. It starts with normal stool, then a bout of constipation or hard stool and then loose or thin stool then normal again and it keeps changing. Sometimes, the abnormal stool would occur with abdominal discomfort and cramping. I had a normal colonoscopy about four years ago. I also recently had a normal KUB x-ray to check for any significant blockages.My gastroenterologist did not seem to be concerned with these symptoms and suggested a fiber supplement. I tried Benefiber (wheat dextrin) and that did not have much of an effect. About one week ago, I switched to Metamucil (psyllium) and within a few days of starting, I passed a large amount of stool. Since then, I have felt much better. There is no cramping and I have been passing stool about three to five times a day. The last piece of the puzzle, though, for me, is that the stool I have passed over the past week has been of varying size and consistency. Some stool looks normal and in between, there are thin, firm and unusual rubbery strands formed together. I am concerned about these unusual stools and I have attached a photo. Is what I am describing consistent with IBS? Or could this be a parasite? Should I be concerned about this more serious?","Doctor":"Hi.

I am currently on Cirpaex 10 mg.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. How much weight exactly did you lose? Since when you are having symptoms? If we consider there is significant weight loss, then other specific symptoms are expected with malignancies like constipation or diarrhea, malena or symptoms pertaining to other systems if we consider issues elsewhere in the body. Also, ultrasound would have shown some mass. Although ultrasound may miss the tumor in early stages, since you are having significant weight loss and long duration of symptoms, tumor would be beyond the early stage. And the probability of malignancy is less at this age group. But we are not comfortable unless we find some alternative causes like gastric issues like chronic gastritis, diet changes, frequent indigestions, or any other changes or factors which could explain weight loss if it is significant. If there is any addiction like smoking, alcohol, or drugs it should be reduced. You may have antacids like capsule Cyra D or Pan DSR (Pantoprazole) for a few days, if you have any gastric symptoms like bloating, burping, upper abdominal pain or heartburn.

I guess you do not have pain at anus while passing stools. Is there anything which comes out of anus during straining? It is better to get it confirmed by a local doctor by examination regarding the diagnosis. Hemorrhoids as such are not life-threatening. The problems associated are bleeding and sometimes pain. Permanent treatment is surgical removal. However, it can be well controlled. Firstly, you should avoid straining at any cost while passing stools. Straining will increase them and also lead to bleeding. So it should be avoided. Next thing is your stool should be soft so as reduce the damage, bleeding and need for straining. For that, you should eat high fiber diets like fruits apple, banana, oranges, and green leafy vegetables like spinach, raw cucumber. Avoid smoking, refined food, fatty and oily food. You should have plenty of fluids and regular exercises. Also, you should have Isabgol powder two tablespoons bedtime to maintain stool soft. Alternatively, you may have a syrup like lactulose 15 to 30 ml bedtime to maintain your stool soft. If there is a pain, then you can apply 2 % Lidocaine gel before each stool so as relieve pain.

No laboratory evidence of HIV infection. The HIV-1 RNA qualitative TMA assay is recommended for use as part of a multi-test HIV-1/HIV-2 screening and diagnostic algorithm. This assay can also be used to resolve indeterminate HIV-1 antibody assay results, and to test for HIV-1 infection in patients less than 2 years old. When a fourth generation HIV multi-test screening and diagnostic algorithm is used, if the test results include a repeatedly reactive HIV-1/2 antigen/antibody (fourth generation) screen, followed by negative confirmatory tests for HIV-1 and 2 antibodies and HIV-1 RNA by TMA, the most likely interpretation is a non-specific (biological false positive) reaction in the fourth generation screening assay. There is no current laboratory evidence of HIV infection. Repeat testing on a second specimen is not generally indicated but may be appropriate if there are known risk factors for recent HIV exposure. If the recent HIV-2 infection is suspected, additional testing by HIV-2 DNA or RNA, qualitative, real-time PCR should also be considered. Can someone explain this to me?","Doctor":"Hi. HIV RNA PCR test is accurate after 9 to 13 days after the risk exposure. It can be used to detect early infection with HIV when most other screening tests are not yet reliable. However, it is not a confirmatory test and an early screening with RNA PCR should be followed by a more sensitive and specific screening test, this is the fourth generation antigen-antibody HIV screening test at four weeks and at 12 weeks. Therefore, RNA PCR is quite useful in the detection of early infection. Other times this test can be useful as a second test after an indeterminate fourth generation HIV screening test or when a positive HIV screening test is followed by a negative confirmatory test (usually a western blot). In the second scenario, if RNA PCR turns up as negative then it suggests that an earlier positive screening test was most likely a false positive."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Approximately one year back, my left chewing tooth got a small hole due to something which I bit.

I have no serious pain or discomfort. I am going through my daily routine without difficulty. The main problem is frequent urination. I faced the problem of continuous urge to urinate and mild pain on the right side for around five months ago. That time only basic blood and urine tests were conducted. As I had the pain again before a few days, I had an ultrasound. An ayurveda doctor says that I should take Stonex and Cystone tablets for two to three weeks and the kidney stone will disintegrate and pass through urine. I was advised that the creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL is not high and I need not worry. I was also advised that only in case of extreme emergency and severe pain, I should go through lithotripsy and not ureteroscopy. In contrast, the allopathy hospital says 1.2 cm stone will not come out through conservative management like Cystone and Stonex. The kidney stone is obstructing the right kidney, which has led to rise in my creatinine. I was advised to go through ureteroscopic removal of the kidney stone. Which is right? Can ayurveda treatment with Cystone and Stonex disintegrate a 1.2 cm stone in a short time? Can I wait and watch for a few weeks? Either lithotripsy or ureteroscopy, which is better for the removal of stone in the UV junction?","Doctor":"Hello. The size of your kidney stone is 1.2 cm and it is in ureterovesical junction, so it is not causing you any major problem till now. From the kidneys, ureters continue to urinary bladder to expel the urine. The diameter of the ureter is 3 to 4 mm. So, you can guess that the stone is bigger than your ureters. Cystone and other ayurveda medications can help only the smaller stones to expel out of the kidney. But, this type of stone cannot get out of your ureters through medication. Because, if it get out of the kidney to the ureter, then it will stuck there and will cause you immense pain. It can possibly come out if and it got crushed through medicine, but it all depends upon that from which thing the stone is made up of. Some stones are made up of calcium carbonate and some are made up of uric acid, etc. At this stage, we cannot say that of which thing the stone is made up of. The second thing is that your creatinine is a bit higher and the normal range is up to 1.2 mg/dl. It is not that high that it will cause you any trouble immediately, but it might be due to kidney stone that is hindering your renal function test. You are not facing any pain because the stone is in the kidney. Unfortunately, if it comes down to ureter, then you will face trouble. So, take some precautions. Do not lift heavy objects and do not do hard physical activity till the problem is solved. If you want to wait for some time and continue your medicine, then repeat your serum creatinine every week to keep an eye on it. So, that it will be in your knowledge that the stone is not disturbing your kidney function. But, do not wait for too long. Wait for two to three weeks only. Then, repeat your ultrasound again. You can also go for an x-ray KUB (kidney, ureter and bladder). If the size increases or does not change, then according to your kidney function tests you can take the decision. After waiting for this much of time you will come to know the exact situation about your stone. Then, kindly consult a urology surgeon. He will explain you all the phenomena according to your reports and condition. Unknown etiology or dietary habits or hereditary. Ultrasound abdomen, x-ray KUB and serum creatinine.

I know that chronic diseases can lead to depression but I can honestly say that it is not knowing that I have a disease that makes me feel unhappy. I just feel like I am mentally unstable sometimes. Sometimes it feels that everyday life situations are a lot more stressful to me than they used to be. And I feel like I am always on the verge of a mental breakdown. I have been feeling depressed off and on for at least two years. My lupus has been totally under control with the Plaquenil that I take daily. My BP runs a slightly over the normal at about 125/84, resting pulse in low 70's and BS WDL.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand what you are going through, and I will try to be as helpful as possible. There are two possibilities: 1. The depression is not because of lupus but comorbidity. This is likely if there is a family history of depression. 2. Plaquenil could have some contribution to your problems. Insomnia is a known side effect of it. So, you can try taking it in the morning if you are taking it at night. Also, there are case reports of mood changes secondary to Hydroxychloroquine. Since your lupus is so nicely controlled with Plaquenil, it would not be wise to stop the drug just because of this. What I will recommend is to take it, first thing in the morning. A good sleep could in itself have a mood stabilizing and elevating effect. If this does not help much, you could ask your doctor for an antidepressant which promotes sleep. Agomelatine is one such drug that comes to mind, but it needs regular liver check-ups and has interactions with Ciprofloxacin, Omeprazole, Lorazepam, and Fluvoxamine. I could not find a known interaction with Plaquenil but I think your rheumatologist is the ideal person to ask. If mood swings are your major issue, a mood stabilizer could help. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My father is 63 years old and has rashes in his neck. He had rash before and got medication by a family doctor (a Steroid and Zantac). He is also taking allergy medication. Since then the previous rash subsided. Now that he completed his 30 days prescription, he got another set of rashes and has irritation and burning sensation and redness. Can you prescribe for his symptoms?","Doctor":"Hello. I have examined the pictures as well as the details sent by you (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I find a similarity of the condition with irritant dermatitis complicated by steroid dependence. Had I been able to examine him in person, I would have asked him about the evolution of the rash and other details. I believe his original picture has been modified with the use of Steroids and he has developed dependence to this class of drugs. This is clear from the fact that after completion of the 30 days course, he again started having the symptoms. He can be relieved of his problem but we will have to proceed in a systematic manner. In this case, I would have recommended the use of either mild or moderately potent steroid creams with an intent to control the acute episode and gradually taper them off to a point where he can stay normal without Steroids. I might have considered providing Mometasone or Betamenthasone creams initially and slowly start diluting them with cold cream to reduce their potency. Then I would have gone on to increase the proportion of cold cream till I could control the rash just with cold cream. All this while I would have depended heavily on antiallergics like Levocetirizine or Desloratadine. In such a situation, cold compresses are a great help. Just ensure that he does not have any factor that could aggravate his problems like diabetes or other contact allergies. I am sure by following the recommendations, your dad would soon be in his comfort zone."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I think I have gum disease. My teeth are starting to move.

My doctor gave it for sinus infection.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that you have skipped your antibiotic. It is essential to follow the course of medicine correctly. Now you have to restart the whole course again. It means if the doctor had asked you to take antibiotics for five days, now you must start all over again. Start for five days from now, the same way as your doctor told you. Each antibiotic has its mechanism of action, and they act to inhibit or kill bacteria at various stages in the life cycle of bacteria. Also, at a given time, different bacteria will be at different stages of their life cycle. That is the reason why we provide antibiotics for three or five or seven-day course. To kill the bacteria (or inhibit) entirely, all colonies of it that have caused the infection. Henceforth do not skip the dosage or omit taking tablets. What happens when you omit the dose or take a faulty course is the individual colonies of bacteria from among the lot will turn resistant. Next time the same drug will not work. I hope your query is answered. Feel free to contact for any question."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 48 years old, female.

Please let me know if you can diagnose and see what problems I am facing.","Doctor":"Hi. OCT is normal. Glaucoma is in very early stage (attachment removed to protect patient identity) but you have not mentioned your intraocular pressure forastigmatism. I would suggest these options: 1. Toric contact lenses. A non-surgical procedure but contact lenses require constant care. 2. LASIK surgery preferably PRK LASIK surgery is one of the best options now but coming to my third option, phasic lens extraction and replacement with toric multifocal lenses. Option 3 is preferable because 10 years down the line you will be needing a cataract surgery anyways.

There are various causes for dry cough during pregnancy like allergies, asthma, bronchospasm, rhinitis of pregnancy, heartburn, or weakened immune system.

And for four months I have had emergency contraceptive pill four times. One in each month after having unprotected sex. I got regular periods for four months after having the medicine. But this is the fifth month in which I have not consumed any pill and still did not get my period. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Emergency contraception is not to be taken regularly. There are two phases of the menstrual cycle first 15 days estrogenic phase and second secretory phase. These tablets are high dose hormonal and delay ovulation. So depending upon which phase you took medicine, the period will prepone or postpone. Or you can have erratic bleeding, irregular cycle eventually.

It is common to have some emotional outburst and anxiety during this time.

I left my family to work in a different place. I came from a seven years relationship that I do not have voice. All I do is yes and yes to my partner and I am not happy.

I sleep 5 to 6 hours daily. I take a bath at night-time before bed daily. More details about the presenting complaint is that I am experiencing nosebleed. Not much associated with headache.

First of all, I like to inform you that you are not alone and there are plenty of options available through the online portal on the current date (Icliniq is one among them).

The primary doctor ordered an ECG and an echocardiogram because of a couple of episodes of near syncope recently. The episodes occur after sudden standing, and we were told it might be due to dehydration and orthostatic hypotension. There is no loss of consciousness and not under any medications. Blood pressure and pulse are listed below. The details of the echo cardiogram are below. The ECG was normal.The echocardiogram reported the following: 1)\\tBorderline asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (1.2 cm). 2)\\tBorderline enlarged LVOT (LVOT 2.2 cm; LVOT velocity 1.97 m/sec). 3)\\tIncreased mitral valve E to A ratio, consistent with the patient’s age. 4)\\tTrace-mild pulmonic valve regurgitation. 5)\\tThere is an abnormal mosaic pattern over the pulmonic valve areas during the color flow Doppler examination. 6)\\tNormal left ventricular, right ventricular, left atrial and aortic root diameters. 7) The ECG is normal. 8) BP when sitting is typically 110/61, with a heart rate between 58 and 64. 9) BP, when lying down, is 87/43, with a heart rate between 42 and 45.

Is it harmful to your skin to not have a barrier against the elements, even if it is in our home? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Your interest to know the skin system is appreciated. The skin has several layers of cells packed closed to each other. This packing is due to cementing substances between the cells that do not allow external things to enter inside the body. However, the strength of this packing is weakened in dry skin, infections, skin diseases, trauma, etc. On cleansing the skin, the outer dead cells are eliminated, and inner cells are hydrated. This makes skin supple. But sometime after cleansing, the water evaporates and leaves the skin dry, making it tight.  Makeup can be considered as an application of an external layer of substance on the skin. If a moisturizer is used, it locks the water content in the skin and avoids tightening. If the application is physical like a foundation, it forms a uniform layer of skin covering the openings of glands and follicles too. This gives an even tone. However, the substances externally applied can enter the skin through weakened gaps between cells or through follicles or glands, which can lead to skin diseases. So there is a need to have a sound skin barrier system. I hope I have addressed your query.

Before I explain and answer your questions, I will take a little of your time to explain what has probably happend in your case. The eustachian tube basically ventilates the nose and the ear. In a situation where it does not function, a negative pressure develops in the side of the ear leading to feeling of vaccum, ringing sounds, feeling of fluid in the ear and sometimes decreased hearing as well. Most common causes out there would be allergy or underlying sinusitis which can block up the tubes and there by cause its effects. Now getting to your question. 1. A sinus x Ray cannot show if the eustachian tubes are closed or not. A sinus x Ray just gives information about the status of the sinuses, septum and other bony prominence. 2. Yes we do a nasal endoscopy to see what is the status of the nasal mucosa, Sinus drainage pathway, details of the nasopharyngeal area and definitely see if the tubal opening is anatomically patent or not. In most circumstances, we can pick up any functional eustachian tube block by 2 methods You mentioned about the confusion regarding fluid accumulation in the ear If you feel that your ears are still clogged, then you can consider the treatment mentioned below This might take around 15 to 20 days for things to completely come down but chiefly depends on how manage to follow the precautionary advice mentioned above.

I have a larger right cheek, and my face is off-center. Is there a safe procedure to replace the condyle that is missing?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your history and complaint. The reason for the reduction in the size of the condyle could be as you said. The tumor infection could have entered the left joint capsule and gradually wearing it off. At this stage, our concern should be if this reduction (acquired condylar resorption) is going on or has stopped. This can be checked through a CT scan. On a positive note, there are treatment options available to solve your problem, which is by a procedure called distraction osteogenesis. But, the outcome of the procedure or even the treatment plan depends on various other factors. This is hard for me to search for which I would refer you to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. An examination with the surgeon can give you elaborate details in the same, and if you would be a suitable candidate for such surgeries. I hope you got an idea of what I am trying to say."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am trying to find out a specific function of the diaphragm when it comes to taking a deep breath. There seems to be a deep breath one takes similar to when one is at the doctor and they say take a deep breath and then there is a much more satisfying deep breath one can take which seems to fill the upper lungs with much more air. It looks like the diaphragm (upper belly) moves out a little bit when this deep breath happens. Can anyone explain the mechanics of this? Why can this deep breath happen sometimes and not other times? It is as if I could hold a musical note for 3 minutes because their is so much O2 in my lungs.","Doctor":"Hi. It is an interesting question. Your observation that sometimes you can take a deep breath that is a bit more satisfying than other times makes me a bit more curious as to whether you are in the same posture every time you try it. The diaphragm is a muscle that divides everything in chest from everything in the belly with a few orifices that help get certain things like your food pipe through. It helps to expand the lungs by moving towards the belly while to take a breath in thereby creating more space for the lungs. Since there is a finite potential space, I wonder if you feel the difference based on how much food you have had or what time of day is it. I suggest a more detailed discussion if you can provide some more information."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a cold sore, and I put Zovirax on, and a few hours later, it is tingly.

Most of the patients experience a tingling sensation before the appearance of blisters, but this is soon followed by painful ulceration. This lasts for 7 to 10 days. You have mentioned the application of Zovirax cream on the cold sore, but that is not very effective. Instead, you should take tablet Acyclovir 400 mg three times a day for five days. I would recommend you to send me your photographs as I would like to confirm the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have severe hair fall. And when the hair falls, I can see a white color substance at the root of the hair. Can I know what is that? Is it dandruff?","Doctor":"Hello.  I have noted your concerns, and this most likely seems to be due to telogen effluvium or hair fall. In this condition, three is loss of scalp hairs in their entire length from all areas of the scalp. The whitish bulb-like substance that you see at the root of the strands is a shrunken hair root which is in good health active and thicker but shrinks when the hairs are falling. There are several ways in which patients of this condition are helped. These are 1. Do not brush the hairs when they are wet. 2. Avoid massaging and use of harsh chemicals. 3. Biotin, a vitamin taken orally helps in the majority of patients. 4. Correct your anemia and dietary habits. Finally, have patience as that this disorder takes several weeks or months to clear up.

What can I do to make sure I am asleep during operation?","Doctor":"Hello. I suggest you opt for regional anesthesia by a spinal and epidural anesthetic. They will give an injection between your spine, and this will make your legs numb and any sensation below the navel you will not be feeling.

If you have taken Ozith for three days, it is enough. Unless the doctor who prescribed it had asked you to take for longer. 2. Stop using Axytop soap unless you have some fungal infection over the body. With regards to the above two points, I wish to know whether the soap and tablet were prescribed by some doctor and if so for what complaints?

I have been recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and do not know what to do about it, could you help me get on track?","Doctor":"Hello. You are already on an effective combination of medication to manage your underlying diagnoses. As you may know, you are on an antipsychotic ( Abilify), anticonvulsants (which are also mood stabilizers- Divalproex and Lamotrigine) and an antidepressant (Zoloft). Have regular follow-ups with your doctor so that dosage can be reviewed as needed. Do not stop any medication without guidance. If you experience any side effects, discuss with your doctor. In addition to medication, it is essential to have therapy and psycho-social support to help in your continuing recovery. Have you had any psychological treatment like CBT? CBT can be helpful in anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia as well. Have regular contacts with your trusted family and friends. It is essential to have ongoing social get-togethers and avoid social isolation. If you are in education or at work, try to make appropriate changes to manage your workload.

Bump inside vagina could have many causes but mainly it is due to the presence of cyst or cysts. e.g. Bartholin gland cyst, Gartner cyst, etc. Normally, vaginal cysts are not painful and do not require any treatment unless they are causing problems, e.g. becomes infected and painful, causing pain during sex or walking, etc. As I usually mentioned, no treatment is required, but if they become infected, then antibiotics might be needed, and in some cases, drainage is the option.

However, the area where the infection was observed is still sensitive to pressure. I have not taken many pain killers because the pain has not been that bad. But my surrounding teeth are sensitive still. Is this normal? Will the infection subside? And will I require antibiotics?","Doctor":"Hello. 1. The pain you have after root canal treatment is because when you bite, there is a pressure distributed over the teeth and taken up by the tooth supporting structures around which is a sort of new irritation. 2. The sensitivity is a normal scenario after cleaning of gums & teeth, and you will automatically recover in a week. 3. You have mentioned that you are diagnosed with bruxism, hence relieving the bite(correction of the tooth surface so that it doesn't hit the upper when bitten) has to be done by the dentist.3. Or a nightguard covering all surfaces of the lower teeth has to be customized for you to wear(management for bruxism). 4. Either of these things will help you get rid of the pain. 5. The X-ray pretty much shows no infection down the roots, so you need not bother about taking antibiotics. 6. I advise you to visit your dentist for further follow-ups to ensure the tooth is surviving well with the fillings inside the root canal as well as over the tooth surface. Management of bruxism with night guard appliance. Do not bite hard foods like apple,guava,corn with the front teeth."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My 7-year-old child had a small filling about a month ago in his top premolar (baby tooth). Two weeks later he said it hurts a little when biting and with temperature. I have taken him to two different pediatric dentists who did X-rays and did not see any cracks in the filling or infection. Occlusion was also checked, and the tooth was polished down a bit. He still complains of minor pain in the tooth when biting hot and cold.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly it is not a premolar but a deciduous molar, as premolars are absent in baby's dentition. And please check if the baby is having sensitivity or pain. There is a small difference between the two, which we can differentiate while a baby cannot. If the cavity is deep then even after a filling, the tooth turns out to be sensitive for hot or cold foods. If this is the case apply some desensitizing toothpaste on that tooth only two minutes before brushing and then brush his tooth with his regular toothpaste. If in case he is having very bad pain which he cannot bear then go for a root canal treatment as that tooth has to be there in the oral cavity till 12 years. I hope this would help you.

An early cataract causes a change in glasses number and vision corrected simply by glasses until the cataract is significant, and vision is not improved even with glasses. Secondly, cataract surgery timing depends upon patient visual needs. If the cataract is affecting patients daily routine activities, then surgery is advised.

My family doctor advised me to do nothing and just eat healthy food and re-do the blood test after six months. But, I am totally not convinced with this. I am not a diabetic or hypertensive. I am taking Femoston since five years. Does this have any effect with my low WBC count?","Doctor":"Hi. I have thoroughly gone through your case and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. The levels are not so bad to me. It is a normal variation and I cannot demarcate or label any kind of serious disease to this level. Sometimes it happens and low immunity also has a role in low WBC (white blood cell) count.  2. Femoston (hormone replacement therapy drug) causes clots in blood by affecting the platelets and also may decrease RBC (red blood cell) levels. But Femoston has nothing to do with WBCs.  3. You need to take a proper diet. I will suggest a list of foods that are good for you to get the levels back to the desired range. You will have to repeat the test afterwards to see the improvement and we will work it out accordingly.  4. Yes, vitamin deficiency and mineral deficiency can cause the issue with formation of the blood cells and hypoactive bone marrow assembly of blood cells.  5. Your cholesterol is a bit high and LDL is also out of range and that are justifiable with the HRT (hormone replacement therapy) drug you are on.  6. You need to start physical activity and if you need guidance on that you can contact me. You need to go for vitamin B12 levels. 1. Spend some time in sunlight by applying sunscreen lotion and wearing the sunglasses.  2. Take tablet Surbex-Z (multivitamin) one daily.  3. Immunity booster foods which are good for you to gain normal counts are citrus, red bell peppers, broccoli, garlic, ginger, spinach, almonds, yogurt, cashew, turmeric, green tea, berries, kiwi, apple, red grapes, kale, onion, sweet potato, carrot, old fashioned chicken soup, shiitake mushroom.

I have been diagnosed with IBS in the past, and for about a good seven months I have had stomach issues on and off. Nothing serious, no weight loss or any large amounts of blood in the stool. I had one CT scan the first time six months ago and my abdomen was fine. I did one about a month ago, and they found numerous pericecal enlarged lymph nodes measuring up to 12 mm that may represent mesenteric adenitis. I am afraid that this is stage 4 colon cancer. All my GI doctors think it is not necessary to do a colonoscopy, and that I am too young to have anything wrong with me and it is probably nothing. I did just find out that I had a grandfather who had a blockage in colon a very long time ago but received no cancer treatment for it. Should I consult a GI doctor? Are this grounds for concern?","Doctor":"Hi. See as such mesenteric lymphadenitis does not directly represent colon cancer. It is very commonly seen post infection. So what we do is that we give antibiotics for seven days and later repeat an ultrasound abdomen after one month to check for the size of lymph nodes. If size are decreasing in size we simply wait and watch. Actually, these lymph nodes if once increased in size may take weeks to months to come down to normal size. Even you do not have any symptoms of colon cancer. However, your suspected family history should make us little concern. So I would recommend you to take a Gastroenterologist consultation and simply get a stool for occult blood done. If this test comes out to be positive then you would need a colonoscopy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 31-year-old physically active male and I have been worried about the size of my superficial dorsal vein of the penis. It has slowly increased in thickness over the past few years. It looks extremely engorged in both erect and flaccid state. I am not experiencing any pain or erection problems so far. I had one varicocele surgery on the left side and two inguinal hernias repair seven years ago. I am not sure if there is any correlation. Is this a cause for concern? Should I consider any treatment?","Doctor":"Hi. The dorsal veins of the penis (superficial and deep) drain most of the penile blood back towards the heart. They have to be tortuous so that when the penis becomes erect, they do not stretch too much. The superficial vein is prominent because it is just below the skin. I would not worry about it. This is normal. Any lumpiness or ballooning or skin changes are abnormal and will require medical attention.

I wanted to know about the possible association of back pain with lung cancer. I have been a smoker for the past 12 years. My daily consumption is about 6 to 10 cigarettes. I do not consume alcohol, and I do not chew tobacco and have no other addiction. I normally have home-cooked meals except lunch, and my diet includes some amount of vegetables almost every day and fruits at times. I hardly consume red meat and my consumption of spicy and oily food is limited to about once a week. I am overweight (113 kg and 6 feet tall). I do not exercise as such, but I normally walk about a kilometer or more every day. I have been experiencing non-specific back pain (mostly upper back) since last year. My GP asked me to get a vitamin D test, and my result was 12.5. I was prescribed Uprise D3 60K once a week for three months, which I took as prescribed. For the last 7 to 10 days, I have been experiencing occasional mild back pain. The pain is not constant and not severe. Most of the times it occurs around the center of the back, slightly towards the right. And at times, it occurs at lower back. Sometimes, it occurs on the side, very rarely on the chest and near the right collarbone. I have no cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss, and loss of appetite. I do not feel any pain or anything unusual while inhaling deeply. The back pain, if present, is not worse during the night or while lying down. I have had mild throat irritation for the past two weeks, which an ENT specialist checked and said is due to mucus dripping from the back of my nose into the throat. I have sinusitis. He prescribed me Lasma AB once a day for seven days, which I took and now the throat irritation is better, almost normal. I have been reading a lot on the net about back pain as an early sign of lung cancer, and it really scared me. Is back pain a common sign of lung cancer? If yes, what stage does it usually occur? Can only back pain occur with no other symptoms if it is lung cancer, or it is typically accompanied by other symptoms? What are the chances of my getting lung cancer, given the age and the history stated above? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi.

After some time when I licked my teeth with tongue, I can feel the harshness, while at some places it felt like usual, it means he only rubbed those areas which had stains.When I asked him, will the enamel regrow? He said he had not removed my enamel. Why did he say so? Because I can feel roughness in teeth, the first four incisor teeth on my lower jaw are sensitive, while molars and canines are still fine. I wanted to know if what he said is true? I mean, if he cleaned my teeth without removing the enamel? Is it possible, by the kind of tool he used? Also, list me the precautions and side effects and demerits of teeth whitening. Does enamel regrow?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, I would like to say you that, is the right machine which all dentists use to clean the teeth. It is called ultrasonic scaler, and it sprays water and not some other liquid. I saw the picture you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity), and your teeth seem to be perfectly good after cleaning. This procedure does not remove the enamel, and it cannot regrow as well. Once gone is gone (e.g., during sports fall, accident, etc.). Sensitivity and roughness are felt as your teeth and gums are getting adapted to the new clean oral environment. You should be probably prescribed with an ointment and toothpaste to massage your gums after. If not, use toothpaste Parodontax 75 g (without fluoride) instead of your regular toothpaste for night brushing only. This will help your gums heal quickly. In this case, brushing includes massaging your gums in a circular motion as well. Regarding teeth whitening, the major drawback is that you have to keep repeating the procedure every three months to maintain the shade. It is not a one-shot treatment. You are most welcome to ask if you have any more queries."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30-year-old. I had IVF frozen embryo transfer due to my husband having a reciprocal balanced translocation. The embryo was tested genetically to ensure it was not unbalanced before transfer. I had a 13 weeks and one-day ultrasound that showed uterine arterial PI in the right artery of 2.27 and left artery of 2.75. CRL is 7.65cm.Right, Ut-RI is 0.83, and Lt Ut-RI is 0.87. Blood flow to heart and kidney of the fetus was all good, I think. HR was 156. Growing two or three days ahead of the due date. All the other measurements looked good. My doctor told me to take aspirin 150 mg daily, which will start today. I am seeing my doctor next week but have some questions.General pregnancy symptoms such as the blocked nose and an associated sinus headache. I take a pregnancy vitamin and an extra small dose of iron and vitamin D. I also take Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily. My mother had four kids without any preeclampsia. My aunt had preeclampsia with delivery at seven months. My questions were as follows. 1. Can this improve? Is this something that maybe my uterine arteries are a bit slow to develop and will catch up in the next week or so? 2. What is the accuracy of this ultrasound? 3. Fetal development is otherwise healthy, what is the chance this restriction of blood flow will cause fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia with FGR or any other effects too baby? 4. Does restricted uterine arterial blood flow mean that there will be fetal growth restriction? My BP measured on the same day was 110/77. I did a urine analysis but did not know about the results. Does restriction in blood flow through uterine arteries mean there will be a restriction in blood flow through the placenta and umbilical cord and growth restriction in the baby? Or can there be a restriction in uterine blood flow without effect in the baby?","Doctor":"Hello. Since your uterine artery is showing some changes, Aspirin is started prophylactically, and there is nothing to worry about. Usually, it will settle down as the baby grows. Often ultrasound is accurate up to 80 to 90 %. Fetal growth restriction is quiet unlikely, as your already taking precautions. Only in case of uncontrolled hypertension or neglected pre-eclampsia can lead to severe problems.  Usually, uterine artery restrictions are self-limiting and will settle down with proper medication and regular treatment. So relax and do not worry about it. Usually, stress, anxiety, work pressures, high salt intake, and erratic eating habits will be an added factor. Uterine artery changes are not permanent and can be reversed with treatment.

Crowning the tooth could not be a solution for sensitivity, and moreover, you say that you still feel the tooth to be sensitive. There is a high chance that the molar with the crown is not the culprit. Also, the sensitivity could be for two reasons. 1. Enamel wear exposing the next layer of the tooth(dentin). 2. Initial stages of tooth decay. Hence, my advice for you is to get a complete oral check done, and I suspect tooth decay in any teeth opposing the molar you mentioned.

Was this mold, and do you think my hole mouth is affected?","Doctor":"Hello. I have to say this. Your root canal treatment was not completed. The green spongy thing is nothing but discolored cotton pellet used to cover the root openings top of which a temporary filling was done. This is so obvious that the tooth was not given a permanent filling at all. Please check with your dentist again for the X-rays taken before and after the treatment which will allow to find out if the root canals were filled or not. The reason for the food lodgement is that the temporary filling has dissolved slowly and left-back the big cavity to snug in the food particles. Now, there are a lot of chances for the bugs to retain in the tooth for which you had to undergo a second thorough cleaning of the root canals (most probably without injections). Meanwhile, I advise you to use chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.2 % (without alcohol) 10 ml and rinse with it twice daily for a minute and a week.

When NT (nuchal translucency) is towards higher value than a baby is more likely having a problem. Now there are two prenatal tests which can be done at 12 weeks. Most commonly done is a double marker test. Currently, both are screening test, and we come to know whether this pregnancy is high risk for some genetic disease like down's, Turner, patau syndromes. And if high risk than how much is the risk, statistically like 1:148, which means there is a chance of one pregnancy to come positive for downs in every 148 pregnancy. So for further confirmation have to send liquid around a baby for examination. In that, we remove fluid under sonography guidance and send it for examination. They segregate fetal cells from it and do a DNA test for confirmation. But this test is directly invasive and also have some possibilities of side effects, so we avoid on the first basis. Because if it comes as low risk in double marker than no need to send liquid around the baby.

It is mandatory for every person of hemorrhoids to go for a colonoscopy because about 5% of patients have hemorrhoids secondary to the colon which could sometimes be serious. Although you are just 25, I do not there could be anything serious but to be on safer side you should go for lower gastrointestinal examination preferably colonoscopy to rule out any serious disease.

Current symptoms are weight loss (lost about 5 kg in one month), feeling hot. Sweating, problems falling asleep, difficulty focusing on one task, forgetfulness, change in bowel habits (experiencing loose motion sometimes), palpitations, nervousness, fatigue, heat intolerance (not able to hold hot objects like hot teacup). The blood test results show thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.008 milli-international units per liter of blood (mIU/L), triiodothyronine (T3) 2.3 ng/ml, thyroxine (total T4) 17.8 µg/dL, thyroid scan result is suggestive of thyroiditis.","Doctor":"Hello. From what you have mentioned and from the reports you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it appears that you have thyroiditis. Your results show that you have hyperthyroidism but not so bad but your scan results suggest thyroiditis which needs no treatment, so, therefore, you have two choices, either you wait and watch till your thyroid gland recovers from this crisis by taking bed rest and Aspirin. Or you take anti-thyroid medications if you had a high pulse rate but since you are not having any high pulse rate it would be better not to take any drugs for thyroid currently. My personal advice would be to wait and repeat your thyroid function test after two weeks. Till that time we can be sure whether treatment is necessary or not. Till that time take strict bed rest. Keep a watch on your pulse rate and blood pressure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 32-years-old female. My second baby was delivered by LS/CS method before a week after completing 36.5 weeks.

During the above operation, I lost heavy bleeding about 4.5 liters, for which six units blood and four units plasma were transfused and was admitted to CCU for ventilator support.

I inhaled salt water while swimming at the beach. Will it affect my lungs? What is the natural way to treat this?","Doctor":"Hi. Seawater or salt water by itself is harmless to the lungs. The worst you may get is few days of cough because of lung irritationfrom the salt present in the water. At present, if you are not having any problem then there is nothing to worry. But there are chances of you developing an infection if the water is contaminated with bacteria. In that case, you might get a fever anda productive cough lasting for weeks. In case you develop a high fever or an excessive cough, get a chest x-ray done. Next time when you are in a similar situation, you can sit down on the cot, bend down the upper half of your body (like when you pick something from the floor while lying on the bed) and voluntarily cough for 10 to 15 minutes. By this way, the inhaled water can be expelled. Revert back with the x-ray reports to a pulmonologist online for further follow up. --->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I was told recently by an energy channeler that I have an allergy to dairy because he sensed that my general anxiety goes up when being exposed to dairy after performing some tests. I told him that I do not experience any physical symptoms, and he said that I do not have to experience them to have an allergy. I have never been told that I have an allergy to dairy, and I would like to get a second opinion possibly.","Doctor":"Hello. Please let me know which objective tests did he perform? Now since you do not have any symptoms on exposure to dairy products, the possibility of such thing is unlikely. If he had shown some objective tests like skin test for allergy or blood tests, then we may have some evidence that the body is allergic to dairy products. Even in such a scenario where you are not getting any symptoms, there is no need to withhold dairy products as tests can be falsely positive as well.

If it is not possible then go ask your dentist to give these dressings and fix up your problem. 4. Retake an X-ray to make sure if any broken down root is not left under the socket.

As you mentioned if there is only jawline problem, then you should have physiotherapy and warm massage at TM joints (tempero mandibular) at the junction of the ear when you open your mouth, it can be felt quickly. Do warm massage for 10 days, twice a day this will relieve symptoms definitely if it is because of the joint. Try not to yawn or open your mouth big, do eat with a spoon, do not have rice with hand. These will relieve jaw pain. 2. If the symptoms do not get better with massage and exercise, and you are having pain in some tooth, then you might be having some infection in the tooth that needs root canal treatment or extraction. If you can provide me with OPG X-ray of your jaw, I can tell you the exact diagnosis and the treatment plan. Tell me about symptoms as well, do you feel more pain at night as compared to day time?

Was supposed to have palate and tongue looked at on advice of NHS respiratory consultant at the local hospital, not done. The surgeon has just sent through potential diagnosis but also alluded to MRI scan taken two years back which identifies moderate mucosal hypertrophy in left maxillary and mild mucosal hypertrophy of right ethmoid sinus as well as mucosal hypertrophy of paranasal sinuses noted. Have rung 111 for advice to see if these issues could be imitated in breathing difficulties increasing leafing to immobility and weakening breathing muscles giving the potential diagnosis of respiratory dyskinesia. Also huge swallowing difficulties. Weak swallow identified a year back, barium swallow not notified by GP. No investigations despite repeated requests ENT just larynx. Nasal breathing has been weakening for a long time and now can barely breathe lying down. Choking fits increasing without food or drink. GP has not been interested in a date. Could these sinus and turbinates issues be causing increasing differences? As now long term deteriorating problem. Choking pressure to breathe through the nose and very very weak breath. I cannot yawn. Weak jaw muscles. Cannot stick tongue out without choking. Soft palate ripping. Problems with mouth muscles smiling, etc. Feel could stop breathing in the night as breathing weaker and weaker and noises from the throat are increasing.

I personally feel you have been having chronic obstructive sleep apnea at different levels. However, the symptoms of difficulty in opening your mouth and yawning can be related to the temperomandibular joint. The other symptoms such as weakened chest moments causing discomfort while breathing is mostly attributed to a probable respiratory dyskinesia as provisionally diagnosed earlier. Hypertrophy of the nasal mucosa in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses can be secondary due to sinusitis which can be responsible for the probable headache and nasal obstruction you are having. Treatment of the hypertophied mucosa can be initially done with nasal steroid sprays over a few months and then depending on your symptoms and a repeat CT scan should give an idea of requirement for surgical diathermy and reduction considering hypertrophied inferior turbinates. All in all, we are looking at different problems here and you will not get relief from all the symptoms.

Dry mouth is a symptom and lymph nodes prolonged but no pain. My feet (my toes) have dull shooting pain. I play basketball. So, they begin to hurt after a while and I am only 19. That should not be happening. Some days after basketball, I begin to feel ill and throw up water. Also, after playing, I sometimes crave gummy worms or very sugary snacks. I used to get terrible cramps in my thighs front and back and calf muscles that would cause me to stop abruptly.  Can diabetes cause swollen lymph nodes? And what are the chances that what is happening to me is diabetes?","Doctor":"Hello. I think you are worrying too much. You are just 19. Enjoy life. The fluctuations in your weight will be most probably because of your different habits of eating and playing. When your eating more than you play, you are bound to gain weight. Right? The cramps in your muscles can be caused by electrolyte imbalance. So, keep yourself hydrated when you play. You can add a pinch of salt to your water as well. Your symptoms are definitely not pointing towards diabetes as such. Still, if you suspect you are suffering from diabetes, you need to check your blood glucose levels in fasting and postprandial states. That is the only diagnostic method to label you as a diabetic. Symptoms are vague and non-specific even in cases of diabetes. Hope you are satisfied with my answer and explanation. Have a great day. Regards.

Is there any test other than urine and throat swab test? If I go for testing what should I ask? How much will it cost?","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia are sexually transmitted diseases and are screened in a suspected patient through few tests which are,  1. Urine tests for both chlamydia and gonorrhea. 2. Swab test from the inner side of the urethra for both diseases and also from the throat in case where there is suspected throat infection.  Other than the two, serum IgG and IgM antibody test can also be tested for chlamydia. From the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) I got to know that you are IgG positive. So, consult a doctor for physical evaluation.  For the price of the test, call the front desk of the laboratory you want to choose, and ask for the same. I preferably write down the name of the tests for you as: Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT) for chlamydia and gonorrhea.  Specimens collected are, 1. Urine sample. 2. Swab from inside the urethra. 3. Swab from the rectum. 4. Swab from the throat.  Results will be available within 72 hours depending on the laboratory selected for testing. It is a DNA test and very accurate for testing dead or alive pathogens. Depending on your NAAT test report, I will guide you with next management plan. Revert back with your laboratory test reports to an internal medicine physician online.--->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Four months ago, I had an encounter with a CSW. During that time, I kissed her mouth, boobs, and the outer lips of the vagina (not vagina). I had taken tests for HIV, HBsAg, HSV, after three months and all those came negative. During that time, I had taken a normal urine test for UTI. In that report, the pus cell values are 3 to 6. My questions are:  I had not taken any separate test for gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomonas. May I take that normal urine test report (whose pus cell values were 3 to 6) as conclusive because in a forum, I have read that pus cell values of more than 10 is only considered as STD. Or, do I have to take a separate test for those? Is there any chance of oral HPV transmission by kissing the lips (mouth), and the outer covering of vagina. If so, is any blood test available for testing oral HPV?","Doctor":"Hello. You said you did your HIV test three months after sexual exposure. So, it is very unlikely that you got infected. Secondly, the likelihood of getting gonorrhea and other infections which you mentioned are very unlikely after three months. If you had developed gonorrhea, there would be discharge or bumps over the penis within one month. About oral HPV, if your sexual partner had this infection, then there is a possibility of transmission, but that too is very unlikely. If you had developed, you would have symptoms by now. There would be at least minute warts that would have appeared over the oral cavity or genitalia. So, do not get tensed. Be cool. Take care not to have encounters with unknown persons and if you do, I suggest using adequate protection in the form of condoms.

Today I noticed that from the side closer to the cheek my gum between first and second molar turned white and purple. It seems to be dead. My tooth does not hurt. I had an injection with anesthetic, but it was different from the ones I had before. This time the doctor proceeded to his work right after the injection. It is the first time I notice such worrying changes in my gums. The dead area is spread on the surface of about 12 mm^2, which is quite a lot. I have attached the picture of my gum. Please tell me if I should be worried about that change and what should I do next?","Doctor":"Hello. Please do not overthink about this. If you have no pain and swelling, you should not be worried about that change. Sometime during the filling procedure, high-speed instrument touches surround gum tissue and make some traumatic ulcers, which gets cured automatically in a few days. Wait for two more days and after then if you have still this problem or any pain or swelling then see your dentist. Tissue injury during tooth restoration. Access filling, tissue injury, and ulceration. Tissue injury. Application of ulcer gel containing Chlorhexidine. Take B complex supplement (once in a day). Make proper oral hygiene.

She had her periods 10 days later. Today she is experiencing some lactation and also suffering from typhoid. The hCG tests and pregasure tests are negative. But still has lactation when presses her breasts.","Doctor":"Hello. The fact that hCG levels ruled out pregnancy now, of course, confirms the absence of pregnancy. The lactation or as we call it galactorrhea in absence of pregnancy is due to increased serum prolactin levels. Please get her serum prolactin levels checked to rule out hyperprolactinemia. Typhoid can be treated simultaneously with Cephalosporins and Ornidazole with a period of 10 days of treatment. But hyperprolactinemia shall require treatment with Dopamine receptor agonists like Cabergoline which may be given orally at 0.25 mg, one tablet twice a week for four weeks. This should help treat galactorrhea. Also, along with the treatment, one should avoid any form of breast stimulation or foreplay practices which can reciprocally increase the prolactin secretion in feedback. So, please get a serum prolactin level done and follow up with report before starting Dopamine agonists."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have an inquiry regarding my upper teeth.

The possibilities for your upper teeth not visible during talking or smiling are a short upper lip, short upper teeth, and most rearward upper teeth. 3. The imbalance between any of the above is the reason for this esthetics problem. 4. And these are the permanent teeth now where the changes are very much possible.

I understand that you suffer from susceptible teeth. You say that there are no signs of decay, I ask you, is it severe sensitivity can be a sign? However, to be accurate in commenting, I will share my thoughts and the things we need to do to diagnose this. If you have large fillings (deep fillings), it can be a cause, as it is close to the nerves of the tooth. Also, if you made a new filling in less than four weeks, this could be a cause. If you have a history of teeth grinding this can be a cause.  And if in a small percentage some physiologic normal tooth morphologic gaps between the enamel and the cementum tissues of the teeth sensitivity can be the cause, but the last scenario is not causing that severe pain. Also, you tried many sensitivity toothpastes, and it did not work out, I think that it is time for a dentist interference.  Does your pain occur in a particular tooth or is it generalized, did you have a new dental treatment, fillings or scaling? Are you a smoker? What is your age? Do you have a teeth-grinding problem? I need more history, x-rays and some intraoral photographs for better diagnosis and for making a good treatment plan. I hope that answered your question.

I am not able to see an ophthalmologist until four more days. I am worried that I will go blind before I get to see my ophthalmologist. Will blindness happen all of a sudden?","Doctor":"Hello. Diamox is to control your eye pressure. It does not treat the actual disease it is to manage your ocular pressure that might have increased due to pseudotumor. Since it is a diagnosis of exclusion, you might have undergone a lot of investigations to exclude all other possibilities, including sarcoidosis and wegners. Treatment for pseudotumor or non-specific orbital inflammation is steroids. Some people need a short course of maintainable in the long term to control it without which it recurs. Some get resolved after some time it all depends on the type of pseudotumor you are having did you had an orbital biopsy (a piece of your lesion taken through an operation). Usually, we do a one if not it is orbital apex or sclerotic. For your record sclerosing variety is resistant to treatment. Unfortunately, I cannot say whether you can go blind or not suddenly because not impossible. Due to high pressure, vascular occlusion, optic nerve compressing or reduced blood supply to it and many other things can cause blindness. What I can say is if it is predotumer and if it is a recurrence (not something new) you need steroids and other treatment accordingly. Most importantly, you need close monitoring of your vision to exclude optic nerve damage, which is detrimental and require urgent action."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am experiencing a dry cough, and feel like my body is shaking internally without visibly seeing the shaking.

By going through your query, I could understand that you have difficulty in driving at night, and you wanted first-hand information about the process of eye examination when you consult an ophthalmologist. 1. When you visit an ophthalmologist, you will initially have your vision checkup where you need to read the letters on a chart displayed.

Next, you will visit the doctor and get your eye examined under slit lamp by the doctor. 3. He will then direct you to the retina examination room where your pupils will be dilated, and your retina examined. 4. Then your intraocular pressure will be checked. 5.

Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Your question is on a very vast topic. All the problems you mentioned have endometriosis, an estrogen hormone-dependent condition. I mean to say, you will have these as long as you have periods, that is as long as ovaries are functioning. Treatment depends on what your primary need is. 1. If infertility is the main issue have a serum AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) and day three serum FSH level, to confirm how many eggs or follicles are left in your ovaries. Endometriosis eats into the ovarian tissue, so the risk of follicles losing. If normal, then have the cysts and fibroids removed, if they are more than 5 cm, have two to three cycles of hormone suppression, to clear unseen endometrial deposit. Followed by ovulation induction with or without IUI or go ahead with IVF.At the age of 34 years do not take risks. Once gone eggs cannot be replaced. The best treatment for endometriosis and adenomyosis is to stop the period, and the best way for that is pregnancy. 2. If the pain during periods or sex is a problem, or bleeding is excessive, have a hormonal suppression. That will clear all your problems. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am concerned about my eye health I have hypermetropia of very high degree. Can it be corrected with surgery? I am wearing high power specs for long would it have affected my eye health? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I could understand that you wanted to get an insight of the surgical options for correction of hypermetropia. Yes, there are many surgical options.All of them require these basic parameters like, 1. Central corneal thickness. 2. Endothelial cell count. 3. Anterior chamber depth. 4. Fundus view. 5. Corneal topography. After evaluating these parameters, if these are in the acceptable range, I would suggest you go through a surgical procedure. The best method I recommend to my patients these days is SMILE (small incision lenticule extraction). I see patients who underwent smile, have a faster recovery , more spectacle independent and proper long-term maintenance of quality vision than other procedures like LASIK ( laser assisted in situ keratomileusis), epi-LASIK, and ICl (implantable contact lens). I can more provide a more detailed opinion reg the surgical options if I can see your eye examination reports spectacle power report etc. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a problem. I am a 24 year old caucasian male. Past history: 1 and a half years ago a boil - carbuncle formed on my penis, popped after 4 days. I used Framykoin for a week and it went away. A month later molluscum contagosium formed right above penis, stayed like that for 2 weeks, then doctor burned it off with liqud hydrogen, and gave me betadine to use. It healed within 2 weeks. Present complaint: 11 days ago a bump appeared on my penis, near foreskin. I thought it was a boil which I had before, so I kept applying Framykoin for 5 days, it kept drying the bump. Then visited a urologist, he tried to pop it but it was not poppable. He told me to stop using Framykoin and let it heal by itself. Well, I decided to use betadine instead (I am on the 3rd day now). Symptoms: Bump hurts when I put pressure on it, and hurts only very slightly when idle. Bump was itching during first week as well, but only little bit. There is no visible head, it is approximately 10x7mm big, dome shaped, when I tighten the skin on penis, it becomes a visible bump, and is shiny. It is more like purple/red. There is no visible head and is unpoppable and is kind of firm when squeezed (but top is soft). Also, after 2-3 days I found out lymph node was swollen near groin area and I had feverish symptoms (but that could have been due to fact that I also have been using internally for 7 days oregano oil, since the bump appeared, and oregano oil is a strong natural antibiotic). It is certainly not herpes, I do not have those, and symptoms look nothing like it. I hope it is not a cancer either, we do not have it in family (so chances are reduced). It also cannot be an STD, since I have been only with my wife. I have attached pictures of the bump. What could it be, furuncle, carbuncle, molluscum contagosium, inflamed sebaceous gland or cyst, or something else?","Doctor":"Hi. Coming to the differential diagnosis and treatment: Chances of it being furuncle is less as it is a progressive condition and would have certainly popped out by pressing. Carbuncle is the collection of furuncle, so chances of it again is very less. Since you have a history of molluscum, it could be molluscum, but you have destroyed its classical morphology by popping it out in early stage. It can certainly be an infected sebaceous cyst or infected apocrine gland which are normally present in high number over the genital area. You were right of it not being any STD. Lymphadenopathy is a non specific finding and could be due to any infection involving the genitalia. Take Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid 625mg twice daily for 7 days. Continue betadine lotion and do not try to pop it out. Revert back after two weeks to a dermatologist online for review -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am having fever and cold for the past few days.

So pharyngitis including tonsilitis could be due to streptococcus like bacteria or influenza like viral infection. The symptomatic management need to be done with decongestant tablet like Phenylephrine or Levocetirizine. Salt water gargle or dilute Betadine gargle is having great effect in relieving sore throat. Do not take excess spicy foods. Drink more water. If your tonsil remains enlarged then throat swab culture should be done to check for causative organism and treatment accordingly.

I have read your concern about the ICA (internal carotid artery) aneurysm. It is a good thing that you identified it early. The size is small. Aneurysm at this location is hard to operate on because of the depth, and the rupture rate (which we are concerned about) is almost nil.

Your hemoglobin value, MCH, and MCV values are borderline and not reduce to a level where any treatment is needed. So your MCV and MCH values are not matter of worry. Do not worry about that. Your total WBC count and neutrophils are high. But any inflammation in body also can increased this value slightly. It is not raised to level where antibiotic needed. However if you have any clinical complaint like fever, gastric pain, burning micturition etc., than mention it to guide you further. The elevated red blood cells could be due to dehydration. For that, you need to drink lots of water. If after a few days, your hemoglobin increasing along with red blood cells count than polycythemia should be ruled out. You need to investigate with serum EPO estimation, echocardiography, chest X-ray, and JAK2 mutation study to rule out all possible causes of polycythemia. The hair fall and MCV does not correlate until your hemoglobin level is low. The hair fall can be increased in stress, chronic infection, and hormone-induced.

Is this a dangerous condition?","Doctor":"Hello. Irregular bleeding is the most common side effects of hormonal IUD (intrauterine device). You should expect irregular bleeding or vaginal spotting for six to eight weeks after the insertion. I recommend you to reach inside your vagina and feel the string. If you can feel the string the chance that IUD is in the right place is very high so you should not worry too much. Taking Motrin (Ibuprofen) and applying heating pads should help with cramping. The string should be checked by yourself now and then to make sure it is still in the right place."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had my lower wisdom tooth extraction last week.

Did you follow all the do's and dont's your dentist had suggested you after extraction? As wisdom tooth extraction is in itself a complex one and any manhandling makes the patient suffer a lot. For now, do warm water and salt rinse slowly not so harshly, and water should not be hot, only warm, be careful about that. Secondly, you need to visit your dentist who did the extraction as soon as possible, to look for any bony spicules remaining or if stitches are healing correctly or not.

It's called an oro-antral fistula. If it is big then it may have to be corrected surgically. Additionally if the infection is not healing one can give a thorough antral wash and wash out the contents of the sinus in an operation theatre under anesthesia which will help in bringing down the load of infection and help the antibiotics act.

I am quite sensitive to dust and get sinusitis along with blocked nose and stuffed head often. Around three to four weeks back, I had small red bumps on the roof of my mouth.

On cleaning, it was painful and discomfort in swallowing, but these bumps are making me panic, I have had few tonsil stones come out of my tonsils also, which on seeing a spot I cleaned using a cotton bud. I am very much worried about my recurrent throat infections as well as these bumps as shown in the picture. My medical history includes the following. I was diagnosed with acid reflux before four years and has been taking medicine and following diet control on food. Though I did keep it under control, at times, I get heartburn after a particular food, but it goes away immediately. I also get recurrent sinusitis. I had been falling for pharyngitis due to consumption of cold items. A doctor advised me to have Septilin on a daily basis and for long, and I feel it controlled my infections. Also, seven months back I had trouble sleeping due to severe back pain upon lying down to sleep. When consulted and took an MRI, it resulted in a spine disc hitting a vein causing pain at different angles. My habits include eats quite rightly all meals, but at times skip breakfast and occasional alcohol consumption. I am a software engineer, and hence, at times I have trouble having a proper sleep of 6 to 8 hours.","Doctor":"Hello. You have very precisely described your problem with pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I appreciate that. My diagnosis of your condition based on your symptoms is chronic or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, which is causing chronic pharyngitis. Rhinosinusitis produces thick mucus or phlegm that runs down your throat and causes those bumps. The bumps are in fact lymph nodules, which get inflamed due to the post-nasal drip occurring due to rhinosinusitis. The same mucus or phlegm due to air currents inside nasal cavity dries up to form crusts. The crusts when pulled off, strips the nasal mucosa (inner lining of the nose) and causes a temporary bleed. Secondly, your oropharynx (the region is shown in your picture) shows telltale signs of chronic inflammation. They are the granular posterior pharyngeal wall (the bumps), congested anterior faucial pillars (the rashes on the roof of the mouth - soft palate or pillars) and the enlarged tonsils. These may cause recurrent throat pains and sore throat, which may require taking a frequent antibiotic course. Dust, one of the primary causative agents of allergy, worsens sinusitis by causing blocked sinus ostium, which causes proper ventilation of sinuses. You may note down various times when your allergy and sinusitis get triggered, like certain locations, certain food items, certain habits, etc. Kindly do the CT scan and send me the report as well as films. Films are important. Kindly upload those if you are getting a CT done anyway. For further information consult an ENT otolaryngologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 41 year old female.

I have gained weight of 20 pounds in three months, have lost the sexual drive, and I have exhaustion and I am irritable. What can be done?","Doctor":"Hello. Your unpleasant taste in the mouth could be due to one of the two reasons listed below:  Are you a smoker? Which type of OCPs are you taking? Do you have any family history of blood clots? Did you have any blood clots in the legs or lungs? I suggest you try Omeprazole 20 mg once daily 30 minutes before breakfast daily. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. Preventive measures include the fact that the combo of Phentermine and Wellbutrin together can increase the risk for seizures. If you are prone to seizures, have only one of these drugs. You need to reduce spicy and sweet foods intake. You should also avoid eating in the last two hours before bedtime. Follow up as needed.

I experienced pain from my cheek all the way up to my temple. The dentist was very rushed and just told me that the pain and numbing sensation could last for up to 2 hours after the filling. The numbness went away everywhere except for in my cheek. I have been experiencing a throbbing pain and swelling in my cheek bone and my lower eye socket. I also have a slight fever. Is this something to be concerned? It should be noted that I have sublingual and submandibular nerve damage from a wisdom tooth extraction that I had two years ago.","Doctor":"Hi. You have mentioned that you regained sensation, which means the nerve was anesthetized properly and has reverted too. The numbness, pain, and swelling in your cheek might be due to accidental injection into the cheek muscles. I want you to check yourself if you can open and close your mouth normally as before. If not, then it is a muscle twitch, for which you have to do mouth exercises to come back to normal. But the other possibility for your pain might be the tooth itself, as local anesthesia is not given for a normal filling. Maybe the tooth itself is filled deep without pulp protection. Please attach an x-ray of the tooth which you got filled.I will be able to give you an elaborate answer and treatment once you revert with the additional information. The history of lingual and mandibular nerve damage is not relevant for this scenario because it is in the lower jaw.

I am not sure what caused it whether it was an insect bite or just a rash. It was itching a bit initially if I remember correctly, but then it stopped. It started as a small boil, but then it got bigger. I tried to drain it by removing the pus, cleaning with Savlon and putting band-aid around it. But for the last 3-4 days it has just remained as it is. When I remove the band- aid, pus started coming out of it automatically. So, at that point I clean it with Savlon, and again put the band-aid on. I have been doing it for three to four days, but nothing has changed. This morning, when I removed the band-aid, I saw dark greenish swelling, that again started draining on its own. But, this morning it was greenish pus and not watery one. I also see a dark red spot around the boil. The boil does not itch and there is no pain. How can I take care of this? Also, on both my feet I have had sort of rashes for several weeks now. I cannot quite remember how they started or what caused them. They itch very much and while taking a bath or while sleeping I somehow manage to peel them off by scratching. They are not going away. I do not know if this is related to the boil on my hand. Please suggest remedies for both and let me know if they are related or not.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your complaint and seen the pictures attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It seems to be either bacterial or fungal infection and best treatment option would be pus culture to look for organism followed by antibiotic sensitivity testing to treat it. Green pus indicates Pseudomonas infection. You need to be put on antibiotics to treat it. You can apply Mupirocin or Neosporin antibiotic (combination of Neomycin, Bacitracin and Polymyxin B) over the boil after cleaning it with warm water. Do not apply Savlon. I would also suggest you to have your blood sugar tested. Itching lesion could be allergic. You can apply Tenovate (Clobetasol propionate) which is a mild steroid cream over it once a day. It will resolve. Revert back after pus culture test to a general medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 26 year old. I did not have any physical relationship till date. My meatus got torn from bottom of around 1 mm three weeks back due to masturbating on bed in jean. The meatus was swollen and looked like lips. I felt continuous need to urinate every 10 minutes or so. The urine was also dark yellow in color but would get transparent if I drank water properly. It has been three weeks now and the feeling to urinate has reduced. The swelling also has gone and the burning sensation has reduced. But, I feel slight irritation when the mouth rubs against my clothes. One more thing I noticed is that regularly I am dripping transparent thick liquid, and when exited, it drips a lot. This was not the case before the injury. I would like to know few more things. When will I get healed? What precaution or medicine or cream should I use?

She was discharged from the hospital within a few days and everything seemed normal. Last Friday night, a little less than a week after the birth, she went to the ER and was admitted back into the hospital with blood pressure at 171/117 and blurry vision. In these three days, her blood pressure has been going up and down, from over 200/120, down to 139/79. They have diagnosed her with postpartum preeclampsia. Last night her blood pressure spiked again, at around 1 AM, they moved her into the ICU. Her vision is still blurry, and it seems to have taken them hours to get the pressure back down. My main question is, is it typical for her blood pressure to still be fluctuating after three days in the hospital? Is it understandable for the doctors to be having trouble keeping the blood pressure down? My mom has been unable to see my sister since they took her to the ICU, because my mom cannot take the newborn, there. The only way my mom has gotten information is through my sister texting her. Even though my mom is still in the hospital, she says no doctor has talked to her since they moved my sister, and my sister is not in a great condition to make decisions right now. Is all of this normal?","Doctor":"Hello. She has developed postpartum preeclampsia. It is rare but possible that the patients could develop hypertensive crisis from preeclampsia. If that happened the patient will need to be closely monitored in ICU and due to the medications used to control BPs might drop her BPs too low therefore she needs to be in ICU until her BPs are stabilized. I would not contemplate transferring her when she is still in critical condition.

I am asking because I gained about 6 lbs in three months and I sweat a lot but I must admit that I am a regular alcohol user. About 4 to 5 drinks on the week (evening only, never during the day) and a little more on weekends. I have always been predisposed to sweating but it seems worse since I am taking Lexapro. I was wondering if alcohol can make me sweat in the morning, 8 hours and more after my last drink? Or is it the combination that causes this sweating? And what about my weight that seems to increase easily?","Doctor":"Hello. Escitalopram is an effective antidepressant but as with any other drug, can cause some side-effects. Increased sweating (diaphoresis) is a less common side-effect and can happen with Escitalopram. Some patients experience weight gain as well but as you recognized it is more likely to be due to a combination of factors. Regular alcohol use is a known factor for weight gain. It provided empty calories and you can make unhealthy food choices whilst drinking alcohol. Also, regular alcohol use can make Escitalopram less effective and can worsen emotional problems. In this situation, it will help to cut down on alcohol, eat healthily and exercise regularly. If problems persist and are affecting your quality of life, kindly discuss with your prescribing doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Can I undergo a dengue test even without a fever? Been feeling sick intermittently for like three days now. I would suddenly feel sick like as if I have an illness, and I can feel it in my body.

For your current illness, please take these medicines, you will be fine. 1. Tablet Dolo 650 (Paracetamol) twice daily for five days. 2. Tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once daily for three days.

I think about it every day, and I am so scared to be alone in an unfamiliar place. I am short and often believe that if a man wanted to hurt me, he would do it quickly. I am afraid to leave home alone. It is hard for me to think about it, but I cannot control my thoughts. I read a lot of articles with recommendations on how to avoid rape, but it only got worse because now I got paranoia. I am really scared. I am trying to protect myself in every way.

Rape is a serious issue worldwide, and you have to be vigilant, not hypervigilant because if you take care of yourself, you can best protect yourself like do not go alone in late hours, unfamiliar places and with unfamiliar people and you should have a good relationship and support with your family members. Uncertainty and apprehension causes anxiety, stress, and unnecessary fear, overprotectiveness causes the avoidance in behavior and takes you away from your freedom and happy life, be confident in your discuss your concern with your family, have immediate contacts with you during these situations, and if symptoms are affecting your life you should take some counseling sessions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had sex with a friend and have a swelling on my lymph node under my ear when asked he said he has genital herpes. I wanted to be sure if I have any sort of STD. Please tell me what are the tests I have to go through to be sure.","Doctor":"Hi. Usually, the blood test for herpes becomes positive only after 2 to 3 weeks because antibodies in the body take time to give you positive results otherwise false-negative results can occur (antibodies test for HSV1 and HSV2). Herpes infections can be diagnosed by looking on the lesions on body and blood investigations are often not required. If you have any symptoms then consult a nearby physician or dermatologist for further evala uation. Sometimes, the viral culture of a swab from skin lesions or nuclear amplification test (NAT) can be done without waiting for blood test as this test can be done earlier."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old, girl, who went without her period for over six months. Thankfully it came back, as previously stated. But the thing is that it has not gone away ever since. I am quite honestly just wondering what it might possibly be.","Doctor":"Hi. It is very common not to have a monthly period after starting to have a period for the first time. In order to produce period, your pituitary, ovaries, and uterus have to work harmoniously and it takes over 3 to 4 years for them to work together well. It is called anovulatory bleeding which is bleeding after you have not ovulated for several months. The bleeding tends to be heavy and prolonged due to estrogen effects that build up endometrial cells. You can imagine that your endometrial layer is very thick so it takes a longer time to shed and bleed. You can prevent this by taking combined birth control pills that would imitate your normal menstrual cycles and will prevent prolonged bleeding in the future."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

But the main concern is that since I have grown it, I started to experience excessive shedding. By only passing my hand on my head I would get on average 15 hairs. The pattern stopped for a while, but my hair is thinning a lot on the sides. I can see across my scalp easily by lifting the hairs on the side of my head, (lateral sides, on top of ears, and the regular pattern baldness zones). It has become excessively thin. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. From the information given it seems you are experiencing the early signs of male pattern hair loss. This is a very common condition and there are many factors responsible, one of them being genetic. If you have other family members with similar patterned hair loss the chances for you to develop it increase too. Due to the effect of the male hormone on the hair cycle, over a period of time, the hair follicle starts shrinking and so the hair which comes out is thinner and more fragile and breaks easily. Also, the growing phase of the hair is shortened, so your hair does not grow as long it used to and becomes shorter and wispier. Being just 17 years old I am sure it must be worrying you a lot. But do not be disheartened. There are several treatment options available and the sooner we start the treatment the better the chances of reducing further hair loss, thinning, and increasing regrowth. A combination of oral supplements to boost hair growth along with application of lotions containing Minoxidil 5% to begin with will be the best course of action in my opinion. Oral Finasteride, which is the male hormone blocker, is used frequently. Applications with Finasteride are available too. This will be prescribed by your treating doctor after assessing the extent of thinning and discussing the side effects, etc. Several preparations of bio-peptides and other natural ingredients like saw palmetto extract, melatonin, etc are also available to boost the hair growth. PRP (platelet-rich plasma) is a popular procedure which is often used in combination with medical treatment to stimulate hair growth further. Usually, a combination of treatments is suggested after the clinical evaluation. But using the applications regularly is the key to good results. Hair regrowth takes a few months to show and you will have to be patient to see the benefit of the treatment. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?

The patient has headaches and sleepiness throughout the day and burning sensation in urine at times.","Doctor":"Hello. No, not needed if there is no pus cells on routine examination. This also depends whether one is having symptoms or not. Occasional burning usually occurs due to dehydration and most of the times this burning is also associated with yellow urine which further suggests dehydration. So should drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration and burning. Also, patients with gonorrhea and chlamydia will have frequent urination, constant burning, fever, pus in urine, etc., which suggests infection and then needs some specific investigations, but not in your case. Do you snore at night? Do you get episodes of interrupted sleep, frequent awakenings or temporary stoppage of breathing as noticed by others? If yes, then there is a possibility of obstructive sleep apnea which will lead to excessive sleepiness, headaches, etc. For more information consult an internal medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I want information regarding Argyreia speciosa.

Once I delivered my baby, the blood sugar levels were normal. I used to check the blood sugar levels and they were normal all these years. But since nearly six months, my levels started rising again. Usually, my fasting levels are high now and they fall during the day. My levels are between 200 and 300. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi. It is well known that diabetes during pregnancy is a forerunner for diabetes in later life. It is good that you checked your blood levels faithfully after your delivery and that is why you were able to identify the high levels. Having found out about these high levels, it is time for you to meet a physician or diabetologist to start treatment. The target sugar level for fasting is 100 and for two hours after a meal is 140 mg/dL. Adhering to a strict diet and regular exercise may reverse diabetes completely in the early stages. You have not mentioned your age or desire for future pregnancy. In either case, I can suggest accordingly.

She was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes with HbA1c of 10 three months back and was prescribed with Jalra (50/500), Invokana (100). We consulted a dietitian as well and went on exercise with full diet control. Took the HbA1c results yesterday and was found to be 5.6 with CBC-hemoglobin-13.2.Her doctor was surprised and was not able to believe. He changed the medication to Melmet SR 500 mg and retained Invokana and told us to take it for next three months. Please advise us whether to go on with the tablets as we heard that for this level of HbA1c tablets are not required? We want to fight it with diet and exercise.We want to switch to Ayurveda. So, is this the right time?The doctor advised that we should compulsorily be administered with Insulin if we are planning for pregnancy. We are planning in the next year though. Please advise whether do we have to compulsorily be using Insulin? Is there no other alternative?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Since there was a sudden fall in HbA1c level, your doctor might have been surprised by the change. He might want to follow up for a couple of weeks or a month to ascertain that everything is going well. That is probably why your wife is now on Melmet 500 (Metformin) which is the first-line drug for diabetes. If her blood glucose levels are stable with diet and exercise, then she will definitely be able to go off medication. But that needs to be confirmed by the doctor after subsequent testing. Her HbA1C came down to 5.6 while she was on earlier medication. Now the doctor has reduced the dosage to a minimum and your wife's reports will be followed up for further progress. Depending on the next report, your doctor will take further action. That is how it works usually. So do not be in a hurry to stop medication and do not make any hasty decisions. Regarding the efficiency of Ayurvedic medicine, there have been reports of effective medicines in Ayurveda, but that needs to be discussed with an Ayurveda expert. Be sure that you are consulting a doctor who practices pure Ayurveda and prescribes genuine medicines. You may be aware - all that is labeled herbal may not be ayurvedic. Regarding pregnancy, I think what your doctor meant is, when your wife gets pregnant, if her blood sugar is not under control, she will have to take Insulin. It is true because oral medications are not recommended in pregnancy. Insulin is the safest medicine for use in pregnancy. In case her blood sugar is normal during pregnancy (without any medication), she may not need Insulin or any other medication. But she will still need to be tested regularly to be sure that she is in the normal range. You do not have to be apprehensive about Insulin use, there are a lot of myths associated with Insulin use. It is a safe drug, easy to manage, and after pregnancy and lactation, she can slowly move to oral medication again. Since you have another year to plan the pregnancy, she can now focus on lifestyle modification - balanced diet and exercise - and take a decision based on how things unfold. Stay positive, stay healthy.

He has congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is generally in good spirits and is well taken care of. He uses oxygen and his doctors have told him that when his oxygen count goes down, to breathe in and exhale through mouth. Since his breathing is generally weak, after every time he walks or climbs stairs, he sits down with this oxygen tank and breathes in slightly and then exhales, usually with more force than he inhaled. I am trying to teach my mother about pranayama and the importance of exhaling through the nose. Her concern is that the doctors have taught them the breath in through nose technique and exhale through the mouth. Given that he is 90 with those conditions, on oxygen, is there a reason that he should use the technique the doctors are recommending? Would it be more beneficial to breath in through the nose and exhales slowing through the nose, even with the tubes in his nose? The latter makes more sense to me but since my mother only trusts her doctors, she asked to get more information about this. Thank you so much for your time.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for posing this question. Please find my suggestions below. At age 90, it becomes very important to keep the things simple for the patient. Your effort to teach pranayama is appreciable. I would advise you not to go for any difficult pranayama which is tedious to understand. Nadi suddhi and anuloma viloma or alternate nostril breathing is sometimes confusing for elderly people. If the above option is also found to be difficult, then just ask him to follow breath awareness, where one just needs to focus on breath without any active effort for its manipulation either sitting or lying. Exhaling through the mouth is perfectly fine as far as the patient is comfortable. But, there is nothing wrong in exhaling through the nose also. Let it be decided by the patient whether he wants to exhale through the mouth or through the nose. Both ways of exhaling seems to be equally good with a bit extra priority to exhaling through the mouth. Let us not trouble him by putting any unnecessary rules. I will consider bhramari pranayama (chanting of Nnnn while exhaling) to be best for him. If any religious concerns are there about any of the chanting, then these can be replaced with either only bhramari pranayama or instead of Om some other words like swim can be followed with emphasis on ''Mmmm'' sound and very minimal ''swi'' sound. Any other similar words or chants can be chosen. Treatment proposed here is to be followed under supervision and several modifications or omissions and replacements may be needed for different individuals with same ailment or same individual at different stages of ailment.

A recent bout with Fordyce on lips and a large amount on the scrotum and penile shaft. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your case. In my opinion, Fordyce spots are non-infectious lesions and are not sexually transmitted diseases. These are painless spots which occur in the area of sebaceous glands. It has no corelation with your previous HPV infection. Usually, it does not require any treatment.

Before that two months ago, I had a crown lengthening, and I was supposed to get a crown, but the dentist two weeks ago said it is best to do a filling. Now I have what looks like a pocket or inflammation around the tooth that was placed with a filling. I saw that dentist today to get it checked, and she said it is the gum inflamed, and that I might need to lose the tooth or see the periodontist who might be able to fix it if it does not heal in a week. In that week, she told me to use mouthwash every day, floss extra diligently, and clean the area. Will this help, or am I in significant risk of losing the teeth? If I have to see the periodontist who did the crown lengthening, what would they do?","Doctor":"Hello. There are two conditions with your teeth, and it might be only due to overhanging filling or due to a pocket surrounding the affected tooth. In that case, you should go to the periodontist first, he will clean the area and give you a better idea of what is happening around the tooth. In the worst cases, it may happen that you will have to get your filling removed and get that tooth root canal treated. But all of this can be clear only after an X-ray. For now, warm water and salt rinse is a good option, no doubt but go to your periodontist as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,At the moment, I have been wearing braces for roughly 2.5 years.

My teeth continuously shift, and I was told I have a tongue thrust, and hence, my teeth are always moving back. Am I wasting my time getting braces again? I was also considering veneers, but not sure if it would even qualify.","Doctor":"Hello. Why have not they put fixed retainers in your case? Especially if the case got relapsed. You must have got the second treatment done and then at end get fixed retainer at palatal and lingual side of your teeth for like good 10 years. This is the only way to avoid relapse. Moreover, if you are having tongue thrust, there is an appliance for it. I would suggest you to get treatment done (which could be fourth time) with conventional bracketing. And at the end, ask the dentist to put fixed retainer. After it gives you an appliance to limit tongue thrust. This would not cause relapse, hopefully. I could suggest you more proper treatment plan if you can provide me with clinical pictures of before, after treatment and now recent ones too."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Meanwhile, he and I are talking since I confessed and till now, as friends, we mostly speak every day, for a month now.I am getting nightmares about him for this month, and they are all about him being harmful or he getting harm. Whether it was physically or psychologically (he causes damage, or he gets hurt by having accidents or fighting or insulting, etc.). Why do I keep having nightmares? Why are all of them are about him by keeping in mind that I only had very few dreams about him for the last nine years (except for the previous month, mainly)?","Doctor":"Hello. Dreams do not have any relations with the future. Or at least there is no evidence for that as of now. But dreams have always related to your unconscious or conscious mind. If something troubles your mind, it could manifest as dreams. That dreams may not be having the same subject.For example, when you run a fever, it possible that you dream about some natural calamities or some wild animals or even harm to our house structure.  The dream about your friend being hurt may not have anything to do with the future. But it shows that you have something stressful in your thinking about him. You are stressed or worried about your relationship with him. You even could have a fear that this friend may not last. The more you worry about these dreams, the more dreams come. Because you are stressed more, so stop worrying about those dreams."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 15-year-old boy. I have questions regarding my hormones and my puberty. I am scared that I feel as if I may have been through precocious puberty as I have had a beard since I was a late 13 years old. Will I be able to grow still taller, and is there any way my hormones can be regulated and have I finished puberty?","Doctor":"Hello. Precocious puberty can be called when the onset of puberty is eight years or below for girls and nine years or below for boys. The beginning is not synonymous with a growing beard, which is a more advanced stage. Staging is usually done with a scoring system called tanner staging which considers pubic hair, testicular and penile development. You should note the first changes in these aspects. Females can grow until the mean age of 16, males for a period three to five years longer. The ethnic, familial, nutritional background is important for final height and pubertal development. As long bones, especially those of the lower limbs, are important to give the height, radiograph of ossification centers like those around knees can be taken. If all the centers are ossified, you are not likely to grow taller. As you are turning 16, it would not be appropriate to suppress your puberty which could be done at a younger age by GnRH analogs or a few alternative agents. I hope you got guidance."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a tooth removed a while back, and the tooth next to it feels lower down, and I get toothache every so often my dentist said there is nothing wrong, but I feel it is going to fall out or crack and I have pain when I bite down. I cannot eat the rest off my teeth without really biting down, and when I do it hurts and feels like it is pushing my tooth back up, I cannot even bite down gentle without it hurting.","Doctor":"Hello. There might be following conditions involved in your case, 1. The tooth you got extracted would be a bit higher and functioning before extraction, that would be used in your bite and the second tooth would be malaligned and a bit lower in height. Once it got extracted now the second lower tooth is only there for a bite and chewing function all chewing load is shifted to it, so it started hurting, and it is not easy for you to eat from this side.  2. There could be an infection or a hairline fracture or split in this tooth that needs to be diagnosed through X-ray and some clinical examinations. Addressing your first condition, the treatment could be a prosthesis. You need a bridge that can adjust your bite and level down the chewing forces to all teeth equally and your generalized aching will be resolved. While for your second type of condition, the tooth will be treated according to diagnosis. If the infection is there, then root canal treatment is required along with the cap. If there is a bite fracture, then extraction is recommended. Kindly provide me with X-rays so I can suggest you the appropriate treatment. I hope this helps you. Feel free to ask if you have further queries."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Is it normal to get prickling stinging sensations especially in arms as a startup a side effect of Prozac?

Fluoxetine (Prozac) induced abnormal skin sensation like pricking, tingling, or numbness feeling have been occasionally reported. They are not common but can happen and are usually only for a short period. 2. It is also possible that the pricking and stinging sensations are due to anxiety itself and not related to the medication. This can happen, especially when hyperventilation happens related to stress. 3. It is good that you are only on a low dose of 4 mg once daily. So your response and any side effects can be carefully evaluated. When are you due to being reviewed by your prescribing doctor? 4.

Revert back with the detailed information to a dentist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 44 years old and diagnosed with preliminary hypertension. All my tests including ECG, TMT, 2D echo, brain CT scan, pulmonary embolism (to rule out the cause for sinus tachycardia), 48 hours Holter monitor, chest X-ray, lipid profile, and kidney and liver function tests. TMT, 2D echo, CBP, and vitamins are normal. I was prescribed Metoprolol tartrate 50 mg twice a day, Hydralazine hydrochloride 25 mg twice a day and Amlodipine 5 mg twice a day. As I had slightly high total cholesterol I was also prescribed Atorvastatin 10 mg. Doctors suggested two changes to the above medicine regime as follows:  Stop Hydralazine hydrochloride. Take Metoprolol succinate (extended release) instead of Metoprolol tartrate (immediate release).  So, currently I am on Metoprolol succinate XL 50 twice a day, Amlodipine 5 mg twice a day and Atorvastatin 10 mg once a day. My BP is very much controlled (110/80 mmHg), and heart rate average is 70 to 80 beats per minute. At night time it drops to 60 to 70 range. My cholesterol is very much under control, the total is 140, LDL is 73, HDL is 43. My specific questions are as follows:  Since I changed to Metoprolol succinate, I have identified that my hair is thinning. Does beta blockers cause hair thinning? Can I switch back to Metoprolol tartrate (immediate release) or is there any other beta blocker which is as effective and safe as Metoprolol and does not cause hair thinning? Metoprolol is also causing my HbA1c to go higher. It is now 5.4. Within one month of taking Atorvastatin, my cholesterol level has come down. I have been taking Atorvastatin for last one year. Can I stop it now? I do regular exercise. I walk 20 to 30 minutes on all days.","Doctor":"Hello. From the description it appears, you just have hypertension and no other problems. Firstly, just for hypertension, now beta blockers are not given as a first line medicine. It is given after calcium channel blockers (Amlodipine), ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors (Telmisartan) and Hydrochlorothiazide fails. However, there is no harm in having it as a first line agent. Sometimes in less than one percent patients, Metoprolol can cause hair loss and also it does raise the HbA1c which does not require any treatment and it is acceptable. So considering these things, it is better to switch on other medicine like Telmisartan (Telma CTD 40/12.5 mg once a day). Also, if you want you may switch to Tartarate as well, but since its an immediate release formulation, blood pressure control may be inadequate at a later time period after medicine consumption. Also, the HbA1c issue will be there with all beta blockers. Another alternative beta blockers you may have Nebicard (Nebivolol) 5 mg once a day which we will increase gradually. So it is more like your personal preferences. But, seeing all these things, it is better to switch on to Telmisartan. If you are fine with hair loss thing then may be continued on Metoprolol. Succinate and Tartarate both can cause hair loss. You may stop Atorvastatin, continue to have healthy lifestyle including diet, regular exercises. Get lipid profile repeated after six to eight weeks to see for sustained control.

Is a 500 cc implant filled to 600 cc considered extremely large with more chance of rupture? Is going from A cup to C cup (350 cc) then going from C cup to possible D cup (500 cc filled to 600 cc) that big of a difference?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your confusions. Let me tell you one thing. The implants are usually measured by three things, the volume, the base diameter and the height (profile). So the implants chosen will be on the basis of all the three criteria. An implant of 500 cc will have the capacity to be filled almost up to twice its volume (1000 cc) without being ruptured. It depends upon the surgeon that what volume will be good in your case. Again the material and shape of the implant determine the distribution of the additional fill. That all will be pre-decided by your surgeon. Going from A to C and then to D is not that much of a difference provided you do have that much skin to accommodate. If not, then the doctor might suggest a few months interval in between for the skin to stretch.

It may lead to fissure if such repeated traumas are occurring. For fast healing, the important thing is that there should not be re-trauma. So, use regular stool softener like Lactulose 15 mL to 30 mL bedtime till wound heals. Secondly, do not apply too much pressure for stool. Thirdly, you use lignocaine jelly to the local site thrice a day. Drink plenty of fluids and eat a high-fiber diet. Avoid junk food.

I am in need of emergency contraception due to failed birth control. I will be ovulating tomorrow, so I am at a high risk of unwanted pregnancy. I obtained and took a 1.5 mg dose of Levonorgestrel (Plan B pill); however I have been reading online that this method of emergency contraception is ineffective because of my weight. I cannot obtain an IUD and do not wish to wait and see. If I am pregnant, then the only option is to go for abortion. I have a friend who induced her period early by taking an excessive amount of vitamin C. I am aware of the risks of taking an excessive amount of vitamin C, but I am planning on pursuing this method. I have read that vitamin C aids in inducing a period by increasing the amount of estrogen, promoting the growth of the lining of the uterus and eventually leading to the shedding of that lining. I intend on consuming 3000 mg of vitamin C for a period of three days. Is there any way that the Levonorgestrel pill would have a negative reaction with the Vitamin C? Is there any other alternative to induce a period or prevent conception other than an IUD or this Vitamin C method? Thank you in advance for your help and concern.","Doctor":"Hello.

There are no chances of pregnancy as you had sex on the 4th day of your cycle and you were in your safe period when ovulation would not have taken place and hence no chances of conception or fertilization. Moreover you have taken an i-pill as well within 72 hours so it is like double protection.

Will exercises or workout help in overcoming it? Can you suggest me ways to overcome it?","Doctor":"Hello. Premature ejaculation in most individuals occurs because of associated anxiety, psychological reasons, and hyperexcitation. Relaxation and treatment of anxiety result in improvement in most individuals. The first thing you have to understand that it is normal to ejaculation earlier when even an individual start engaging in sexual intercourse. This occurs because of a poor experience, anxiety, and restlessness. Lack of confidence is also a reason for early discharge. So accept that even if you are ejaculating earlier even then there is no weakness in you. This is a normal thing, and you should not lose confidence for that.Distraction during sex is one method to delay the time. Try to distract yourself during sex and immediately just before ejaculation, try to withdraw the penis and then again insert it. This will help in delaying the time. Use of Lignocaine jelly over the tip of penis reduces the sensitivity of the penis, and this helps to delay the time. This can be tried. If that does not help, then you can think of using medicines. Dapoxetine is commonly used to improve the time. The drug is taken about one hour before sex helps to delay the time. The drug is safe to use, does not cause any serious side effects and can be used when needed. You can discuss with a psychiatrist for prescription of this drug. Thanks and take care. Hope this helps you. For more information consult a psychiatrist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Will complete blood count test show HIV infection?

We have no extra-marital affairs and I am 100 % sure of that. My right labia is swollen and is very painful to touch, even a slight breeze of air causes extreme pain. The pain is similar to a sunburn. It is painful enough to make me cry. The swelling starts from my right vulva next to my vaginal canal and goes all the way to my anus. The area with the worst pain is next to my perineum. This started as a painless lump in the size of a peanut that could be palpated from within my vagina with a finger but not visible externally. This was about a week ago. Now, it is huge and painful. My labia is three times larger than its normal size and very red. There are no discharges, no foul smells, and it is not itchy. I am managing the pain with Clobetasol topical cream and Mefenamic Acid orally. The pain disappears instantly with the cream but I think it is also making the swelling bigger (steroid?). I am on my third day of Co-Amoxiclav 625 mg (twice a day every 12 hours) but I think this is what caused the swelling in the first place. Also, I tried to do a sitz bath and it only made the condition worse. Just a few hours ago, I had trouble breathing (allergy?). I have never been allergic to any medication before. Any impression or advice would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. From the symptoms you described, it sounded like you developed Bartholin gland abscess which is an occlusion of the Bartholin gland duct and that turned to be abscess. Steroid cream is not used for treatment. You need to finish the antibiotic and continue a warm sitz bath three times a day. The abscess will get soft and drain spontaneously. If you had this previously and have the abscess at the same location, it would be better to have a procedure called marsupialization.

The lactation could be due to high prolactin levels due to hyperprolactinemia which needs to be investigated with serum prolactin levels. However, the best way to rule out pregnancy if you are still anxious is to get a serum beta hCG test done. If the hCG levels are less than 5 mIU then she is surely not pregnant.

When I get up and walk around for several minutes, the pain goes away. I never experience the pain when I am not lying down.

I found the intensities in the cecum region to be upwards of 3071 compared to my bone intensity measurements averaging around 1200.

I am unable to completely trace both the ureters without their disappearance and they both seem to be compressed in various regions. I can however find them again around the bladder.

I have slight pain and discomfort. My erection falls to one side when lying on my back and it also points downward when standing up. I do not have any past medical history.","Doctor":"Hi. As you have written that you have no past history of any significant condition, so I am sure there is no history of injury or pelvis bone fracture. It is highly unlikely for anyone to have suspensory ligament injury without a pelvic bone fracture. Penile normal anatomy is not that it stands straight at 90 degrees it always will deviate to one side. An injury which is common in the penis is penile fracture which happens during sexual intercourse but after that, there is no erection. Since you have an erection that is also not the possibility. As you have mentioned, you have a weak erection. To find the cause of it, further evaluation by means of blood test and sonography will be needed. But you should understand that erection strength and frequency decreases with age, erection which was present at the age of 20 will not be present at the age of 30. Still, if you are willing to undergo evaluation of the cause of erectile weakness you can let me know, I will tell you the required tests. If you are still sure that your condition is related to a suspensory ligament injury, an artificial erection test followed by a physical examination will be needed. This test is done by a urologist at his clinic where a small injection is given at the base of the penis to cause an erection, then penile anatomy is examined to see for any deformity. MRI pelvis is also an option to see for injury and its severity."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,How many hours of sleep do I need as a 17-year-old? Are six hours of sleep enough?

I have been involved in bodybuilding for the last year and decided to start taking creatine roughly three months ago. Before that, I did not notice any effect of exercise on my skin, except some small pimples on my chin area. After a month of creatine usage, I realized that my skin was getting worse with some breakouts all over my face, forehead and temples and especially chin and low jawline area. I first removed the protein supplement from my diet thinking it was the cause and only 1-2 weeks later realized upon the research that creatine was the real culprit. I instantly stopped taking it and the only supplement I take now is natural, dairy free protein powder. Along with the skin care regimen, I follow this every day. I am using a cleanser along with moisturizer twice a day and it has helped almost to clear my forehead and temples. I assumed my breakouts were due to dehydration in the period I was taking creatine, but only noticed slight progress in my chin area. Although, the bumps on my skin now do not feel as tough and dry as they did and do not itch anymore unless I forget to moisturize. I drink lots of water and have just bought a 97% pure aloe vera gel tube that I am going to apply twice a day. I am afraid whether this condition could last a long time after quitting creatine. I am really worried as it is seriously damaging my confidence and overall wellbeing. Is there anything I need to know or anything I can do on my own to help the healing process? Two weeks ago, I decided to take a break from working out and thought that I noticed some improvement, as in decreased redness but I do not feel too sure about it.

Adequate sleep is essential for proper functioning of the body and as a result of prolonged lack of adequate sleep your body's circadian rhythm has been affected. Hence constipation and even weight loss. I am assuming you may have lost a bit of appetite or cannot eat on time either. Now, it is important to get six to eight hours of sleep every day. Even if you cannot sleep at night, you must ensure at least six hours of sleep by making up during the day. Also, try to get some meditation or yoga which helps immensely in these cases and helps to restore the body's circadian rhythm. Half an hour of meditation if done properly equals to two hours of sleep. Also, drink plenty of fluid and fibers for constipation. And take your meals on time.

I slept very late one night and the next day while taking class had a dizzy feeling for a second. I felt that my head was reeling and on that afternoon I took off. It did not happen again but I felt myself weak with less energy, as if I am about to fall if I do not sit somewhere. I was unable to stand or walk for a longtime because of fatigue and lack of energy. Nerves were twitching sometimes. I saw several doctors but I was unable to convey my symptoms properly. Sometimes, I get a sudden panic too, with increased heartbeat, dizziness, etc., with a frightful feeling that something is going to happen. An MRI scan was done which is alright. Hypertension, thyroid, and sugar tests were done and that too fine. The doctor said it may be a stress reaction and he gave a tablet for fatigue. After having that tablet for a while, fatigue was gone, but other symptoms of panic attack, occasional tiredness still continues. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi.

And also I ran my fingers on the vagina. I did not have any kind of penetrative sex, frottage or deep fingering or oral. After that episode, on the eighth day, I had a fever, body pains, and chills for two days. After two days of fever, I had some rise in temperature in the afternoon and used to get normal in the evening which lasted for two weeks but had some body pain and weakness. After two weeks, I had some sweats in the night with no fever for a week. Now I do not have any other symptoms but for the last few days, I started having some pain in thigh muscles. When I stretch my legs, I do not feel any pain but when I bend or sit in the chair, I start feeling some kind of soreness and sharp pain in thigh muscles and suddenly in around groin area and inner thigh. When I press the area where I have pain, it becomes normal. I work out a lot and stopped for the last five weeks due to the illnesses. I am a little worried. I have been reading a lot of ARS symptoms on the internet and it is making me restless and I am suffering with a lot of anxiety. Now I am in the week six after the episode.","Doctor":"Hi. HIV is only transmitted through direct unprotected sex that either involves contact with infected genital surfaces or through the exchange of infectious genital secretions like semen or vaginal fluids. Skin to skin contact as in body massage is absolutely safe. Mere contact of the outside of vagina with your penis without any penetration and running your fingers over vagina is not a risk for transmission of HIV. Moreover, the symptoms that you have are non-specific and could be seen in a common viral infection. I suggest you take symptomatic treatment like an OTC (over-the-counter) painkiller like Flexon (Nickel Titanium) tablet or Combiflam (Ibuprofen and Paracetamol) tablet, for symptomatic relief, if you feel any muscle pain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The left side of my tongue has been hurting for a few days, and there is a white raised line on it.

The pain varies in place, but it is always centered on my left temporal area. Pain can be on the top of my head, cheek, side of jaw and even chin at times. I have also had momentary ear pain, which is a brief one second flash perhaps inner ear pain for the last week. I went to my doctor after the first week of non-stop pain. Ironically the pain had eased that day and I was left with a sense of pressure in my temple area. It was disrupting my sleep. My heart rate was a bit high. He took an ECG there and he was not sure why I had the headache, so sent me to other hospital. He also looked into my eyes and thought I may have a blurred left optical disc. I had another ECG at the hospital and my pulse rate was still high, sinus tachycardia. But, the nurse told me that everything else with my heart was reading fine. The treating doctor ran through the usual questions and gave a neurological exam. I passed everything from looking into my eyes with a light to reflex tests and making me push him away with my arms and legs and opening my eyes while he pressed gently on them with his fingers. He also ran blood tests and they came back normal. He was not sure what the problem was and was not convinced that my left optical disc was blurred. As it was 1 AM he suggested me to stay overnight, so that I could see a consultant or specialist first thing in the morning. I had my blood pressure taken once again at around 4 AM and the nurse said it was still a little high, but everything was fine.The next morning consultant or specialist saw me for about a minute. He did not even acknowledge my heart rate, just said that as I was feeling totally normal and had no other symptoms other than the pain it was likely a benign tension headache. I was better off at home rather than stuck in hospital. Based on what the treating doctor said he too was not convinced that I had a blurred left optical disc, but wanted me to see an eye doctor at the hospital. I had an eye examination and everything was fine, other than the fact that I need glasses, which I already knew. No issues were detected and my left optical disc was fine. I was then discharged and went home. I asked a nurse about my sinus tachycardia just before I left hospital and she said that the heart does that sometimes and being in hospital or going to the doctor does not help as I was well and healthy. The first thing I did when I got home was checked my heart rate monitor app that I have on my phone. It uses the torch on my phone to detect color changes in one finger to measure beats per minute. I have read that it is very accurate. My resting heart rate at this time was around 75 bpm. I was relieved and put my heart rate down to the anxiety of going to see my doctor about the persistent headache and then having to unexpectedly go to hospital. In the three weeks since my hospital visit I have still got the headache. The pain is in the same place around left temple area, side of jaw, cheek, top of head. The pain is not severe, but annoying. Lying down to sleep at night is what seems to make the pain worse, even after a pain-free day. The pain would flare up as soon as my head hit the pillow, including at the back of my head and yet when staying with my girlfriend I would not get this when sleeping on her pillow. I decided to see my doctor again yesterday after having a sleepless night. I had 48 hours mostly pain-free and occasional pangs of pain. I slept at home fine, then the next night at my girlfriend's fine and then the next night the moment I went to sleep the pain came on and I could not sleep all night. Painkillers would not help. I was also experiencing a kind of dizziness, unless it is all in my head. Nothing spinning or dramatic, but just sometimes felt a bit odd briefly when moving, only when moving. Balance is fine. I had felt this the day after returning from hospital, but it was gone within 24 hours, so I have been free of it for two weeks.I saw a doctor again. He did not have a specific diagnosis, but backed up the idea that it was a benign headache. I have not been stressed or having personal problems as such, so he ruled out anything there. He said pain at the back of the head when laying down can be quite serious, but could not understand why I get that pain at home but not at my girlfriend's house, so said it could not be serious in that case. I was asked to rate that pain out of ten when I get it in bed, I said it can be about 6/10. He asked about a history of migraines which I do not have. Asked if I had any other symptoms which I did not. He checked my oxygen levels and blood pressure. He said my BP was shooting, but I said it was anxiety because two weeks prior it had returned to normal as soon as I got home from hospital, so I thought it was likely high because I was anxious of being at the doctors. He prescribed me 2 x 28 tablet boxes of Naproxen 500 mg twice a day and asked me to let him know how I was getting on with it after five days. He also checked my jaw, pushed down on my shoulders, etc., and all was fine. He said I would not have been discharged from hospital if anything sinister was considered. I asked if I had more pain whether it was something sinister and he said yes and that they have given me a head scan if they were concerned. I took my third Naproxen pill about an hour ago. I took my first at about 6 PM yesterday and it took care of the pain within about 20 minutes. Because I had not slept at all since the pain came on when I went to bed the night prior I was suffering with it all day, but the Naproxen killed it. It wore off after about five hours and I started to feel the pain come back, but I took two Paracetamol and went to bed. I slept fine and I have had a pain-free day today, although I get very occasional pangs in the left side of my head, but only for a second. I still have the very slight dizziness when I move however. I am not sure whether dizziness is even the right word. I have read that it takes about two weeks for Naproxen to give off a constant anti-inflammatory affect that can break the cycle of benign headaches. Is this correct? I have been keeping track of my heart rate through my phone app. When I am very well rested it falls in the 60s and 70s, but my average resting heart rate seems to be 80-90 bpm. When I stand up and move around a bit it usually falls between 110-115 bpm. Is this normal? I am 25 years old and not overweight, but I do not do any exercise, which I am looking to change. I try not to check my heart rate too often in case I over think it too much, but it only seems to be 65-75 after sleep and I never get it that low again during the day. Should I have any other concerns and does everything I have noted sound correct in terms of my headache being benign and my heart being fine? How much can ECGs pick up and detect? Again, based on the hospital ECG the nurse said my heart was fine other than the sinus tachycardia which I read is not harmful anyway. Is the very slight dizziness that has only really just started a symptom of benign headache? Can I expect a generally elevated heart rate from taking Naproxen twice a day? I am grateful for your answers. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for such a detailed query.

The reddish-brown color of the semen indicates a condition called hematospermia. The most common cause for this condition is idiopathic inflammation of the prostate or seminal vesicles. Do you have any feeling of dysuria (difficulty in urination or painful urination) or incomplete voiding? So, a workup for this condition is digital rectal examination to feel your prostate and seminal vesicles and also PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) level. We usually treat idiopathic hematospermia with a Quinolone antibiotic for four weeks (to take care of any prostatic infection). We also give a two-month course of Alfuzosin and Dutasteride combination."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My girlfriend is a virgin and we were intimate on two consecutive days last month.

Her periods is due now for this month and still she does not have any menstrual symptoms. Will she be pregnant? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. Ideally, Meprate - Medroxyprogesterone should be taken only after confirming the absence of pregnancy as Meprate has a tendency of causing incomplete abortion. So, it would be wise to get a serum beta hCG done (human chorionic gonadotropin). It is a blood test that detects minutest pregnancies. As per the timeline, if the value comes less than 5, then the test is negative. Review with the value of the beta hCG report, so that I can suggest medication safe for her. When you review make sure you mention the following. The value of beta hCG, starting date of last periods (before intercourse), date of intercourse and intake of Meprate and if she has associated thyroid or prolactin disorder.

I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Please suggest medicine. MRI reports show nerve root pressing. She used to take calcium 500 mg. Should she continue calcium?","Doctor":"Hello. After taking a look at the MRI reports that you have posted (attachment removed to protect patient identity) it looks like your mother has moderate arthritis in her cervical spine and lumbar spine, which is starting to cause nerve compression. Ibuprofen 600 mg and Baclofen 10 mg, once in the morning and once in the evening is the typical initial starting point to help with some of the symptoms. This will provide short-term management of her condition. Typically that is recommended for about four to six weeks. Once she starts that regiment, she should also start physiotherapy. That will begin to properly rehabilitate the spine and allow for proper motion to occur. Physiotherapy is typically recommended at a frequency of three times a week for six weeks. And it is then reducing the frequency for two times a week for another four weeks. Prognosis varies depending on other comorbidities and how well your mother tolerates treatment. If we are looking at a co-treatment, she should also do a low sugar and low carbohydrate diet. And a menu filled with good protein and vegetables. If she is overweight, she should lose some weight. All of what I have mentioned the need to be done with patience, consistency, and monitoring from a health professional. Proper rehabilitation can take up to six months and can vary from patient to patient."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have diagnosed with DVT before four months and currently on Xarelto 20 mg once a day.

OCP was the main reason for my blood clot. Should I continue taking Xarelto for three months or six months?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to the icliniq.com. I should appreciate your awareness of health. For venous thrombosis, anticoagulant should be taken for at least three months. However, when the risk of thrombosis is high than duration can be extended for the next additional three months. So the clinical correlation is needed to decide the duration of treatment. If your doctor has suggested a total of six months duration of therapy, then I would suggest you take it for six months. I hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 28 years old. I got pregnant three months back. At 1.5 months, I went for a regular check-up. Everything came normal except for my TSH level, which came out to be 5.57. I have not gone for thyroid test before. Doctor gave me 50 mg Thyronorm to be taken daily as she termed it hypothyroidism. After one month when tests are done again, TSH came out to be 1.67, but anti-TPO antibodies are present and 278. Please explain what does this mean? Do I have to take medication life long? Does it have any harmful effects on my kids, I am expecting twins. Doctor asked me to continue medication even after delivery. What does it mean?","Doctor":"Hello. Elevated levels of anti-TPO antibodies indicate you have autoimmune thyroiditis. Do not worry about these terminologies, what it shows is you may have the disease even after the delivery. But that does not mean that you need to take medications life long. It can become normal by itself also. Since your TSH level is controlled now with medication, there are no harmful effects on your kids but keep taking drugs and get TSH frequently tested till delivery."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have a strange sensation in my leg for around two years. It usually only affects the lower half of the left leg and foot but has recently encompassed the upper sections. This is accentuated when walking and more so when the pace gets quicker. The feelings feel as if my lower leg and foot are quite light on the lift and not entirely under my control.The foot can feel as if it wants to turn in when I am running but never does, almost like a buzzy electric wave feeling. There is no weakness of the leg itself. I have suffered from cold feet over the years, and these can be pronounced, making the foot very stiff so that wiggling the foot and toes can be quite difficult.It can occasionally feel as if there is a block in the leg. The same sensation with a feeling there is a block can be felt in the forearm also. There are icy hands as well, which can affect ability with the thumb numbness now and then. When sitting, the feet feel as if they are stretching out with light relief available when I do. I am worried about MND.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query. As per your symptoms, there can be chances of MND. In MND, there are also other symptoms, and there are chances of underlying sclerosis. But you can not rule it out on your own. You need a clinical examination by a trained physician. So I advise you to visit a nearby reputed physician and ask for the complete examination. Once a proper diagnosis is made, only then start taking treatment rather than taking random treatment.

She does not need wisdom teeth removed, but she has a small baby tooth number 22. The last dentist we went to see suggested removing it because there is no enough root. They suggested to remove before braces and bridge it. I am concerned the bridging may get damaged. She has only 15 teeth, and number 12 never came out. (wisdom teeth are coming out and visible on X-ray). Is it possible the baby tooth can remain, or will it fall out during the braces procedure? I thought if we try to keep it then once the braces are off we can have a veneer or overlay placed on top of the baby tooth? I do not feel comfortable for my 14-year-old daughter to have bridging work at such a young age, and she would then have to always need a new tooth or bridge every 7 to 10 years which is expensive. If the baby tooth needs removing, then is it possible to remove it but not place another tooth and close that gap while the braces are on? Can this be achieved with braces? At least her mouth will have the same amount of teeth in it. I am getting different opinions to form dentists, and some have said all four wisdom teeth need removal, and this one said no need. Please provide suggestions.","Doctor":"Hello. Please attach the X-ray for a better understanding. Anyway, the milk tooth has to be removed. The wisdom tooth usually develops and erupts by around 18 to 20 years of age. So need to see X-ray for confirmation. No need for a bridge at this age go for braces to correct alignment and if possible, close the space without a bridge."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 32-year-old single male. In the past, I have experimented with using non-deglycyrrhizinated licorice to reduce my libido and make single life more manageable. I have hereditary low blood pressure so that the side effect was not an issue for me. However, after a few days of use, the licorice causes me to develop muscle aches all over my body. Which I assume are due to the reduced potassium levels from the licorice. Is there a better alternative to the licorice? Or a way to prevent the loss of potassium so I can use it for more than a few days at a time? No matter what I ate, (bananas, avocados, apricots), it did not seem to be enough.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. Non-deglycyrrhizinated licorice contains Glycyrrhizin which has some side-effects like hypertension, hypokalaemia, reduces testosterone, edema, etc., as you mentioned well. Muscle cramps and aches are most probably due to hypokalaemia. To fulfill the requirements of potassium you can take a banana, avocado, orange, lemon, apricots, etc. An alternative to non-deglycyrrhizinated licorice, you can take mint, flex seed, popcorn and soda. They normally reduce the testosterone level and make men libido."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 22 years old with a weight of 96 kg. I have been participating in sex from the last year. It is happening frequently and when I am alone, I am now masturbating almost daily even for once and I finish so early. I cannot last long. Is that anything to do with masturbating or frequent participation in sex?","Doctor":"Hello. The excess masturbation has shown relation to premature ejaculation. So it is advisable to restrict masturbation frequency two to three times a week. It is also important to learn when to slow down stimulation by distraction technique to prevent early ejaculation. Master and Johnson's techniques are also beneficial. Topical Lignocaine jelly can be applied after erection to prevent early ejaculation. A pelvic exercise called Kegel exercise is also beneficial. However, if you do not have an improvement in early ejaculation with all these methods then consult nearby sexologist or psychiatrist for detailed evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I need advice after my second CT chest result. Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one. In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?","Doctor":"Hi. According to guidelines when there is a single nodule in the lung of size less than 3 mm we ask to follow up in six months for repeat CT. In the repeat CT, if we find any enlargement of the nodule or any new developments we usually ask for a biopsy of the existing nodule. That is how we practice. So, I think you should repeat your CT after six months and if the size increases, you should get a biopsy done."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from fever since last three days.

You are also using Rantac that is antacid and not an antibiotic. Your symptoms are suggestive of viral pharyngitis most likely. I suggest you take Levocetirizine 5 mg OD for five days to relieve congestive symptoms. You should also take Limcee which contains Vitamin C 500 mg and it should be chewed rather than swallowing. Do salt water gargles three times a day. Do not take excess spicy foods. Drink more water. You can also do diluted Betadine gargle instead of saltwater gargle. If no improvement in the next two days, then I suggest you investigate further with full CBC and throat swab culture or ASO titer.

I suggest you use the Montair LC tablet Levocetirizine, Monteleukast) two times a day for three days for controlling the skin rash. Also from the next time consider using a trimmer instead of a blade. Please get back to me if you have more questions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have had pain and a tiny bump on right pinky (DIP) for over six months, only when I touch it. Now I have slight stiffness in two other DIP joints and one PIP joint (same R hand which I use a lot on the computer, maybe two hours a day). Also one DIP joint other hand. It got much worse with my allergies this month, and I have had a lot of stress in the past few months.I also have pain in my left toe and possibly have Morton's neuroma between toes 3/4. But I have terrible flat feet and was walking a lot for three weeks with sandals. I have been home for three weeks and it is not better. So, I went to my doctor and he thinks I have rheumatoid arthritis. He says it starts in the feet and hands. Blood workup is totally normal for RA factor and inflammatory markers. This is causing me severe anxiety. He did not take X-rays but says he can see changes in my hands. They look the same to be as I am petite and have always had bony hands. He is a rheumatologist but did not even touch my hands to examine them. I have had no fevers, tiredness, anemia, etc. Just now a lot of anxiety over this.Can this be allergies with some slight osteoarthritis? Stress inflammation? Also, I am starting menopause as I am 48 years old, no period since last month. Hormones? I do have a slightly swollen gland under right ear and right side of throat is sore from postnasal drip, also had cold sores in the mouth. I do not know if a virus can affect this also. I will upload the blood report.","Doctor":"Hi. Well, as per your clinical history and symptoms it does look like nodal osteoarthritis of the hands. My point in favor: 1. DIP joints are never involved in rheumatoid arthritis. If they are inflamed we have to think of alternative diagnosis. Either OA or psoriatic arthritis. But from your history, it seems more like nodal osteoarthritis with Herbedens nodes and Bouchard's nodes. 2. If it was rheumatoid even if seronegative ESR and CRP should have risen but they have not. So, it is unlikely there is any inflammation going on. 3. As per your feet, it looks like you developed plantar fascitis. Would recommend you to start wearing sports shoes and do some compressions in a hot water tub. That should help. Apart from it, the swollen gland may be due to a viral infection only which I am hoping should settle in due course. But yes, if you need a final confirmation, best is to ask for an ultrasound of hands and feet that would tell us if there is inflammation or not as X-rays may not pick up early changes. Ultrasound of hand. OA of hands."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Generally, I feel very stressed and tired. Getting angry on a minor issue and wanted to live alone. Because of this stress and anxiety, I am not getting good results in the exams. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. You are preparing for a competitive exam for which you have anxiety. If I ask, can you guarantee the results of the exams for which you are preparing? Definitely no. But you can predict the good results, but it is not guaranteed because we expect a lot. Not only you, people around us expect a lot, but this is also the thing which hurts us a lot and put us in a competition that triggers over expectations, uncertainty, apprehension and leads to a variety of psychiatric symptoms and behavioral issues. There are two types of stress, 1) Eustress is a normal stress in which our performance get better because we only do our best and leave the rest. Take good care like sleep, hygiene, social life, a good diet, no expectations, proper diet, and exercise. 2) Distress in which our performance get down due to lack of proper care, lack of good sleep, diet, over-expectation, excessive worry about the result which is not under our control. I think I tried my best to answer if you any other concern you can ask."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I suffer from bipolar 2 disorder as well as OCD and social anxiety disorder. I have tried almost all SSRIs, and SNRIs and neither of them have worked for me (for the last 2 1/2 years). I believe that I have treatment-resistant depression because all the medicines are not working. Currently, I am taking 20 mg of Paroxetine (although I already took 40 mg a few months ago, so I already increased the dose as well), 900 mg of Lithium and 1.5 mg of Risperidone. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand that it can be frustrating if the medicines you have tried so far have not been effective. Have you been on the maximum doses of each medicine before trying another? There are medication options like add-on Bupropion, which can be considered by your psychiatrist if the low mood is a significant issue. Any medication changes have to be done carefully under monitoring as you are already on a different psychotropic medication. More importantly, have you received any psychological therapy like CBT along with your medication? Combination of CBT and medication is likely to be more effective than medication alone. Especially for OCD and anxiety, CBT has a strong response rate. Also make sure that you follow the necessary lifestyle modifications like eating healthy, have a sleep routine, and exercise regularly. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 27 years old. My penis does not get fully erect at the time of intercourse. It remains in semi-erect state.

As you have mentioned three different prescription in which Escitalopram and Clonazepam is common to all and rest are different drug. Each drug has its own side effects and each person may have few of these side effects. Now, coming to your question that which one is to be used for long term, it depends upon what are the side effects you had.

Yes, you are right in this regard but clinically it is proven to give if patient's symptoms are resistant on medication but there are few options to try before prescribing this, and for sleep to prescribe Noncrystalline is not suitable decision, rather you can have Mirtazepine low dose which is suitable combination with any SSRI and has no drug interaction which you can search even, and you may need counseling to help to deal with your problems.

At first, it started with lots of pain, but the pain got subside after relieving my bowels. The stools were softer and of large quantity. No blood in stool, but a little bit of red color on my toilet paper. I have hemorrhoids, which I know and I have been impacted by all of this. I went to my regular doctor and had an abdominal CT scan last week. I have not received my results yet. I am getting pain to the right of my belly button a few times. After about five or six days when the frequency of going to the bathroom slowed down, I seemed to strain a bit more to go and the stools were coated in white. This would only occur with the harder stools. The other stools seem to be softer and more yellowish in color. After the CT scan, I am of course going to the bathroom frequently, but no white in stool at that time. So, my concern is the mucus which I have never had before. What is causing the diarrhea? Ironically, I had seen my gastro doctor when all of this began. So, I have scheduled another appointment. I had a colonoscopy two years back, all normal except for hemorrhoids and an upper GI at the same time. Gastritis was the only thing found. Since then, I had an abdominal ultrasound and pelvic ultrasound, in which all were fine. Could colon cancer develop quickly? I am a worrying and I am driving everyone around me nuts.

We had started his medication and behavior therapy around 40 days back under the consultation of pediatrics and psychologist. After 10 days, we consulted a neuro-psychiatrist who recommended us EEG brain (sleep). The report of EEG was abnormal, whereby non-epileptic discharges were captured. The doctor prescribed liquid Valprol in some dosage. Since the finding was abnormal, we thought of getting a second opinion from a neurologist with video EEG this time. The video EEG (awake and asleep) under consultation with senior neurologist gave absolute normal findings. We showed this video EEG report to the previous doctor and asked him why is the difference in his (abnormal) and elsewhere video EEG (normal) report. The former doctor said that once the patient has been detected with abnormal findings, then subsequent normal findings cannot contradict the fact that the patient has the issue of non-epileptic discharge. We are confused about whether we should give him the syrup Valprol or not.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your concern and seen the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It seems like there is a discrepancy. It would be wise taking to account both results are true positives. It is warranted to that you go to your child neurologist to confirm if these are seizures. Most of the time, a video EEG (electroencephalography) confirms the presence of seizures. If it was not caught on video EEG, a thorough history and physical exam are warranted for your nephew.

There is some twitching or tingling in fingers. Please suggest any adjustment of medicine. Could this be due to any of the medications I am taking?","Doctor":"Hello. No, I do not think any medicine is causing this. The compulsive scratching or pulling of hair could be due to unconscious anxiety. You are on Paroxetine 25, and if the anxiety is still persistent, then we can think of increasing the dose to 37.5 mg. Increase in dose would help in controlling the unwanted impulses. You can talk to your doctor about that.

My fasting blood glucose level reading is between 110 to 116, whereas random is 98 to 105. I took an HbA1c which was 5.9, what should I do? Doctor suggested some random tests and figured out fasting sugar level a little high, so I went for HbA1c, and I am taking the readings at home since then.","Doctor":"Hello. Your BMI is 33.75. So you have obesity class-I. Your fasting blood glucose is high, but not high enough to call it diabetes. You have impaired fasting glucose (IFG), a form of prediabetes, which may proceed do diabetes. You have to reduce your weight and start taking more vegetables and no sugary or sweet food, no excess fat. Vegetables should constitute half the normal plate, a starch-like bread from whole cereals should constitute a quarter, protein in the form of fish or lean meat (chicken better) should represent the remaining quarter of the main meals. Start doing exercise, walk fast enough to put two steps a second, for at least 30 minutes a day, at least five days a week. You can take Orlistat (Xenical) 120 mg with a meal to reduce your body weight. Fat may come out as oily stool as a side effect.

After a diet, I gain double and every time it is harder to lose. I am desperate, lonely, and depressed. I do not want to be fat for my entire life. I am only 26 and have always struggled with my weight. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I can imagine the level of your frustration regarding your weight. Yes, it is nearly impossible to keep reduce weight and maintain diet and exercise. I may not be able to give you a composite plan of action for your weight reduction since it is not basically a one day consultation task. In fact, it is a long term commitment towards yourself and towards a multidisciplinary team inclusive of a dietician, bariatric endoscopist (gastroenterologist), behavioral therapist, and lastly a bariatric surgeon. So I would give you facts and figures for the existing evidence of weight reduction therapies. Remember your current body mass index BMI is 34.3. The goal of any weight reduction treatment is to reduce weight to optimal ranges where the physical and psychological well being of a person is maintained. Now anybody whose body mass index (BMI) is more than 40 should straight away consider bariatric intervention in the form of endoscopic or surgical modality. And anybody whose BMI is 35 but having other conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes, coronary artery disease (heart disease) or lung dysfunction (lung hypertension and sleep disorders) should undergo interventions. But you see not all person fit into above category. Many have BMI less than 35 (such as in your case) and having very troubling symptoms, among such people individualized approach is employed whether medicinal use or endoscopic or surgical intervention. Diets and regular weight reduction exercises do help to reduce weight by 7 to 10%. All medicines which are currently in use help reduce weight by 10 to 20%. Certain endoscopic bariatric procedures such as balloon placement in stomach and sleeve gastrectomy does help reduce weight around 25% And lastly, surgical procedures such as metallic rings around the stomach via laparoscopy and surgical sleeve gastrectomy, and surgical Roux Y bypass, help to reduce weight by 30 to 35%. The figures are ranges, they vary significantly in individual cases. I also want you to understand, that these interventions should be accompanied with optimal dieting and exercise even after surgery or medicinal therapy. Otherwise, the weight can frequently recur to original ones. This above description is only to make you understand and figure out things. I can recommend you to start with dieting (keeping your calories well below 1500 Kcal daily), running, swimming, and weight lifting on a regular basis. I also suggest you to meet a dietician on icliniq or otherwise in person, to get a diet plan with respect to your calorie requirement. I can suggest you some medicinal treatment, but they are prescription medicine, may not be OTC, and the course has to be taken for at least six months to see the effect. Naltrexone/Bupropion (Contrave) is proven and FDA approved and can be started in your case. But I want you to provide more information about your health, as I can assess your condition first and treat aimfully rather adding more harm to your health. Because these medications have some side effects and they should be kept in mind before giving it therapeutically. I also want to know about family support, any occupational therapist available near your vicinity, your current job status, and medical health insurance, and also information whether the cost of these medicines is covered or not. Until that time you follow up, I want you to get the following blood tests to better know the impact of your obesity on bodily systems. I hope this helps. Obesity. Complete blood count. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), FT3, FT4. Liver function test. Fasting lipid profile. Serum CRP (C-reactive protein). Albumin total protein and AG ratio. Arterial blood gases. Urine detail report, and urine for albumin. Will decide after further information is provided and after investigation thoroughly for any underlying metabolic complications."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having itchy and dry eyes for the past one week and recently experiencing some eye pain also for the past two days.

What can be done now? I cannot tolerate either of them.","Doctor":"Hi. If you are taking treatment for hypothyroidism, it is to see that you get the right dose. But whether you are being over replaced or under replaced should be determined by periodic thyroid function test, if a single hormone, then TSH which shows amplified suppression and elevation of both T4 and T3 in hyper and hypothyroidism (here I presume, as you are being replaced, you initially were diagnosed as primary hypothyroidism, which is the most prevalent thyroid disorder). Serum TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary) should be done four to six weeks to adjust the dose till the appropriate treatment dose has been settled (TSH normal for a few follow ups at a particular dose), and then, every six months to one year. Manufactured proprietary Levothyroxine tablets are more comfortable to change the dose with since they have exact dosage preparations, 25, 50, 100 or 150 micrograms, and they and they have only Levothyroxine (T4), no rapidly acting T3. So, sudden alteration of biology is unlikely. The dose has to be adjusted by 25 to 50 micrograms each time. Carefully, half of that change for adjustment in heart disease and the elderly.Some essential clues (better confirm by TSH):under replacement (hypothyroidism)- Weight gain, coarse and dry skin, slow heart rate, constipation. Over replacement (hyperthyroidism)- Weight loss, sweaty warm skin, palpitations, fast heart rate (tachyarrhythmia AF and sometimes heart failure), hyper defecation (increased number of stools) and sometimes diarrhea. You did tell your age. If you are approaching menopausal age you may experience similar symptoms due to estrogen deficiency but though worth paying attention, it is less likely because your symptoms are related to taking medicine."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, From the past one week, I have itching problem in my arm area.

I randomly have episodes of heart palpitations, one time I jumped 3 feet out of my bed suddenly being shocked by a hard fast-beating heart palpitation that lasted for seven seconds, that was scary, it felt my heart was going to burst out of my chest and the beat reached my upper chest to my throat and neck, it is not a heartbeat that we get from playing sports, it was a weird episode of heart beats. After that incident in months, maybe a year I then got an episode of heart palpitations like that intensity but this time it lasted for 15 minutes going and coming with sweat only. Then after that, I just get them randomly while sleeping and awake for 1 or 2 seconds and now mostly when I pee standing up it also appears for a quick second and goes. I did CT scan and sonar heart tests and all doctors said my heart is fine, I also wore a Holter scan for 24 hours and still results say my heart is normal, but the issue here while doing the tests and wearing the 24-hour Holter I surprisingly had no heart palpitations. I am really worried, can you educate me on what test I have to do. When I shower I get tired a bit and have heartbeats that are not palpitations, they are just heart beating as if I am playing a sport, soccer or something, I get that quick beats when I pee, when I pray going on floor, when I walk up one simple set of stairs, and right before closing my eyes and full crashing to sleep I then suddenly wakeup having heartbeats. It is like brain telling me not to sleep as soon as I close my eyes falling into sleep it starts again, when I laugh hard it beats like I am playing sports, every small activity causes my heart to beat normal but the heartbeat speed is like when I am playing sports and running. And as I mentioned, sometimes I get quick palpitations that are different than fast heartbeats, it is like my heart is racing to get out of throat for second or so. Another really really main concern I am so worried about is that in my chest, in my lungs I feel a window of 1 to 3 seconds of tingly or bubbly feeling that reaches my throat, it has no pain and it is not heartburn, and it appears always, like every 1 minute or sometimes every 5 or 10 minutes or more and sometimes for seconds. It is a feeling of very small lighting or like a line that is slowly traveling from my chest up to my throat then back down to the chest and gives me sometimes a closed throat or cry throat feeling for a split second then goes back down to the chest. What should I do? I have incredible stress and anxiety, I sleep at 10 AM, sometimes 11 AM and wake up by 6 PM and cycle repeats. I think a lot and am afraid of what will happen.","Doctor":"Hello. Listening to your symptoms, the possibility which we need to rule out is of cardiac arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation or PSVT. They occur intermittently so may not be picked up on Holter monitoring as you did not have those symptoms during Holter monitoring. It is better if you can attach your ECG and other reports if you have. Most of the cases these are not life threatening although it may give uncomfortable sensations. So, firstly calm yourself and stop thinking anything bad. So, if you are having these symptoms on daily basis now, I would advise you go repeat Holter or even 48 hour Holter or may need long term monitors like implantable loop recorder if Holter is not successful. If it picks then it is fine otherwise you may need elctrophysiological studies which are invasive tests and should be a last option. So, at present, please attach your reports and go for repeat Holter preferably 48 hours. And if this not successful again then we can think of other options."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am on Metoprolol for CHF. I have got a usual heart rate of 60 to 65 BPM, but tonight my HR is at 90 to 95 BPM. May I take extra Metoprolol to control my HR.","Doctor":"Hello. At first, sit for 5 to 10 minutes comfortably, calm yourself, and recheck your pulse rate. It is not immediately life-threatening to have a heart rate in the range of 90 to 95 with no symptoms. However, if you take an extra dose of Metoprolol, BP may go down as well. So, if your BP is on the higher side and pulse rate continues to stay in that range, then you can have it. But since it is not an emergency, it is better to wait and get yourself checked and then hike up the dose. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I really have a big skin problem that has ruined my life.

Keratosis pilaris is a common, harmless skin condition that causes dry, rough patches and tiny bumps, usually on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks. The bumps generally do not hurt or itch. Keratosis pilaris is often considered a variant of normal skin. While there is no cure for keratosis pilaris, these products can help treat those pesky red bumps that show up on the arms and legs. But these red bumps on the skin are very often keratosis pilaris, a harmless (albeit annoying) skin condition caused by a buildup of keratin in the hair follicle. Take care and have a nice time."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I received CBC and CMP blood test results. Info points to kidney issues but dismissed as nothing by my doctor. I would like your opinion. Key points outside normal range: WBC 12.66, hematocrit 45, eosinophils .5, absolute neutrophils 8.76, absolute monocytes .91, BUN 26, creatinine 1.4, calcium 10.6, EGFR 58.29. Note that tests were performed for autoimmune disease.","Doctor":"Hello. Attached investigations do not show evidence of autoimmune condition (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But it shows some impairment in kidney functions as GFR is lower than normal and creatinine is 1.4. This could be an effect of longstanding hypertension or due to another factor. My opinion is to investigate this renal impairment further by doing the albumin/creatinine ratio in urine and kidney ultrasound.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I always make the mistake of choking on ramen and it has been happening a lot lately. I noticed in the last two months that every time I have ramen and choke on the soup, I get a sinus infection or something that feels like uncomfortable post nasal drip. Could it be because of choking on the ramen?","Doctor":"Hi. It is very unlikely that you develop a sinus infection following consumption of any food. However, if your prone for a post nasal drip after consuming anything for that matter, it could be related to a food allergy what we categorise as NINAR (non infectious non allergic rhinitis). Post nasal drip occurs due to accumulation of mucus in the nose which has no place to go other than being blown out or pushed into the throat which often causes irritation and frequent throat clearing. I do not really suggest any treatment for this. You take steam, have warm water and do saline gargles to get rid of the irritation temporarily. Ultimately it is always best to avoid consuming anything which can trigger such a response."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis.

Last year I started using a homeopathic HGH but did not notice that it had homeopathic thyroid in it too (Somaderm). After a few months, I saw a rapid heartbeat. I went to the doctor and found I had an arrhythmia. Took a blood test and T3 was 4.7. Other thyroid numbers normal. The most significant change was VLDL went from 51 to 15. LDL from 130 to 89. Triglycerides from 253 to 76. I stopped my thyroid medicine in half. A couple of months later, I took another thyroid test, and my T3 was down to 2.4. Other thyroid numbers are still normal. I have started taking iodine. Again doing half the dosage of armor and using homeopathic HGH. I do not know how much of each thing I should be using or how to determine what I should do?","Doctor":"Hello. The problem with natural medical products is that even when they are useful, they are not in an exact dose which could be provided in the newly manufactured products. For instance, armor thyroid is extracted from porcine thyroid gland which contains both T4 and T3 usually in the biological ratio, but their concentration may vary depending on the type food of these animals are fed, especially iodine concentration in the food. This is the product responsible for your new symptoms, which are that of over replacement of thyroid hormone, and you did the right thing by having the dose. But whether you are being over replaced or under replaced should be determined by periodic thyroid function test, if a single hormone, then TSH which shows amplified suppression and elevation of both T4 and T3 in hyper and hypothyroidism (here I presume, as you are being replaced, you initially was diagnosed as primary hypothyroidism, which is the most prevalent thyroid disorder). Serum TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary) should be done four to six weeks to adjust the dose till the appropriate treatment has been settled, and then, every six months to one year. Manufactured proprietary tablets are more comfortable to change the dose with since they have exact dosage preparations, 25, 50, 100 or 150 micrograms, and they and they have only Levothyroxine (T4), no rapidly acting T3. So, sudden alteration of biology is unlikely. The dose has to be adjusted by 25 to 50 micrograms each time. Carefully, half of that change for adjustment in heart disease and the elderly. Some essential clues (better confirm by TSH), under replacement (hypothyroidism) weight gain, coarse and dry skin, slow heart rate, constipation. Over replacement (hyperthyroidism) weight loss, sweaty warm skin, palpitation fast heart rate (tachyarrhythmia AF and sometimes heart failure), hyper defecation (increased number of stools) and sometimes diarrhea. As your symptoms are clearly from thyroid over replacement, I would not elaborate on other products. Though my general comment on natural products would apply. Moreover, growth hormone (GH) in excess may cause diabetes, hypertension, sometimes enlargement of organs and other musculoskeletal features. For the current problem, focus on the thyroid."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have been wearing the same eyeglasses prescription for a few years now. I recently had another eye exam, and not much has changed. However, every time I put my current glasses on I starts feeling dizzy. My vision does not seem quite right, and it is giving me headaches. They did adjust my glasses as they thought they were off a bit. That has not seemed to help so curiously what your thoughts might be on this.","Doctor":"Hello. Eye strain after a change of glasses might be due to over or under correction of glasses or improper spectacle frame and centration. So you need to recheck your refraction and lenses whether they are dispensed according to your prescription. If you are having trouble in near-vision or near work, then it might be due to presbyopia. Presbyopia usually starts at 40, but some people might have problems after 35. Other symptoms like headache, neck tightness, and shoulder pain might be due to other causes like glaucoma. So you need a complete eye exam and intraocular pressure IOP check along with the retinal exam. Your doctor might suggest a few investigations if required.

Would losing weight be the best first step to take before visiting a neurologist?","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your concern, I would explain that this feeling could be related to an inner ear disorder. Your blood lab tests show increased white blood cell count suggestive of an infection. Anemia is also present. That is why I recommend taking iron supplements. A brain MRI is also necessary to exclude possible vascular malformation of the brain. It is also essential for checking thyroid hormone levels.

My PCP ordered blood work to look at platelet levels. The only abnormality was a slightly prolonged aPTT time (40 seconds and the lab reference range is 25 to 36 seconds). Further blood work was done: Von Willebrand factor activity, factor VIII activity, and factor VIII related antigen, all of which were borderline low but still within the lab reference ranges. My PCP said there was no evidence of Von Willebrand deficiency and that the petechiae were likely caused by straining while weight lifting. However, I have weigh lifted for many years and never experienced petechiae until a couple of months ago. So, I am wondering if there are any other lab tests that I should ask to be done or if there is no need to do further testing.","Doctor":"Hello. For the petechial rash, you need to investigate with full CBC to check platelet count. Low platelet count is one of the causes of such a rash. I suggest you investigate with SGPT and ultrasonography abdomen to check for liver disease.  Your raised APTT is a surprising result and points towards some coagulation deficiency (attachment removed to protect patient identity). So I suggest you investigate with mixing the study of APTT investigation which will guide us further for detailed workup. If mixing study report is suggestive of an antiphospholipid syndrome-like presentation than you can investigate further with anticardiolipin antibody estimation. So, this is something you can discuss with your treating doctor regarding mixing study for APTT. Meanwhile, over the bruise you can apply Vitamin K cream. I suggest you take Vitamin C lozenges for a few days which will help in managing rash. You can revert back once CBC and USG reports are done."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I am a 39 year old male. My height is 6 feet and I weigh 81 kg. Right side of my left foot is having numbness though it is not 100% numb. The left side of the foot has little pain. I get a feeling that there is some blockage in the blood flow though it might not be the case. I am a regular vipassana meditator and I have been going to 10 day courses regularly for the past 6 years. This time I decided to do a 30 day course. This numbness started happening on the 10th day and continued for 20 more days. A typical vipassana requires sitting for 13-14 hours with small breaks at regular intervals. I thought I will get better once I start doing activity after coming back home (though I used to walk for 15-20 minutes daily during the course also). I never had such problem in the past courses. There was no improvement in the condition even after 15 days after coming back. I have done alternate hot and cold water treatment but did not see any improvement. I also tried doing massage using rheumatic oil. In case it helps, my family has had cases of diabetics (my grandmother and my father's brothers). What would you recommend?","Doctor":"Hello. You have mentioned numbness in the inner part of the left foot as your main symptom. Most commonly numbness is a manifestation of a nerve involvement, it can be compression of the nerve at an anatomical site like in back or anywhere along the course of the nerve or it may be a manifestation of a systemic disease like diabetes or any condition that leads to what we call as neuropathy. Now your trigger has been the yoga courses which you do on a regular basis every year but you have done may be for a prolonged period this year. Being an orthopaedic surgeon, I may not be able to guide you anything regarding yoga and its usefulness but it is logical to stop all these postures till your condition settles and improves. My guess is that there has been some prolonged compression during your classes or there could be an entrapment somewhere along the course of your nerve. I need to know from you: If the answers to above questions are no, my suggestion to you will be to wait for a few days and start with medications for neuropathic symptoms like Pregabalin or Gabapentin along with vitamin B 12 supplementation, and it is a good possibility that your symptoms may subside over next 4-6 weeks because there might be nerve neuropraxia (mid nerve injury). In case your symptoms do not improve or if they increase, then I suggest you to get few blood tests done and nerve conduction studies to look for any compressive pathology.

It started with anxiety about developing schizophrenia and feeling detached from things. Since then, I often get periods of extreme anxiety, involuntary mental images of memories, imagination, dreams, and distorted memories. There are periods of time (1 to 2 weeks) when I feel completely fine. Despite my problems, I was able to take my exams, resume work, and have a social life. I have been seeing a psychologist, who tells me I am on the OCD spectrum. I am always scared that I am losing touch with reality. From the past seven days, my symptoms are, I have very vivid dreams, and when I wake up, I am confused as to whether the dream actually happened or not, and it is only after some time that I convince myself that it did not happen. I have an overactive imagination. As a result, I often act out scenarios in my head. When someone says something, I imagine that they will say this or that next, or this will happen next. It is more like an anticipatory imagination. I try to hold my imagination back, as I am scared I will confuse it with reality. For instance, if a person is sitting in the room next to me, I will think that they are probably doing this or talking to someone or I think that this person will probably do this next. This causes me discomfort and panic, as I think that my overactive imagination is causing me to lose my grip on reality. I do know that this is my imagination, but I feel very scared or anxious as to why I imagine stuff like this in the first place. Usually, in the morning, I feel extremely anxious and feel I have lost my grip on reality, so much so that my teeth chatter from morning to afternoon. I keep on getting mental images of distorted memories of the past, imagination, and dreams. I feel extremely unnerved when I get these mental images, as I feel that I should only be getting mental images of things that actually happened. Why is my imagination or dream bubbling up like this? I feel very anxious when I forget the source of these thoughts or images or cannot determine with 100 % surety as to whether this actually happened. These are mundane things. I also get memory problems. This is probably because I am thinking of my mental problems and not paying attention to things. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why I feel like I am losing my touch with reality, as I am not paying attention when people are actually talking to me. I have been getting extreme feelings of deja vu for the past seven days. Sometimes, things or events seem familiar. It is an effort that I tell myself that this is deja vu. Now the positive things are, there is no problem with my work or social life. I am instantly able to point out when I get these mental images or deja vu. There are periods of time (1 to 2 weeks) when I am completely fine. Strangely, these problems are at their maximum in the morning, and by evening I feel completely fine. My psychologist has told me that I am on the anxiety spectrum. I wanted to know whether someone with anxiety can have these symptoms.","Doctor":"Hello. From your description, it appears that you are having OCD(obsessive-compulsive disorder). Yes, all of your symptoms can be seen in it. The main problem is that you do not have control over your thoughts, that is why imagery and other ruminations occur. The extreme anxiety associated with these ruminations and anticipatory anxiety lead to other problems like memory problems. It surely is not a psychotic illness like schizophrenia, and the symptoms and the positive points you told also go against it. You can also do a self-rating test of OCD like Y-BOCS (Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale), which you can easily find online. Kindly consult a psychiatrist in-person for detailed evaluation and treatment. The treatments that are available are medications and psychotherapy.

Finding it after years of medication tweaking to truly keep my bipolar II symptoms in check, with no significant side effects. I ran out while traveling abroad. Though I have no means of obtaining a new prescription, I do have plenty of Seroquel XR (in 50, 150, and 200 mg dosages) with me. For two nights, I have tried taking a 200 mg XR pill in the evening. Unfortunately, I have gotten little to no sleep and am very concerned about sleep cycle disruptions, as they have always led to more severe symptoms in the past. Moreover, I feel the sedative effects throughout the following day, an impairment I simply cannot afford to deal with right now, as well as a more persistent general sense of anxiety and agitation. If I were to simply crush these pills into a powder, would I be able to take them as though they were immediate-release of the same dose? Or would doing so alter the medication's properties? I am aware of the medication guide's instruction against chewing or cutting the sustained-release pills in any way, but I wish to know what the actual effects of doing so would be. Any suggestions on minimizing related risks, like food or water consumption tips, titration from a lower dose, etc.? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. Let me enlighten you with the concept of IR and XR medication. IR medications mean immediate release; once you take the drug, its effects come in minutes and lasts few hours only. Most of the drugs are in IR form until we need them for some specific purpose. IR medications have a shorter half-life and need to be taken in multiple dosages in a day. XR medications mean extended release; once taken, the drug will be released slowly over a period so that a plateau state for serum drug level can be achieved for a longer period. XR medications have a gastro-resistant coating over it, which prevents them to get dissolved in gastric juices immediately, hence resulting in delayed release of the drug. XR medications have a longer half-life and can be taken once a day. However, breaking an XR drug into powder state will result in erratic release and erratic blood level. Hence, variable effects along with more side-effects. I can understand your problem, sleep disturbance is considered to be the utmost important early warning sign in bipolar disorders, and it needs to be treated as early as possible. In your case, you can opt a short acting benzodiazepine for sleep induction, as you have difficulty to fall asleep. Once sleep is induced, it can be maintained by Seroquel XR (Quetiapine) as well. Zolpidem 5 mg is a good medication for sleep induction. Besides this, you can try Nitrazepam 10 mg for the same purpose. Though Zolpidem has the least dependence potential, and it is the preferred choice. Besides this, follow sleep hygiene measures, they will be helpful over a long run and will help in maintaining healthy sleep-wake cycle without medications. Thank you.

When you take the birth control pills, this thickness will not only slowly increase but, it also loses the water content in it. This makes the lining dark red or brown colored, fleshy, and it will come out in the shape of the uterine cavity en mass. As your cervix is still narrow (it dilates only after a vaginal delivery), the expulsion will be painful. It will not trouble you anymore as the thickness would have come out completely.You can take any of the painkillers, and that would be more than enough. I would always advise you to have a period, once a month and never delay it by more than 45 days. In that case, the thickness will be lesser, and so will the bleeding and the pain. So, I suggest you have the birth control pills cyclically, I mean, without break for 21 days. Then depending on which birth pill you are using, either stop the pills for seven days or continue with the dummy or inactive pills. During these seven days, you will have your periods. But, irrespective of whether you have periods or not, start the next packet from the eighth day. Keep taking it cyclically this way and your periods will never be a problem. Until the age of 21 years, the hormonal axis between your brain, pituitary, and ovary is not mature. So, your cycles will not be perfect. Once this axis is matured, you will have no problems. Hope I have clarified your query. Do write back. All the best.

In the last two months, my period has stopped for about two to three days. Then, again returned after another three days. This month, I had my periods for two times with terrible constipation and lower back pain. Could the progesterone be wearing off?","Doctor":"Hi. IUD (intrauterine device) does not cause constipation. But, back pain can occur, because of the bleeding patterns after placing IUD. You can take syrup M2 tone (Ashoka and Lodhra) two tablespoons thrice daily for one month.

I have pain while swallowing certain oily and spicy food. What should be the treatment? In the last three months, I have got tonsil infection a couple of times.","Doctor":"Hi. Granular pharyngitis occurs because of chronic irritation to the pharynx. It is commonly seen in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, smokers, and nowadays, one of the most common cause for granular pharyngitis is laryngopharyngeal reflux disorder. The usual symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reflux disorder are a mild burning type of throat pain, especially, on swallowing, foreign body sensation in lower part of throat, constant throat clearing, and sometimes early morning voice change. There may not be any symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disorder, such as heartburn and abdominal pain. It is common to have recurrent attacks of throat pain which mimic bacterial pharyngotonsillitis in patients with laryngopharyngitis reflux disorder. I suggest taking anti-reflux medications, at least for three weeks. You can take tablet Pan D (Pantoprazole and Domperidone) 40 mg twice daily for three weeks.

You can take Combiflam (Ibuprofen) tablets after food maximum up to three times a day. But however, I would like to point out that the fever and pain may not be because of your fibroid problem because you have been diagnosed with the problem long back. We have to find the cause for the same. Without knowing the cause for fever it is not advisable to take Combiflam, preferably please take Paracetamol or Dolo 650 mg for fever. One possibility is degenerative changes in the fibroids, which can get secondarily infected and cause pain and fever, or sometimes a reproductive tract infection, or most commonly it can be even because of urinary tract infection. So I would like to know if you are experiencing any pain or burning while passing urine or if there is any increased frequency of passing urine.

But if you are taking antibiotics of Azithromycin class then I suggest taking lower doses of the drug or preferably avoid. The drug is safe with other antibiotics classes commonly used. Take the Viagra brand from the pharmacist. If you fail to get Viagra then take Penegra of Cadila. Both are good. This will have great effects. You can take Tadalafil 20 mg tablet instead of Viagra. The drug has a long duration of action and will provide sustained erection for long. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. The tablet should be taken around one hour before sex. Take plenty of water with the tablet. I hope you are not taking any antihypertensive medicines and any blood coagulants. The drug is safe to use and no serious residual side effects. But if you have good erections then no need to take the tablet.

Also, my mouth stinks.","Doctor":"Hi. There could be following reasons for yellowing of teeth.  There could be yellow or brown layers of tartar at gumline that needs to be taken out so that your actual enamel can be seen. For it, you need to get your scaling done from the dentist and then do brushing twice a day. Your teeth will not get yellow. Scaling (cleaning of teeth) should be done at dental clinic atleast once a year.  If your enamel is weaken then you should brush at mild force and once a day before sleeping. As excessive brushing wears off enamel (the white layer) of the tooth and exposes dentin (yellow layer) of the tooth. Start doing saline water mouthrinses two times a day after getting your scaling done. Then it will get you relieved from mouth stinking. For appropriate diagnosis please provide me a few pictures of your teeth so that I can suggest you need scaling or yellowness is due to harsh brushing or any other factor.

When you listen silently, you can hear the exhalation sound, and that is absolutely normal.

I had a blood test two months back which showed serum prolactin levels at 618. I was unaware what the test was for so breastfed before and during the blood being taken. I breastfeed a toddler between 3 to 8 times a day. (He is also eating solids so most feeds are comfort suckling). I had the test repeated last week and the serum prolactin level is 480. I did not breastfeed before or during the test. When the GP discussed my first blood results I disclosed I had been experiencing frequent headaches. I was advised to monitor my peripheral vision. I mentioned my vision has become more blurry than usual, since my eye test four months back. (I have prescription glasses for astigmatism). I have had only 5 menstrual cycles since giving birth 19 months ago. My facial skin is more spotty than it was during puberty and I have become more hairy since pregnancy. Two days before the second blood test I experienced black moving patches of static in my peripheral vision in both eyes. I experienced this a second time the day after the test. I have experienced similar visual disturbances during historic migraines on two occasions, however those were in one eye in the centre of my field of vision. I will disclose this to my GP at my next appointment. I take no medication and my current diagnoses are migraines and depression. The migraines are medicated with over-the-counter painkillers. May I receive an opinion on my current situation. My second blood test has resulted in no further action and I worry I may be overlooked due to breastfeeding.","Doctor":"Hi. To get rid you of your worries, I should let you know the usual level of prolactin in different conditions. The upper limit of normal for many assays of serum prolactin is approximately 500 mIU/L (24 ng/mL). In non-pregnant and non-lactating patients, monomeric prolactin concentrations of 500 to 1000 mIU/L (24 to 47 ng/mL) are likely to be induced by stress or drugs, and a repeat measurement is indicated. Levels between 1000 and 5000 mIU/L (47 to 236 ng/mL) are likely to be due to either drugs, a microprolactinoma (<1cm) or disconnection hyperprolactinemia (pituitary stalk compression blocking dopamine inhibition on prolactin). Levels above 5000 mIU/L (236 ng/mL) are highly suggestive of a macroprolactinoma (> 1 cm) . Your problems may be attributed to migraine, astigmatism you said to have. Persistent and progressive loss of peripheral vision may occur sometimes with headache, morning vomiting, even in that case, which must be further investigated, your levels are not very suggestive of prolactinoma or solely stalk compressing tumour, rather a tuomour in or extending into suprasellar region pressing optic chiasma, may be craniopharyngioma, meningioma, etc. After knowing that you have persistent and progressive loss of peripheral vision your doctor should do fundoscopy usually at bedside, confrontation test, perimetry are also done, and you should be advised MRI of pituitary."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I talk to myself.

It is good that you are insightful about your experiences and seeking out more information to empower yourself. The first thing to remember is you are not crazy. You are experiencing emotional difficulties, and you will get better gradually with support. You appear to be using fantasy as a coping mechanism to deal with problems in real life. Many people have this experience. We tend to use our imagination to visualize better scenarios. Some of us have an overactive imagination and wishful thinking and develop an elaborate fantasy world. It becomes unhealthy if fantasizing starts affecting your real life. With support, you can develop more healthy coping mechanisms. Have you tried writing down your rich imaginative fantasy world? Some find it helpful to write down their experiences into stories. You can try and see whether it is useful for you.

I read your query. You need to take Levothyroxine for the rest of your life regularly because our body daily needs this hormone for various functions like metabolism etc. However, along with that you can use some herbal products which can help you up to some extent and your dose of Levothyroxine may decrease and you will also feel relieved from other symptoms. 1. Take capsule Giloy two capsules two times a day with water after food for one month. 2. Take tablet Kanchanar Guggulu one tablet two times a day with water after food for one month. 3. Walk daily at least for 30 to 60 minutes.

I had sudden deafness of left ear last year. No infection, no injury, no other disease. Treatment started with Mecobalamin, Dexamethasone sodium phosphate, and some other medication through IV. Also treated with mouse nerve growth factor and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Oral Mecobalamin and B complex for a month. Now there is still some low-frequency hearing loss of the left ear and mild tinnitus. I am seeking for more treatment options and advice which may improve the hearing function.","Doctor":"Hello. As per reported by you, there is an improvement in the left ear however, in spite of all the treatments done, sometimes the loss is not entirely reversible. Thus there are high chances of the damage in the left ear to be the same, which is mild at low frequency. The main rates responsible for speech perception are that of 500, 1k and 2 k which are mild. However, your right ear will compensate so there would not be much problem in communication. Regarding tinnitus, you can consult an audiologist for TRT, which is called tinnitus retraining therapy from where you might get some results for tinnitus. If you want, you can ask an otolaryngologist for low-frequency hearing loss for further treatment. If your tinnitus is reduced, you will hear much better."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have allergic rhinitis. My eyes are itching, sneezing, I have runny nose, and hives.

His platelets were 1,35,000 five days back, then decreased a day later to 1,17,0000. Then next day night he was admitted in hospital because his platelets reduce again and count was 80,000. After admitting, his platelets are still reducing. Next day evening was 66,000 and today morning is 60,000. But he is feeling well as compared to starting days. Right now he has very low fever, no headache. We are very worried about platelets count. How we can increase and why still platelets count are decreasing after admitting him? The doctor is giving only Paracetamol saline. No medicine. Could you please suggest what we need to do or it will recover soon? He is taking 5 litre water daily and fruits apple, kiwi.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, admitting the patient will not lead to an improvement in platelet count. The patient will be advised admission when the platelet counts are low because of the risk associated with bleeding due to low platelet count.  Secondly, initially, there will be high-grade fevers then as the fever comes down that is called defervescence the viral load comes down and destruction of platelets comes down and platelet levels initially get stabilized and then gradually improves. Third, there is no medicine that can actually directly improve platelet count. Fourth, the only thing we should understand is to maintain good hydration and for symptomatic relief, we give saline for hydration and Paracetamol for fever and body pains relief. Fifth, to what level platelets go down and then start improving varies between patients that depends upon one's individual immunity status. So to boost immunity and catabolic state we need to provide nutritious food, fruits and maintain good hydration."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am looking for a third opinion.

I wore my retainer nearly every night, but on an occasion where I forgot to wear it, it would be painful the night after and felt like the teeth had moved. Fast forward to now, I have still been wearing my retainer, and found that whenever I forgot to wear it for more than two days, the teeth would move (almost noticeably), and when I used the retainer the teeth would go back to normal. Recently, I found a large crack in my retainer and found that even after wearing it for a few nights, two of my teeth are slightly out of place. I understand that I need a new retainer, however, if they were to make impressions of my teeth now, the retainer would keep the two shifted teeth permanently shifted. Is there a way to clone a retainer? So that my teeth would go back to being perfect using the original impression, rather than an impression of my shifted teeth.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome back to icliniq.com. The first thing is to go to the clinician and get examined. Ask for the repair of the old retainer to the maximum detailing possible until it could correct the two teeth. Meanwhile, impressions for your new retainer could be taken and fabricated. New retainers could be adjusted to retain the treatment undergone earlier and could bring back minor movements to the original position, which you are worried about. If possible, ask the clinician for permanents fixed palatal or lingual retainers at a later date after satisfactory correction if the minor movement is required for the present situation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am currently having problems with straight neck and migraine headaches.

I have the following conditions. 1. IHD for many years (T wave inversion). Recently undergone TMT and 2D echo. Both are negative. 2. Mild BP is normal and under control. 3. Thyroid under control. 4. Diabetes for five years and under control. 5. Prostatomegaly for five years is normal and under control. I am taking the following medicines, Betacard 50 mg, Glycomet 500 mg twice, Atorva 10 mg, Amtas 10 mg, Thyronorm 75 mcg, Deplatt 75 mg, Urimax D 0.4 mg. I have attached my lipid profile as well. I observed that though my cholesterol levels showed a decrease over two years, there is a marked increase in triglycerides from last year. I have been taking Atorva or some other statin right for 13 years. The apparent reason for me is recently I have been taking some snacks (like mixture, save, etc.) quite often. Besides that, I take biscuits two pieces twice a day besides some bakery products. Apart from that, I do not eat much-fried foods. I do not take ghee or vanaspati. I regularly walk for four km at a stretch. I am not sedentary. I do not drink or smoke. Now my question is whether I have to increase my statin dosage from 10 mg to 20 mg or so. Or does 10 mg is sufficient for these levels? My attending doctor did not say anything. Also, I have been taking Clopidogrel. Two years have been passed. Can I stop or do I have to continue. If so, how long? Please advise on Atorva and Deplatt.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have gone through your explanation in detail. Your triglycerides level is at borderline, not high. You do not have to increase the Statin dosage all you need is to readjust your diet. Reduce the snacks and eat more vegetables and fruits. You should continue taking the Clopidogrel, it will reduce your chance of a heart event, so you cannot stop it. You might need to take it for as long as possible. Continue with the Atorva (Atorvastatin) and Deplatt (Clopidogrel) too, once you are not experiencing any adverse reactions from use. They could be a substitute, or the dosage can be increased if after you changed your diet, yet the triglycerides level keeps rising. I hope I was of help to you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 20 years old. I had an unplanned pregnancy. I and my partner decided to have an abortion.

You should have confirmed intrauterine pregnancy and then after doctor's advise, abortion kit can be used. Anyway, now you can get checked your blood beta hCG level to confirm whether you were pregnant or not. It can be still elevated slightly if you were pregnant. For your heavy bleeding, Tranexamic acid tablet can be prescribed.

The stains seem to be the onset of early childhood caries which usually starts on the four upper front teeth due to improper brushing (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Try to brush at least two times after feeding. If possible, wipe the front teeth after every feeding using wet cotton to remove all sticky milk from the teeth. As the babies usually drink milk in lying down posture, milk accumulates between upper lips and front four teeth causing milk sticking to them for a long time. It is better if you can go to a dentist and get a fluoride varnish to prevent the breakdown of those teeth in the near future."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a question concerning a failed medical abortion.

I am okay with the abortion. I just feel like I had a second chance or I am being punished.","Doctor":"Hello. If you have been given tablet Mifepristone 200 mg during the medical abortion process then there is no point continuing the pregnancy as it can cause congenital anomalies in the foetus, however, if only Misoprostol was used then you can contemplate continuation. There are different check levels with scans which can determine anomalies during continuing pregnancy- at 11 to 13 weeks NT scan, quadruple scan, anomaly scan at 18 to 20 weeks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 26 years old.

The foreskin retracts itself on erection and if you had no problem for masturbation, there will not be any problem for sex as well. Foreskin never comes in the way of sex.

Generally, for esophageal atresia, two to three procedures (in parts) are done for correcting the anomaly because it is almost impossible to stretch the tube so far as to reach the stomach. As far as I know, we put in a gastrostomy tube wherein food is directly poured into the stomach via a tube. Theoretically speaking if we find such an anomaly, it is essential to check for other physical anomalies in the vital organs like brain, heart, lungs, kidney, stomach, liver, etc. Generally, in such cases with proper intervention at the appropriate time, there should not be any issues."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have light patches on my chin area that grew overtime gradually.

But still she is 4'5\\", and her height is not increasing, and as a girl, she faces too many problems because of her height. Will GHRP (HGH) work?","Doctor":"Hello. Expected height of your sister should be, 2.54x (75+67) /2)-6.5(+/-)10 cm = 173.84 (+/-) 10 cm = 5'8.44\\"(+/-) 3.9 inch. Girls usually acquire their final height by the age of 16 years.

Treatment is a replacement, costly, and valid only when given timely (before puberty). In achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia, intelligence is average, and body habitus is disproportionate.

This looks like more of a Chronic pharyngitis. The red spot you have pointed out is more of a lymphoid follicle which has slightly increased in size and is present in almost all of us. There is nothing that you need to worry about as this is a very common entity we come across and is treatable. You can consider following the advice mentioned below  Drugs mentioned in point 1,2 and 3 can be taken only if there is an acute infection associated with pain while swallowing. If there is no pain or infection the medication mentioned in 1,2 and 3 are not required. Make sure you follow points in 4, 5 and 6 as long as possible as this prevents the possibility of developing a throat infection. There is absolutely nothing to worry about the red spot over there as it doesnt indicate any cancer or malignancy and is only a lymphoid follicle which has increased in size due to possible previous throat infections. I hope I have answered your query in detail. If there is anything more you want to know or enquire, please let us know and we will get back to you ASAP.

I used to advice hygienic precautions, use of condoms at sex to avoid transmission of sexually transmitted disease, soft, comfortable undergarments, sitz baths recurrently in a day, avoiding overtreatment, avoiding local cosmetics, use of water and soft razor (to remove hairs) only, etc. 8.
