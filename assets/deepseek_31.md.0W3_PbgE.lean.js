High blood sugar level can cause diabetic coma due to osmolar edema in brain. Uncontrolled hypertension can cause brain hemorrhage and coma. In your mother's case, hypoxic brain damage is another cause. She was having flat line twice. This means that her heart stopped twice. This might cause reduced blood supply to brain and hypoxic damage. To rule out all these possibilities, get done MRI brain and CSF (cerebro spinal fluid) analysis. Hope I have solved your query.

As per your query you have symptoms of  flu & high fever. Well there can be many reasons for symptoms you mention in query , but in your case it seems to me that the symptoms are due to viral infection or viral pharyngitis.

I would suggest you to do warm saline gargles several times a day , drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and consult pulmonologist for proper examination. Doctor may order throat swab test and blood test .

And treatment in such case should be directed on causative organism. So you may need sputum culture and sensitivity report.

Your symptoms are associated with eating. So by mistake when we aspirate food particles in trachea (wind pipe), it gets blocked. Due to this, we can not get air and hence we feel breathlessness. During this episode our body is deprived of oxygen and so black out is seen. To overcome this, violent coughing (reflex) is done by the body to cough put food particle.

Treatment of COPD is based on severity only. You may need additional antibiotic, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) on the basis of chest x ray and PFT report. Chest x ray will also rule of possibility of lung cancer. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Almost all lung infection (specially tuberculosis) heal with either fibrosis or calcification or both. Very rarely complete resolution is seen. So fibrotic scar lesions after tuberculosis are common after tb. They will remain as it is through out the life. No treatment is required and hence not available for these scars because these are inactive, non infectious lesions. No drug is available to remove them. For visa purpose, we need to prove that these lesions are not active infectious lesions. For this, you need to consult pulmonologist and get done CT thorax with Contrast and Bronchoscopy with BAL analysis.

Common causes for such recurrent pericardial effusion are infection like tuberculosis and malignancy. If we don't treat underlying pathology, this fluid will accumulate and may endanger life. So better to get done repeat thoracocentesis and get done fluid reports for tuberculosis and malignancy. If it is tubercular then anti tubercular drugs will cure him. But if it is malignant then he will need pigtail catheter insertion in pericardium. Diuretic works only in transudative fluid.

This is mostly due to friction bleeding from sinuses. You are having allergy and sinusitis. So inflamed sinuses can cause bleeding on pressure or force. So no need to worry for this episode. But if this kind of episode happens again then get done endoscopic examination of sinuses time rule out internal pathology. At present no need to worry. Hope I have solved your query.

I used to be bulimic, do you think I could have damaged my stomach in some way?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain, gaseous distention of stomach and noises from stomach. So better to avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I went to the er this week with chest pain , shortness of breath headache they rain an ekg, chest xray, cardiac enzymes, and a d dimer and everything came back normal. The only risk factor i have for blood vlots is that i took the birth control pill for 4 years. Should i still be worried about a clot? Im not on the pill anymore.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Since your d dimer and ecg are normal, possibility of Pulmonary embolism (clot in lung) is very less. But birth control pills is major risky factor for embolism. So if you want to confirm that you are not having Pulmonary embolism then get done CT Pulmonary angiography. If this is normal then you are not having embolism for sure. Also get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis because this can also cause similar symptoms. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

How likely it is that I am having coronary blockage? and what is the treatment?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. If your ecg is showing ischemic changes in inferior leads then you are mostly having inferior wall ischemia. This means your heart's inferior wall is not getting enough blood. This wall is supplied by right coronary artery. So possibility of right coronary artery obstruction is more in your case. To confirm this you need to get done 1. 2 d echo 2. Stress test (trade mill test) 3. Coronary angiography. Coronary angiography is not only diagnostic but it is therapeutic also. We can put Stent if there is blockage in coronary arteries. So consult cardiologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Yes, by history and description, you are mostly having asthma. Asthma is allergic disease which causes rhinitis (sneezing and running nose) and bronchospasm (cough, wheezing, breathlessness). So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose asthma but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of asthma is based on severity only. You will need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid. Intranasal spray containing steroid is also useful in rhinitis.

These lesions are not suggestive of active tuberculosis. These lesions are suggestive of healed, old, scar lesions. All lung insults whether tubercular, pneumonia or injury, heal by fibrosis. So you might be having any of these in the past which were healed and now showing fibrotic lesions. So in my opinion, you are not requiring anti tubercular treatment. You are also having cardiomegaly and prominent left ventricle. This is commonly seen with hypertension and other heart diseases. So get done blood pressure monitoring, ecg and 2d echo to rule out heart diseases. So your x ray report is not suggestive of any serious disease but you need to rule out heart diseases.

Diaphragm is involuntary muscle and very unlikely to go in spasm. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis because bronchitis can also cause squeezing feeling in chest. If PFT is suggestive of obstructive defect then you may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar squeezing feeling. So avoid stress and tension if you have these. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Since you are having COPD and scleroderma, following are the likely cause for your central chest tightness and stabbing pain. 1. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) 2. Worsening of COPD 3. Pulmonary hypertension (PH). Scleroderma causes dilatation of esophagus and laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. So GERD can occur. PH is common in COPD patients who are also having scleroderma. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination, 2d echo and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out all these possibilities. At present, if you are not having insurance, you can try proton pump inhibitors on empty stomach. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. If you are improving then it is mostly GERD.

HRZ is having isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R) and pyrazinamide (Z). All are must in primary complex in children. So there are no alternative to these drugs. And vomiting is common after these drugs. This is because of gastritis caused by these drugs. So to avoid this, give antacid and anti emetic drugs before giving HRZ. You can also give HRZ after some food. If still he is having vomiting then get done ultrasound examination of abdomen and liver function test to rule out jaundice (HRZ induced jaundice). So discuss allergy these with his treating doctor.

For this reason, I would recommend performing a cardiac ultrasound and a resting ECG in order to examine her heart function and structure. Considering her blackout attacks, I would recommend performing some tests too: - complete blood count for anemia,- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance. An ambulatory 24-48  hours ECG monitoring would help examine her heart rhythm trends for a prolonged time and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia. Hope I have answered your query.

He was on coumadin, (sp?), for about 3-4 years then went off of it in late January/early February, and, even with this diagnosis, does not want to return to it. He lives in a wonderful assisted living community, does not smoke and is not over weight at all. Fully aware that all situations are different, is there any kind of forecast you would be willing to share as far as what to expect as far as his quality of life and life expectancy? Thank you!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Pulmonary embolism is common in old age due to atherosclerosis and stiffening of arteries. Severity, life expectancy, prognosis etc depends on 1. Size of embolism (massive embolism can cause sudden death). 2. Involvement of pulmonary artery. If main Pulmonary artery is involved then prognosis is poor. But if distal, smaller arteries are involved then prognosis is good and hence life expectancy is more. 3. Severity of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary embolism (PE) almost always cause Pulmonary hypertension (PH). So if PH is severe then prognosis is poor.

This causes less albumin in the blood. You are having less albumin for this reason. When albumin decreases then water retention occurs and this gets collected in the lungs, abdomen and legs causing pleural effusion, ascites and swollen limbs.In chest x ray pleural effusion means larger than 150 cc of fluid in lungs. It is important to see the x ray to know the approximate quantity of fluid. If it is less than 500 cc then medicines like diuretics can be given and the fluid will come out in urine. The blood albumin is to be corrected with nutrition.If the effusion is large then it requires insertion of intercostal drainage tubes and this will allow the fluid to be taken out through a tube in the chest wall. If your effusion is small then this is not required and it can be treated with medicine. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I have this dull nagging pain in my chest and then it goes to my left sholder and left arm, i have had 2 stress test in the past and have had nemrous EKG's and all are normal but i am really worried about this, its been about a month and it happens every day, what could this be? i do have anxitey, could this be stress and should i be concerned?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic.

The next few days I had chest pain that felt like I had really pulled a muscle or bruised the chest wall. The following Sunday I swam again but got very very tired and some chest discomfort. I final went Wed to ER and they finally did a cath. They saw three arteries with one graft that had clot for 100% blockage. They did an intervention the following day and said they got it right and repaired one of the grafts also. Sat. When I was due for discharge, I got tremendously out of breath. They gave me a Colace.

She diagnosed costachondritis........the pain is awful....how long will it take for me to recover and get back to work","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Pneumonia is the most common cause for pleurisy (inflammation of pleura). And pleurisy is causing the chest pain. So in your case as chest pain is continuous and not improving, possibility of persistent pneumonia is more. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and Chest x ray to rule out worsening of pneumonia. Also get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. Culture will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide you about effective antibiotic treatment. This is the best treatment for pneumonia. Once pneumonia resolves, pleurisy will also reduce and hence chest pain will subside. You can apply warm water pad on affected areas. This will also reliev pain. Hope I have solved your query.

In my opinion, you are mostly having post infectious bronchitis. It is common after viral upper respiratory tract infection (cold). Your symptoms like wheezing, cough with expectoration, coughing attacks etc are suggestive of bronchitis more. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only.

Her symptoms are suggestive of either uncontrolled hypertension or coronary artery disease (CAD) or heart failure, because all these cause chest pain with radiation to arm. Ecg can be normal even with the disease in some patients. So better to consult cardiologist and get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring to rule out high BP. 2.

In my opinion, his chest pain is mostly due to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) because it is improved with antacid (gas x pills). But better to rule out heart diseases because he is 60 years old and heart diseases are common at this age. So consult doctor and get done blood pressure monitoring, ecg and 2d echo. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. His chest pain is more likely due to GERD. So ask him to avoid stress and tension, avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs regularly. Quit smoking and alcohol if he have these habits. Don't worry, he will be alright.

But since since your TMT is borderline and it appears you don't have chest pain on exertion, less likely that you'll have significant blockage this time needing intervention. Still if there is any doubt regarding TMT you can undergo stress thallium. If stress thallium is positive then angiography can be done to detect blockages. Also regarding precautions, you need to have low fat, low sugar diet, regular exercises like brisk walking. Also take medicine as advised properly.Hope I have answered your query.

The tightbess is gone and I thought I was getting better until yesterdayn whenI became tired and the cough started to leave a metallic taste in my mouth. I've read my dental inplants could be the cause or possibly this has turned into Bronchial infection. Will it go awa?   Am I contagious?  Should I see a doctor? (I'm a big fan of letting my body - not meds - heal itself.)Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having post infectious bronchitis. It is common after viral upper respiratory tract infection (cold). And cough with expectoration is common symptom for this. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). If you don't treat this in early stages, this will cause breathlessness also. So better to consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your concern. No need to worry for this. Gynecomastia is basically a hormonal disease. Most common cause for this is hormonal imbalance (more of estrogen and less of testosterone). So in my opinion, you should definitely consult endocrinologist and get done clinical examination and hormone levels to rule out hormonal imbalance. If imbalance is there then you have to take hormone therapy to balance them. In Banglore consult Columbia Asia hospital. It is having good endocrine department. Don't feel shy. This is treatable.

I can understand your concern. Basically you are having left sided chest pain when you are excited. Excitement causes sympathetic stimulation and this can cause heart damage. So we should first rule out heart diseases in your case. So get done ecg and 2d echo first. If both are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Should I be worried this is cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are a uterine cancer survivor, this nodule in lung can be due to metastasis. Uterine malignancy is known to metastasize to lungs. And in initial stages, metastatic lesion looks like nodule only. So your current nodule can be due to cancer. But it is too early to say this. You need to get done CT scan every three monthly and if nodule is increasing in size then biopsy is needed to confirm malignancy. But if nodule is static or decreasing in size then no need to worry for malignancy. It might be due to benign cyst or fibrosis.So better to consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.

I still am not sure... What do you think?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern.

Just now I used the restroom again and the stools were loose, plus there was quite a bit of white mucus. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. Possibility of bronchitis is more in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).

I was wondering about it. The blockage was in the base of the fork going into the heart which was opened when the stent was in place. But it had both forks blocked, from what I understand.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. LAD called as left anterior descending artery is one of the main arteries supplying the heart. Whenever there is blockages in its proximal part, whole of the heart area which it supplies is at risk and there is high risk of death. That's the reason why it is called as widowmaker. You mentioned one of the blockages of the fork was opened, it may be due to blockage in the other stem. That is, left circumflex may not be more than 80%, and that might be the reason why it was not opened by your cardiologist.Hope I have answered your query.

I can understand your concern. Your x ray report is suggestive of smoking related lung damage. You are having COPD (chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease). So hyperinflation of lungs is likely. You are also having pleural based opacity. Lungs are surrounded by thin layers called pleura. Opacity in pleura is mostly due to either collection of fluid or mass like lesion.

Knocked the wind out of me and hurt while getting up but I figured I maybe just lightly bruised the chest and ribs.  Pain has been horrendous trying to move, breath, cough, sneeze, etc...my whole right  side hurts even down my my stomach.  There's no bruising but the area feels puffy....side of chest and upper abdomen and both areas are tender. Breathiing was a little easier today but still painful.  Might I have a flail chest or.......a punctured lung?  And, if I go  to the ER at this late stage won't  the be upset with me for not coming in sooneer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely go to ER now, don't afraid of being late. You had blunt chest trauma and your symptoms are mostly due to any of the following. 1. Rib fracture 2. Pneumothorax 3. Pulmonary confusions. 4. Musculoskeletal injury. So better to consult doctor and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and Chest x ray.If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for major Pulmonary disease. Your symptoms are mostly due to musculoskeletal injury. So apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. You can also wear chest belt to avoid minimal mobilization of affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright.

My e-mail ID is  YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion you are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) related bronchitis and productive cough. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause acidity, chest pain, reflux in wind pipe and trachea. This reflux causes chronic inflammation in airways. This causes bronchitis, cough and expectoration. So we should first treat your GERD to control bronchitis. So avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. For bronchitis, take inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Don't worry, you will be alright with above mentioned things. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"31 year old female.

I can understand your concern. Your symptoms are characteristic of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Since you are smoker, GERD is likely and this is even worse by alcohol intake. Actually both (smoking and alcohol) cause laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause chest pain. So better to avoid smoking and alcohol as soon as possible. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.

In my opinion, you should consult doctor and rule out Pulmonary and heart diseases because you are having positive ANA (anti nutrophilic antibodies) and having breathlessness only exertion.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having stress and anxiety related symptoms. Stress and Anxiety are the biggest risk factors for acid reflux and tension headaches. So we should first treat your stress and anxiety. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. And beta blockers are known to reduce anxiety, so no harm in taking it. For your chest symptoms, along with antacids, you need to follow these lifestyle modifications. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 2.

But gradually over the time the condition is that, i have it everyday. One day I took montair fx and it reduced for two days. I have been taking it since then. Now, wheezing doesn t reduce with the intake of inhalers. It reduces only with montair fx. What are the side effects of prolonged use of montair fx ? Any other remedy to cure/reduce my asthma attacks ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Asthma is allergic disease. It needs regular treatment in the form of anti allergic drug and inhaled treatment. Best way to control allergy is identification of allergen and if possible complete avoidance of it. So avoid dust, pollens, mites, animal fur, smoke etc. Wear face mask every time you go outside home. Montair FX is having montelukast and fexofenadine. Montelukast is anti allergic drug and fexofenadine is antihistamine drug. Both are safe for long term without any side effects. So continue montair FX, it is good drug for asthma control. Also continue long acting inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). You should take these drugs for prolonged period (atleast 1-2 years).

I can understand your concern. Your father is having blunt chest and abdominal trauma. Traumatic kidney injury needs nephrectomy (removal of kidney) and liver injury needs surgical repair. So doctor has done appropriate treatment. Rib fracture don't require surgical fixation. We have to just immobilize the fractured segments so that with time they heal and unite togather. Now we need to wait for healing and stabilization of body vitals. We need to give time to body for healing. Usual time for complete healing and stabilization is 1-2 months. So ask him to take complete body rest for 1-2 months. Don't worry, he will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having simple viral infection. No need to worry for this x ray report. This x ray picture is suggestive of old healed TB lesion. You had tuberculosis in past. Almost all tb lesions after treatment heal by fibrosis or calcification. These healed lesions will remain as it is through out the life. So I think your present x ray showing healed fibrosis lesion of previous tb infection. You are also not having fever and loss of appetite. So possibility of active tb is very less in your case. Simple viral infection is more likely in your case. And hence simple antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs are required for 1-2 weeks Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out heart blocks in your case. You said that your ecg was showing slow rhythm. This is seen in heart blocks. And if this is present then your all symptoms like weakness, dizziness, breathlessness etc are explained. In heart blocks, pumping of heart is reduced and hence blood supply to organs is reduced. And hence all these symptoms occur. So first consult cardiologist and get done repeat ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart blocks. Another possibility is hormonal imbalance and anaemia due to menstrual abnormality. So get done hormone levels and haemoglobin estimation to rule out this. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Thanks Abdul Khader","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. IgE is marker of allergy. And you are having IgE level 1499. This is considered as very high. So possibility of allergy is more in your case. You are also having constant, severe cough. So we should first rule out asthma in your case.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is must for the diagnosis of asthma. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of asthma is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Oral combination of antihistamine and anti allergic drugs are also indicated in your case.

My mom was just admitted to the hospital due to fluid in her lungs.  What are her chances of getting better?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, this does not carry good prognosis in your mother's case. She is having low heart pumping (25%) and chronic kidney disease (dialysis dependent). So her heart and kidneys are almost non functioning. When these two organs fail in their work, fluid tend to accumulate in the body. This is the reason why she is having fluid in the lungs. This also causes breathlessness. So breathlessness and fluid in the lungs suggest further deterioration in heart and kidney functions. And hence this carries poor prognosis. Chances of getting better are very very less. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother.

I can understand your concern. Your father is mostly having chronic bronchitis. And at present, he is having uncontrolled bronchitis. Bronchitis needs regular treatment. Asthalin is having salbutamol. It is short acting beta 2 agonist. It's action lasts for only 2 hours. It should not be used as regular drug.

This causes bronchospasm and this spasm is the reason for chest tightness and breathing difficulty. You are not improving because you are not taking complete treatment. Bronchitis is mostly caused by infection. So antibiotics are fine. But to relieve bronchospasm, you need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). You are not taking these inhaled drugs and hence you are not improving.

In my opinion, your numbness I'd mostly due to nutrition deficiency like deficiency of vitamins, minerals etc. You recently come out of an acute illness. You stayed in hospital for 2 weeks. In acute illness, body 's nutritional requirement increases. And since we are not eating properly during those days of admission, our body remains deprived of vital nutrients like vitamin b 12, folic acid, zinc, calcium etc. And deficiency of these cause numbness.

These problems may be due to two reasons, one is when one begins BP medicine, blood pressure tend  to fall and one gets symptoms of dizziness and vertigo so she should monitor her blood pressure. If her bp is remaining on lower side persistently then she needs to decrease the dose. Also hydrochlorothiazide can cause electrolytes abnormalities so these like sodium and potassium should be checked once. Otherwise whenever she gets symptoms she can consume fluid with some added salt and sugar provided her BP is not high. If BP is not high then there is no harm in giving it.Hope I have answered your query.

And this gives chest pain, chest tightness, pressure, feeling of breathlessness etc. So your symptoms were mostly due to worsening gastritis by champagne. And your mom must have given you antacid that helped you. So better not to take alcohol after any oral drugs (especially antibiotics). Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Rarely Pulmonary embolism can cause sudden onset chest tightness and breathing difficulty. So if PFT is normal then get done CT Pulmonary angiography to rule out Pulmonary embolism. If this is also normal then possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright. But better to rule out above mentioned causes. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of either sleep apnea or sleep disturbances is more. So better to consult sleep specialist and get done clinical examination and sleep study. If you are obese then possibility of sleep apnea is more. In this case you need to loose weight and stay fit and health. CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is also useful in it. And if you have stressful life then possibility of sleep related disturbances is more. In this case, you should consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions.

I can understand your concern. Possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more in your case. But better to rule out heart diseases first. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. GERD is more likely in your case. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of Central chest pain, burping, chest tightness etc. Along with drugs, you need to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Go for walk after meals. 4. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 5. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. 6. Loose weight if you are obese. Don't worry, you will be alright.

He woke up from a nap Tuesday night at 8:00PM, clinching the center of his chest, and with severe jaw pain, which he had felt the jaw pain earlier in the day. I rushed him to the ER and Chest Xrays, blood work and EKG all came back normal. Today is Friday, the catheter was removed yesterday and he is taking the Hydrocodine for pain as needed, however the chest and jaw tightness are still there. He really feels the chest tightness when he lays on his left side, or twists his body to the side, or takes a deep breath (He's a smoker, by the way). We have an appointment set up with a cardiologist for next Thursday, but would like to have these questions answered so we don't spend the weekend worrying.  We are wondering if this pain could be due to the Hydrocodine, or perhaps a muscle in his chest could be pulled due to the stress on his body, causing the additional pain to the jaw, or perhaps even an infection of some sort.  The last thing I want to think is perhaps there is a clot or embolism, but is it possible?  We've been told to take him back to the ER if the pain worsens, I can have him there in minutes.  Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, possibility of pulmonary embolism is high in his case. Risk factors in his case are 1. Recent surgery 2. Active smoker 3. Chest pain and Chest tightness, recurrent and not relieving. So possibility of pulmonary embolism is more. He needs CT Pulmonary angiography to rule out this. If CT Pulmonary angiography is normal then no need to worry for Pulmonary embolism. His pain can be due to musculoskeletal cause. Don't worry, he will be alright. But better to first rule out Pulmonary embolism. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your husband.

I can understand your concern. Yes, you are right. Quadtab is having four drugs combination for tuberculosis. In my opinion, he should not start this drugs only on the basis of x ray. Any previous lung insult like infection or injury, heals by fibrosis. So fibrosis on chest x ray does not suggest active tuberculosis. Better to first get done sputum examination for AFB (acid fast bacilli-bacteria causing tuberculosis), CT thorax and Bronchoscopy, BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis.

I am 33 female non smoker.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, possibility of reflux induced bronchitis is more in your case. Actually alcohol causes laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. So reflux is more in patients who takes alcohol. This reflux causes micro aspiration in lungs. And this causes persistent inflammatory reaction in airways. So bronchitis is common in reflux patients. So your tickling cough, hurting in lungs etc can be due to bronchitis. So consult pulmonologist and get done PFT. If PFT is suggestive of obstructive Pulmonary disease then you need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for treatment. Avoidance of alcohol should be the priority. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

No, rapid and shallow breathing can not cause prominent cardiac silhouette and mild venous congestion. Prominent cardiac silhouette is commonly seen in hypertension and other heart diseases like coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy etc. Venous congestion is also seen in hypertension.

I can understand your concern. No amlovas can not cause shortness of breath. Amlovas is having amodipine. It is anti hypertensive drug. It will not cause shortness of breath. Your shortness of breath is mostly due to uncontrolled bronchitis. Best treatment for bronchitis is inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS).

I can understand your concern. Wound gapping and delayed healing can be seen after bypass surgery. And this can cause pain especially in movements of chest. In my opinion, you should consult cardiac surgeon for this. He needs revision surgery with artificial bone graft. By this healing can be achieved and hence symptomatic relief is more likely. Calcium and vitamin d 3 supplements are also helpful in healing. So consult cardiac surgeon and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father.

I can understand your concern. Advent is having combination of amoxicillin and clavulinic acid. Ideal dose is 625 mg three times a day.So better to take it thrice daily. Twice daily dose is insufficient and hence chances if partial or incomplete recovery are more. So better to take it thrice daily. If she is having vomiting then better to take advent after meals or some food. Also give her antacid and anti emetic combination prior to meals. These will help in subsiding vomiting. So give her thrice daily, don't give advent twice daily. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother.

I can not go very long without coughing, which only gives a very temporary relief, before the tickling starts again.  I've been hacking up dark green sputum, sometimes bloody at night, from excessive coughing, which may be due to irritated throat tissue?  It is also painful when I cough at the bottom of my throat and in the top of my lungs.  Often when I cough, i get a sharp pain in my head just above my right eye.  Also my ribs are quite sore from all the coughing.  Went to hospital and got on Penicillin 6 days ago.  Has not helped at all.  This bug is likely a virus.

Usually occurs 2-3 times a week recently. At the end of the work day or sometimes during the day the bottom of my chest area which I am pretty sure is the Xiphoid Process area has an unusual tightness. Literally the middle of my torso. It usually will take 1-2 hours after work when at home for it to subside. Then when I press on that hole location at the bottom of the sternum and just above that on the bone itself it is tender and tight, which causes some trouble breathing and hyperventilating. In the past, I ve suffered from panic attacks but this is something different. Again, I believe it to be related to stress as I have an anxious feeling when it occurs and I definitely am going through a lot more stress than I ever have with work, personal life, etc all at the same time. Also, I ve been sitting down a lot more at work and I m not sure if it s because I ve been slouching forward too much. Also not sure if it relates to how I sleep on my back as some mornings when I wake up, the middle of my back and sometimes that area in front is a little sore.

Your all symptoms are suggestive of mostly stress and anxiety related GERD. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of Central pain and tightness. So stress management is very important in your case to relieve these symptoms. And for this, you should consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. You should also start proton pump inhibitors. Don't worry, you will be alright.

In my opinion, you should should definitely consult cardiologist and rule out angina pain and other heart diseases. Left sided chest pain and left shoulder tingling sensation (pins and needles) are commonly seen in heart diseases. So get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring 2. Ecg 3. 2d echo. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, if you have and be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

If both are normal than no need to worry for heart diseases. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) can cause similar kind of chest pain. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause central chest pain and nausea. You can take proton pump inhibitors. But along with drugs you need to follow certain below mentioned lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Go for walk after meals. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux.

I can understand your concern. No this is not true. Removal of turbinates can not allow viruses or polluted air to go inside the lungs. So don't believe in this. Hypertrophied turbinates are the common cause for blocked nose in children. They actually cause mechanical obstruction. And hence surgery is must to overcome this mechanical obstruction. Laser surgeries are better than radio surgeries. Laser surgeries are more safer and they give faster recovery time. So in hospital stay is less and hence cost is also reduced. So better to go for laser surgery for Hypertrophied turbinates. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am 16.

It almost feels like a shortness of breath or something. I have accidentally stopped taking an acne medication that I have been on for many months just because my routine since Christmas has been weird. I don t know if my body is reacting to that? I have never even tasted alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. No stopping of acne medicines can not cause fluttering sensation in chest. Fluttering sensation in chest is commonly seen in arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart). So better to first rule out heart diseases in your case. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia. Sometimes stress and tension can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm.

I don t know what to do.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should get done stress test (trade mill test). You are heavy smoker since long time, so you are definitely at risk of heart attack. Sometimes ecg in resting condition can be normal. But when body is in exertion (stress), ecg may show changes. And hence to rule out this stress test is needed. So get done stress test. If this is normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Smoking is also a risk factor for GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Smoking causes laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter.

It seems that your mother was having heart and lung failure. She was on oxygen, this suggests lung failure. She was having edema in lower limbs, this suggest heart failure. And at the age of 87 years, heart and lung failure is having very poor prognosis. Chances of survival are very very less. In hospital, there is always a triage policy. This means priority given to those patients whose survival chances are more and who are young, so that their life expectancy can be increased. Honestly speaking, 87 years old, heart and lung failure patient is having least chances of survival. So no point in keeping that patient.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of bronchitis and allergy related symptom is more rather than heart related. Bronchitis and allergies when uncontrolled can cause worsening inflammation in lungs. And this can cause burning type of sensation. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will tell you about severity of inflammation. On the basis of PFT values, treatment is advised. Inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are treatment of choice. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.

He did not drink a drop of alcohol. I heard GERD can affect the results of the breathalyzer. Is it true?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concerns.If the person has an episode of GERD before the breath test, alcohol gases or vapors coming up from their stomach can be mistakenly read by the machine as deep lung air. This can cause the breathalyzer machine to give a falsely high BAC result. Usually, the law requires a person giving someone a breath test to wait and observe the person for 15 minutes to make sure that the person does not vomit, belch, or have the hiccups because this could cause alcohol from the person’s stomach to be read by the breathalyzer machine.Most DUI defendants who suffer from GERD will have to present evidence from a physician to show that they suffer from the condition so that a court can determine whether GERD played a role in a high breath-alcohol test result.Hope your questions were answered.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi my sister had the following symptoms and I sent her to the ER sob 3nights ago mild dull chest pain 3nights ago the it went away then the next day dull left arm pain then it went away then today left leg pain behind the knee with bruising in the front of the knee she is 43 fair shape family history of CAD maternal grandfather is that a sign of a blockage","Doctor":"Hi.

Over the last few months my breathing has become more labored especially at night negatively affecting my sleep. I often feel like I am drowning - loud gurgling / bubbling like sounds when I breath, especially while lying on my back. I use my respirator more often than usual (Albuterol Sulfate) - 5 or 6 times at night when I cant breath and also during the day. I cough up phlegm often but over the last month or so I cough up what seems like clear water - I wake sometimes with a mouthful of water after a coughing fit. I now have to use a nebulizer at least once a day, usually before I go to bed otherwise I cant sleep because of all the noise my lungs make and the water and phlegm. I have added Budesonide to the nebulizer mixed with the Albuterol which seems to make the effect last longer so I only have to use the respirator once or twice during the night.

She told me six months ago after a echocardiography that a part of my heart is enlarged and this is usally due to sleep apnea.  This is my second echocardiography that shows the enlargement.  I was tested and do have sleep apnea and was put on a bi-level cpap.  My doctor was hoping to see some improvement but didn't.  She said she will give me 6 more months on my machine and do another echocardiography and if there still is no change she wants to send me to John Hopkins or Washington Aventist for a test that they only do.  I don't remember the name of the test.  I researched and wondered if it may be an angiogram?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I would like to know the detailed echo report so that I guide you precisely. Any sleep apnea can certainly lead to heart enlargement due to multiple reasons. It can damage the lung and secondarily lead to valve leakage and heart enlargement. It also predisposes one to blockages in the heart leading decreased heart function and enlargement. Do you have any other symptoms like chest pain, heaviness, or sweating. If yes then you also need get one TMT test done. Do you have high blood pressure if yes it should be controlled. From your side, you need to get lipid profile and sugars tested, also thyroid levels. Regular exercises, low calorie and low fat, oily and sugar diet will help reducing weight and it's key in treatment of sleep apnea.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Sagar Makode"},{"Patient":"Hello im a 16 year old male and ive been having these sharp chest pains and then they go away and im almost positive its precordial catch syndrome and i was wondering if there was a treatment to get it to go away or if pain medicince will help ge rid of it?","Doctor":"Hi.

I have done several cardiac work-ups that were unremarkable but a recent stress echocardiogram revealed my heartrate abnormality. I am being treated by a cardiologist now who has prescribed Veralan 120 mg daily. My question is this: I am a clinical dietitian with a background in sports and fitness. In the past I did a lot of exercise, both endurance and weight lifting. I last lifted regularly about 2 years ago. Are there any concerns with this type of training given my condition? I am taking it as a given to begin at a lower intensity and work up to more challenging workouts. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Long standing tachycardias like in your  case may cause a condition called tachycardia cardiomyopathy. Therefore you should  avoid conditions which would induce such condition such as vigorous exercises, and exercise stress. It is advisable to visit your cardiologist and get an Holter monitoring and discuss about the treatment including radio frequency ablation.Hope my advice was helpful. Please get back for any more queries.Get well soon. Regards,Dr. Noor Us Saba Z"},{"Patient":"A patient was admitted to the hospital with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His PO2 was 55 and PCO2 was 65. A new resident orders 54% oxygen via the venturi mask. One hour later, after the oxygen was placed, the nurse finds the patient with no respiration or pulse. She calls for a Code Blue and begins cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Explain why the patient stopped breathing.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. The patient you are talking about is having co2 (carbon dioxide) narcosis. It is common in COPD patients. It is due to increased level of carbon dioxide in the blood. These patients tend to have respiratory drive, driven by low oxygen in the blood. So low oxygen in such patients is actually beneficial to maintain central respiratory drive. So when you give these patients high flow oxygen, this central respiratory drive will be diminished. And hence patient stops respiration. So never give high flow oxygen in COPD patients even if their oxygen saturation is low. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

But these ailments are very much in control due to Inhalers once a day, like Aerocort and Foracort.  But I am suffering recently with a strange symptom in winter ( cool climate). When I breath in and out, the internal skin of my breathing Air- Track gets a tender uncomfortable inflammatory feeling. I feel like stopping my breathing, at once. The feeling is like uncomfortable touch sensation on a wet wound, as if air breeze is blowing on the wound. My doctor checked me. I have no wheezing or no cough, no cold. No chest congestion. Only my usual body-ache and tiredness. So he has prescribed to me just  one Tablet called Vitaresp. I will take it once a day from tomorrow. I have feeling that there is some sort of strange inflammation on the internal skin of my air track. Please advise. Regards, Avinash Bhosekar.

Airway inflammation is the basic pathology in them. And both are worsening more in winter months. This is due to viral infections and cold weather. So better to get done annual Influenza vaccination before winters to prevent recurrent viral infections. Get done PFT to rule out worsening of inflammation. If it is worsening then you may need additional extra bronchodilators during winter months. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query.

I m 33 years old and ever since I can remember (childhood) I cannot read aloud without becoming winded (after a full page I d be noticeably breathless). It was also tiring for me to sing aloud and even to talk nonstop for more than a few minutes, as in giving a speech, nor was I ever able to run much. My parents never took these complaints seriously because I seemed very healthy otherwise and I eventually had two pregnancies and births without complications. Anyway, recently there was a tragedy in my family and I became depressed and unable to sleep, the reason why this is relevant is I ve noticed that when I haven t slept at night and attempt to go about my day anyhow, the dyspnea becomes so bad I cannot speak 3 words without having to stop and catch my breath, this is sometimes accompanied by a slight pain/pressure in the sternum. Then, oddly, after I get enough rest (8+ hours), the severe dyspnea and chest pain stop (even though the more minor symptoms I ve had since youth remain). From all of this, I m leaning toward heart disease (lung disease doesn t get better after rest, does it?). I suppose my question would be, what type of heart disease is this likely to be? and, is it possible I have always had this (my history of dispnea as a child) and it went undiagnosed during checkups (I recently gave birth to 2 children and no one noticed anything unusual)? Thank you for any thoughts on this matter!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Thanks for detailed information. By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more. Heart and lung related diseases can subside on rest. But both are worsening during pregnancy if you are not taking treatment. You had two uneventful deliveries. This itself suggest that you are not having any heart and lung related diseases. Your symptoms worsen after tragedy. So all these indicate that your dyspnea is related to stress and anxiety. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should consult senior, experienced ENT doctor because obstructive lesions in the nose need surgery only. So for obstructive turbinate, you need to get it surgically removed. Another thing is allergic rhinitis. You are not improving 100% after any previous surgery. So possibility of allergic rhinitis is more. And so you will need 1. Steam inhalation 5-6 times a day 2. Intranasal spray containing steroid (fluticasone)3. Oral combination of antihistamine and anti allergic drugs. So first undergo surgery for turbinate and then start above mentioned drugs for complete relief. Consult good ENT doctor and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Thank you. A change was made in my medication for Parkinson disease which I ve had since 2008.

I started having a problem taking a deep breath and yawning, and in checking out info regarding this new med, it lists bizarre breathing problems as a possible side-effect. This matches my symptoms, for sure, but I was wondering what the considered a bizarre breathing problem. I even had to go to the ER two nights ago as it was getting really bad. After doing all kinds of tests there, they said they couldn t find any serious problem (with heart, lung, etc.) They did find I have a UTI and prescribed med for that.

You are at high risk of heart diseases because of stiff arteries and previous two heart attacks. Sometimes stress test can be false negative. So only on the basis of stress test, coronary artery blockage can not be ruled out. So better to get done more more diagnostic test (Angiography) to rule out heart diseases. Angiography also have benefit of treatment. If blockage is there then stenting can be done in the same sitting. So get done coronary Angiography. Hope I have solved your query.

Let me know what is wrong. Does consuming hot food make this happen? I have thyroid and is the only medication I take. .25mg capsules.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of Central chest pain, fullness, chest pressure etc. So better to follow these steps. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. 4.

I am a type 1 diabetic and currently being treated for hypertension, psoriatic arthritis and cardiac issues. I had a heart attack in 1986 and two stents implanted. I have PMR (sed rate now down to 75). What does this diagnosis mean?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. PMR stands for polymyalgia. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory disorder that causes muscle pain and stiffness in various parts of the body. It most commonly affects the shoulders, neck, and arms. A blood test is usually done to help make the correct diagnosis. No blood test is 100% reliable for PMR. However, blood tests called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test and the C-reactive protein (CRP) test can detect if there is inflammation in your body from various diseases. ESR test results are measured in mm/hr, or millimeters per hour. The following are considered normal ESR test results: - Women under age 50 should have an ESR under 20 mm/hr. - Your ESR is 75 mm/hr highly indicative of an inflammatory condition like polymyalgia.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Rini"},{"Patient":"curious as to what this may be...I have been having a dull ache under my left rib cage and it seems to only happen when i don't drink enough water? ...if i drink water it seems to get a little more tolerable, but doesn't completely go away...any idea as to what they may be?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of gastritis is more. But better to get done ecg to rule out heart diseases because left sided chest discomfort is common in heart diseases. If ecg is normal then no need to worry much for this. Possibility of gastritis and hyperacidity is more. Your pain is subsided by water intake. Water dilutes the acid in the stomach and hence subside the pain. So drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Start proton pump inhibitors. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid stress and tension. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Montek LC is having montelukast and levocetrizine. Montelukast is anti allergic drug and levocetrizine is antihistamine drug. Both are used in allergic conditions. You are improving with montek LC, so possibility of allergic bronchitis or asthma is more. And so better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is must for the diagnosis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. Along with montek LC, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are also beneficial in your case.

I has a chest x-ray and it showed a very small calcified round lesion on the lateral aspect of the right lung.Previous radiological reports dating 12 years ago stated that this a lesion of indeterminate origin and differential diagnosis lies somewhere between a granuloma or hartoma. I have never had TB but was involved in a car accident as a child- have also been inoculated against TB. Yet a current X-ray report states that this is evidence of TB. Can a radiologist state that a lesion is conclusively past TB even though previous reports have stated otherwise. I am really concerned as this is for immigration purposes and would appreciate an opinion","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Calcified lesion on chest x ray suggests old, healed, scarred lesion from previous lung insult (infection or trauma). So at present, no need to worry for active lung lesion. But to prove that this lesion is inactive especially for immigration purpose, you need to consult pulmonologist and get done 1.  CT thorax with Contrast 2. Bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. If both these are negative for active infection, you can argue with immigration authority about not having active lesion and this lesion is old, calcified lesion. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Beclazone is having beclomethasone. It is inhaled corticosteroid. It actually treatment of choice for asthma. It is very safe and having least side effects. These are possible because beclomethasone is given locally (as inhaler) and not systemically. So drug will deposit directly in the lungs without reaching to other organs and hence systemic side effects are very less with inhaled beclomethasone. You just need to rinse your mouth after its use to prevent drug deposition in pharynx. So don't worry about long term side effects of Beclazone. It is having excellent safety on long run.

Angiogram is an invasive test and require administration of radioactive dye in the body, it can even be fatal in 2% of the cases. Rather I would suggest you to go for a test called stress thallium. A thallium stress test is a nuclear imaging test that shows how well blood flows into the heart while you’re exercising or at rest. This test is also called a cardiac or nuclear stress test. The thallium stress test can show:   - the size of the heart chambers  - how effectively the heart pumps (ventricular function)  - how well the coronary arteries supply the heart with blood (myocardial perfusion) if the heart muscle is damaged or scarred from previous heart attackSensitivity of stress thallium is almost same as angiography,  and is far safer then angiogram.

It will show details like exact size, shape, content, association with surrounding lung etc. And all these details are important in diagnosis. So better to get done CT thorax. Ask him to quit smoking as soon as possible if he is smoker. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Chest x-ray returned following finding: \\"Extensive increased bronchovascular markings seen in both lung fields with fibro calcific changes within. Areas of collapse - consolidation seen in the left upper zone with shift of mediastinum and trachea to the left. Crowding of left sided ribs noted. Emphysematous changes seen in right lung field.\\" What does this mean?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. This x ray report is suggestive of left sided fibrotic lung due to previous infection like tuberculosis or pneumonia. There is left sided crowding of ribs and right sided hypertrophy and emphysema. This clearly suggest that patient is having non functioning left sided lung since long time. There are fibro calcified lesions also. This suggests possibility of old infection like tuberculosis or pneumonia. Healing from these diseases produce fibro calcified lesions. So to summarize, this chest x ray is suggestive of old, healed scar lesions with fibrotic left lung and hypertrophic right lung. Patient may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid. So consult pulmonologist. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have had gurgling my in my left side of my chest for 4 or 5 days now. Seems like every 4 or 5seconds there is a relase of air. I also seem to have a build up of gas which I can burb and feel beeter. sometime it helps the gurgling but most of the timeit doesn't. I have no pains.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of gaseous feeling in stomach (gurgling sound), burping etc. So better to follow these steps for symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. 4. Go for walk after meals. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed. 6. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these symptoms. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

I can understand your concern. Most common cause for pleural effusion is infection. But in old age, malignancy can cause pleural effusion. So we should rule out infection and malignancy in your grandmother 's case. And for this get done following reports of pleural fluid. 1. Pleural fluid routine and microscopic examination. 2. Pleural fluid cytology 3. Pleural fluid culture and sensitivity. 4. Pleural biopsy if cytology is suggestive of malignant cells. CT thorax with Contrast is also useful. So better to consult pulmonologist and first diagnose the cause of effusion and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your grandmother.

I never had these symptoms while smoking. what's causing this?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. You are mostly having acute e of asthma. And most common cause for this is viral infection. Smokers tend to have weak lung defense. So they are prone for respiratory tract infection. You have smoked for 2 years, so your lung defense must be weak. You are also having asthma. So worsening of asthma is likely in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT will tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of asthma is based on severity only. You may need antibiotics, antihistamines, anti inflammatory, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Don't start smoking again. Don't worry, you will be alright.

I can understand your concern. Your symptoms are seen after eating, so possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more. But better to rule out heart diseases first, because all these symptoms are commonly seen in heart diseases. So first get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. You are mostly having stress induced GERD. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain. So avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Take proton pump inhibitors.

I can understand your concern. Normal chest x ray is taken in PA (posterioanterior) view. In this view, upper lobes are not clearly visualized due to overlapping by ribs and clavicle. So any lesion in upper lobe can not be seen and hence reported perfectly. So apicolordotic view is done. In this x ray is taken in such a way that ribs and clavicle don't overlap upper lobe and hence upper lobes can clearly seen. So any pathology in upper lobes is easily visible in apicolordotic view. So for your husband, get done apicolordotic view for better visualization of lesion. Possibility of pneumonia or tuberculosis is more. So consult pulmonologist. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should definitely rule out heart diseases first because left arm numbness, fast heart beats, chest etc are classical symptoms of Coronary artery disease (CAD). So better to get done ecg, 2d echo, trade mill test (stress test) and coronary Angiography (if required). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Some stress and anxiety also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions.

She has no spleen and was admitted Sunday because of fluid in her lung and was almost septic Monday.  How long should she wait before getting on an airplane?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. It is advisable to take at least 2-3 weeks of rest after pneumonia. She is also having pleural effusion (fluid in lung) and septic, so possibility of severe pneumonia is more. In this situation, it takes almost 2-3 weeks for complete resolution. Air travel in plane is not safe because of low oxygen saturation at that height. So possibility of breathing difficulty is high in pneumonia patient in the plane. So better to take proper rest at home for 2-2 weeks atleast. Get done repeat chest x ray and clinical evaluation after 2-3 weeks. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi. I'm 21 years old.

I can understand your concern. Most common cause for pleural effusion is heart diseases. Congestive heart failure causes fluid over load and hence accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity. Her chest pain is not improving with anti tb drugs, so we need to rule out other causes for pleural effusion. Since your mother is having diabetes and hypertension, we should first rule out heart failure as a cause for pleural effusion. So better to get done ecg and 2d echo first. If these are suggestive of heart disease then she will need diuretics and cardiac inotropic drugs. Another possibility is Pulmonary embolism and infarction. So get done CT Pulmonary Angiography.

Docs think I may have an arrythmia and that caused the blackout, but after almost 2 months now I still have a large bump in the area where I hit my head. Should I seek medical attention?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Yes, you should consult your doctor soon. Get a MRI done of the area where the bump emerges. The MRI will tell you whether it is hematoma or any other gross injury. The sudden black out which you had is called as syncope. Syncope is temporary loss of consciousness and posture, described as \\"fainting\\" or \\"passing out.\\" It's usually related to temporary insufficient blood flow to the brain. It most often occurs when the blood pressure is too low (hypotension) and the heart doesn't pump a normal supply of oxygen to the brain. If you suspect arrythmia to be a cause behind  your syncope following tests are recommended:-  2d echo- 24 hour holter monitor or a loop recorderThey are the base line test for patients with arrythmia.Regards,Dr. Rini"},{"Patient":"My dad has been advised to take metpure xl 50.

Do i still have ptb and is it again contagious after 6 months of treatment","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. At present, you are mostly having old, healed, fibrotic lesion on chest x ray. After six months of treatment, active tb lesions on chest x ray heal. Healing takes place mostly in the form of fibrosis, calcification or both (fibro calcification). Complete resolution is rare in tuberculosis. So these healed areas appear as scar lesion on chest x ray. They will be seen as it is for lifetime. So presence of this fibrotic lesion is not suggestive of tuberculosis. Your sputum report is also negative. So you are mostly having healed lesion and not having active tb lesion. But if you really want to rule out active tuberculosis then get done CT thorax and bronchoscopy with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis.

So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid movements causing pain. 4. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Usually veins are not appeared on breast tissue. But sometimes dilated, green coloured veins running on breast skin are seen in1. Viral skin infection of breast. 2. Breast tissue infection 3. Breast mass either benign or malignant. So better to consult doctor and get done clinical examination of breast, mammography, sonography of breast to rule out major breast diseases. If all these are normal then no need to worry much. Apply warm water pad on affected areas, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I have no other ailments except for blood pressure which is now under control","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Inflammation of sinuses and airways can rarely cause this kind of cold feeling. So we should rule out sinusitis and bronchitis in your case. So first consult ENT doctor and get done clinical and endoscopic examination of sinuses. If this is normal then no need to worry for sinusitis. Consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis.

It is skin infection caused by herpes virus. This virus cause inflammatory reaction in nerves. So patient feels sharp, stabbing pain. It also produces rash. And chest region is most commonly involved, so better to consult dermatologist and get done clinical examination of involved area. You need antiviral drug like acyclovir. Pregabalin is needed for pain. Anti inflammatory drugs are also useful. Application of ice packs is also beneficial. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query.

Anyway, said my heart sounded ok and lungs sounded ok.  No swelling in limbs.  Ordered a d dimer and today was told it came back positive and they will schedule me for CT sometime next week.  I am on my period now, could that cause this?  I had thyroid biopsy about 6 weeks ago now, could that be it?  I am prone to worry excessively and am trying not to.","Doctor":"Thank you for writing on health care magic.I understand your concern. You shouldnt worry too much. You scheduled for CT which mens that its not a urgency to do it. As a general rule prior to do a d dimer its been done a prediction score for the risk of pulmonary embolus. Im convinced that your doctor is suspecting pulmonary embolism. pulmonary emboli are clots that normaly are formed in the veins of lower extremity that travel and block pulmonary arteries. As I see you dont have any pain in the limbs which is a good thing and lowers the risk that you might have trombus in the lower extremities. You have had a biopsy of your thyroid but the resjlts of biopsy are not shown. Its a great importance to know the results of it. The biopsy may be related to these high d dimer. Periods generaly do not increase the d dimer The cuases for high D dimer excluding the clot formation include infection which increases ddimer at high level. Age , whith it increases somehow and some other causes like pregnancy, trauma, surgery. You just have to wait, and i know is not easy to stay with fear but a CT is going to be performed and a diagnosis holefuly will come and things can go for better. wish you good health"},{"Patient":"My dad just got out of the hospital last week. He went in with pnuemonia in right lung, afib and low blood pressure 70/40. Has only 10% lung capacity with copd and something else. He has been complaining of this sweet taste in his mouth since he has been home. He does have diabetes runs about 116 to 156. He doesnt have the fruity smell. and my daughter n law is a respitory therapus. He is on 3 liters of oxygen all the time. is on ameodrone, dijoxen, ditilizem for heart. some med for reflux like omeprizole. Vitamins not sure right now on the rest. was on a lastic med for water, they had hi on 180 milgram at the hospital. and now i think 40 at home. Can you help.","Doctor":"Thank you for writing on health care magic.I do understand you concern.Your father has been with pneumonia and suffers from COPD and 10 % of his lung capacity is low. By these number and the liters of oxygen being used i presume your father is in stage four of COPD ( or D stage) which is the last stage. COPD is not e reversible disease and the lung function deteriorate with time passing and disease progression.The list of medication is broad but normally patients at these stage have to take these medication.He has taken all the necessary medication for COPD exacerbation. I see he takes amiodarone and digoxin for heart rhythm problem and diltiazem also which i suppose for high blood pressure.It's good that he takes omeprazole for reflux because at theses stage of disease most of the patients have reflux and also helps to heal the stomach from side effects of drugs being taken( for the most prednisone).diabetes has to be good controlled because a bad controlled diabetes lowers the immunity and predisposes to infection and of course a better control makes him feel well and helps him not to get to early the complications of diabetes. The dosage of drugs seems ok.I would suggest to take some drugs with inhalation to help him feel better, you have to use corticosteroids with inhalation( symbicort for example), and long acting beta agonist , and salbutamol. These medications have to be decided by your pulmonary physician.Regarding your question about the possible treatment for pneumonia generally these kind of patients has to be treated with a combination therapy of a cephalosporins 3 grade or more ( ceftriaxone 1 gram twice per day for 7 days or cefepime for example) in combination with a macrolide ( azithromicin 250 mg for 7 days)Don't hesitate to post if you have any other questionWish you good health"},{"Patient":"Hi ... for the last two weeks I have had brochitis, and was put on amoxicylin again 3 days ago bc the infection was still in my chest...however with this illness I have been getting increasingly worse sharp pain under my left shoulder blade when I take a deep breath.The pain increases every day...should I be concerned or is this the bronchitis?","Doctor":"Thank you for writing on Health Care MagicI understand your concern.You are on medication which helps you to fight the infection of bronchitis. these is your first day. normaly you should start to feel better after these three days. the pain you are reffering mostly consists with pleural pain. these kind of pain is generated when the pleura ( the outer lining of lung) gets inflamed.To be completely sure on no complication you should have a consultation with your physician.The physician can order a chest X-ray to see if the infection is spread or if the lungs and pleura are normal. Depending on the chest x ray findings he can change the medication.Wish you a good health"},{"Patient":"My husband and I both have a virus that causes head congestion and a phlemmy cough that you can't spit up.

I've always had the usual cold, fatigue, and brittle nails symptoms. However, last week at work i was on ladder and almost fainted, my heart beat was irregular so i checked my blood pressure it was 140/107 and that was 30 mins after my incident. I've never had high bp ever! I could not take a deep breath until i layed down. It was scary and that was only incident.

How severe is my anemia?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Extreme fatigue, weakness, chest pain, fast heartbeat or shortness of breath are signs of iron deficiency anemia. Headache, dizziness or lightheadedness, cold hands and feet, inflammation or soreness of your tongue, brittle nails all are the symptoms of severe iron deficiency anemia. Most likely you are having severe anemia, a thorough investigation should be done to rule out the cause of iron deficiency anaemia. I would advise you endoscopy, colonoscopy serum ferritin transfer in total iron binding capacity test to rule out  the  level of iron deficiency and cause in your case. Acccording to symptoms it is severe iron deficiency anemia at present.Hope I have answered your query.

I can understand your concern. At present no need to take anti tubercular drugs because your report is not showing tubercular infection. Report is showing reactive lymphadenitis. It is seen in bacterial infection. So in my opinion, you should take broad spectrum antibiotic at present. Wait for atleast 10-15 days. If swelling is decreasing then no need to worry for tuberculosis. But if swelling persists or increase in size or becomes painful then possibility of tuberculosis is high. And for confirmation, you need to get done excision biopsy and histopathological examination. This will be 100% diagnostic. So at present, don't worry about tuberculosis. Start broad spectrum antibiotic. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

X ray improvement takes longer time. Complete resolution of chest x ray takes almost 1 month. So better to wait for 1 more month. You are feeling well, not having cough and breathlessness, fever etc then no need to worry for repeated infection. You are in recovery phase of pneumonia. And this is the reason for pleuritic pain (pain while breathing). So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Get done repeat chest x ray after 1 month. Hope I have solved your query.

Could this be causing the feeling of rapid heart beat and sometimes not being short of breath?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes  if blood sugar is very high and protein (acetone) is present in the blood then your symptoms are mostly due to DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis). In this, uncontrolled high sugars causes hivh protein and acids in the blood. These cause acid base imbalance, tachycardia, breathlessness, tremors etc. This condition should be treated immediately because if left untreated, it can cause organ (kidney, heart, brain, retina) damage. So immediately consult doctor and start treatment for DKA. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Yes, these symptoms are commonly seen after such aspiration episode. You had accidental aspiration of food in wind pipe. So body will react to this by coughing and vomiting. In this coughing, there are high chances of friction and inflammation in the wind pipe and upper airways. So these cause flu like symptoms.

By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal injury due to twisting in bed and heavy coughing is more. But better to get done chest x ray to rule out internal lung injury because you are still having pain and painful breathing. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for major lung injury. Musculoskeletal pain is more likely in your case. So avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant.

I can understand your concern. No, smoking is strictly contraindicated in patients with tuberculosis. Smoking is the risk factor for lung and pleural infection. Smoking causes irritation and inflammation. These weaken lung defense system and make you vulnerable for infection. The cause for your tubercular infection is mostly smoking. So better not to smoke because you are already having an infection. If you continue smoking, healing rate will decrease and you may need longer duration.

Sometimes all reports like ecg, 2d echo and TMT are normal but still patient can have obstruction in coronary artery which is causing symptoms. This can be picked up only by Angiography. Angiography is not only diagnostic but it is therapeutic also. If blockage is there then we can do stenting also. So for long term recovery Angiography is good for you.

Honestly speaking, there is no cure for IPF (idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis). It is chronic progressive fibrosis of the lung. Following things should be done to achieve optimal treatment and reduce the rate of worsening of lung functions. 1. Home oxygen therapy. Low dose oxygen should be given continuously for atleast 16-18 hours a day. This is the best treatment. 2. Start perfinodone. It is the only available and US FDA approved anti fibrotic agent. It reduces rate of fibrosis. 3. N acetyl cysteine is having excellent antioxidant, mucolytic and expectorant properties. And hence it is beneficial in IPF. 4. Enroll her in Pulmonary Rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are done. These will surely improve her lung functions. 5.

Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Old age and diabetes are risk factors for cardiac diseases, and there can be a number of variations in ECG of a person. As you have not mentioned it clearly I would say that if  variation is with st segment or t wave in ECG, then some base line tests of cardiology like 2d echo and tread mill tests are indicated to rule out cardiac ischemia. A lipid profile test should also be done. If possible upload photo of her ECG for detailed comments.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Rishu Saxena"},{"Patient":"i suffered from sarcoidosis and take treatment like solupred 20mg twice daily since 8 months but now no improvement and i feel weakness and fatrigue and tremors start appear and become aggresive in stress i want to stop drug to feel normal but the mass of sarcoidosis in my nose still as it and i only 25 year","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Sarcoidosis is inflammatory disease. And best treatment for this is oral corticosteroid. Solupred is having prednisone. Prednisone is oral corticosteroid and it is treatment of choice for sarcoidosis. But in some sarcoidosis patients, steroids are not effective at lower dose. So we need to give higher dose. But with higher dose, side effects are more. Sarcoidosis of nose can be treated surgically. So in my opinion you should consult ENT doctor and discuss about surgical option to rule out nasal sarcoid mass. So better not to stop solupred with our consulting ENT doctor. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Left sided chest and arm tingling sensation can be due to heart related diseases. So better to first rule out cardiac cause. So get done 1. Ecg 2. 2d echo 3. Stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for cardiac diseases. Sometimes stress and anxiety can cause similar tingling. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm.

I can understand your situation and problem. Pain in the middle of chest (substernal) and in the upper back is mostly due to musculoskeletal cause. So better to avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. You will mostly improve in 1-2 weeks. Another possibility is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause central chest pain. So avoid stress and tension, hot and spicy food. Take proton pump inhibitors.

I can not see a doctor until next week but I ve been to hospital once already thinking I having a heart attack and I was fine. Except my face is VERY swollen, I m in pain and my joints hurt. ?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Yes, cushing syndrome can be present with palpitations, but it is very rare. Most likely your palpitations are because of heart involvement. Joint pain and swollen face are all characteristic side effect of cushing syndrome. However, for palpitations I would advice you to avoid caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, or illegal drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines. Get your thyroid levels checked up. Other useful tests include:Electrocardiogram (EKG): This can be done while you’re at rest or exercising. The latter is called a stress EKG. In both cases, the test records your heart's electrical signals and can find unusual heart rhythms.Holter monitoring : You’ll wear a monitor on your chest. It continuously records your heart's electrical signals for 24 to 48 hours. It can identify rhythm differences that weren't picked up during an EKG.Hope I have answered your query.

I can understand your situation and problem. You had inhalation lung injury. Mowing of lawn can produce tiny particles in air and when we inhale them, they cause irritation and hence in the airways. These produce bronchitis. And this is the reason for coughing and shortness of breath after mowing of lawn.Best treatment is stoppage of exposure and inhale fresh air. Usually this is sufficient. But In severe cases inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are given. Antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs are also useful in this. In severe cases, with treatment usual time of recovery is 7-10 days. So in my opinion, you should continue drugs for 7-10 days. Don't worry, you will definitely improve.

But sometimes infection can also cause similar kind of pain. So in your case, better to get done 1.  Chest x ray 2. Ultrasound examination of local part. If it is only pleural thickening then you need painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs. Application of warm water pad on affected site is also useful. Don't worry, you will be alright.

They can be felt in your chest, throat, or neck. You may have an unpleasant awareness of your own heartbeat and feel like your heart skipped or stopped beats. High heart rate is called as tachycrdia. I would recommend you base line cardiac tests like holter monitoring, 2d echo and tread mill test to rule out the cause of tachycardia. There are a number of cases of tachycardia and palpitations. Usually, palpitations are either related to your heart or the cause is unknown. Non-heart-related causes include strong emotions like anxiety, fear, or stress. They often happen during panic attacks.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Rishu Saxena"},{"Patient":"yes i have a question well i was having a drink or two on the weekend with some freind when my chest began to have sharp pains as well as both my arm and the pain was radiating down my arm but after like 15 20 min it was gone and later that night the pain came back","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Recurrent chest pain with radiation in arms is seen commonly with heart diseases. You are also taking alcohol, so possibility of heart related pain is more in your case. So better to quit alcohol as soon as possible. Get done ecg, 2d echo, stress test (trade mill test) and coronary Angiography if required. You may need cardiac supportive drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright, but quit alcohol and rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am a 26 year old female and the past 2 years I have been having breathing difficulty. I was seeing a pulmonologist briefly who diagnosed me with severe asthma and placed me on a maintenance regimen (symbacort and spiriva) and gave me a rescue inhaler. The maintenance drugs did not help and I was referred to a cardiologist with the theory that my SOB was caused by a heart condition. Thanks partially to the economy I do not have health insurance and have been attempting to treat myself for the past year and a half. I still have rescue inhalers and use them several times a week for SOB, mainly due to exertion. Recently I have been having more difficulty and the other night my lungs seized, as they do from time to time, but I was unable to sit up or hit myself which are my two typical courses of action to restart my lungs. My boyfriend happened to be in the bathroom at the time and came back to find me not breathing and was able to sit me up and hit my lungs to restart them. This was right after having sex. Is this normal with asthma? What can I do to prevent this in the future?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. No, this kind of sudden stoppage of respiration is not seen in asthma. By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more along with asthma. Actually stress, anxiety worsen asthma. So apart from inhalers, you should consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Why when I'm laying in bed getting ready to go to sleep, usually laying on my right side, all of a sudden, no pain, just I feel my left chest area quivering and it becomes more pronounced enough that I almost feel as if my whole chest / rib area is quivering or like a shiver for what feels like a minute but is probably only 5 - 10 seconds give or take.  It doesn't happen every night and I only seem to notice it when I'm getting ready to go to sleep.  Again no pain or anything to cause me to be scared just a strange strong quiver or shiver feeling.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more. But better to first rule out heart diseases like arrhythmia. Arrhythmia is rhythm disturbance in heart and this can cause shivering, fluttering, quivering feeling in left sided chest. So better to get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Stress and anxiety appear more likely cause. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions.

I can understand your concern. Tuberculosis should be diagnosed only on the basis of Elisa test. Elisa test detects antibodies. And antibodies can be positive in patients who had tuberculosis in the past or had taken BCG vaccination. So positive Elisa test does not indicate active tuberculosis. You need other strong evidence like chest x ray showing cavitation, sputum examination shows AFB (acid fast bacilli-bacteria causing tuberculosis) etc. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done chest x ray, sputum examination for AFB. If any of these is suggestive of tb then you need anti tubercular drugs otherwise only on the basis of Elisa test, anti tubercular drugs are not indicated. Hope I have solved your query.

You are having protein S deficiency. It is hypercoaguable state. Intravascular clotting is common in this condition. So clotting and obstruction in the coronary arteries is also common. And this can cause sharp, stabbing, left sided chest pain. So better to get done 1. Ecg 2. 2d echo 3. Stress test (trade mill test) 4. Coronary Angiography if required. If all these are normal then no need to worry much. Musculoskeletal pain can cause similar symptoms. So avoid movements causing pain. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise.

Montelukast is anti allergic drug. Levocetrizine is antihistamine drug. These drugs are useful in allergic cough. So you can definitely take these drugs. One more thing I would like to tell you is that possibility of allergic bronchitis is also there in your case. Cough especially at night time is characteristic of allergic bronchitis. So also consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).

I'm 45, overweight, and have blood pressure that averages 150/90. The skipping started about 3 months ago.  But since i started taking the magnesium it has all but disappeared and i was wondering why?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Magnesium is a mineral with central importance in the normal function of your heart. Too low  magnesium levels in blood can cause you to experience symptoms that include an irregular heartbeat, a symptom sometimes indicated by the presence of fluttering, or rapid heartbeats called palpitations.Its very likely that levels of magnesium in your body were quite low, causing palpitations. Once corrected, palpitation goes away, but I would advise you to monitor serum magnesium levels. Please mention the medicines you are taking for high blood pressure, as diuretics if used cause hypomagnesia.Hope I have answered your query.

What are some ways to prevent gasping for air?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Some degree of breathing difficulty is common at 5 month of pregnancy. This is due to enlarging uterus which is pressing diaphragm and lungs. So no need to worry much. Another reason is stress and anxiety. So avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. You can do 1 more thing. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bedtime. So that your lungs are at higher level and we can prevent compression by uterus. So by this lungs can able to expand more and your symptoms can be subsided. Hope I have solved your query.

PA says she is having pain so needs the morphine rather than Ativan and Tylenol. She seems to be sleeping more and responding less since on morphine. We are very concerned. thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, her current symptoms are mostly due to morphine. Morphine is opioid analgesic. It acts directly on brain. Along with analgesic effect, it causes sedation and respiratory depression. So her more sleeping and responding less is mostly due to sedation of morphine. Another reason is high carbon dioxide (hypercarbia). COPD patients are known to develop hypercarbia if respiratory center in brain is suppressed. High carbon dioxide can cause lethargy, sleepiness etc. So better to stop morphine and consult pulmonologist to rule out hypercarbia. Hope I have solved your query.

Im a MA so I tried to listen to my chest and I dont hear anything. I have a slight couch but nothing is coming up.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Chest congestion and wheezing are commonly seen in heart diseases (heart failure) and lung diseases (bronchitis). So better to consult doctor and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Ecg, 2d echo and stress test to rule out heart failure. 3. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) for the diagnosis of bronchitis. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) if bronchitis is there. Diuretics and cardiac inotropic drugs are required if you have heart failure. So better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I have read your question closely, I understand your concern and will be helping you with your health related problem. Usually no heart issue is expected in this age with a child who has this much physical activity, if there were a problem it would have been felt much earlier by your child. I believe he is fine he might be having muscular pain specially swimming can cause pain in center of the chest. I would suggest you to keep a check at his food intake and salt replacement during physical activity which are important.I hope this answered your question, if you have more queries I am happy to answer you.Regards,Dr. Muhammad Ahmad"},{"Patient":"I have a lung problem.  My Rheumatologist thinks rheumatoid has settled in my lungs.  Had rheumatiod for 16 years, but blood test are all negative.  Dr. can't tell what it is by X ray.  I will see a thorasic surgeon to tlak about a biospy.  Could I have rheumatoid in my lungs and it not show up on blood work?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, it is very common to have Pulmonary manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) without abnormal blood reports. And to confirm this you need to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). 3. HRCT (high resolution CT) thorax. RA can cause bronchitis, fibrosis, bronchiectesis etc. So PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. HRCT thorax is needed to rule out fibrosis and bronchiectesis. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have had some lung pain for about 5 days now. In fact I am not even sure if it s the lungs or a heart, but its mostly on the left side. It is not so much as pain, but a very strange feeling (left chest) I don t know how to describe it. When I drink water for example, I even feel like it s actually going down on that left chest. Searching on google some people have said it s like butterflies in the stomach feeling, except in the chest, so it mite be that. I am 21, and extremely light occasional smoker (4-5 packets a year since 18) So I really doubt that would be much of a concern. There were some neighbours in the same apartment building we painting, and it just occured to me, maybe that could have been the cause, because of the smell it has been for 2 weeks? I am really not sure. I also havn t been going much outside lately, but I ve just went for a walk today and yestarday. I know that the only thing you probably have for me is to take an ex-ray, but is there anything that you may know that I could have? Thank you.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Left sided chest discomfort in a smoker can be due to 1. Heart diseases 2. Lung disease like bronchitis or lung infection. 3. Gastritis. So better to get done ecg and 2d echo first. If both are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Get done chest x ray and PFT. If these are also normal then no need to worry for lung diseases. Sometimes gastritis can cause similar symptoms. So quit smoking as soon as possible. It is not a good habit. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Take proton pump inhibitor. You will mostly improve in 1-2 weeks. So don't worry, you will be alright, but first quit smoking and get done above mentioned investigations. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I've recently been treated for sinitus and bronchitis.  Should I go to the ER or Urgent care?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Since you recently had bronchitis, possibility of either right sided lung infection or acute exacerbation of bronchitis is more in your case. So you should definitely visit ER (emergency room) and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray 3. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed for the diagnosis of acute worsening of bronchitis. You may need antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). So don't wait at home, consult ER and start appropriate treatment.Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello! I'm 18 years old and recently I just had a Chest PA. The findings were: hazy and streaky infiltrates seen in the left upper lung field. The rest of the lung fields are clear. The impression was: Left upper lung TB, activity undetermined. I'm somewhat confused since I don't have a known history of TB and during and prior to the test I don't manifest any of the common signs and symptoms of TB such as cough for more than 2 weeks. Please clarify me with my condition if I really have TB now. If I do have, what should I do? Thanks.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Your x ray findings are more in favour of tuberculosis. Tb infection is most commonly seen in upper lobes. Actually tb bacilli grow more in upper lobes due to high oxygen in upper lobes. So any infiltration in the upper lobes must be first investigated for tuberculosis. So possibility of tb is high in your case. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, sputum examination for AFB (acid fast bacilli-bacteria causing tuberculosis), CT thorax and bronchoscopy if needed. You may need anti tubercular drugs. Minimum duration of 6 months is required. So better to first confirm tuberculosis by above mentioned investigations and than start appropriate anti tubercular drugs. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I am 54 yrs old, diabetic, asthma, RLS, small vessel disease for which I am on daily meds for each.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Asthma patients are at increased risk of respiratory infections due to poor lung defense. And most common infection is viral infection. Amongst viruses, Influenza virus is more common. So for your symptoms, recurrent viral infections (mostly Influenza) is likely cause. And fir this, annual vaccination with Influenza vaccine is advisable. This will provide sufficient immunity to prevent recurrent Influenza infection. Also take your asthma drugs timely because control of asthma is also important in prevention of symptoms. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, we should first rule out bronchitis in your case. Because bronchitis can cause similar symptoms like breathlessness, chest tightness, pressure, pain etc. So better to get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If PFT is normal than no need to worry for bronchitis. Your CT thorax is also normal. So no need to worry for lung infection too. Sometimes stress and anxiety can cause similar symptoms.. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions, try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution.

EXPLAIN...THANKS","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Normally on chest x ray bronchus is normal seen because it contains air and a iris radiolucent. This is the reason why chest x ray appears black. Bronchus is having its own blood supply. And blood is radio-opaque and can be seen on x ray. So any pathology where wall of bronchus is inflammed, edamatous or blood supply in the vessels is increased than they (bronchovascular) are prominent and visible on chest x ray. Common causes for prominent bronchovascular markings (BVM) are viral infection, bronchitis, in normal individual when x ray is taken in expiratory phase, smokers  etc. Since you are asymptomatic, possibility of bronchitis or viral infection is very less. And hence you declared fit despite of prominent BVM because this can be seen in normal individual also. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Normal oxygen saturation of body is more than 95%. So 66% saturation is considered as very low. Pneumonia is common cause for low oxygen saturation. Pneumonia if uncontrolled and extensive can cause collapse, consolidation and pleural effusion. All these causes non functioning of involved lung. So oxygenation (main function of lungs) is hampered. This is having poor prognosis. Body can not sustained for long time with this much low oxygen level. After sometimes kidney, heart and brain start loosing their functions due to low oxygen saturation. So his condition is extremely serious. Prognosis in such cases is very poor. So discuss with your doctor and start vigorous treatment to control pneumonia. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your husband.

Asthma is chronic allergic inflammatory disease of airways. It needs regular long course treatment to achieve proper control of symptoms.

Yes, green coffee extract pills will also cause you similar kind of pain. Actually, in my opinion, you are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause chest pain. Coffee contains caffeine. And caffeine plays huge roe in laxity of sphincter. So coffee extract will also have caffeine and so it will also give you trouble. So better not to take those pills.

I have always taken incredible care of myself and have earned my PhD in general medicine.  I recently have gone thru a divorce from my wife of 12 years which was literally here and happy one day, and completely psychotic and stressed the next and last 18 months of my life, which unfortunately led me into a life which I was not accustom to, in that my diet is weak and poor as is my exercise, and now ability to even think of exercise. The physical rated at which I was exercising prior to all this was private training with the local professional soccer team, and playin level 5 tennis, all on a minimum of 4 days or 16 hours a week, I've never had any type of incapability to work out or work, although a HD patient the Sat 24+ years; this divorce has really taken it out of me, but I am just now coming thru it, and ready to get back to it.

I had a chest scan and a blood test for CBC, sed rate, and allergies. everything came back normal. along with the chest pain, shortness of breath, occasional fevers, headaches and bark-like cough, sometimes producing mucus, I have had some lower back pain, and have been overly sensitive, like crying super easily, like during a tv show happy or sad moment or a minor issue, which I did not normally used to do. I am generally happy overall and enjoy my life, friends, and job, so it is not depression or anything like that. The only medication I take is birth control and now an inhaler to try and help the labored breathing. I also bruise super easily, sometimes out of no where. I had a few tests done at a hematologist a few months ago, but nothing conclusive came from it, I am not sure if that is relevant. Does anyone know what could possibly be going on with me? Thanks!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of either bronchitis or Pulmonary embolism is more. Birth control pills can cause Pulmonary embolism. So in my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done 1. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) 2. CT Pulmonary Angiography. PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only.You may need additional inhaled bronchodilators and oral bronchodilators also.  CT Pulmonary Angiography is needed to rule out Pulmonary embolism. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My spouse told me that my breath smelled like metal. She then stated that it was coming from my pores and I smelled like metal all over. Not sure what can cause this.

Please help.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Sertraline and Nicotine patch can not cause bad breath. Bad breathing is mostly related to oral cavity problem like caries teeth, decayed teeth, gum bleeding, abscess, perotitis etc. So better to consult dentist and get done clinical examination of oral cavity.

If CT scan is normal than no need to worry for blood clots in lung (Pulmonary embolism). D dimer is not a specific marker for Pulmonary embolism. D dimer will be raised in many other conditions other than Pulmonary embolism. D dimer is actually acute phase reactant. So any infection, inflammation in the body will cause raised D dimer.

I was looking online and noticed that there is a new procedure out for this condition that is less invasive than repositioning the breast bone and removing the cartilage. Which procedure is better?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, no treatment is required for pectus carinatum (pigeon chest). It is developmental defect of rib cage. Surgical correction is very risky and 100% successful correction of the deformity is next to impossible. But if patient is having underlying lung developmental defect, breathlessness, collapsed lung, low oxygen saturation etc than only surgical correction is required.

I can understand your concern. Aortic regurgitation is due to incompetent aortic valve. Aortic valve is situated between left ventricle and aorta. The main function of this valve is to provide oxygenated blood from left ventricle to the aorta in uni directional way. Competent aortic valve prevent back flow of blood from aorta to ventricle. But if valve is incompetent than blood is coming back from aorta to ventricle. So blood in systemic circulation is decreased. So hypotension occur. This also causes dilatation or left ventricle.

I regularly walks for 4 KM a day at an average speed of 1KM/10 min. About 6 months ago I had felt discomfort in chest which was sometimes on the left. To rule out any heart problem, I went to hospital to consult the cardiologist. The doctor asked to go for some tests ECG, TMT and 2D echo. After the tests the doctor told all the reports are normal and my problem is no way concerned with the heart.In addition, I have also done the tests like Lipid Profile and diabetic and the reports are normal. Here I am giving the values. Fasting Plasma Glucose (Method : Hexokinase) 88 Post Lunch Plasma Glucose 105 BP 120/80 Triglycerides:106 Total Cholesterol : 161     LDL Cholesterol: 88     HDL Cholesterol:52 VLDL:21 Total Cholesterol/HDL Cholesterol Ratio: 3.10      LDL Cholesterol/HDL Cholesterol Ratio 1.61.

Its location is different all time; sometimes it is shoulder and sometimes in left hand and some times in the middle of chest. More often this discomfort gets relaxed after few belching. Sometimes the pain is like a pin point and some times I feel the ants are moving under the skin. The pain is not that high, it is quit bearable but the tension and anxiety created by the pain is not bearable. Now my most important question is, after getting the above tests normal, How long time I can believe that the pain is not associated with the heart problems? Six months? or one year? or two years?. Once I know it, I can keep my mind cool at least up to that period.

For this reason, I would recommend performing some blood lab tests in order to investigate the possible underlying causes: - complete blood count for anemia- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction.

If you are taking any antihypertensive drugs, I would recommend reducing the dose or stopping them, until your blood pressure values will be high again. Hope I have answered your query.

Avoid heavy meals instead have multiple small meals and don't lie down immediately after meals instead have walk for sometime.
