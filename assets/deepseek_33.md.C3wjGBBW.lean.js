Troponin is a marker of heart muscle called myocardium injury. The elevation of troponin in the blood suggests that there was some injury to the myocardium of your heart.There are several causes for these injuries from inflammation due to viral infection, known as myocarditis until myocardial infarction. The picture that you reported, the association supposed abdominal viral infection, electrocardiogram unchanged suggests myocarditis. However, it is necessary to rule out that this situation has not been a heart attack. If myocarditis, we must investigate if there was damage and loss of function of your heart.You must look for a good cardiologist to organize this investigation.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, your current symptoms are due to acute gastritis and stress, anxiety. Antibiotic and other drugs are known to cause gastritis. This gastritis will cause chest pain, gaseous distention, palpitations, tachycardia etc. And all these symptoms are more worsening in stress, anxiety and apprehension. So first of all be relax and calm. Drink cold water. Take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach twice daily. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. You will mostly improve with all these. If you fail to improve or symptoms worsen then consult emergency room. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My dad has CHF, past open heart surgery, black lung disease...Cleveland CLinic would not give him an lvad because of his lung condition.  His bnp is 6795 and he is now starting to sleep a lot...he slept for 17 hours.  Do you think the end is near for him.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, his end is near. Black lung disease can cause respiratory failure in terminal stages. This respiratory failure causes carbon dioxide retention (CO2 retention) in the body. This will cause excessive sleepiness. All these will be more pronounced if patient is having heart failure simultaneously. So your father is sleeping for 17 hours is because of heart and respiratory failure. And this is not good sign for prognosis. Gradually, his condition will worsen and ultimately he will go in deep coma and death. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father.

I can understand your concern. Elevated blood pressure on exertion is seen with early heart failure, coronary artery disease (CAD)  and valvular heart disease. Since you are already having hypertension, possibility of heart failure and CAD is more. So better not to perform cardio rehab. First consult cardiologist and get done ecg, 2d echo, stress test (trade mill test) and coronary angiography to rule out heart diseases. If it is CAD then you will need angioplasty (stenting).

By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more in your case. But better to rule out heart diseases like arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) first. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. You are improving with alprazolam (anxiolytic) drug. Only drugs are not important in stress, anxiety. Counselling is very important. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions.

Honestly speaking, there is 70-80% chances of death during the defibrillator (shocking if heart). But there is no other alternative other than defibrillator application for his situation. So you have to take decision with keeping this in your mind. Even if heart rhythm is stabilized after defibrillator, his prognosis will remain poor because his heart is only 10% working.

In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and rule out asthma. You are having eczema (skin allergy), breathlessness and choking sensations in throat. All these are seen in asthma. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose asthma but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will improve with inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

My height increased till 18 - 19 yrs  then I got depressed that m not normal in bone structure and more thing my palm and fingers are not so big as it should be for a 6 feet taller male. Though my parents genetics are strong and they are much bigger. Because of this I've been in depression and I couldnt leave masturbation , though the daily frequency is decreased now . Because of this m mentally weak , I couldnt remember  topics or things I learn and I couldnt recall them on time . I have consitipation problem and I think my Penile is also not grown  enough as it should be for my body size , its short and thin but hardness is good. But in Jan. 2010 my Father passed , he was the person I loved most in my life and after 3-4 months of this tragedy I started feeling a kind of pain in my chest and  so much fatigue , lethargy . Then I went to Metro Heart Hospital fr chk up and I was diagnosed with  MVP . Then I took some Ayurvedic Medicines and Herbs and I got fine , the pain was no more but it started again suddenly becoz of my untidy routine and some junk foods like Pizzas and Dairy products I think.Now what happens is sometimes I fell quite energetic but I soon feel tired , I can not concentrate on my wrk , I 'm afraid of doing exercises.

BRAIN, LEGS OR ARMS?? PLEASE READ THE BELOW BEFORE ANSWERING This all began back in Augusts. I had had the flu and had been in bed for some time. During this time I noticed a lot of pain in my left leg and then in my right arm and across my left shoulder and back of neck.  After I thought the flu was past the pain didn't go a way. It became more and more painful. I went to see my Docor but was seen by his Nurse practioner. He gave me pain killers,  Iburprofen 800mg.  This didn't seem to help. A few days later he prescribed Tramadol 50mg as needed every 8 hours. He told me I could mix the two medicines. Over the next few months I did my best to deal with the pain. I tried not to take the medicine because I'm very sensative to any kinds of medicines. ( Not that they work but they nock me out) Example: a few months earlier I took Lipitor. My cholestoral and Try dropped in 3 months to a dangerous level. The doctor told me I had to stop taking Lipitor because my body needed some Cholestrol and ect.  Some time later He told me to start taking 1/2 a tablet of lipitor. I had so much pain every time I took a different statin I couldn't stand it. On Nov 17th I had  pain in right arm and left leg ( pain at night or when laying down)became unbareable. I took one 800mg of Ibprofin and it didn't help. An hour and a half later I took a Tramadol. The doctor told me I could mix. Within the hour  I made a trip to ER in Houston because my HEAD was exploding and I couldn't stop vomitting. CT was done of my head but they said they didn't see anything and but kept me over night and medicated. The truth is since that day the pain in my leg and arm seem to have gotten somewhat better. The ER doctor told me to get with my Primary when I returned home. It took a while to get in but I got in on the 15th of December. When I returned home my Primary doctor did an EKG around the of 15th of Dec. The doctor didn't tell me anything except that my ekg was ABNORMALl. He sent me to a heart doctor. The heart doctor asked me if my Primary doctor had told me about my ekg.  The heart doctor told me that the ekg done by my Primary Doctor was a picticularly nasty one but the one he  (the heart doctor just did in his offices was even wosre). He told me it appeared I had a blocked front arterial artery. He but me throught a battery of test and then ordered an Angiogram. In time  had  four EKG at 4 different locations or offices. All of these EKGs showed I have a blocked arterial artery or restriction. On the 28th of this month I had an angiogram. They went in through my groin to heart. A few days before my angiogram my PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR\\"S nurse called and told me that the doctor asked me not to miss my next appointment on 1-03-2012 because my cholestrol and trys are over 300. AFTER MY ANGIOGRAM ON THE 28th The HEART DOCTOR  told me he couldn't see any blockages and is sending me back to my primary doctor. I have been running a low grade fever for almost 6 months and I'm tired of being tired. and in pain. While waiting for the Angiogram the heart doctor  prescribed Alpazolam 0.5 MG 3times a day and Cartia 180.MG XT Capsules a day. The pain seems to have become a lot more bareable since taking this medicine. Now  the heart doctor says that the Angiogram showed no problem and he is sending me back to my primary doctor  BUT to stay on the Medicines he Prescribed.. ??????? What I'm really afraid. Does this mean my heart is ok or is something else somewhere else in my body causing the abnormal ekg. This morning I was walking to my pantry and I felt like I wasn't getting air to my head. I felt myself going down so I grabed a hold of the door knob and sit down on the floor. It wasn't the tirst time this has happened but it really frightened me because I now know I actually have ekgs showing that it isn't all in my mind. Now today 12-29 I'm laying here in bed waiting for the wound from the angiogram yesterday. I'm tired of being tired. Do you have an answer. I'm 53 and have always had more energy than one deserves but now I feel like I am dying and no one hears me.    facebook Christine Hulsey","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. First of all, no need to worry for heart diseases because you are having normal angiography report. So be relax and calm. You are improved with alprazolam and cartia.

On meds my pressure is still at times in 180/106..","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, herniated disc at the level of lumber vertebrae can cause urinary incontinence. So your urine leak without knowing you is due to herniated disc. Chronic pain causes stress on the body. This continuous stress causes sympathetic over activity and this in turn causes rise in blood pressure. So your uncontrolled blood pressure is also due to pain because of herniated disc. So pain management is very important to control your blood pressure. Along with this, you will also need anxiolytic drugs too reduce stress.

I can understand your concern. Your all current symptoms are due to valvular heart disease (aortic stenosis and mitral valve stenosis). Valvular heart diseases ateare commonly due to rheumatic heart disease (RHD). RHD is caused by streptococcal infection of heart valves. This kind of infection is commonly seen in developing and under developed countries. So when you stayed in Namibia, you might have infected your heart valves which is causing RHD at present.

Your symptom of dizziness especially on getting up is due to hypotension only. Blood pressure values of 94/56mmhg, 98/58 mmhg etc are suggestive of hypotension. Since you had gastric bypass and lost 152 pounds, possibility of nutritional and electrolytes deficiency is more. Gastric bypass surgery causes poor absorption of nutrients and electrolytes. All these are normal to maintain blood pressure. So consult doctor and get done serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride). If deficiency then you will need supplements.

Are monitoring how he coupes, my biggest worry is that my father doesn't want any further operations to improve his condition, he shuts me out, the rest of the family have accepted his wishes. What is your advice on this? Only 40 percent of his heart is working.","Doctor":"Hi,There are different types of fast heart rates. The first one when patient's normal rhythm increases, in this case there is no need for any surgery, it is treated with medications. The second most frequent cause of fast heart rate is atrial fibrillation, in this case if rhythm is not restored, we try to do it with medications or electrical cardioversion. If there are multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation, patient may be advised to a invasive correction, which is a minioperation, but there are also patients, which remain with atrial fibrillation, and it heart rate is regulated with medications.There are other fast heart rhythms, such as atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, in every case the treatment can be either with medications or a minioperation, depends on the patient's parameters.But if your father doesn't want to undergo a surgery, it is his right and choice, he can be managed with medications.Hope this was helpfulWishing you good healthIn case of further questions don't hesitate to askRegards"},{"Patient":"just recently i had severe crushing chest pain that lead to difficulty of breathing. i was gasping for breath and as a result went in for admission in an acute care facility. the doctor diagnosed it as costochondritis, however, i have doubts as my blood pressure during the episode shoot up to 220/160? i requested to be tested for cardiac enzymes CKMB and TROPONIN I and both are normal? what do you think? will my blood pressure really shoot up to such high? thanks","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that it is normal to have higher blood pressure values during pain, physical or emotional stress. From the other hand, these values of blood pressure are really high, and further investigations are needed to determine any other possible causes. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your doctor and performing further tests: - thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- a chest X ray study- urinary metanephrines for possible pheochromocytoma- an abdominal ultrasound- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance. - kidney and liver function testsYou should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Meanwhile, I would recommend some lifestyle modifications to help maintain a normal blood pressure: - reduce salt and caffeine intake- perform a lot of physical activity (walking, aerobics, etc.)- reduce weight if you are overweight.

But, as he has been on this therapy more than 10 days, no further changes to his blood pressure are expected. So, I recommend discussing with his attending physician the possibility of making some changes to his actual therapy (increase the dose to 10 mg daily or add another anti-hypertensive agent, for ex. an ACE inhibitor).

You are having hypotension with bradycardia (slow heart rate). This is commonly seen with heart blocks. Your symptoms like dizziness is also seen with heart block. This is block in conduction of heart. So impulse generated in heart is not able to traverse properly and so heart pumping is poor which results in hypotension and bradycardia. If not treated promptly, this can be life threatening. So consult cardiologist and get done 1. Ecg 2. 2d echo 3. Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg).

I can understand your concern. Inferior wall ischemia means blockage in right coronary artery. Right coronary artery is small branch supplying inferior wall of the heart. So any blockage in this artery will cause ischemia in inferior wall. This artery also supplies SA node. SA node is pacemaker of heart. So possibility of arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) is more with inferior wall ischemia. So you should definitely consult cardiologist and get done coronary angiography to identify the blockage in right coronary artery. Sometimes more than one arteries are blocked. So angiography is must. Angiography is not only diagnostic but therapeutic also. We can put Stent and open the blocked arteries. So you should definitely consult cardiologist and discuss all these.

What is going on?","Doctor":"Brief Answer:There are different causes of heart palpitations and shortness of breath.You should do further examinations. Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. Heart palpitations usually aren't serious or harmful, though, and often go away on their own. Most of the time, they're related to stress and anxiety or to consumption of stimulants such as caffeine etc.Even though, heart palpitations may occur in specific medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism, or anemia, low blood pressure, dehydration, abnormal electrolyte levels etc.In rare cases, palpitations can be a sign of a more serious heart condition. A laboratory assessment of the thyroid hormones levels (TSH, fT3, fT4) should be done to exclude  a hyperthyroidism. If it will be proven by the results of the above mentioned levels of the thyroid hormones, you should see an endocrinologist for further treatment strategy and follow-up. Electrolyte levels assessment (Na, K, Cl, Ca) is essential, too and their correction (if deviations are noted) is necessary. Anemia can be ruled out by making a full blood count exam. If anemia is proven, you should treat it and your palpitations will go away. To be very careful, having experienced chest discomfort, and shortness of breath, you should make an ECG and see a cardiologist.If all the above mentioned exams are normal, than stress and anxiety remain the most probable causing factor of your symptoms.Meanwhile you should take plenty of water (2 - 3 liters per day).You should take an equilibrated diet.Try to avoid getting stressed or anxious.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

I was diagonosed of high blood pressure in Oct'10 and my family doctor prescribed me Telmisartan-40mg OD. I'm on this drug since then and get my BP measured once a month. It was 95 by 148 in Oct and now 90 by 130 with the medicine. I was a chronic smoker and have now completely given up smoking. With the busy work schedule I dont get enough time for work outs. I avoid foods with excessive salts and taken necessary precautions to maintain my blood pressure. I'd like to know what additional steps should I take to maintain my Blood pressure and stay healthy.","Doctor":"Brief Answer:You should undergo further radiologic examinations and laboratory exams. You should be guided by an internal medicine doctor.Detailed answer:Thank you for using HCM. I understand your concern. First of all, more than a therapeutic approach, I would suggest you to undergo further radiologic examinations, and laboratory exams, in way to detect any possible cause of your high blood pressure. Your age is too young and your blood pressure levels under treatment, are still high (148/95mmHg) , to have an essential (primary) hypertension.You should be screened for all the secondary possible causes of hypertension such as renal stenosis , renal parenchymal disease , Cushing syndrome , Pheocromocitoma, Hyperaldosteronism, Hyperthyroidism, Sleep apnea, Acromegaly, Coartation of aorta etc.For excluding each of them , you need to do a series of laboratory and imaging exams .The internist is the adequate doctor which may lead you in detecting the causing factor of your hypertension.It seems a little bit long way to do , but i encourage you to go under it , cause treating the causing factor once is better than treating hypertension for all of your life.There are even cases in which eventhough you do all tests for secondary causes , it doesn't get out nothing. At this case we are in front of an idiopathic hypertension , which we have to deal with. Regarding to your actual treatment, Telmisartan is a good choice. Most of the antihypertensive effect of Telmisartan is apparent within 2 weeks. But is difficult to deduct if you have a good response to this drug or not by measuring the blood pressure only one time a month. You should monitor the blood pressure at least three times a day for one week , to see the range of your blood pressure values during a normal week. If you have a persistent blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg, additional blood pressure reduction should be achieved, increasing the Telmisartan dosage to 80 mg. Meanwhile, you should do effective lifestyle changes for controlling blood pressure, such as : weight loss , regular physical activity ‚Äî at least 30 minutes 3 days of the week, eating a diet that is rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products. You should restrict the salt quantity that you take with food. Try to avoid alcohol, smoking, and caffeine. Try not to get stressed.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

The pain was intense and my regular physician gave me a toradol injection for the inflammation and 6 days of Prednisone. My BP was to almost 190/100. Usually I am in the 100-115/55-70 range despite smoking. The pain got worse the next day and since I felt my BP elevate as well, I went to the ER. My BP was 249/110 and they took me to an ER room. The doctor was ordering MRI s and when I told him I was on workers compensation, he suddenly decided that all I needed was xrays and only for the right shoulder at that, as if soft tissue damage will even show clearly on xrays. He kept saying I worked for WC, you can have them do all those haha. I am going on year 9, and it took 3 years to get one body part accepted while after 9 years, I still litigating over other injuries. Anyway, he left me there for 25 minutes after I had 2 techs get xrays; he speny maybe 90 seconds with me, saying this is an ER, I don t have time to listen to all your problems when I was trying to tell him what had happened. He put down calcific tendonitis (misspelt it as well), torn muscle, and elevated BP on the report. Then a nurse came all grumpy, telling me to take a clear grl yhst eas roughly the shape of a 1,000mg fish oil but had a yellow/orange color. I asked him what he was but all he told me was we give this to everyone with high BP . And they read my vitals again which showed 182/5minutes later. He adked the doctor if they should release me, and when the doc said yes, that was it. The ER was at maybe 20% capacity while the doctor eas sotting at the nurses station and chatting away with a nurse. It has been 5 days and my BP never shot above 140. However I have this dull, almost bruised feeling on my left back, right around the 5th rib which feels like a bruise. It almost feels as if it is under yhe bone and cartilage, and straight on the heart but I can t really tell and nothing makes it go away. I wasn t checked or even asked if I displayed any heart attack symptoms or anythong else other than you can get WC to take care of that . Is it possible that the high BP may have caused something or even bruised my heart somehow, or is it possible that I may have had a minor heart attack? My BP was over 180 for 2 days straight, especially considering it rarely goes above 130. And now that I checked thr online patient portal, my 240+ intake BP has also been removed from the transcripts. I am one step from filing a complaint for alst letting me die.","Doctor":"Hi,You had elevated blood pressure because you were taking Prednisone. Medications like prednisone, steroids, have a side effect of causing high blood pressure. But you should check your blood pressure also after stopping prednisone, as it is possible that you had slightly elevated blood pressure from time to time and you didn't know about it, and prednisone just made it worse.Your pain is related to your muscle and cartilage problems, don't worry, it is not a heart issue.Take careCome back if you have any further questions"},{"Patient":"I am taking Telma 40mg for controlling bp levels in the range of 120-130/80-90 since last 3 years but recently I started feeling heavy head, irritation, swollen face and on checking bp, found the levels are in range 145-150/90-95 at different timings.

One significant marrowing was treated with stent, but the other one remained. I think they didn't perform stenting of the other artery as the stress test results were good in 2011, but of you have positive stress test results in a year, then there is a need to repeat coronary angiography to evaluate arteries again, there may be two possibilities, either the other narrowings became more and are significant now or it is the D2 from the first angiography causing the problems.

On my sons 1st birthday I was run off my feet all day. Later tat night when I finally sat down to relax I called my mum. during the phone call I began to get chest pains and a sharp pain when I breathed. I ignored the pain for about an hour and stayed on the phone but the pain was slowly getting stronger so i told my mum i had to get off the phone. I went and sat on the lounge and then it got really bad, like something was squishing my chest through to my back which was also aching. It was getting harder to breath because with each breath I got a sharp pain in the chest. I called my husband who was in the other room and asked him as I thought it might help, if he could run a bath for me. So he ran into the bathroom to do as I asked, and in that short time it became alot worse I tried walking round the room a couple times to take my mind off it but it was so bad. The pain was even more intense, the sharp pain when I breathed in, the dizziness, the cold sweat and the feeling like i was going to be sick. I tried to walk into the bathroom but as I walked out of the loungeroom I felt like if I didnt sit I was going to pass out and fall so I sat in the hall way, but then layed because i couldnt sit. My husband came out of the bathroom and called my parents, who only live round the corner. So they came over and by the time they got there, which only took about 2 mins, I felt alot worse, I could barely breath, the pain was extreme, I couldnt move. My parents rang an ambulance. from the beginning, I had this sharp pain that slowly seamed to travel up my chest, like i could point to it and follow it up, by the time the ambulance got there this sharp pain was traveling up my neck towards my jaw....although the pain everywhere else was extremely strong, I could feel it was easing. the paramedics took my blood pressure which was 60 / 40 and took me to hospital. on the way to hospital the pain eased some more, by the time we got there it was an ache. I was left in the corridor for about 45 mins and then the doctor spoke to me, gave me an iv for dehydration and some mylanta, but by this time all the pains had gone except for an ache and felt like my chest was badly bruised ...could this have been a heart attack ??","Doctor":"Hi,From your description the pain is more likely to be cosrochondritis or a muscle pain. I really understand your feelings as sometimes the can cause a very severe pain. Sweating and low blood pressure can be consequences of your severe pain.

My husband is 75yrs old ,always been healthy except for a mini stroke about 5yrs ago that passed with no damage-did weigh 218 & now weighs 190 after triple bypass June 16th 2011. Found after heat stroke on June5th. Had nuclear stress test showed lack of blood flow to part of heart resulting in Heart Cath thru wrist,which led to the triple bypass surgery due to 80%blockage on left side. Had bad irregular heart beat following Monday up to 145-150. Was regulated with meds-then needed 2bags of blood transfusion following day. Vitals became stable&he was starting to walk...feeling & looking better. Had severe allergic reaction to adhesive used with heart monitor&the surgery-was all over his neck&torso&hips. Allergist gave him oinment to put on &his body had a severe allergic reaction to it! Had to wash off in shower Saturday June25 &also June 26 at which time he fainted for a flash,collasped upon his knees with legs beneath him. I saved him from hurting his CABG or head.No nurse was present &should have been! Also never told him he couldn t take warm/hot shower due to blood rushing to feet&brain not getting enough! When they finally responded to my screams for help!!...they just stood around him &kept attempting to lift him up little then dropped his body weight back upon his squished legs&feet...over &over they did this for 6to7minutes till finally another heart patient s 50yr old son rescued my husband off the floor! He was conscious whole time except for intial momentary blackout &vitals were stable. However he complained of right foot hurting yet they had him walk on it atleast 5times after that! I said his ankle was really warm so something has to be going on in there! An xray was finally ordered next morning June 27th. The Cardiologists were furious with the negligance of this Sunday nursing staff however the damage was already done! The xray showed a severe break in his right ankle on right side-the smaller bone broke away from the ball &had separated &shifted plus ligaments on left side torn! The dropping of him over &over plus making him walk on it caused greater damage! He had ankle surgery July 1st...put pin & plate in &then had severe pain next day so needed morphine-which caused constipation, causing him then to have to drink citrate, which resulted in all day Sunday July3 &most of the 4th to have runny stools. This ended Monday afternoon accompanied by the most severe pain ever for next 24hrs or so in his lower right abdoman resulting in more morphine to ease the wrenching pain!His appendix was removed when he was 11 so a CT Scan was ordered which found kidney&gall bladder stones they feel were caused by the dehydrating effects from surgeries & meds& citrate! He s been thru so darn much &never took meds in his life except an occasional antibiotic for sinus infection &recently past 5yrs 10mg daily Lisinopril for maintenance purposes. So now he can t weight bear on right foot for 6weeks to 3months depending on how it heals...&he can t use his arms to push ,pull, lift, brace etc due to CABG for 8weeks or longer! Thus he can t use crutches so now instead of being home already &healing from triple bypass...walking being paramount in the well being of heart surgery patients...he is confined to bed in hospt-having to use lift to get him from chair to bed to toilet etc...&he once again had a fainting spell when on toilet in bathroom that was confining &had no circulation. He had finished having stool &was ready to be lifted off when he said he was feeling dizzy& it hit him fast. They got him in wheel chair when he was starting to pass out but he tried hard to remain conscious &did but it was scarey again! His vitals were ok again. The Doc-new one now down on TCC Unit(Transitional Care Center) where he can receive some kind of rehab therapy-cut back on some of his meds thinking could be causing this. I have noticed when he is up in wheelchair for an hour or more he gets tired easily & says he s starting to feel a little light headed. His BP has been recently 106 to 120 but tonight it was 95/58 at 4:30 pm. Is this too low?? He had just used the bedpan(cause they are afraid he ll get dizzy on toilet) about 30 minutes prior. So they didn t give him his blood pressure med. Then at 9pm BP was 114/62. This really concerns me& him that he gets so tired easily or can t stay up long & feels lightheadedness. He has gone to rehab 4times doing exercises to strengthen legs &only used the bicycle for the arms real slowly. An hr each session.They were making him use the sliding board by using his arms to scoot himself from chair to rehab table & back until today when a Cardio Rep said NO! Can t use his arms that way! I see how this is a strain for him &needs to lay down afterwards & u can see it in his eyes. Is all this just because he can t get up & walk like he should be doing-&his body just isn t use to being up & heart isn t use to pumping when body in upward position? &the low blood pressure is very concerning cause he could faint &be crippled for life or worse! This is a man who exercised & was basically healthy before all this! What exercises can he do with his arms now that won t hurt his CABG?! Will this tired dizziness ever leave him? When could he use crutches &be really safe in not damaging the CABG?! What is the remedy for the low BP? For I Know he has to take some BP meds rest of his life after bypass surgery-right? He s also afraid to eat too much cause he s confined to the darn bed due to one individual s lack of professionalism in caring for him! Which has changed his whole life now plus mine with this broken ankle plus how it is effecting the recovery process of his CABG! We should be home with our 19yr old son who is in Intell in the USAF &our daughter, 21, an Aerospace Med Tech in USAF overseas, is extremely concerned for her Dad s health as well! Please lend your professional advice as much as possible! It will be so deeply appreciated beyond words! Thankyou deeply!!","Doctor":"Hello Dr Faisal here,I have read and understood your query, I will suggest you as if he is  over weight? What about his BMI (height required).In back ground of irregular heart beat, he needs 24 hour or 48 hour holter monitoring and defect needs to be worked upon if caught. In future patient should be strictly checked for allergy, any new drug if started.  There is a very high chance of getting any arrhythmia after CABG surgery so patient should be vigilantly monitored for any syncope or collapse and ideally should not go to toilets for an initial 7 to 10 days. Or at best for initial 15 days.  Joints other than  fractured ankle and other  3 limbs should undergo active or passive exercises as per convenience of patient.  Bed pan is good for him until and unless he is diagnosed for cause of his low bp and fainting spells.Ideally a senior physiotherapist should be consulted but so far as I know he should use his biceps. And arm muscles. By pumping a tennis ball. Light weight exercises for his upper limbs for 15 minutes thrice a day at minimum.   His tiredness needs to be evaluated for any excess or deficiency of vitamins, minerals, thyroid or any blood  count levels. The recovery of bone and cartilage in chest cage takes almost 1 to 1.5 months to recover.he need to wear a belt post operatively. Cause of low BP needs to be worked upon. I need list of medications which he is taking during his BP fluctuations, Ideal weight for his body according to BMI needs to be calculated.He should take enough healthy diet low in oil and ghee diet to maintain his weight at a fix.  .

But, before coming to this conclusion, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a physical exam and some tests in order to investigate the possible causes: - a resting ECG and a cardiac ultrasound - a chest X-ray study - thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction - complete blood count for anemia - blood electrolytes for possible imbalance. An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring would help investigate for possible cardiac arrhythmia. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I am having a recurring pain in the left side of my chest, which is making me very nervous. I first began to feel it about 4 1/2 years ago. The best way to describe it is a balloon inflating behind where I imagine my heart to be, accompanied by discomfort, and sometimes sharp pain. I have seen many doctors about this issue, and have been through multiple EKG's, all indicating my heart is just fine. I don't doubt that, but this symptom is constant, and the location is stressing me out. It seems to be occurring more frequently, sometimes 6 times a day, for  many days in a row. What tests should my doctors be doing to find the cause?","Doctor":"Hi,The cause for the left sided chest pain is not always heart, among young people muscle pain and pain caused by spine problems are more frequent, and sometimes chest pain can be caused by anxiety as well.I would advise you to see a doctor to check if everything is normal with your spine.Take care"},{"Patient":"I failed my stress test and the doctor is sending me to a hospital to take the stress echocardiogram test.  He is telling me that women have a tendency to have false positives during the original stress test and that he is not concerned there is anything wrong.  Is it really normal to fail the original test?","Doctor":"Dear Mrs,ECG stress test results can be false positive among women, it means that there can be abnormal results, when the person actually has no problem.We perform a stress test to a woman patient, if it negative, no abnormality in results, then heart disease is unlikely, if it is positive or doubtful, it doesn't yet mean that a person has heart disease in case of a woman patient, in this case we need more specific tests, so you were referred for echo stress test. Don't worry, your doctor just wants to make sure, that everything is normal.Take care"},{"Patient":"I was electrocuted on 10/11/11.

By your history and description, in my opinion, you are mostly having systolic hypertension. Only antihypertensive drugs are not always sufficient to control systolic hypertension. You need to follow certain below mentioned lifestyle modifications also. 1. Strict salt restrictions in diet. 2. Avoid oily and fatty food. 3. Start using sunflower oil in food preparation. 4. Do regular aerobic exercise like running, cycling, swimming etc. 5. Avoid stress and tension, if you are having stressful life. Don't worry, your blood pressure will control with all these.

I rarely have palpitations but today I have had them a few times and my right arm is achy and tingly. should I be concerned. I am 5' and 254lbs.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more. But since you had heart murmur in childhood, we should rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) for your palpitations and tingling arm sensations. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia or other heart diseases. You are approaching menopause. So hormonal imbalance is likely and this can further add stress and anxiety. So get done hormone levels and if imbalance then you will need hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Also consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

Strict salt restrictions in diet is needed. 3. Avoid oily and fatty food. 4. Do regular aerobic exercise like running, cycling, swimming etc. 5. Avoid stress and tension if you are having stressful life. 6. Get done regular lipid profile,ecg, 2d echo and stress test once a year. 7.

I can understand your concern. Yes, angioplasty will definitely work in your case. Your symptoms are classical of coronary artery disease (CAD) which is confirmed by angiography. You are having blockage only in 1 artery (single vessel disease). So angioplasty with stenting is treatment of choice for this.

Yes, coronary angiography is must in his case. In fact, not only angiography, electrophysiological (EP) study of heart is needed for the diagnosis of his tachycardia and PVCs (premature ventricular contractions). His symptoms are mostly due to accessory pathway in heart which is sending extra impulses and these extra impulses produce all the symptoms. So get done angiography and EP study.

Its more annoying than anything but sometimes it can keep me up at night thus making me more exhausted.

I can understand your concern. No, high potassium level can nothing prevent heart attacks. Potassium is actually considered as double edged sword.

It is true that electrical shocks emitted by the defibrillator are a source of major concern giving an unpleasant feeling and psychological distress. Anyway, his current complaints need to be further investigated and a medical consultation with his neurologist is advisable. Neurological status examination and better control of the anticoagulant (warfarin) activity should be done. In addition, the adverse effects of heavy alcohol abuse should be sought as well. You need to discuss with his attending doctor on the above-mentioned issues. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

From the other hand, heavy physical activity can exacerbate high blood pressure values. For this reason, I would recommend only light physical activity (walking, aerobics, etc.) and reduce salt and caffeine intake. Yoga can help against anxiety. But, if these high blood pressure values persist, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests, in order to investigate for secondary causes underlying high blood pressure values: - complete blood count, PCR, for inflammation - thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction - kidney and liver function tests - blood electrolytes.

This is a common glitch on the EKG. Furthermore, I suspect the doctor looked at other parts of the ekg that were inconsistent with it actually having occurred.

Your heartbeat is low because of side effect of medication (Terazosin-it is an alpha-blocker, which lowers BP & may cause slow heartbeat), poor electrolyte balance(take ORS, soups & juice), obstructive sleep apnea, poor general health, thyroid issues(hypothyroidism). You are suggested to get physically examined, get your general health condition better. Get treated if you are diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea or thyroid issues. Get treated at the earliest. Quit smoking & drug abuse. You can talk to your treating doctor & get Terazosin replaced by other medicines that will suit you better. Your treating doctor can suggest you surgery(TUIP/TUNA) depending on the moderate or severe symptoms you may have.

Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. Yes, you may be right. Heart palpitations may occur in specific medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism, or anemia, low blood pressure, dehydration, abnormal electrolyte levels etc.In rare cases, palpitations can be a sign of a more serious heart condition. Thyroid parenchyma disorders, may be suggestive of hyperthyroidism, as the most probable cause of the symptoms such as in your case. A laboratory assessment of the thyroid hormones levels (TSH, fT3, fT4) is essential to make a right diagnosis. If hyperthyroidism is proven, you should see an endocrinologist for further treatment strategy and follow-up. Electrolyte levels assessment (Na, K, Cl, Ca) is essential, too and their correction (if deviations are noted) is necessary. Meanwhile, referring the fact that you are symptomatic (you still experience heart palpitations under Verapamil), i would suggest you to increase the dosage of Verapamil in 80 mg x 3, monitoring your blood pressure.Meanwhile you should take plenty of water (2 - 3 liters per day).You should take an equilibrated diet.Try to avoid getting stressed or anxious.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

She is very interested in solving crosswords puzzels and sometimes sits on the bed for hours holding the newspaper in the right hand and the pen in the left one.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I carefully passed through your question and would explain that it is important performing a comprehensive differential diagnosis of different causes that may lead to this pain: 1- a musculo-skeletal pain. Is the pain modulated by body motion or respiration? This would indicate possible musculo-skeletal pain. Staying in a wrong position for a prolonged time could cause these problems. I would recommend performing a shoulder joint X ray study, a cervical column X ray study and inflammation tests (complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate) for this purpose. 2- myocardial ischemia. I would recommend performing a resting ECG and cardiac enzymes to exclude this possibility. You should discuss with her doctor on the above issues.

This means that further changes to his actual antihypertensive therapy need to be made. Regarding the doses, I would explain that the captopril dose he is taking is a low daily dose. I would recommend increasing the dose to 50mg twice a day, in order to have a better control of his blood pressure. While, I would not recommend making further changes to bendroflumethiazide doses, as this is a normal maintenance dose. But, this drug is not recommended as first line therapy for high blood pressure. You can discuss with his doctor the possibility of switching from bendroflumethiazide to another antihypertensive drug like hydroclorothiazide or a calcium channel blocker (nicardipine, amlodipine, etc.). Some lifestyle modifications would also help maintain normal blood pressure values: - diet modifications (reduce salt and caffeine intake)- stop smoking or alcohol intake- perform a lot of physical activity (walking, jogging, aerobics, etc.)- reduce weight if he is overweight.

He has a family history of hypertension from both maternal and paternal realtions. He regularly excercises, mantains a healthy diet. HAs recently quit smoking.we have been monitoring his BP regularly and it fluctuates every day. For Example- yesterday  was 180/100, today it is 190/90. Please suggest which doctor in bangalore we should refer.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should start antihypertensive drug in his case. His blood pressure readings are suggestive of hypertension and he is also having strong family history of hypertension, so no need for wait to start antihypertensive drug. In young age, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are the treatment of choice. ARB includes telmisartan, losartan etc. Better to consult cardiologist for this. Because in hypertension, we should rule out systemic involvement like kidney, heart, retina etc. So he will need kidney function test, ecg, 2d echo and retinal examination. So consult cardiologist and discuss all these. In bangalore, Columbia Asia hospital is having good cardiology department. So consult there. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your concern. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) can cause reduction in heart functions. This can cause fluid retention in the body. This fluid can accumulate in lungs, abdomen and legs. In lungs, it causes pulmonary edema and this can cause breathlessness on exertion.  In abdomen it causes ascites and this cause heaviness in abdomen. So you should consult cardiologist and get done 2d echo to measure heart function. If it is reduced then you will need diuretics to reduce fluid retention. After diuretics, you will mostly improve.

In my opinion, you are mostly having musculoskeletal pain due to heavyweight lifting. But since it is left sided chest pain, better to first rule out heart diseases.

Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller like ibuprofen.

I can understand your concern. Heart murmurs are sound coming from heart due to turbulent flow of blood. Normally blood flow in the heart don't make any sound. But when there is turbulence in the flow of blood (mostly due to valvular diseases), murmur is heard. Since you are having aortic insufficiency (aortic regurgitation), this is the likely cause or your murmur.Grade 4 murmur is suggestive of severe valvular defect. So better to consult cardiologist and get done expert 2d echo to know the severity of aortic regurgitation. If it is severe then you will need surgical repair of this aortic valve.

Presently I am suffering from a sinus infection however, this hasn't happened before when I had one. My father had his thyroid taken out and also has graves disease. I am not sure what I shuld do I have an appointment with a ent tomorrow shuld I tell them about this or wait till I see my GP","Doctor":"Brief Answer:In most of the times tachycardia (high heart rate) is a response to physiological situations, and there is nothing to be worried about. Yes, sinus infection may be related to tachycardia.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. I understand your concern. In most of the times tachycardia (high heart rate) is a response to physical activity, chemical interactions (like coffee or nicotine), emotional episodes, stressful situation. It can happen after eating due to lowered blood pressure or when you change immediately your position from lied down to upright position, too. In your case, the heart rate may be increased due to high physical demand during the exercises. During these situations, your body releases a series of hormones that make you hyper-alert, focused, and energized, and this chemical cascade causes increased heart rate, respiratory rate, and perspiration.The blood from the heart is pumped to aorta and subclavian arteries , and from them to the carotid arteries, which run up either side of your neck, and to your brain.  This is the reason you feel your heart biting in your neck and head.Sinus infection may cause tachycardia too, due to pain or high fever, that's why it is important it to get treated. You should see the ENT doctor first, eventhough you had the tachycardia episodes prior to sinus infection.High heart rate may be either due to over function of the thyroid gland, and in this case it is accompanied with other symptoms such as sweating, tremor, anxiety, high blood pressure, weight loss etc. The symptoms, in case of hyperthyroidism are not related to physical activity , and they are present at rest too. To be quiet, you can test your thyroid hormone levels in blood (as you have a family predisposition for thyriodopathies), and after receiving the results of the laboratory exams, you should see a GP or an Internal medicine doctor.They will judge if you need to do a ECG or ECG Holter (48 hours ECG) or not.Meanwhile try not to be stressed, and avoid coffein , nicotin, etc.During this situations, you can make the carotid massage as a way to ‚Äútrick‚Äù your brain into thinking your blood pressure is high, and lower your heart rate.You should make deep controlled breathing by, slow 10-second inhalation through the nose, followed by a slow and complete exhalation for 10 seconds. Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards, Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"I have recently had my blood pressure taken it was 140/102.

This has happened about 4 times over the past 2 months. I am a light smoker, half a pack a day or less.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are smoker, we should rule out heart (arrhythmia) and lung (bronchitis) related diseases first as both are common in smokers. So consult doctor and get done 1. Ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg) to rule out arrhythmia and other heart diseases. 2. Clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out bronchitis. You may need anti arrhythmia drugs or inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) on the basis of above reports. In any case, smoking cessation should be done as soon as possible. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"my grandmother is in the hospital and they told her that her creantinine level is at 3. She has high blood pressure, diabetes and is retaining water and in her lungs. She is 84 y/o. What does this test result mean? She has been in the hospital since sunday and on meds and it went from 2.5 to 3.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Creatinine is a protein which is excreted by kidneys. It is actually a waste product fromm body's metabolism. Normal level of creatinine in blood is upto 1.5. When this level rises, it means that kidney is not excreting creatinine out of the body. This is commonly seen with Renal (kidney) failure. Most common cause for Renal failure are diabetes and hypertension. Since your grand mother is having both, diabetes and hypertension, possibility of Renal failure due to these diseases is more. When kidney fails to perform it's functions, urine output decreases, so there is fluid occumulate in the body. So overall she is having kidney failure any due to this her creatinine levels are increasing. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your grand mother.

Yasmin contraceptive pills can cause mood swings, stress, anxiety etc. And all these inturn cause palpitations, chest tightness, tingling etc. So better to consult gynecologist and discuss about these side effects.

I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, there is no alternative to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) especially in triple vessel disease (TVD). CABG is considered as gold standard treatment for TVD. But now a days newer technique called ECCP (external coronary counter pulsation) is available. It is non invasive technique. In this patient is made to sleep in special apparatus where his calf muscles are squeezed periodically with pressure. By this, there is development of pressure wave in the blood vessels which can dislodge the clots in coronary arteries. You can try this for your father. No harm in it. Hope I have solved your query.

Today has been my worst day by far. My mother has a mitro valve prolases so im not sure if I have one as well.","Doctor":"Brief Answer:Heart palpitations usually aren't serious or harmful, eventhough you should make some further laboratory exams and an ECG.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.Heart palpitations usually aren't serious or harmful, though, and often go away on their own. Most of the time, they're related to stress and anxiety or to consumption of stimulants such as caffeine etc. But there can be palpitations due to other medical conditions too such as Hyperthyroidism, anemia, low blood pressure, dehydration, abnormal electrolyte levels etc.In rare cases, palpitations can be a sign of a more serious heart condition. In your case, being post partum, the most probable cause of these symptoms, can be anemia eventough you should have had palpitations during the pregnancy too. This can be diagnosed by making a full blood count exam and if anemia is proven, you should treat it and your symptoms will go away. You should test the thyroid hormones level (TSH, fT3, fT4) and the electrolyte (Na, k, Cl,Ca) levels in blood too.To be very careful, having experienced chest pain you should make an ECG and see a cardiologist.Meanwhile you should take plenty of water (2 - 3 liters per day).Try to avoid getting stressed or anxious.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards, Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"I am 49 and have a heart murmur that has not impeded any activity in the past.

Acid reflux or a musculoskeletal pain could be the main causes underlying your complaints, as your symptoms are relieved by sitting down. Coming to this point, I recommend taking omeprazole for acid reflux. If the pain does not improve, the next step would be taking acetaminophen, which would help in case of musculoskeletal pain.

I have listened to my heart when this is happening and it sounds like what is described as premature atrial or ventricular contractions. I never had this until recently. Last fall, I had chest pain and nausea and slight shortness of breath when I woke up one morning. I went to the ER and was evaluated. They diagnosed me with idiopathic chest pain. I went back 2 more times for the same thing and same result - chest wall pain or idiopathic chest pain. There were no palpitations then. Later on, I have had these palpitations and a slight feeling of phlegm in the chest. I do cough up a little thin mucous from time to time. It is kind of worrying because I have never had this before. I am 43, I worked out for most all of my life and was in very good shape. It is suspected that I have Acute Intermittent Porphyria, as I started becoming very chemically sensitive with many environmental allergies in 2001. I did acupuncture and chiropractic and now no longer have chest pain but I have these palpitations. My blood pressure had gone up significantly last year. It had always been around 110/70 or so and it went up to 165/110 for a bit last fall when this happened. Later, I had gotten it down to 110/70 for a while again, however, it has recently run up to 135/83 or so and has stayed around that level for the past few weeks.

I can understand your concern. I have gone through ecg report you have mentioned. No need to worry much for this ecg report. Left atrial abnormality can be seen as an accidental finding without any symptoms. So if you are asymptomatic then nothing to worry about this abnormality in ecg. But if you're really want to confirmed this then 2d echo is needed. So get done 2d echo to rule rule out all fear. If echo is normal then no need to worry for employment add other issues.

Besides, considering your young age, a cardiac issue would be exceptional. Anyway, I would recommend consulting with your GP for a physical exam and some tests: - a resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound - thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction - blood electrolytes for possible imbalance - complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause underlying your complaints.

I am 18 years old, I weigh around 82kg/180lbs at a height of 184cm/76 inches For about two years now I ve been having problems with hypertension. Not only that, I also experience that weird chest pain very often, don t know if palpitations or angina is the right word, either way it s not that painful but it makes me feel very uncomfortable, followed by fear or even panic attacks (for obvious reasons, I guess). About a month ago I had a blood pressure of 198/144 (it was late in the evening and I was about to go to bed), whereupon we called an ambulance that brought me to the hospital. I spent the next two weeks there and they conducted a wide array of different tests including blood tests, urinalysis, fecal occult blood test, trans-esophageal echo, loads of ECG s (had a long-term ECG done about a year prior to that), long-term blood pressure recordings, an eye test and two magnetic resonances. All these tests were negative, meaning they did not find what was causing my problems. They did, however, notice that there was an unusually high amount of some hormone in my blood. Ever since I ve been monitoring my blood pressure on a daily basis. (about once or twice a day). I have to take an ACE inhibitor and a 5mg Beta blocker every day in the morning (again, I m only 18!). It has always been in the green area or slightly above the normal. However, sometimes the sign for irregular heartbeat comes up. And I still experience these unpleasant sensations in the area where my heart is. Today around noon it was at 117/78. But when I measured it later that day, at around 8 p.m., I had 143/128! Now, I know that s way above the average but what was I supposed to do? Call 911 and go through all of this again?? I decided not to do that and keep an eye on that myself. I re-measured it about 20 minutes later and noticed that the diastolic number decreased to 95 while to systolic one went up to over 150. Probably because I got very nervous. Even though doctors ensured me that there was no life-threatening danger, I always fear the possibility of a stroke or a heart attack when stuff like this happens. What I could extrapolate from this is that apparently my blood pressure greatly fluctuate throughout the day. Some additional data: *My mom also has hypertension and takes meds since she is 40 or something *Her father, my grandfather, died at the age of 50 because of a heart-related disease *I sweat a lot *I often find it hard to fall asleep because I am worried about my health and because I have this uncomfortable feeling in my chest, which most of the time is gone completely or very weak when I wake up again *Sometimes it feels as though my heart skips a beat, I can clearly feel it and it makes me become very aware of my heartbeat. This also comes with lightheadedness from time to time. *Often, shortly before falling asleep, some of my limbs move without me wanting them to move *I often have a headache, however I doubt it s related to my blood pressure *Sometimes I experience what I believe is tachycardia, a very fast heartbeat *It would be a lie to say I m sporty but I m not obese either *I don t do drugs, I don t smoke and I only drink alcohol occasionally So, I would like to know if it is possible for someone like me to have a high blood pressure without anything to fear. Is my life-expectancy significantly shortened by this? Do I need to take more meds?Could it be that it s my mind causing all of this? As impolite as this may sound, I do not need any calming words unless they are backed up by medical facts. I greatly appreciate any help I can get and I wanna thank you in advance for taking the time to read all this! If you need any additional information from my clinical record I will gladly provide it to you. Also, I am very sorry for the broken English!

I have previously suffered a single episode of what was diagnosed as lone atrial fibrillation when I was 27 years old. I had a echocardiogram following this episode and this confirmed a structurally normal heart. Following this I had another echocardiogram a few months later which showed evidence of trivial mitral regurgitation and the report also stated that the aortic and pulmonary valves velocities were within normal limits but it didn't state if there is was any evidence of regurgitation or stenosis. The tricuspid valve doesn't have any stenosis or regurgitation. I'm now 31 years of age and have been asymptomatic up until early November this year. I've spoken to my own GP who's arranged a referral to see a Consultant Cardiologist but she seems unconcerned. In this time I've been to A & E twice because of symptoms and an x ray and blood test were performed to check for a minor MI. Both results were negative. No signs of enlargement and no minor MI. The first A & E doctor performed auscultation and said normal heart sounds. On the second visit to A & E the doctor said there was no abnormal heart sound then said there's no significant murmur. I've also used a walk-in centre twice and the GP's on both occasions performed a physical examination and they both said they couldn't detect any abnormal heart sounds.I have my own due headed stethoscope and have listen and can clearly hear a moderately loud S1 in the left fifth intercostal space. I assume it could be a sign of mitral stenosis? I've learnt a lot about heart anatomy and have studied the structure and function in detail. Further to this I've also read medical journals and case studies. I feel I have a heart murmur given what the second A & E doctor said. I know some murmurs are classed as functional or innocent but I think with the presentation of symptoms and the development of a new heart murmur that it must be pathological?

My INR, cholesterol etc have all styled to good levels. But I get an itchy prickle (no pain) inside my heart beneath the sternum.is the heart just healing around the stent, like a scab would?","Doctor":"The symptoms you are having is unlikely cardiac in nature. The stent is in an artery that is on the surface of the heart and not in the heart. As time goes by the stent becomes endothelialized (the surface of the stent that blood flows through is covered by the tissue that normally covers the inside of an artery). The time it takes for this to happen varies on the type of stent that were placed. You should not be able to feel this healing process as it occurs very slowly and the healing process is different from a healing external/skin scar and will not cause symptoms of itching/prickly feeling.Typical cardiac symptoms occurs with activity, stress, etc. If your symptoms are more noticeable with activity etc or occurs with the activity that caused the initial event then you should speak to your cardiologist about your symptoms.Also the heart tissue and its vessels never come in direct contact with the sternum with regular activity.You are doing an awesome job taking the medications prescribed by your physician team and I urge you to continue."},{"Patient":"HELLOW MY NAME IS KAREN AND IM A  TYPE 1 DIABETE AND WITH THYROID DISEASE.

It contains DMAA, a stimulant banned from US military bases and implicated in several cases of liver failure and heart failure. Any symptoms related to your heart are probably due to this ingredient under cover of the name of geranium oil. This ingredient is not safe for you to take. This is why you feel your heart muscles are sore.2. In the US in 2014 it was recalled for the presence of 10.2 mg of Phenolphthalein, a known carcinogen.3. It has no evidence of effectiveness.You are asking if you should take this pill in light of your symptoms. If you were my patient, my answer would be to stop taking this pill. I would advise that weight loss does not come in a pill but in lifestyle changes in diet, exercise, general activity levels. Yes, I know of chemicals, supplements, herbs to help that process, but they need to come from a qualified clinician capable of monitoring you.Congratulations on doing the healthy thing, writing us for advice before any side-effects occurred so you could make an informed decision.Healthy Regards, Kathy J.

Should i be more concerned or fine to keep waiting till my appointment?","Doctor":"Hello!I carefully passed through your question and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to any cardiac disorders. The muscular pain could be related to a viral infection or electrolyte imbalance. This does not seem to be an emergent situation and you can wait until your doctor consultation. I would recommend performing some tests: - complete blood count- muscular enzymes- PCR, sedimentation test for inflammation- liver and kidney function tests- blood electrolytesRegarding your blood pressure values, I would recommend to closely monitor your blood pressure different times during the day ( in sitting position, after 10 minutes of total relax),write them down and show them to your new doctor. The values you refer are within the normal ranges, and some of them are borderline. This means that you do not need to start antihypertensive therapy. Some lifestyle modifications would be enough to help you maintain a normal blood pressure: - a healthy diet ( low salt and caffeine intake)- a lot of physical activity (aerobics, walking, jogging, recreational sports, etc.)- reduce your weight if you are overweight. Considering your blood sugar levels, they are within the normal ranges and do not indicate diabetes.

She is a very healthy weight, if anything could stand to gain some weight, but she is very active in dance and gymnastics.

Quite commonly, an abnormally fast heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation may occur. Your doctor may already be aware of this and have him on appropriate medication but let the doctor know of the 132 heart rate just to be sure.Hand numbness may occur after surgery due to changes in nerve function with medication and fluid shifts. If this does not disappear after 2-3 weeks testing should be done to be sure of the source of symptoms. Often, all that is needed is a protective hand brace worn for a few weeks to achieve recovery."},{"Patient":"I am having a chest pain above my heart that extends to my sternum area sometimes. Most extreme when laying down. Wakes me in my sleep after about 5 hours. Feels tight like I could stretch the area to relieve pain, but doesn't work.

Also experiencing numbness in hands and right foot. 2 weeks ago before chest pain I was having numbness in left hand causing throbbing in index finger. Also can't lay on side without sore cage feeling, aches to stretch out after. No change in diet or exercise. Last 2 days starting to extend further into the day or become more frequent. 26 year old female, 5'5, 138 lbs","Doctor":"The good news it that a heart related illness is very unlikely based upon your description of symptoms. Discomfort that is positional, awakening from sleep, sharp or worsened by a deep breath is usually not cardiac. More commonly, the source of discomfort is skeletal, inflamed joints where the ribs meet the sternum, muscular discomfort or even nerve irritation. Most such problems fix themselves in 7-10 days and respond to over the counter pain medications. Of course, if symptoms worsen or fail to resolve over that time period, let a healthcare professional take a look at you."},{"Patient":"i, mayI nsweryur health queries?

Pl reply me","Doctor":"Narrowing of the heart arteries is generally classified according to the number of vessels affected (there are only three). When all three vessels are narrowed or very specific disease affecting two vessels, treatment (such as a bypass surgery or stent) is almost always necessary. For less severe forms of two vessel involvement or disease of only one vessel, the need for relief of chest discomfort or trouble breathing determines the need for these types of treatments. Regardless, everyone with narrowing needs medical attention and specific medications to protect them. Medications are obtained upon recommendation from your doctor."},{"Patient":"I have had 2 coronary bi-pass surgerys.

I can understand your concern. No need to worry for heart diseases as you are active and doing exercise. But better to get done screening for heart diseases as you are having strong family history of heart diseases. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes, musculoskeletal pain can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Yes, hormonal pills can have side effects of palpitations. Actually these pills can cause stress and anxiety and these can cause tachycardia, palpitations etc. Not all women tolerate hormone pills.

I can understand your concern. No, citralka syrup can not cause palpitations or rise in blood pressure. Actually citralka is alkalizer. It is given into urinary tract infection to make urine alkaline. It is very safe and nontoxic drug. So no need to worry for citralka related side effects. In my opinion, your palpitations and rapid breathing ate mostly due to stress and anxiety. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright.

Because electrolytes have so many different roles within the body, their imbalance can affect lot of systems, that's why they should have a special consideration. You should test the level of sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, calcium and magnesium in blood in way to correct their level by taking needed supplements as treatment. Meanwhile you can begin immediately correcting your diet. Take plenty of vegetables and fruits that provide potassium and magnesium such as leafy greens, broccoli, cabbage, sweet potatoes, squash, bananas, and avocados. You should give up from junk foods, takeout and restaurant foods, while instead you should cook more fresh foods at home. Eat a lot of fruits such as: Coconut water, Celery, Watermelon, Cucumber, Kiwi etc, to avoid dehidration. Drink approximately 2-3 liter of water per day.

They last from 5-20 minutes.So, if you are experiencing chest pains, difficulties in breathing deeply than I would say that you definitely need to seek medical advise.If I was your treating doctor I would recommend some examination like a electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function,valves, a full blood analyze to exclude electrolyte imbalances.After this simple examination we can create an idea what we are dealling whith and how to treat it.Hope I was helpfull.Best regards,Dr.Ervina."},{"Patient":"My wife had open heart surgery two months ago. mitral valve replaced with bovine valve. after discharge my wife s heart rate plummeted to 25. pacemaker was inserted. pacer set at 60. my wife has been complainiing of sob since. my wife has asthma. her lungs were clear. when in er they did a bnp blood level and told us it was chf. wife is taking lasix with very little im provemnets. wife is taking 40 mg lasix a day.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question  and I understand your concern.I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion.Sob, difficulties in breathing deeply might have different causes like pulmonar, cardiac ect.Asthma is a strong cause of dispnea.Lungs might be clear but the person might experience bronchial spasm that lead to asthmatic crises.Another reason might be cardiac.Carsiac insuficiensy, meaning a reduced heart function might lead to sob.if your wife has replaced a valve, than valvar situation should be ok.Pacemaker is like a battery and it improves heart function, so it doesn't lead to dispnea.Even though, as we are dealing whith a person whith replased valve the situation should be reevaluated.If I was the treating doctor I would recommend some examination like a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and valves, a full blood analyze to exclude anemia,electrolyte imbalances and d-dimer to exclude any pulmonar thromboembolism.After this we can better understand what we are dealling whith and if it is necesary to add another treatment or rise diuretic dosage.Hope I was helpfull.Best regards,Dr.Ervina"},{"Patient":"I have a 20yr migraine history I also have since Aug had a problem with my blood pressure out of control.

The discovery made by your physician raises questions that require more information for a definite answer. Most medical societies recommend that the discovery of a weakened heart muscle be followed by pursuit of the cause of that weakness. With the symptoms that you have felt, some investigation of your heart rhythm may also be warranted.Briefly,1. There is not yet enough information to properly \\"name\\" the problem affecting your heart.2. Further testing with your Cardiologist is needed to gain that information and screen for heart rhythm disturbance.3. The medicines recommended are in lines with current society recommendations. Follow up with your doctor is necessary to ensure that they are working (effects usually measurable beyond about three months)."},{"Patient":"About a year-and-a-half ago, I was hanging-out with a couple of friends and I felt the early onset of a cold coming-on. After a few days, I realized that there was a sort of dryness in my left lung, however I braced for whatever was about to come my way. When the sickness struck full-force I suffered through a cold with additional symptoms, including difficultly breathing, accompanied with a sharp pain in, what I assumed was, my left lung, which manifested every time I took a breath; every breath felt insufficient. I braced myself for a few days and I was able to overcome this ailment, however, subsequently, a few days later, a sharp strain on the left-side of my chest gradually became a perceptible bother, as it inhibited me from partaking in certain activities, including sports, running, heavy lifting, etc. About two months after my run-in with the cold, it returned and I experienced the same symptoms once more, yet I was able to overcome it once again. As time went on, I became adapt to this constant strain in my chest, which would be sporadic in its intensity. About six months posterior to the last time I was battling the cold, I decided to schedule an appointment with a Pulmonolgist, which, regrettably, resulted in a six-month ordeal having me running back-and-forth to various health departments for tests, including a: blood test, chest X-Ray, and a Cat Scan. All of the tests returned with normal results, and in the mean time, the doctor instructed me to use an inhaler, which he gave me(Unfortunately, I do not have the name of the inhaler.) to see if it would do any good. He assumed it had something to do with the muscle surrounding the lungs, and, at the same time, he asked that I go for an MRI, however I was unable to do so, because I'm not a person of means; I have no insurance, and this was taking a toll on me financially. Ultimately, I decided to try to live with this burden. During this entire time period, I tried to diagnosticate my ailment, and I narrowed it down to two possible conditions. The first being Lung Pleurisy and the second Fibromyalgia, though there's no way I can confirm this. This past Spring, for a two month period, I suffered through a bout of OCD, which caused me to become an anxious person, avoiding certain activities. I was able to transcend my thoughts, but it helped me realize that I was a psychology fragile person, which I may have inherited from one of my parents. Anywhichway, about a month ago, I began having difficulty breathing accompanied with a faster heartbeat, in sporadic intervals throughout the month. Here's a little information about myself: I am twenty-five years of age, and I have a steady diet. I have had an on-again off-again relationship with cigarettes. I feel lost and I'm extremely worried for my health. I know it is imperative to stay positive, but most times, saner minds do not prevail. Please, any suggestions will be held in the highest regard and would be greatly appreciated. God bless and have a healthy and happy day.","Doctor":"The discomfort that you have described in your chest is called pleuritic chest pain. This simply means pain related to breathing or specific activity. Pleuritic pain is commonly due to irritation of the lining outside the lungs (the pleura) but may also be due to muscular or skeletal irritation. The investigation of pleuritic pain frequently yield little on imaging tests although they are important to be sure that life threatening illnesses are not the source of pain. In my experience, it is not uncommon to find no specific illness even after exhaustive testing. The conclusion here is a diagnosis of pleurisy (fanciful name for I don't really know). However, there is additional information that may be of value (some of which your doctor may already have). The following should be discussed with him/her:1. Past experience with swollen or painful joints.2. Skin rashes3. painful mouth sores4. changes in vision not related to the need for glasses5. blood tests for inflammatory diseasesIn the interim, many patients report pain relief with the use of readily obtainable medications such as Naproxen or Ibuprofen."},{"Patient":"51 yoa, female, 6 240lb been very sick with sinus infection, so went to Dr for care and had to get bloodwork done to refill bloodpressue meds.

As no one has told him.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for using Healthcaremagic. I had gone through all the data you have posted. In a patient of heart attack, the time interval between occurence of symptoms and restoration of blood supply by either thrombolysis or stenting (PTCA) is the most important factor determining the extent of damage heart muscle had undergone. Once heart muscle undergoes death, it forma a scar and it cannot contract along with the surrounding heart muscle which causes ineffective pumping of blood from heart. Ineffective pumping of blood may result in two types of symptoms:breathlessness on exertion, breathless on lying down, sudden episodes of breathlessness at midnight - these occur due to pooling of blood in lungs.abdominal distension, swelling of legs, anorexia, indigestion - these occur due to pooling of blood below level of heart in legs.AHA/ACC divides heart failure into 4 stages, explaining in shortStage A: only risk factors and NO structural heart diseaseStage B: structural heart disease but no symptomsStage C: structural heart disease  with cardiac dysfunction, prior or current symptoms of heart failure, above mentioned symptoms.

Just stopped taking Avapro 300 mg(yesterday was my last dose), and switched to Lisinopril 40mg and Norvasc 10mg today. Meds were taken about 45 minutes ago, I always take them at morning to mid morning. My resting BP is currently 143/94, with heart rate of 81. The past few weeks those stats have been BP-140/80 range, HR-mid to upper 70s.  Should I expect higher readings in the next few days, until the Lisinopril starts to work? Or are there any other negative symptoms I should expect? Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Brief Answer:The lisinopril effect begins within a hour .After 48 hours you will have a steady state of your blood pressure values.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.The lisinopril effect begins within a hour and after aproximately 12.6 hours, half of the drug is eleminated from the blood. Steady state is attained after two daily doses (every 24 hours), which means after 48 hours after drug administration .The amlodipine levels in blood rise gradually to peak 6 to 8h after administration. It is extensively metabolised in the liver and is slowly cleared from the blood for more than 40 hours.So your blood pressure will not be higher than 143/90.After 48 hours you will have a steady state of your blood pressure values.The most common side effect of lisinopril is cough. And the most common side effect of amlodipine is swelling of the ankles or feet.Both can cause : headache, dizziness, depressed mood, drowsiness, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, upset stomach, vomiting or diarrhea, skin symptoms such as mild itching or a rash .Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

With this problem, you are working very hard all night long resulting in fractured and non-restful sleep. The physical work and difficulty breathing may produce a variety of health problems. Proper treatment is essential as is losing the weight that is so often at the root of the problem.

Many heart procedures, even those that are not as invasive as an open surgical procedure may produce psychiatric problems, most commonly depression. In addition, many rhythm control medications may worsen these problems. Open and honest discussion with him, if possible, may offer him the opportunity to seek help (so many patients already realize that something is wrong but are ashamed to admit it).

Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Brief Answer:You should make an ECG and measure the digoxinemia levels in blood, to exclude heart as the origin of this symptoms. You should take a good treatment for esophagitis and gastric ulcer.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.The pain the way you prescribe it, looks more likely to originate from gastrointestinal system than from the heart. Eventhough, being diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and having experienced high heart rates , it would be more accurate to make an ECG, to exclude other pathological changes.The elevated digoxin levels in blood may for it self cause high heart rate and pain also. That's why an important evaluation in your case should be digoxinemia levels in blood.On the other hand , it's needed an adequate treatment of esophagitis and gastric ulcer, which may have caused this sort of pain also. You should receive full dose of PPI drugs such as Omeprasole (Biocid) 40 mg , twice a day , 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner. You should avoid spicy food, frighted food, sparkling , tomato, caffeine.

Is these all symptomes is normal? and when I feed completely recovered please ?","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough cardio thoracic assessment is advised followed by a routine checkup.As you have undergone PTCA and CAG post which you BP is not slowing down you should check your heart thoroughly. As you are having this issues again and again you need to focus on PTCA post rehabilitation plan. As most patients need to focus on their deit and physical activity to improve the Cardiorespiratory retraining and also improve the hemodynamics which can be achieved by exercises.As the process of thickening of the blood is higher you need to perform good physical exercises as to improve the metabolism and also the immune system.Most cases do not get recurrent PTCA or CABG in my clinical practice. We rehabilitate patients post PTCA and CABG and make their physical status to optimum. Also respiratory retraining is needed post PTCA and CABG as to improve the hemodynamics and also the Cardiorespiratory endurance.Now to understand here is the body changes over a period of time which is called the degenerative changes occuring and it is common. Having a healthy and FIT lifestyle is what needed to focus to compensate the requirements of other systems by Having control over the Diet and physical exercise.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"my daughter is 15 today had a spell she got got really tired all of a sudden and then  her heart started beating heavy she said it wasn't fast but just felt like it was beating harder than normal it lasted about 5min she is taking to med. meloxicam 7.5 and suladizine 500mg. she feels normal now .","Doctor":"The good news is that at age 15, an uncomfortable awareness of the heartbeat (palpitation) is rarely life threatening. However, there are several disturbances of rhythm and other problems that can be bothersome. One of the most common sources of the symptoms that you described is single extra heart beats in between normal heart beats. While not dangerous, these can make you feel somewhat odd and tired. They usually respond with no need for treatment. In your daughter's case, the use of meloxicam and sulfadiazine suggest an underlying medical problem and relationship with a physician.

A 28 year old with physical limitation unusual for him. The probability of coronary heart disease is low but not zero and the treadmill provides useful information. It lets you know that his limitation is not severe and risk of near term death is not high affording time for deliberation, elective evaluation and choices in the next step for arriving at a diagnosis.2. The ECG is abnormal in D3 (frontal plane lead III) with exercise but rapidly returns to normal. This is frequently a false positive finding and does not automatically indicate arterial disease.3. The treating physicians are sufficiently suspicious to recommend invasive testing. Oddly, one of the most difficult things to test in medicine but also one of the most important, is the physicians suspicion after interview and examination. Therefore, the recommendation to look for additional information should be followed.The options that should be discussed with the treating doctor (to be sure that he or she has the information needed to make good decisions) are    1. additional physiological testing performed with imaging methods such as nuclear imaging or echocardiography.    2.

I have very low blood pressure...90/60 often...I m undergoing in vitro. Embryos created and transferred, but not implanting for very long. Could my low blood pressure have anything to do with this? should I try to raise it for more circulation in my uterus daily?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, hypotension can cause failed implantation in IVF techniques. For successful implantation, blood riched uterus is needed. And for this adequate blood supply to the uterus is needed. This is possible only with normal systemic blood pressure. With low blood pressure, blood supply of uterus is also low and hence implantation will fail. So better to consult treat hypotension first.

Thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to vasculits. It is a really long time for these symptoms and if it were vasculitis further complications would have occurred. Your symptoms could be related to different causes: 1- Blood pressure drugs adverse effects. Are you taking any calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, nicardipine, etc.)? These class of antihypertensive drugs can cause leg swelling. 2- Venous insufficiency in the lower limbs. A Doppler ultrasound of the leg vessels would help rule in/out this possibility. 3- Polyneuropathy. A nerve conduction study and a neurologist consult would help investigate for this possible disorder. Other causes to consider would be vitamin B12 defficiency, electrolyte imbalances or inflammation. This is why I would recommend performing also some blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, vitamin B12 plasma levels and electrolytes). You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues.

Nothing should be done if he is not having any symptoms of syncope, giddiness, breathlessness, chest pain etc. But better to take appointment of cardiologist and get done 2d echo, stress test (trade mill test) just to confirm that his bradycardia is benign. If all these reports are normal then no need to worry this bradycardia. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your husband.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, your fast heart rate is mostly due to stress and anxiety. You must have attempted suicide by taking overdose of muscle relaxant drugs. This means you are going through a lot of stress, anxiety and depression. All these can cause fast heart beats. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic and antidepressants drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Better not to take do such things in future. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

You have done almost all cardiac tests to rule out heart diseases except Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). This is must for the diagnosis of arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart). Your symptoms like irregular heart beats, low blood pressure, dizziness etc can be due to arrhythmia. So get done Holter monitoring. If this is also normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia. Sometimes, uncontrolled stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms.

However, they did find that I have a Left Bundle Branch Block.  I wore a 30 day halter monitor which revealed PVC's/PAC's, but not much else.  I had the same chest pain last night above my left breast, with shortness of breath, and left arm numbness.  After an hour I went to the ER.  The normal tests were ordered, but the ER doctor also ordered a D-Dimer, and mine was elevated to 0.65.  All other lab tests were WNL. She ordered a CT Angio of my chest which came back normal.  She didn't explain what could cause the elevated D-Dimer, nor whether or not I should be concerned, or what I should do about it.  I am on Metoprolol and Lisinopril for my heart.","Doctor":"Brief Answer:The most serious health problems that may increase D-Dimer levels are excluded and the increase is not significant.Check the D- Dimer level after 1 week.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. I read your question carefully and I think you don't have to be worried because in your case, the most serious health problems that may increase D-Dimer levels are excluded. As your cardiac enzymes and your ECG did not show any new modifications this means that you were not suffering a myocardium infarction. Angio CT of the chest is the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary thromboembolism, which in your case came out to be normal. Also the rise of the D-Dimer level is not so significant to indicate serious diseases.A venous thromboembolism (VTE) is also a cause of high D-Dimer levels , but it can be excluded by the lack of symptoms suggestive for it and low increase of D- Dimer level. (Usually is significant for levels above 1)A more possible cause in your case may be a systemic disease  such as reumatological disease or infection.Eventhough , what to do next ?   If I were your doctor , I should advice you to check D-Dimer level in blood  after 1 week.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

Anxiety or high blood pressure could be the cause of this symptomatology. Have you measured your blood pressure during these episodes?I would also recommend performing a complete blood count for anemia and thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction which can mimic this symptomatology.

In orthostatic hypotension there is a decrease in your blood pressure during standing up. I would recommend measuring your blood pressure in sitting and then in standing up position. A decrease more than 20mm Hg when standing up from sitting position could indicate possible orthostatic intolerance. Another disorder, related to orthstatic intolerance is Postural tachycardia.

I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion.To diagnose ischemic heart disease, angiography still remains the gold standard.As you explain , your father is experiencing chest pains and he allready had a previous heart problems and did surgery.So, having chest pain rises the doubt for ischemic heart disease or having blockage in the coronary artery.The only way to definitely diagnose is coronary angiography.Other examinations like angio ct  are not as specific and they do not make definite diagnose.They just make an orientation if it is a problem or not and the next step will be still angiografy.So, if the pain is typical, if he had done a strees test if it was posible, the only way to make definite diagnose is angiography.Hope I was helpfull.Bestregards,Dr.Ervina."},{"Patient":"I am aged 74 and I take medicines for coronary artery disease for several years and also now for fibromyalgia of left thigh and calf muscles since one month.The drugs for fibromyalgia are neugaba M 75 cap one perday, Evion LC one tab,Diavit plus one capsule, Trental 400 and once 3 days one tablet of Durapain.

No, you should not reduce your medicines without consulting your doctor. In my opinion, you are mostly having drug induced gastritis which is causing this low appetite. You are taking many drugs and they will definitely cause gastritis. So better to take antacid like pantoprazole on empty stomach (before taking all these drugs). Also start appetite stimulant like syrup betonin or syrup activate thrice daily. Also get done liver function test to rule out drug related hepatitis because this can also cause low appetite.

Thank you. The blood pressure of 188/ 123 mmHg is really high and has to be treated.Amlodipine besylate is a good medication in his conditions , but seems it is not enough, for the moment. It takes at least 8 hours to reach the peak level in blood , and 3 -4 days to stabilize the blood pressure. So for this 3-4  days after admission from the hospital, he has to add any other blood pressure medication that acts fast, for example Vasotec (enalapril) 10 mg once a day.

These medicine can cause high levels of SGOT, SGPT and CPK.In the case of your mother , are elevated only SGOT and SGPT but this increase is not significant and may be temporary. In case of an increase of three times higher of the normal range of SGOT and SGPT , then it would be obligatory the interruption of the medication.For now , she must go on with the treatment against high cholesterol levels , and have an other check of SGOT, SGPT after 3 months.She can check the CPK level only in case of myalgia.It is important to understand that she needs this medication not only for the high cholesterol levels, but also for her unstable angina .Hope this was helpful to you .Please feel free to contact me , if you need any other clarifications.Kind regards,Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"I have been having a burning sensation in my face and tingling teeth and gums for 5 days.  My blood pressure was normal until yesterday when it went up to 175/89 with a 90 pulse rate.  I went to my doctor and the blood pressure was down to 151 over 69 when his nurse took it and then down to 140 over 79 when the doctor took it.  I stop taking a new multi vitamin ( take a variety of other vitatmins including fish oil, calcium and vitamin c, etc), thinking the new multi vitamin (it was a new brand for me) might be causing an allergic reaction.

My face is hot again and tingling is in teeth even though it has been over 24 hours since I took any of the new multi vitamin.  I was a little dizzy this morning when the blood pressure readings were low.  The doctor thinks I am having anxiety issues over this hot face and tingling which he feels is caused by the allergy to the new multi vitamin and the anxiety is causing the spikes in my bp.

The feelings that you are having are extremely common and, fortunately, rarely life threatening. If your doctors have found nothing dangerous, this is good and usually means that your mind is, if not the only cause, influencing these sensations. The mind and heart are closely linked. When one is overworked, the other often speaks out.What works isn't always easy but pays off,1. If you can, address the source of stress.2. Regular physical activity, a walk of even 10 minutes can be a great stress releiver.3. Mindfulness and meditation may help isolate stressors and relieve anxiety.4.

In other words, had my body experienced \\"regular\\" (for lack of another way of putting it) shock, it seems likely that I would have experienced that while still at the plasma center.

Non-compacted myocardium is a very serious disease that can have serious consequences for patients affected by this disease. There are varying degrees of cardiac involvement is necessary and staging the lesions to set the proper treatment.One of the major complications of this disease is the risk of sudden death from severe cardiac arrhythmias, whose treatment is the implantation of a pacemaker which detects and especially can control these malignant arrhythmias known as implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD).Another common complication is the formation of clots within the heart that can break off and clog elsewhere on the body, leading to strokes, heart attacks, mesenteric ischemia, amputation of arms or legs. The treatment for this is the use of anticoagulant medications to prevent the formation of these thrombi.There is also the possibility of loss of contractile function of the heart and subsequent heart failure. When this failure is advanced the most appropriate treatment is heart transplantation.Therefore, there is no simple treatment, a specialized cardiac monitoring is needed, and multidisciplinary care with psychologists, occupational therapists and medical staff are well trained to support the patient and his family.Hope I have answered your question.

He needs diuretics (Lasix or torsemide) to remove excess fluid from the lungs. Oral fluid intake should be less than 1.5 liters in a day.

Also, we need to see the SpO2 levels, PI, ECG, Blood pressure, etc. Well, I am sure there will some kindness by Almighty to help him ease towards either side. Once he is out I think you can ask for a good pulmonary physical therapist so he gets the ease of the problems. In my 12 years of clinical practice, I have seen asthma cases with asthmatic attacks too. but over a period of 6 months of physical therapy most cope well.

After two hour sleeping I woke by the noise in it and decided to take my blood pressure, for my surprise it is 171/110, or 180/108, etc...wat can this be?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you and give my opinion. You should know that we talk about hypertension if we have mean value that exceeds 140 / 90 mmHg.A person might have high value during emotional and physical strees so its mandatory to judge on mean values. Of course your values are pretty high so it is necesary to treat them. Because of this high values you might experience headache,  blurred vision, noise in your ear ect.Hypertension is divided into two groups. Essential hypertension, usaly in older age that is a chronic disease whithout an identified cause and secondary hypertension meaning that is a secondary couse of it.This might be a renal disease,  an endocrine problem or a cardiovascular anomaly. So,  if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some examination like a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls,  a full blood analyze to chek renal function, an abdominal echo and a holter pressure monitoring to evaluate your values during day and night. After all this we can better judge what we are dealling whith and how to treat it. Hope I was helpfull. Best regards, Dr.Ervina."},{"Patient":"I had an exercise stress test the other week due to repeated chest pains, Had MI 18 months ago with 3 stents fitted since the exercise test I have felt much worse. My Cardiologist has booked me in for another angiogram in a couple of weeks but i feel much wors. what should I do.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. As you mention, you are a person diagnosed with ischemic heart disease becouse you previously had an infarction and you had a percutaneous intervention whith stents.When a person whith this diagnosis complains for heart pain than we should exclude the possibility of active ischemic heart disease, meaning that might still be a problem whith coronary arteries, new ones or those treated before. In these cases we recommend a strees test.If your doctor has programed you for another angiography this means that he might have seen something in your stress test that rises his doubt for what I mention before. But, if your chest pains are more intense now in their severity or duration this means that the angiography should be prompt. So, my opinion is that you should reffer this symptoms to your doctor, becouse this changes in the intensity of pains are reasonable to accelerate the angiography. During this time don't make big efforts, take your medicament regulary and just meet your doctor.Hope I was helpfull . Wish you good health.

Also, there are times when i don't eat and then i eat something with alot od salt, i become very disoriented to the point of passing out, seeing white spots, and sweating purfusly that i'm drenched in a matter of a minute.","Doctor":"A diet rich in salt, leads to high plasmatic osmotic pressure, causing liquids to move into the blood vessels, resulting to high blood pressure. Hipertension is clinically perceived as head ache, diziness, weakness and may be sweeting. The last symptom usually appears in case of secondary hypertension, such as hyperthyroidism or feocromocitoma.So the interruption of menartan doesn't cause sweeting, but the high blood presure does."},{"Patient":"My husband has severe artery disease with multiple aneurysms he s inoperable phenomenal slow blood flow he s been experiencing feeling dizzy and turns white his face lips turn blue he nos if he lays down with his knees up in a little while he s better what is it.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.

Since you are having stressful life, your heart palpitations are mostly due to stress and anxiety. But better to rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) first because this can also cause palpitations. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Your palpitations are due to stress and anxiety.

I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, with 20% of heart function, life expectancy is not good. He will have symptoms like shortness of breath, coughing, edema feet etc for remaining life.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in his case. Uncontrolled hypertension can damage blood vessels especially lower limb vessels. And this damaged vessels can cause thombus formation in it. When this thombus occlud the vein, it hampers venous return from that limb. So fluid and blood tend to accumulate in lower limb. So possibility of DVT of left lower limb is more in his case. So get done venous doppler study of left lower limb to confirm DVT. Control of blood pressure is must. If DVT is there then he may need surgical removal of thrombus.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your boyfriend.

Dizziness is still there a little (not as bad) was able to work out, slight HA, BP 145/98. Thanks concerned RN","Doctor":"Hello, As what I understand from the history is that the dizziness and nausea feeling is due to vertigo. As both are inter related and are due HMF. The nausea feeling can be triggered by Chemoreceptor trigger zone due to vertigo. Since you mentioned you Blood pressure was high on a digital monitor at home, was it same way measured digitally at the physician centre? If not than did you follow the correct way of measuring the blood pressure? like taking rest in lying position for 30 minutes before taking the blood pressure? also was this measurement of blood pressure happened in sitting position as soon as you reached the physician centre? which arm was showing signs of high blood Pressure the right or the left? Many things are unanswered in the history. but as you mentioned about your age as in the early 30s and you are a good physical workout kind of person , ignore this high blood pressure every now and then as it may be fluctuating in the time of the day. If we have to confirm you are having a high blood pressure than we need to follow the basic principle and also have to check you on a sphygmomanometer along with Echocardiogram and Electrocardiogram with some blood routine. Also, there should be some clinical symptoms before confirming you are having hypertension. As what I feel is your blood Pressure is not the concern and the concern is the BPPV. You need to meet up a good neuro physiotherapist so an exercise prescription is provided which should help you. In my clinical practice of 12 years I have been coming across such cases of vertigo and that is dealt with proper assessment and examination.

First thing to understand that bleeding doesn't stop of happens when there is low platelet counts. And having such fatally worse situation its better not to try out anything without a proper guidance. Medical professionals are continually doing research and this is just to improve the life style of the humans suffering from any conditions. Herbals, ayurvedic, homoeopathic etc needs to be assessed for something as the research is not that advanced and the number of sample they take is too less. Coming back to our case rather diverting it. First foremost thing, meet your cardiologist. get blood routine checked. next follow the medicines he gives you. followed by this indulge yourself in physical exercise and diet plan. Try to do meditation. In my practice of 12 years I have received complaints of people at Early age having a high blood pressure. But with good prescription, they have recovered well. The prescription includes medicine, diet and exercise. We need to understand that there are a lot of marketing platform to sell their products but we should be even sensible to when to use what. in your case herbal medicine is contraindicated as your body is rejecting by providing by excessive symptoms. Please allow the medical professional to take care of the case for better lifestyle.

You should know that we talk about hypertension if we have mean value that exceeds 140 / 90 mmHg.A person might have high value during emotional and physical strees so its mandatory to judge on mean values. It is normal to have high blood pressure values during physical exercise. But it is not normal to suffer from hypertension and not treat It.Becouse left untreated it slowly modifies the heart and during exertion it goes up even higer and might couse hypertensive crisis whith severel side effects. According to heart rate, you should know that your maximal heart rate is 220 minus your age.So, for a 23 years old we expect a maximal heat rate up to 197 beat for minute.Of course you should not go above this limit.

You are mostly having allergic rhinitis and steroid spray is the best treatment for this. So discuss with your doctor about starting this spray. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. No, acidity and gastritis can not cause hypotension directly. In my opinion, you are mostly having stress and anxiety related symptoms. Stress and anxiety can cause GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) which causes gastritis and acidity.And this stress and anxiety also causes high pulse rate, hypertension. But this is not permanent, similar to your case. When you are stressed, you will have gastritis, acidity, high pulse rate and hypertension, all together. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

It almost feels like I have asthma. Itd been like this for a long time. My heart beating fast just started though. Im just scared for the baby.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) first because arrhythmia can precipitate in pregnancy and gives similar symptoms like palpitations and breathlessness. If not treated promptly, this arrhythmia can harm you as well as your developing baby. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). You may need anti arrhythmia drug, on the basis of these reports. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, your all symptoms are related to stress and anxiety. At your age of 48 years, chances of menopause is more. During this period, females tend to have hormonal changes like low estrogen, progesterone etc.And these hormonal changes can cause mood swings, stress, anxiety etc. And all these can cause rapid heart rate, burping etc. So better to consult gynecologist and get done hormone levels. You may need hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and anxiolytic drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have been having moments lately where my heart feels like it's trying to jump out of my chest all of a sudden that come and go.

Actually heart murmur can cause arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart). Some tachyarrhythmia like supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter etc can cause pounding of heart. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). On the basis of these reports, you will need anti arrhythmia drug. Don't worry, you will be alright with appropriate treatment.. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I lost the paper on how to read my pressure. 2nd reading was 112/89","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to take blood pressure medicine with this blood pressure reading. Normal systolic blood pressure is between 120-140 mmhg. Normal diastolic blood pressure is between 70-90 mmhg. So your both readings are withing normal range. Your diastolic blood pressure is at higher side of normal range. So better to avoid excessive salt intake. Do regular aerobic exercise like running, cycling and swimming. Don't worry, you will be alright. No need fir antihypertensive at present. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your concern. Yes, you are right. Metoprolol can cause skipping of heart beats and bradycardia (low heart rate). Actually, metoprolol is betablocker drug. Along with antihypertensive action, it also decreases conduction, hence it decreases heart rate. When dose is hight, it can cause skipping of beats. So pumping of heart us less and hence blood circulation in the body decreases. So you feel weakness, tiredness etc. So better to consult your doctor and replace metoprolol with another antihypertensive drug like amlodipin or telmisartan. These drugs are not having any effect on conduction of heart. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Is this something I should be woried about?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern . You should not worry about .I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You should know that normal heart beats range between 50-100 beat for minute. If the heart beats over 100  for minute in a regular way than we talk about sinus tachycardia. Sinus tachycardia might happen for different reasons like simple emotional stress,  coffee and energy drinks consumption or pathologys like anemia, hyperthyroidism,  electrolyte imbalances , active infections. A flu or a bacterial infection might be responsible for sinus tachycardia becouse during infection our imunitare sistem is activated and the hole organism needs more supply so the heart goes on tachycardia. Other symtoms like headache, muscle aches and dizziness are normal, they soon will dissappear. So, dont worry, it will pass.Hope I was helpfull. Best regards, Dr.Ervina."},{"Patient":"Hi. I am a thirty year old female. am a thirty year old female. I was diagnosed with primary hypertension at age 25. My average reading at diagnosis was 145/110, with peak reading at 185/120. In the past few years, my blood pressure readings have averaged out to slightly above normal with medications, averaging 125/95. However, yesterday I had a higher reading of 150/105 and earlier tonight my blood pressure spiked to 140/115 but has now dropped back down to 135/90. I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes at age 25 with a fasting blood sugar of 385. Now my blood sugar is in close to normal levels and is treated with Metformin and diet. My A1C is also in normal ranges. I was diagnosed with high cholesterol at age 26. At diagnosis, my total cholesterol was 310. Now it is down to 210 with medication and diet. At diagnois, my LDL cholesterol was 220 and has now dropped to 135 with medications. At diagnosis my HDL cholesterol was 75 and has now risen to 90 with my total cholesterol level being 210 at my last appointment with my cardiologist which was two weeks ago. I have been obese for most of my life and have been unable to lose much weight even with diet and exercise. At my heaviest, I weighed 285 pounds and am now down to 245 pounds which is about 110 pounds overweight. I take Metformin, Benicar, and Vytorin. Last night, I felt naseous and had waves of slight pain and pressure in my chest. I also felt pain in my jawline and left elbow area, which came and went in waves. I was sweating more than usual and was dizzy, but felt better with rest. Today I went about my normal routine, but felt dizzy when I went on my evening walk and now my left arm is numb. With my history, should I go to the ER just be sure this isn t cardiac related?","Doctor":"Hello, With the history what appears to me that your blood pressure is high of course what appears from the readings. but for now I feel its not any heart attack for now. if it was then things would haven been complained as different way. As dizziness and sweating can also occur due to low blood glucose levels. Now coming back to the fluctuations in the readings. If you are taking the measurement from any of the digital machines, it can show errors too. Having it done on a traditional Blood Pressure apparatus called sphygmomanometer is advised. Next your blood pressure was high but which arm that you did not mentioned? left or the right? Considering the higher on the left or the right the medication will be advised. Coming to your diabetic profile. Usually, due to sedentary life style, people tend to develop the early high blood glucose levels. Taking part in a regular physical activity like exercise should help it under control without having taking medications on a longer run. For high cholesterols levels this has to be taken care with diet more and exercises equally. As cholesterol levels are increased in most cases because of the fact that the type of food one eats and doesn't burn out leading to high levels. Avoiding oil completely should definitely give the results in reducing the cholesterol levels. Now your next problem is obesity. Now this is something which definitely needs exercise and diet plan. In my clinical practice of 12 years I have seen cases with obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and high blood glucose levels at early ages but all responded well to diet and exercise well and now all are healthy. Medicine is of course good but on long run not good for body and especially kidneys. So most doctors advice control of the symptoms mentioned above with diet and exercise. I hope that you start the diet and exercise regime sooner so that you get some excellent results. 30 is not the age to visit medical professionals more often. This is the age to enjoy.

You should know that typical heart pains have some characteristics .They usually are retro-sternal pains like squizzing,  tightness or heaviness. They may irradiate to both arms , neck and jaw. They last from 5 to 20 minutes. Pains that last whith seconds that come and go are not typical heart pains.Even though, as you have hereditary history of ischemic heart disease if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some examination like - a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls. - a stress test to exclude ischemic heart disease.

Thanks Margrit Haas","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. You should know that this palpitation has to do with a rhythm issue. There are some electrical impulses that generates from parts of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm.They cause premature heart contaction that its not a normal one. You feel like a skipped beat, anxiety, difficulties in breathing deeply and palpitations.There are different causes of this rhythm issue like simple emotional stress ,coffee and alcohol consumption or pathologys like anemia, hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalances or ischemic heart disease. The fact that you have already done a stress test and it results ok than you have excluded active ischemic heart disease. If I was your treating doctor I will recommend a full blood analyze to exclude anemia, hyperthyroidism and a holter rhythm monitoring to evaluate your rhythm tendency and the frequency of this rhythm issue. Only after this we can better judge what we are dealling  whith and how to treat it. If we find a cause and treat it they might disappear.So don't worry just do what I mention before.

I can understand your concern. No need to worry heart related diseases because you are too young (33 years) and having normal echo report. In my opinion, we should first rule out uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. Your thyroid might be uncontrolled and this high thyroid hormone can cause sympathetic over activity and pain (pricking type) in chest. So better to get done TSH, Free T3 and Free T4. If there is poor control then you may need additional dose of carbimazole or propranolol (beta blocker). Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should get done surgical correction for hole in the heart. You are mostly having either valvular defect or septal defect. This is causing your heart to pump less efficiently. So you are developing heart failure. As a result of this, you are developing edema feet. Your edema feet is responding to diuretic (Lasix).

They started a few months ago after a year of virtually no exercise (continuous bedrest) and eating either fast food or processed meats for every meal every day. I also consumed a medium-sized bottle of ketchup daily, for about a year. One day, during a very large meal my heart began to beat very oddly and was moderately painful. These pains continued and I went to a clinic shortly after. It was dismissed as anxiety. I have been acutely anxious as well, at most times very tense and stressed, usually about nothing, however I never had chest pains. It has been a couple months since then, and the chest pains have continued, and in fact worsened. There are points when my chest is extremely tight and I feel as though I cannot breathe. Also, my anxiety has diminished greatly during this span and I frequently meditate to relax, and stay relaxed throughout the day. Almost any time I am emotional, my chest begins to hurt. Recently, I have had pain in my upper-middle-upper back as well. Palpitations occur multiple times daily. I have begun to dismiss all of these symptoms as anxiety however the thing that I continue to debate is whether my past extreme anxiety, coupled with my consummation of fast food or processed meats (chicken strips) daily for a year as well as a completely sedentary lifestyle have perhaps  caused a problem with my heart. For the past month, I have improved my lifestyle habits drastically and continue to have these pains.Thank you for reading :)","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.

Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query.

No need to worry for major heart diseases because your ecg is normal. You are mostly having stress and anxiety related symptoms. These can cause acute gastritis, palpitations,, belching etc. Your symptoms are improved with antacid pepcid. It is 100% stress and anxiety. Better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

After menopause, there are a lot of hormonal changes like low estrogen, progesterone etc. All these changes can cause similar kind of symptoms.

Another possibility is vitamin B12 and vitamin D3 deficiency. So get done blood levels of these vitamins and if deficiency then you will need supplements. Don't worry, you will be alright.

Performing a fibrogastroscopy may be needed, especially if his situation improves after taking omeprazole. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I actually have started taking it QOD instead of QD for about a week and no problems.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Your all symptoms are mostly due to hypotension caused by over diseases of metoprolol. Metoprolol is good drug for palpitations. But it also decreases the blood pressure. Your blood pressure reading of 98/50 is suggestive of hypotension. And hypotension causes decreased blood supply to brain and other organs. This inturn causes headache, tiredness, cold clammy extremities etc. Your symptoms are improving with decrease in metoprolol dose. So better to decrease the dose of metoprolol after discussing all these with your doctor. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

It feels a lot like my pulse but it is painful. I can sometimes feel the same feelimg in my lower back on each side in the area where my kidneys are. It is not a constant pain, but comes and goes at times. I also take HCTZ for swelling in my ankles. When I take this medicine and I urinate a lot it seems to help with the throbbing pain in my neck. Could this be a result of CHF or fluid retention?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, this type of throbbing pain can be due to congestive heart failure, fluid retention and aortic aneurysm. Your symptoms are improving with diuretics, so possibility of fluid retention and heart failure is more. Hypertension can cause aortic aneurysm. You are having throbbing sensation near kidneys and neck. So we're should also rule out aortic aneurysm. So better to consult doctor and get done 1. Ecg, 2d echo to rule out heart failure. 2. CT abdominal angiography for aortic aneurysm. If all these reports are normal then no need to worry much. Sometimes, stress and anxiety can also cause throbbing type of sensations. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

This is normal thing. The sound you are hearing is from carotid artery. Since carotid artery is major artery, larger amount of blood flows through it. And hence you can hear some sound. No need to worry for this. But if you want to Sure about it then get done bilateral carotid doppler to rule out any thrombosis because this can also cause sound.

Yes, stress can cause rapid heart rate. But since you had WPW (wolf Parkinson while) syndrome in the past, better to rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) for your symptoms.

Your rapid heart rate is mostly due to stress. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution.

First of all, he has a lot of problems with his stomach, and is constantly nauseous, he can t eat because he s sick and when he does eat he gets more sick. It seems basically like his stomach is one huge ulcer. He has tried different medicines like Prilosec but their effectiveness wears off after a few months. But what is really worrying me is the fact that he seems to be having heart problems. He s 24 and not in the best shape, but he gets winded going up stairs. His heart seems to be beating far too quickly. Last night he complained about the fact that his heart would seem to stutter and then start back up again. When he has exercised he seemed fine during the activity but when he stops his heart works overtime. What could possibly be the problem? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, I passed carefully through your question and would explain that his symptoms could be related to anemia, probably caused by the ulcer.

My left arm is still weak, I feel sick and I'm light headed.  Should I be concerned???","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern.I will try to explain and give you my opinion. You should know that typical heart pains have some characteristics. They usually are retro-sternal pains like squizzing, tightness or heaviness. They may irradiate to both arms, neck and jaw and last from 5-20 minutes.It is posible to feel tachycardia, difficulties in breathing deeply, dizziness, nausea.  Pains that last all day long are not typical heart pains. Sometimes stress might give a little high blood pressure and a chest discomfort. Even though, if I was your treating doctor I would recommend some examination to feel shure that every thing is all right. I will recommend an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls, a full blood analyze whith cardiac enzymes and if it is possible a stress test and a holter pressure monitoring. After all this we can be shure for everything. So I will advise you to stay calm, it doesn't seem to be something to worry about but just make an appointment to do what I mention above.

You should not worry about. You should know that right bundle branch block  means a characteristic of your electric heart system. It shows the way how your impulse passes through the heart. This branch block in your case means that the electrical impulse is blocked in one of its way,the right faschicule and the heart contraction and the impuls passes through another way.Usaly in young ages and healthy people this is quite normal,its just a normal electrical variation. It is not a dangerous situation but a normal variety and it has  not any effect on your organism. In some chases it is associated with other heart patology.

You should know that we talk about hypertension if we have mean value that exceeds 140 / 90 mmHg.A person might have high value during emotional and physical strees so its mandatory to judge on mean values.

You should know that this bubbling sensation has to do with a rhythm issue. There are some electrical impulses that generates in some part of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm.They cause a premature heart contaction that its not a normal one. It might be just an extra sistolic beat or a chaotic arythmia. In this cases you might experience palpitation, flattering or bubble sensation, anxiety, difficulties in breathing deeply, dizziness ect.

Can carotid artery disease still occur with normal cholesterol and BP?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, carotid artery d can occur with normal cholesterol and blood pressure. So better to get done carotid doppler first. If it is normal then no need to worry much. In my opinion, your symptoms are mostly due to post menopausal hormonal changes. After the age of 50years, females tend to develop mood swings, easy fatiguability, dizziness etc. So better to consult gynecologist and get done hormone levels to rule out hormonal imbalance.

Yes, sh should definitely consult doctor for this blood pressure reading. Common  causes for hypertension in females are 1. Increasing age (stiffness of arteries) 2.

Since she is having diabetes, lung infection is common and this infection can cause bronchitis and wheezing. So get done chest x ray and PFT (pulmonary function test) for bronchitis.

I can understand your concern. No, this is not thermal shock. In my opinion, you are mostly having stress and exertion induced tachycardia which is giving you feeling of heart clicks.

Also, I hyperventilate when i have panic attacks and was wondering if inhalers help stop my hyperventilating and calm me down ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.

My question is , how long after the proceedure will I have to wait  to have sex with my wife and is the time different if they have to put in a stent ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Heart catheterization is major procedure. If your heart catheterization report is normal, you can do sexual intercourse immediately after procedure without any fear. But if your report is suggestive of blockage and you need Stent placement for this then you need to avoid sex for at least 3-4 weeks. It is also advisable to avoid very vigorous sexual activity after Stent placement. So better to consult discuss all these with your cardiologist if you need Stent placement.

But one thing is sure - it is not life threatening or dangerous and not associated with heart attack. It is mostly seen in children with high stress and fear levels. So better to motivate child, encourage them about this syndrome. Relaxing techniques like deep breathing, slow exhalation, diverting their minds from pain etc are good for this syndrome.

I'll try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You should know that we talk about hypertension if we have mean value that exceeds 140 / 90 mmHg.A person might have high value during emotional and physical strees so its mandatory to judge on mean values. Hypertension is divided into two groups, Essential and secondary hypertension. Essential hypertension is a chronic disease, usauly in older ages.It has not a definite cause and it should be treated all live long. Secondary hypertension is common in younger ages and it means that it has a secondary couse of it.This might be a renal disease,  an endocrine problem or a cardiovascular disease. A hypertensive crisis can give symtoms like headache, blurred vision,  dizziness,  nausea but this usauly happens if blood pressure is over 180 mmHg.So , if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram ,a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls, a full blood analyze and the most important one holter blood pressure monitoring to evaluate your values during day and night.

I will call my dr. on Monday to discuss. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, Swollen ankles can be an adverse effect of trazodone. I suggest you to monitor your blood pressure for somedays .

You should see your doctor after monitoring your blood pressure and he will see if a change in medication is needed. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

But I was also diagnosed with cold induced urticaria today and started taking a CVS brand of zyrtec which left me feeling a little out of it, with senses hightened and muscles tense. I also get a pain in the back right of my head sometimes, almost every day, it doesn t last long but it scares me to think it may be a symptom of an underlying problem for my panick attacks and cold urticaria. Please let me know if I should be worried and what it could be because I don t have the money or insurance to keep visiting doctors and emergency rooms. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello!I carefully passed through your question and would explain that cold induced urticaria is a known disorder in allergic diseases. Regarding your headache, it could be related to tension type headache, which is caused by anxiety and physical stress. Cervical column chronic degenerations can lead to headaches in this region. From the other hand, Zyrtec can cause similar adverse effects (headaches, drowsiness, fatigue). In my opinion you have nothing to worry about. I would recommend performing some additional tests:- complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels- a cervical column X ray studyYou should also try to manage better your anxiety. I would advise you consulting with a specialist of this field. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I have had lap band and recently had a brief blockage.

What is the etiology??","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give my opinion. This shock like sensation has to do with a rhythm issue. There are some electrical impulses that generates from  parts of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm.They cause a premature heart contaction that its not a normal one. This electrical issues might be extra sistolic beats, atrial fibrillation or different arythmia. In this cases a person might experience a palpitation, flattering or shock like sensation.This might happen even in a patient that has a pacemaker. The pacemaker is a safe batery in cases when the heart rhythm falls down.The pacemaker might function very well and the patient might experience arythmia. This rhythm issue might have different causes like simple emotional stress to different pathologys like anemia,  hyperthyroidism, active infections,  ischemic heart disease. So, if it happens once a wile it is nothing to worry about.

You should know that normal heart rate ranges between 50-100 beat for minute.When it exceed 100 beat for minute whith normal sinus rhythm we call it sinus tachycardia.Heart frequencies between 80-90 are qiute normal during normal activity.Someone might experience sinus tachycardia during an emotional stress,  during physical activity and this is also normal.There are also some pathologyes like anemia, hyperthyroidism or active infections that might be responsible for sinus tachycardia. So if you have a heavy cycle you have to chek your blood for posible anemia. If you have a long hystory of cough it might be a possible bronchitis that keeps your heart frequency high.Also it is quite known that people whith mitral prolapse might have occasionally rhythm issues. But to decide what is tha cause and how to deal with it, if I was the treating doctor I will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram,  a full blood analyze to exclude anemia, hyperthyroidism, active infections.Also I will recommend a holter rhythm monitoring to see what happens with your rhythm during day and night.Only after this we can judge if it is necesary to treat anything.Hope I was helpful.Wish you good health.

Many thanks.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No need for surgery at present. You should first take anti angina drugs and see for results. If you are controlled with drugs, no need for surgery. Surgery is needed only in resistant cases where drugs are not giving symptomatic relief. You are taking correct drugs for angina. So continue them. You will mostly improve with drugs only. Along with anti angina drugs you should follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid heavy exertion. Start light exercise. 2. Strict control of blood pressure if you are hypertensive. 3. Strict control of diabetes if you are diabetic. 4. Avoid oil, fat and salt from food. Don't worry, you will be alright with drugs only, surgery is not needed in your case. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. At your age of 14 years, shortness of breath and chest pain are mostly due to lung pathology. But since you are having strong positive family history of heart disease in father and you are eating too much cheese (cholesterol), first get done ecg and 2d echo to rule out heart diseases. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system to rule out lung pathology. Better to avoid excessive cheese in diet and start regular exercise.Dont worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

As you explain your father has a stent on a coronary artery. This means that the artery whith a stenosis now should have normal blod flow.You should know that for the fist 6 months tjere is a risk for stent stnosis, so it is mandatory to take the medication and do regular control after 1,3 and 6 months.Normaly after stent intervention your father should be back to a normal live becouse this is why we intervene to have a normal life whithout chest pains or dispnea.Feeling weak or tired might be related to several thinks like hypotension becouse of medication or his cardiac function, might be related to low heart rate or different patologyes like anemia or thyroid gland problems.About his medication ecospir does not cause such symtoms.Lasix might give electrolyte imbalance that might cause weakness. So, to find the real reason my opinion is that you should monitor his blood pressure and his heart rate during the day.

I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. In our daily practice we meet every day whith patients with history of chest pain. Typical heart chest pain have some characteristics. They are retro-sternal pains like squizzing , tightness or heaviness. They may irradiate to both arms, jaw and last from 5-20 minutes.When we deal with a patient with chest pain,according to his symtoms we have to do some examination like an electrocardiogram,  cardiac enzymes to exclude a heart attack and the most imortant one ernogometry. I think that your father has done this examination. It is an examination that tries to identify problems whith coronary heart disease. It doesn't make a dignosis of how many arteries are occluded,  it only rises a doubt throught electrocardiogram changes. Than the diagnosis is made through coronary angiography. So, if your father has already done an ergometry that results whith problems than the next step is angiography to make the definite diagnosis.If we already have a ergomometey whith problemsit is contraindicated to repeat it.Becouse this means to expose the patient to a potential risc during extreme exertion. So, my opinion is that the ergonometry should not be repeated if it has problems the first time.The maximum you can do is to discuss its results with another cardiologyst for a second opinion if you are not shure.Hope I was helpful.Wish your father good health.

I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. Typical heart chest pain have some characteristics.  They usually are retro-sternal pains like squizzing , tightness or heaviness. They may irradiate to both arms, neck and jaw. They last from 5 to 20 minutes, might be associated with nausea,  vomiting, tachycardia.In my opinion this isolated pains to left side near heart lasting for seconds are not related to heart problems. They might be muscular, sceletic or neurotic pains.The fact that you previously had muscular spasms fortifies my opinion that this might be a muscular problem.So,  you should not worry about. This is nothing serious. Only if this symtoms persist and begin to bother you I would recomend some examination like an electrocardiogram,  a cardiac echo and a strees test. This examinations can reassure you that its nothing serious about the heart.Hope I was helpful.Wish you good health.

Thank you for your answer.","Doctor":"Hello and thank  you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern.You shoud not worry . I'll try to explain you something and give you my opinion. Normal heart  rhythm range between 50-100 beat for minute in normal conditions. If it exceed 100 beat for minute in a normal rhythm we call it sinus tachycardia. Sinus tachycardia might happen in different situations.Simple emotional stress or physical activiti might give fast heart beats and this is quite normal.Excessive coffee consumption, energy drinks might be responsible for sinus tachycardia.There are also some pathologyes like anemia,  hyperthyroidism that might be the cause.So, in my opinion a frequency between 80 to 103 it is nothingbto worry about. The fact that you have already done an electrocardiogram and it is normal its a very good thing. But, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some other examination like a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and valves,  a full blood analyze to exclude anemia , hyperthyroidism and of course a holter rhythm monitoring to see your frequency during day and night.After this we can better judge how to menage this frequencyes.

I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. I think that in your mothers case we have to do with a rhythm issue. There are some pathologyes of the electrical system of the heart that causes in the same time fast heart beats and heart electrical pauses. This pauses means that the heart electrical impulse fails for some seconds to generate a normal impulse or contraction. This leads to a pause making the person to loose senses or what we call syncope. Sometimes it is difficult to diagnose this patologyes.The patient might experience fast heart beats,treating them whith medication that might aggravate the situation and lead to syncope. So,in my opinion this is not a blood pressure issue but a rhythm one.Of course long heart pauses lead to secondary hypotension. So if I was your treating doctor and we are dealing with a histori of losing senses and fast heart beat I will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram,  a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and valves and a holter rhythm monitoring. Through this process we can better judge what happens to your rhythm and how to menage it.Hope I was helpful.Wish your mother good health.

Surgery is the best option to remove the clots, but since clots are severe surgery can be risky and life threatening.

A 24 hour holter will pick up any such irregularities in the heart rhythm which in most cases can be treated with medicine alone . Also due to such rhythm disturbance and the dilation of the piper chamber of the heart because of mitral leak , causes stasis of blood in the dilated chamber leading to clot formation which can get dislodge in the brain particularly if any connection exists .

For this a BP measurement in both positions needs to be taken. A fall in systolic BP above 20mmHg and diastolic BP fall of more than 10mm Hg is diagnostic of Postural Hypotension.This needs to be checked.If this is normal, a complete ENT evaluation needs to be done. Dysfunction in your ear canals can also cause Dizziness.Therefore you need a thorough evaluation of all the possible causes.Your BP at this stage is borderline and does not warrant you to be on medication. A healthy lifestyle with regular exercising and reduction of salt in your diet can infact being down your BP. Im sure your physician will recommend the same before starting you on any medication."},{"Patient":"My husband had a Cardiac Cath and 2 stents inserted on Thursday.

I would hate to go through with it just to find out they were shadows. I also have slight damage to my kidneys and high blood pressure and I am afraid of complications.","Doctor":"Hello , I am Dr. Mody and I would be addressing your.  In most probability he did a perfusion scan / contrast 3 go and the dark spots in such situation suggest decreased perfusion of blood to that segment of heart . Like he truly mentioned it can be a false positive.  Now , in your case Yes , conventional angiography would be the best choice forward , the other CT angiogram will use dye like conventional angiogram and many cause kidney injury and yet not give us the final version.  The other way would be to start medical management of the same and repeat the scan after 3 months to see if any dynamic increase in those black spots is there  . However as you rightly know , the dye used in angiography can harm the kidney atleast transiently and so reno protective measures needs to be taken before angiography.  Hoping I could help.

There are two types of  hypertension : Essencial hypertension or idiopathic,  meaning that it has not a definite cause and secondary hypertension,  meaning that it's a secondary couse of it.This is found in younger ages and  the cause might be renal , endocrine or any cardiovascular anomaly.Essential hypertension is a chronic disease and it should be treated all live.High blood pressure values can give you headache, blurred vision, dizziness ect.You don't mention your age but as I explained above it is essential to exclude secondary causes if you are young. As you explain you have all ready done blood analyze and they are normal. This is a very good thing. If I was your treating doctor I will recommend even a cardiac echo, an abdominal echo to evaluate renal structure, your urinary chatecolamins and a holter pressure monitoring. All these can give a better view of your mean blood pressure  values and exclude secondary factors.If the pressure holter monitoring finds mean values above 140 / 90 than you shoud treat it with medications.

Will it take awhile to feel normal?I","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern.You shoud not worry about this . I will try to explain you something.When you do the angiography a substance called contrast is injected into you blood, into your coronary artery to make them visible and look for stenosis. This contrast is than eliminated through the kidney and goes outside the organisms whith urinary output.During the first 48 hours after the angiography, as the contrast in still in our body it might couse hypotension,  nausea, vomiting.This is quite normal after the procedure. But usauly after 48 h it is eliminated  from the organism.So, if the angiography was normal, if the renal function after was normal and if 48 h has passed  every think should  come back to normal. The blood pressure values of 115/75 are quite normal, you should not worry about this.This values are our goal.So in my opinion your symtoms are not related whith angiography, it might be just a flu that soon will pass.Or it might just be a little streess as you experience even fast heart beats.If the symptoms persist if I was your treating doctor I will recommend a full blood analyze to find a reason why you feel tired or this nousea.Hope I was helpfull.

Paroxysmal supra ventricular tachycardia has to do with a rhythm issue.It is an electrical impuls that generates from a part of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm.It causes this fast beats and you might experience palpitation,  strong beating, difficulties in breathing deeply and anxiety. There are some factors that might couse arythmia in general.Sometimes they are idiopathic, without an identified cause, it is just a patology of electric system of the heart and the only solution is to takemedication to controll them.As you already know there are some factors that might exacerbate the simptoms like strees, coffee or energy drink consumption.It is mandatory to avoid them.You say that what you are drinking does not contain such thinks but you have to be shure.Sometimes just presence of calcium might rise the heart contractility and cause the arythmia.So if your simptoms are related to the drik you are taking my opinion is to stop it.There are other patologyes like anemia, hyperthyroidism or ischemic heart disease that might be responsible of arythmia.So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram , a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls,  a full blood analyze to exclude anemia , hyperthyroidism and after that if the symtoms persist my opinion is to arrenge or start an anti- arythmic agent to controll the episodes of PSV.Hope I was helpfull.Best regards."},{"Patient":"88 year old male-----top part of heart basically not functioning----causing bottom part of heart to work hard----conjestive heart failure diagnosed few weeks ago----heart has extra beats----------has parkinson's disease------would you recommend any procedure","Doctor":"Hi,Such heart failure patients are treated with diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, there can be a need for digoxin or other medications as well.

Sometimes finding and resolving this problems might resolve the hypertension.So, in your case if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some examinations to diagnose the kind of hypertension. I will recommend an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo, a holter pressure monitoring, a full blood analyze, creatinine, urinary catecholamins and abdominal echo to check renal situation.Only after this examinations we can know what we are dealing with and how to treat and control it.Hope I was helpful.Best regards."},{"Patient":"My father-in-law has been in the hospital recently with irregular heartbeat.

I am a non smoker and do not consume alcohol.What should I do to reduce my Cholestrol levels?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern.I will try to give you some advises according to your problem.You should know that our desiderable values of cholesterol are below 200 mg/dl. Of course you have a high value and you should lower it to prevent side effects in the future.You can do it with two ways, through lifestyle modifications and medical treatment. The first that we try and that's the most important one is the lifestyle modification. This includes:- regular physical activity, like minimally  40 minutes walking every day- changing diet. Avoid white bread, pizzas, fast foods, pies, cookies, sweeties, alcohol.- A high fiber diet rich with vegetables, fruits.Of course the dietetic modification are not allays effective, especially if we deal with hereditary forms of dislypidemias.This means a genetic factor that keeps the cholesterol high despite the diet.In this cases it is mandatory to take medicines that control high cholesterol like statines as you are already doing.I will recommend you to repeat your cholesterol measurement after one month.Hope I was helpful.Best regards."},{"Patient":"I never suffer from blood pressure my doctors would say my pressure is like a babys 110 over 60 etc. Today i take my blood pressure using wrist type digital and gave me a read of 153 over 105 on the left wrist, i did it again on the right side and received a read of 155 over 108... Is this wrist digital reliable?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern.You shoud not worry about this. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion .We talk about hypertension if we have mean value that exceeds 140 / 90 mmHg.A person might have high value during emotional and physical strees so its mandatory to judge on mean values .Electronic wrist measuring apparats are not very realistic. They are strongly related to they're battery life and artifacts of vazal perifery.The ideal way to measure blood pressure is with a cuff positioned 5 cm above  cubital region and with a stethoscope. Anyway, the fact that you have been always with normal blood pressure values does not exclude hypertension.It might just have started.So,  if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram , a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls and a holter pressure monitoring to have a full view of  your values.

I'll try to explain you something and give you my opinion .As you describe your symptoms seems to be related to rhythm issue. There are some electrical impulses that generates from different parts of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm.They cause a premature heart contaction that its not a normal one followed by a pause and than a normal heart contraction.This are what we call extra sistolic beats. You might experience palpitation, flattering or this bubbling sensation, difficulty in breathing deeply. If this happens once in a while you should not worry, its normal. Only if this begins to interfere in your daily life I would recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram , a cardiac echo and a holter rhythm monitoring to have a full view of your rhythm. Also a blood analyze and your thyroid hormones. After this we can better judge how to treat this problem. In mean time avoid caffeine products,  energy drinks becouse they exacerbate this symptoms.

In your case we have to deal whith two different problems but strongly related with each other,hypertension and rhythm issue.We talk about hypertension  if we have mean value that exceeds 140 / 90 mmHg.A person might have high value during emotional and physical strees so its mandatory to judge on mean values .Fast heart beats might be a simple sinus tachycardia.This mean that your heart beats over 100 beat for minute.But it might be another kind of arythmia like  atrial fibrillation.It means that your heart beats in a chaotic way. Hypertension might lead to fast heart beats but also an arythmia might rise blood pressure. So, if I was your treating doctor  I will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram,  a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls, a full blood analyze,  a holter rhythm and pressure monitoring. This are not urgent examination, you can wait until the apointment with your doctor.Only if it happens again to have fast heart beats that last for several minutes and if they seems irregular I would recommend you to go directly to the emergency room.

We talk about hypertension if we have mean value that exceeds 140 / 90 mmHg.A person might have high value during emotional and physical strees so its mandatory to judge on mean values. Hypertension is divided into two groups. Essential hypertension, without any identifiable cause,usaly in older age and secondary hypertension,  meaning that it's a secondary couse of it.This is found in younger ages and the cause might be renal, endocrine or any cardiovascular anomaly.So,in your case we have to evaluate if we do realy have hypertension and than find its cause,becouse you are very young.According to your other symptoms like weight gain,feeling tired they might related to thyroid gland problems. So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram,  a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls. A pressure holter monitoring to check your mean values.A full blood analyze,  your urinary catecholamines,  your thyroid hormones and an abdominal echo to check renal situation. After all this maybe we can find the cause and judge how to treat it.Hole I was helpful.Wish you good health.

You must know that adderal is a stimulant of central nervous system. It affects chemicals in the brain that contributes to hyper reactivity. Through stimulation of nervous system in a secondary way it stimulates the electrical system of the heart.This stimulation might cause fast heart beats over 100 or generate other electrical impulses in parts of the heart different from normal sinus Rhythm.This causes premature heart contaction that we call extra sistolic beats.In this situation you feel your heart like running, making pauses or skipping beats.You might feel anxiety, difficulties in breathing deeply, palpitations or pulsations to your veins oll over.Every kind of stimulation of nervous system might cause this rhythn issue to simple emotional stress, coffee consumption or pathologys like anamia, hyperthyroidism , this kind of medicine that act directly to the system. So,nothing serious is happening to your heart. its a reaction to this stimulation.My opinionsis to discuss this effects whith your doctor and decide together what to do with andf it is  posible or allowed to stop it.Hope I was helpfull.best regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, My fasting blood sugar 158 and I have also hyper tension 150 /110, my doctor has prescribed metformin 500mg ( in extended release form) and ramipril 2mg two times in a day and also Amtas M 50 ( Amlodipine 5mg and metoprolol 50mg) in the morning and Olmezest H 20 ( Olmesartan 20mg) to be taken in night.

The sudden loss of frame of consciousness that you reported is compatible with syncope.There are several causes of syncope is the most common type is the vasovagal syncope, but there are also syncopations of origin for cardiac arrhythmias and neurological diseases.The picture of your brother has several characteristics of vasovagal syncope, but the information you reported is insufficient to confirm the diagnosis. This type of syncope is often triggered by stress such as fear of needles, fear of heights, long periods of standing and in the same position, hot and stuffy places. Usually there is complete loss of consciousness, which can last a few seconds and the patient wakes up slowly, often with nausea and dizziness, and skin pallor and general ma-being. After a few minutes the person is totally normal. This all occurs by stimulation of the autonomic nervous system that causes bradycardia (reduction in frequency of heartbeat and drop in blood pressure).To confirm this diagnosis and away from others is necessary look for a good Cardiologist to make a detailed medical history and discard cardiac and neurological causes. So I use some additional tests beyond echocardiography, holter as 24 hours, exercise testing, in some cases the tilt test and if there are signs of neurological causes, request a cranial tomography and evaluation neurologist.Hope I have answered your question.

I recommend performing some other tests: - a cervico-thoracic column X ray study to exclude possible backbone disease related to radicular pain- inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate). A fibrogastroscopy may be needed if suspicions of possible GERD are raised. Meanwhile, you should try taking ibuprofen for the pain.

I could not imagine where I got this from because it is in a place where I push the shopping cart in the supermarket. There is nothing else in my house that height that I could have been cleaning.  On Friday, I was eating some chips and ice and I must have stabbed my self with either a chip or the ice because I didn\`t feel it. (I think my tongue was somewhat numb from the ice.) I had to stop the bleed with ice.  This morning around 5am I woke up and had a small amount of blood dribbling from my nose.  I thought I must have hit myself while my arm while I was sleeping.  It stopped immediately.  My pressure is generally good 120/80 but now I am wondering if all these bleeds are from high blood pressure??

A resting ECG and cardiac enzymes are necessary to be done to exclude this possibility.- Musculo-skeletal pain. Do your symptoms worsen during breathing or body movements? This would indicate possible musculo-skeletal pain. Inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate) should be done. - A lung disorder. A chest X ray study is needed in this clinical situation. - Anxiety could also mimic all this clinical situation.- Gastro-esophageal reflux. Have you tried taking antiacids during these episodes. The pain relief from antiacids could indicate possible GERD or gastritis. You should discuss with your doctor on the above possibilities and tests. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause of this syptomatology.

If the blood pressure is lowered, the headache will probably get better. I would like to have some more information about your actual antihypertensive therapy. I recommend taking captopril 1 tab under your tongue to lower your blood pressure. If you do not have this drug, you should take another dose of the antihypertensive drug you use usually in this time of the day (double the dose). If high blood pressure persists in these values, I would recommend going to the ER for a careful physical check up, some blood lab tests and the proper therapy. It is necessary consulting with your GP to make further tests to investigate for the possible cause of uncontrolled high blood pressure, as this is not normal considering your young age. I would recommend performing: - thyroid hormone tests for possible thyroid dysfucntion- cortisol and aldosteron plasma levels for possible adrenal gland dysfunction- urinary metanephrines for possible pheochromocytoma- an abdominal ultrasound to examine the blood flow in the renal arteries- further blood lab tests ( kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes, PCR, sedimentation rate).

I am frequently light-headed, blood work is extremely good, but I have had blood in my urine present with 3 doctor visits. I am to have CTs done and a cystoscopy. I do have history of some flank pain, cloudy urine, mild hearing loss and just starting to realize I have had ringing in my ears occasionally over the last couple decades. Could my blood pressure be hypertension? Beginning to worry and become scared.","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concern and I'll try to help you. Hypertension is a very common disease and is related to genetic factors and lifestyle that people have. Hypertension has no cure and patients need to change the lifestyle and often using medications to lower blood pressure throughout life.Your question is a bit confusing and I understand that you have hypertension for at least two decades, is a loss of blood in the urine (hematuria), flank pain, and ringing in the ears and is systolic pressure and very close diastolic. I will address each of these problems.The loss of blood in the urine and flank pain may be related to a disease that leads to the formation of stones in the urinary tract, known as nephrolithiasis. This disease is one of the most common cause of blood in the urine, as well as urinary infections. There are diseases that can cause increased blood pressure and hematuria secondary to kidney inflammation known as nephritis. To identify the cause of the loss of blood in the urine, it is important that your doctor search for the presence of these stones with tomography urinary tract and a cystoscopy, and seek signs of inflammation in the kidneys with specific blood tests.The ringing in the ears is usually related to poorly controlled hypertension or the vestibular system of the inner ear diseases. The vestibular system is one of the responsible for the body balance and when it is compromised can cause dizziness, feeling stuffy ear and tinnitus, being known as Meniere disease.Finally, when the systolic and diastolic are very close, the first thing to do is check if the devices and pressure measurement technique are correct. If these pressures are even close, it is important to search for signs of heart failure with loss of contractility of the heart muscle. This research can be done initially with an echocardiogram.It is important to look for a strict control of blood pressure levels to reduce the risk of complications secondary to poorly controlled hypertension as cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, heart failure, kidney failure and blindness. To achieve this control is necessary to seek healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition, regular exercise, weight loss, sleep apnea control, in addition to the rigorous use of antihypertensive medications.Hope I have answered your question.

At least 2-3 times per day when I am sitting still, I will feel my heart almost expand or enlarge with an extra beat. Best way I can explain it. Almost feels like it hyper expands. It is not painful but does not feel right when it happens. I am 30 years old and have 2 children that are 4 and 2. This has been happening for the past month or so and just wanted to know if it was something I should ne concerned about. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern.You shoud not worry about this . It's nothing serious. Your symptoms are related whith a heart rhythm issue.There are some electrical impulses that generates in a part of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm.This couses a heart contaction that's not a normal one.You feel it it like a premature contraction , a skipped beat and it might give you anxiety, palpitation or difficulty in breathing deeply. There are different causes of this rhythm issue like simple stress , coffee and alcohol consumption. Also pathologys like anamia, hyperthyroidism or ischemic heart disease might be other causes. So,if I was your treating doctor I would say that you have nothing to worry if it happens once a wile.Only if these interfere in your daily life I would recomend you some examination like an electrocardiogram , a cardiac echo , a full blood analyze to exclude anemia, your thyroid hormones and the most important one a holter rhythm monitoring for 24 h to judge the frequency of extra beats.Only after this we can better know if it is necessary to treat them or no.It might be just a stressed period, it will pass.Hope I was helpfull.Best regards."},{"Patient":"Yesterday, I took my prescribed 70mg Vyvanse with my new converted 10mg Lexapro (formerly Prozac 20mg) - then last night without thinking clearly, took another 40mg Vyvanse with 5hour energy to stay awake and work, and immediately my heart was racing.

My house doctor said me that his heart as two block and he will have to heart surgery( pacemaker) . His all blood rep. are well but only the E.C.G report is not well.

If it is so, this means that his heart has a rhythm problem. This rhythm problem is called heart block. Normally the heart beats are generated from the electrical system of the heart. The electrical impulse passes throw the heart and makes the heart to contract and work normally.  There are pathology's of this electrical system, like heart block. This means that the heart fails  to generate  the normal electrical impulse, or the impulse is blocked somewhere and doesn't pass normally throw the heart.This means that the heart makes a pause electrically and this alter her normal mechanical function, her normal contraction. The person having this pathology might lose senses because of this heart pause.The fist way to diagnose this pathology is through the electrocardiogram. It might show this rhythm problem called heart block. The second way is through the patient symptom. As i previously told, the person might experience syncope, loosing sens, dizziness, feeling tired.To verify a rhythm problem sometimes is recommended a holter rhythm for 24 h.So, we can understand if it is a problem through electrocardiogram, holter monitoring or patient symptoms, making this together.If a serious heart bloc is diagnosed, its treatment is heart pacemaker. This is a kind of heart  safe battery, that start to function when the electrical heart system doesn't or makes this kind of 'block'. It is putted through a minimal surgery in the upper part of the thorax, like a pocket under the  skin.So, if the doctors has told you that he needs a pacemaker, they might have diagnosed it through the electrocardiogram. You should not worry, every think goes fine after pacemaker implantation.Hope I was helpful.

This is a very good thing. We are sure that there are no problems like anemia. I will like to remember you to check your thyroid hormones because sometimes they might be responsible of rhythm problems.I will also recommend a holter rhythm monitoring for 48 h to increase the possibility to catch anything. I don't know if you had done it before, but you might repeat it for a long time.If the blood analyze, your cardiac echo and the holter monitoring for 48 h result normal than you have nothing to worry about.

So, if we are dealing with a hypertensive person, its important to measure the blood pressure during this symptoms.As you explain, the symptoms gets worse after eating. So, my opinion is that it must be related whit a gastrointestinal problem.Ischemic heart disease that can lead to heart attach in general has different symptoms.Usually heart problems are manifested with chest pains.

But last night I also had extreme difficulty getting to sleep.  It felt like I had too much caffeine (I've had none).  No jitters, but a fluttering hart and a feeling of being very alert and 'wired.'  Will these symptoms pass?>","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for ussing HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern.I will  try give you my opinion and advise.This flattering sensations on the heart has to do with some rhythm issues. It might be a simple sinusal tachycardia, meaning that your heart is beating over 100 beats for minute. It might be a different kind of arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation, meaning that your rhythm is not normal bur the heart runs in a chaotic way. Or this flattering sensations might be what we call extra-sistolic beats that are some premature heart contractions, during normal heart rhythm. All this rhythm issues gives the feeling like a fluttering sensation, might cause anxiety and insomnia (sleeping problem).There are different factors that might cause this rhythm issues. Simple emotional stress, excessive coffee consumption, alcohol usage. So it is mandatory to avoid them.Also different pathology's like anemia, thyroid gland problems or ischemic heart disease might be other causes. In your case, with angiogram we have excluded significant ischemia.So, i would say that you have nothing to worry if it happen once a wile. This has been a stressed period for you and it may soon pass.But if they continue and interfere in your daily  live i will recommend  a holter rhythm monitoring to better evaluate the kind of this rhythm issues, what they really are.Hope I was helpful.

I have spent the weekend wearing a heart monitor and I am awaiting results but I am just really curious as to what it could be.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain something and give you my opinion.This fluttering sensation has to do with some electrical issues in the heart. The electrical issues might be different. It might be a simple sinus tachycardia meaning that your heart is beating over 100 beat for minute and you feel your heart fluttering.It might be a different arrhythmia, like atrial fibrillation when your heart runs in a chaotic way. I don't think it is your case.Or the fluttering sensation might be what we call an extra-sistolik beat, that is a premature heart contraction during its normal rhythm.This are quite normal in young people with normal hearts.All these rhythm issues might give flutter sensation, chest discomfort or pain, anxiety, difficulties in breathing deeply.The cause might be different from simple emotional stress to excessive coffee consumption, alcohol. It is important to avoid them during this time.The other cause might be pathologyes like anemia, hyperthyroidism, cardiac anomalies.So, if i was your treating doctor i would do the same that your doctors has already done, a rhythm holter monitoring. It will give a fool view of your rhythm tendency and show what are this fluttering sensations.I will also recommend a blood check up and your thyroid hormones.

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will give you my opinion about this.You explain about fast, racing heart beats and feeling dizzy, light head. My opinion as a cardiologist is that this symptoms are related with some heart rhythm issues. It might be possible that the doctors do not find anything, because you are under normal rhythm when you meat the doctors.This rhythm problem might be different.The most important one is atrial fibrillation. This is an arrhythmia when the heart runs in a chaotic way. This is why you might feel your heart running fast. Also it doesn't wok properly, it doesn't feel normally and for this reason the person might experience dizziness, lightheaded. This rhythm issue might happen once a wile, it comes and go, and so it is difficult to catch it.So, my opinion is that you should do some examinations, where the most important one is holter rhythm monitoring for 48 h. Taking the monitor for 48 h rises the possibility to chatch the rhythm problem if it is any. I don't know if you already did it, but you may repeat it again to rise the possibility to catch something.Also, I will recommend a cardiac echo, a blood analyze to exclude anemia or thyroid gland problems that cause this kind of problems sometimes.If all this examinations result normal,than you should not worry.Only after this we might say that every thing is alright, its just stress.Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health.Best regards."},{"Patient":"I frequently have the sensation that my heart is flopping like a fish out of water in my chest.  This happens several times a day.  I recently had a cardiac stress test and wore a holter monitor for 24 hours.  Both tests were negative for cardiac problems.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and understand your concern.My opinion is that this floppy sensation on the heart has to do with some rhythm issues. There are some unusual electrical impulses that generates in different part of the heart and stimulate it. They cause an extra electrical stimulus that we call extra-sistolic beat, that's not a normal one.A person that experiences an extra systolic beat might feel a palpitation,a skipped beat, a sensation like the heart is racing or flopping in the chest. You also might feel difficulties in breathing deeply, anxiety ect.There are different causes that might generate this electrical stimulus of the heart, like simple emotional stress, coffee products, alcohol or different pathology like anemia, thyroid gland problems ect.So, if this flopping sensation happen just once in a while, it is normal, you have nothing to worry about.The fact that you have done the cardiac stress test and the holter monitor and they're normal is a very good thing. If the holter has not registered any significant arrhythmia, than we should not worry.So, if i was your treating doctor i will simply recommend you some blood analyze to exclude any anemia and your thyroid hormones to complete the full check up. If they result normal to, than we have nothing to worry. It might be just any  random extra-sistolik beat that gives you this flopping sensation.You don't mention your age, but if you are able i will recommend some regular physical activity. Sometimes it resolves this rhythm issues and this sensation.Hope I was helpful.

I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion related to your questions.You should know that we talk about hypertension if we have mean values above 140/90 mmHg. We can not judge if we have hypertension with one only value. A person might have high blood pressures after an physical or emotional stress, so it is mandatory to judge on mean values, during all day.Hypertension is divided in two groups: The fist one is  Essential hypertension, without an identifiable cause, usually in older ages. It is a chronic disease that does not have a cure, but it should be treated all live. Once it is diagnosed, it should be treated always with medicine. The other group  is secondary hypertension meaning that it is a second disease causing it, that might be renal, endocrinological or cardiovascular anomaly. Resolving the causing pathology might resolve the hypertension.So, the first thing to do in your case is to know if we really are dealing with hypertension or not. The second one is to know what kind of hypertension is it and than we can judge how to treat it.If I was your treating doctor I will recommend a blood pressure holter monitoring to have a full view of your values, during day and night. During mornings people has bigger activity and for this might have higher blood pressure values. I will recommend a cardiac echo to evaluate heart anatomy. After this a fool blood check up, your urinary chatecolamins and an abdominal echo to see the renal situation.Only after this we can know how to treat your hypertension. If you have high values they should be treated with medications. Physical activity is not good if you have uncontrolled high blood pressure values, because during  activity the values rises even more.It is necessary to start treating it and than start physical activity. If it is essential hypertension you will treat it all live.Hope I was helpful.Wish you good health.Best regards."},{"Patient":"hi doctor, I am a patient of high pressure and would like to have supraydin capsules as I sometimes feeling weakness in my whole body due to having four different tablets as tenormin 100mg and baby aspirin zacor and naorvasc is it ok or not pls answer me  my age is  around 60 years old and weight is 67.8 kgs and height 1.65 cm","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern.I will try to give you my opinion.Supraydin in a multivitamin capsule. It mainly contains vitamin A,E,D. It doesn't have elements that can interfere with your existing blood preassure treatments. But you should take this kind of multivitamins if you are diagnosed to have deficit of this vitamins like vit D,E, deficit in minerals like Magnezium ect.So, the main think to discus in your case is to explore the reason why you feel weak. Taking tree medication like tenormin,norvasc and aspirin is not a reason to feel weak. Only if you have very low blood pressure  below 100/70 mmHg and frequencies under 50 beat for minute the medications might be the reason and you have to lower they're dosage.

A hypertensive patient might have excessive values under physical or emotional stress and this is normal but when we talk about daily mean values they should be under 140/90. Only with this values we can say that we have a good and controlled blood pressure.So, if you say that in a random measurement you find high values like 167/93 it might be reasonable to rise your medicament dosage.In fact the ramipril dose that you take is a very small one.So my opinion as a cardiologist is that you can rise the dosage to 2.5 and even 5 mg because it cant cause any harm. It will lower your blood pressure values to 120/80 and this is our target for you.Of course it is mandatory to know some blood analyses to do so like your creatinin levels, so i advise you to consult it with your cardiologist.Hope I was helpful.Wish you good health.Best regards."},{"Patient":"Hi my mother is diagonised for congestive heart failure.One doc has prescribed   notrocontin 2.6   dytor 10   cilacar TAnother doc has prescribed   cardace 2.5   lasix 20   ecosprin AV 75My mother is diabetic and under insulin.

As you are diagnosed with ischemic heart disease, this means that we should be very careful with hypertension, because high blood pressure values slowly modifies your heart muscle.The ektopic  beats have to do with some electrical issues in the heart. Some electrical impulses that generate in a part of the heart different from normal sinusal rhythm cause a premature heart contraction that you feel like a skipped beat, because its not a normal one.

I will try to explain and give you my opinion.We talk about hypertension if we have mean values that exceeds 140/90 mmHg.Hypertension is divided in two groups: essential or idiopathic hypertension without an identifiable cause and secondary hypertension, usually in young ages, meaning that is a secondary cause of it. This cause might be a renal disease, an endocrine problem, a cardiovascular pathology.Essential hypertension  is a chronic disease. It has not a definite cure, but it should be treated life long.Sometimes a lot of people does not feel anything even having high blood pressure. But sometimes, excessive blood pressure in a hypertensive crises can be manifested with headaches, blurred vision, nausea or vomiting, increased heart beats, chest pains or pressure as you describe.So, first of all i will recommend you to measure your blood pressure.If you have elevated values, meaning mean values above 140/80 mmHg than you have to treat it. If you leave your blood pressure untreated it slowly modify the heart.If I was your treating doctor i will recommend a full cardiac check up with blood test analyze, a electrocardioram, echo-cardiography, a pressure and rhythm holter monitoring. Only after this we can be able to judge to start a medication or not for high blood pressure and heart rates.In mean time avoid excessive salt intake, caffeine products, energy drinks.They rise your blood pressure and your heart frequencies.Hope I was helpful.

Less than half of patients with palpitations suffer from an arrhythmia and not every identified arrhythmia is of clinical or prognostic significance.Short-lived irregularities, such as missed beats, fluttering sensations or extra beats, are often caused by ectopy. It is of value to know the duration and frequency of palpitations to understand the impact on the patient‚Äôs life.Just palpitations without  any other features like blackout episodes, Breathless, etc and that too occuring occasionally are of less clinical significance.Most common causes are Anxiety and depression, Caffeine, Alcohol, Illicit drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy, medication such as beta-agonists, theophyllines, calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmic drugs, antidepressants, antipsychotics.And rarely they also menefist as an underlying cardiac disease, but as mentioned earlier it has to have associated symptoms.If you keep getting these symptoms quite frequently then I would recommend that you get your ECG, Thyroid Function Tests done along with Holter Monitoring/Event Recorder, 2D Echocardiography."},{"Patient":"If a female, 37 year old have hypertension 170/90 and with chest pain when admitted to ER and twitching in the muscles and chilling all over the body, physician has requested heart enzymes test, CPK found high, troponin -ve , but the  patient still have the chest pain even after treatment.

If the beats are fast and regular it might be just a simple sinus tachycardia meaning that your heart rhythm is ok but just beating over 100 for minute.If the rhythm is chaotic it might be a different arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation.The cause of this rhythm issues might be different.Physical or emotional stress, caffeine products might cause increased heart frequency so its mandatory to avoid them.All sow, there are different pathology's like anemia, thyroid gland problems like hyperthyroidism that might be the cause of fast heart beats.

I also sometimes have a pain in the left side of my neck, not severe just a dull ache, that can sometimes be relieved by moving my head. I do notice this more when I've had a stressful day or when I'm worried about something. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and i totally understand your concern. But you should not worry.These skipped beats have to do with some electrical issues in the heart. Some electrical impulses that generate in a part of the heart different from normal sinusal rhythm cause a premature heart contraction that you feel like a skipped beat, because its not a normal one. This extra-sistolik beats generally are followed by a pause till the next normal heart contraction. If this are not frequent, in Young and normal heart, it is nothing to worry about.There are different factors that might cause this skipped beats like emotional stress, excessive coffee consumption , coca-cola or energy drinks, so you have to avoid them.Pathology like anemia or hyperthyroidism might be other causes. The pain in the neck, relived with changing position is not related whith the palpitations. It might be related to muscular or cervical problems.So, if I was your treating doctor i would say that you have nothing to worry for the palpitations if this happen once a wile, its normal. As you say, they might just be related to stress. But if they begin to bother you and interfere in your live we can decide to do some examinations like a blood analyze, your thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echo-cardiography and of course a holter rhythm monitoring to have a full view of your rhythm and the extra-sistolik beat frequencies.

Survival after coronary artery bypass surgery largely depends on the previous state of the patient and the presence or absence of complications during and after surgery. Patients with cardiac function close to normal before surgery, with a good clinical status and who does not suffer complications during surgery or in the postoperative period, the chance of survival reaches 95%.According to what you reported, the patient is not having a good outcome in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery. And the patient seems to be with some organ dysfunction demonstrated by severe swelling and difficulty opening the eyes. Such problems can tert origin for renal dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction and even neurological dysfunction.

However several prospectively performed cohort studies have demonstrated that drinkers of moderate amounts of ethanol are 40% to 70% less likely to manifest coronary artery disease or ischemic stroke when compared with nondrinkers or heavy consumers. Moderate alcohol intake is associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Moderate consumption exerts several beneficial effects, including the following: (1) an increase in the serum concentrations of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I; (2) inhibition of platelet aggregation; (3) a decreased serum fibrinogen concentration; (4) increased antioxidant activity (from the phenolic compounds and flavonoids contained in red wine); (5) anti-inflammatory effects (with lower concentrations of white blood cells and C-reactive protein); and (6) improved fibrinolysis resulting from increased concentrations of endogenous tissue plasminogen activator and a concomitant decrease in endogenous plasminogen activator inhibitor activity.

Simple physical or emotional stress, caffeine products might cause increased heart frequency so its mandatory to avoid them.After eating, our metabolism increases so it might be normal to have slight high frequencies for a while. Or it may be another problem. When you eat, the abdominal distention rises up the diaphragm and in a secondary way might trigger the heart for higher frequencies. A simple gastro-ezofageal reflux or the food that comes back from stomach to esophagus all saw might be the cause.There are different pathology's like anemia, thyroid gland problems like hyperthyroidism that might be the cause of fast heart beats. When you experience a high frequency, it might be normal to experience palpitation, chest discomfort, pressure and breathing difficulties.So, if I was your treating doctor, as you allays connect this symptoms with eating i will recommend a gastroenterologist consult, a fibrous-gastroscopi maybe to exclude any problem like re-flux, diaphragmatic hernia ect.After this I will recommend an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo-cardiography and of course a rhythm holter monitoring for 24 h.

I would like to have some more information on his current medication and on his past medical history and possible risk factors (smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, atrial fibrillation). It is also necessary to know the situation of his cervical arteries (possible atherosklerotic plaques) and brain collateral circulation. With the best preventive therapy (anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents, coupled with statins and a better control of risk factors like hypertension and diabetes) the chances of re-occurrence would be up to 30-50%.

These electrical issues might be different to simple sinus tachycardia, meaning frequency above 100/beat/minute to extra-sistolic beats or other arrhythmia.The extra-sistolic beats generally are followed by a pause till the next normal heart contraction. A sinus tachycardia means regular normal rhythm with high frequency that gives you the sensation like fluttering. If the rhythm is fast and chaotic than we are dealing with an arrhythmia like fibrillation ectIf this fluttering are not frequent, in Young and normal heart, it is nothing to worry about.There are different factors that might cause this fluttering/skipped beats like emotional stress, excessive coffee consumption , coca-cola or energy drinks, so you have to avoid them.

This rises the possibility to catch any problem. You must know that the rhythm monitoring is random, it might happen that you do it but it doesn't happens anything with your rhythm during that day and so we don't catch anything, So it is mandatory to take it as long as possible and repeat it.According to the Carotid result, it doesn't explain the syncope.So my opinion is to continue and do holter rhythm monitoring and if no result, maybe a head CT scan.Hope I was helpful.

Wish you good health.Best regards."},{"Patient":"sir my mom is heart pasint.she her angioplasty  in mey 2011. afer angioplasty  his health is well but 2 month leter his problam in heart beating bcoz she got a shock in his sister death. i have been check up in doctor s. mohenty DM . he got the medenine but . but heart medenine got a side effect. she have been problam Breathing. so what i do sir","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMI really appreciate your concern, if this is cardiac condition and angioplasty being done then patient has to take the medicine, cardiac medicine may not have any serious side effects it has got the negligible side effect that can be tolerated without any trouble, what ever the symptoms your mother having that could be due to some stress, depression, so no need to worry about this, hope this information helps."},{"Patient":"33 yoa, 5'3\\" 170lbs have a history of high cholesterol with hdl being low, ldl being high and some prehypertension evem during pregnancy. am not on medicines. i was red in the face so i checked my bloodpressure 146/88 with a pulse of 97. i had been walking slowly in the store. i was having some neck pain also.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. First of all when we speak for high blood pressure we have to make a fine diagnose of its type.You should know that in medicine we divide hypertension in two types. What we call essential hypertension seen in older ages and secondary hypertension seen in younger ages.In fact, according to your young  age the fundamental thing is to exclude the secondary causes of hypertension.This secondary causes might be: problems with adrenal gland,problems of the artery supplying the kidneys,cardiovascular anomalies that manifest with high blood pressure values in younger ages. We talk about high pressure if we have mean values above 140/80. These can be the cause  of your head or neck pain.So, if I was your treating doctor first of all Id like to be sure that we do have hypertension. So I will recommend you to monitor it or to have a blood pressure holter monitoring for 24 h to have a good graphic of your values during all day. A simple value its not enought. After that of course i will recommend an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo-graphy and a full blood test analyses to check for problems of adrenal gland. According to the results than we can decide for further examinations for renal arteries.In my opinion, as you are very young its essential to exclude the secondary causes of hypertension. If we find the cause than we can treat it and avoid hypertension. Reducing your cholesterol and your weight might improve your blood pressure values.Knowing the cause can help us to know how to treat the hypertension.Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health.Best regards."},{"Patient":"I have been using Pravastatin for 6 weeks. Previously I  tried three other statins and 2 fibrates - nothing suited, several side effects. Pravastatin appeared ok at first but I now have difficulty breathing sometimes, stomach upsets with soreness ,loss of appetite  etc. Should I continue suing - I do need to control trycelytes in my blood.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and I understand your concern but you should not worry.I must explain you that most of people using this medication do not have serious side effects. The main side effects of pravastatin are :muscle problems like pain, weakness, confusion or memory problems in a very small number of people. In this cases you have to talk with your doctor.Difficulties in breathing its not known as a side effect, eccept the cases when we have a serious allergic reaction to this drug that manifests with itching, swelling of face, tongue, throat and difficulties in breathing. But this is not your case. In a very small number pravastatin might give gastrointestinal problems like stomach/abdominal pain, nausea but we have to judge between good effects and side effects.If take minimum 4 weeks for pravastatin to give its full effect.

But while doing workout I have noticed that my pulse rate remain constant @ 168-170 throughout this period.Is it healthy to continue exercise even at this high pulse rate? is it -ve for my heart?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and i understand your concern but you should not worry. I will try to explain you something. When a person exercises we expect his heart rate to rise up to 220 minus his age. So, you are 29years old. We expect that your maximal heart rate  might go up to 220-29, so 191 beat for minute. This is you maximal heart rate, according  to your age. Having high frequencies when you exercise is quite normal.Doing regular exercises will help your heart to slowly adapt and after some times you will have slower heart rates.So, I must tell that you have nothing to worry  about. I encourage you to keep doing regular exercising because it improves your general health.Wish I was helpful.

I'm just wondering if I should be alarmed or worried.","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concern, as though you are young and skinny, so your blood pressure tends to be down.However, it must be confirmed whether the gauging technique is correct, if the device is calibrated properly, if the cuff has the width suitable regarding the circumference of your arm. All these parameters might incur wrong pressure readings down.In case your level of pressure is really low, we will have to check if the symptoms you are related reported low pressure or not. The most common cause of low pressure in young is vasovagal syncope. However, your description of the symptoms are not compatible with this clinical situation. If the low blood pressure is confirmed, I suggest you look for a Cardiologist for further investigation. I hope I have answered your question. In case of doubts, I am available for further questions.

I will tray to explain you some characteristics of a typical heart pain and help you understand  something.In general cases a heart attach, a typical heart pain presents as a central chest pain like tightness or heaviness, squeezing pain. It might irradiate to one or both arms, neck or jaws. It continues 5 to 10 minutes. In a heart attack it last more than 20 minutes, it is a very heard pain and it is associated most time with sweetness, nausea, dyspnoea or breathing difficulties and palpitations.So, if you feel that you are having pain in your arm that last all day long i would say that this is not related to the heart, because something should has happened during this time if it was a heart attack.If this pain reassembles what i explained before, if it exacerbate during an exertion than you should consult a doctor.You didn't mention you age but in my opinion, if you do a simple electrocardiogram to the ER in the moment that you have pain would help us to understand different thinks and of course you would feel much safe.Hope I was helpful.

Heart size depends on over all body habitus. If you are short by height and thin by weight then your body organs (including heart) are also smaller as compare to other individuals. But important thing in heart is functioning, not the size. So no need to worry for smaller sized heart. Your nuclear stress test is normal. This means your heart function is absolutely normal and hence nothing to be done for your smaller sized heart. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I can understand your concern. Possibility of muscular pain is more. It is better and more beneficial to apply ice packs than hot water to relieve muscular pain. So, start ice pack application on painful areas. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Don't worry, she will mostly improve with all these in 5-6 days.

I got my pulse to go down fairly quickly (2 or 3 minutes), but then stood up about ten minutes later and my heart started racing once again. I sat down on my bed and shortly after I fell asleep for about twenty minutes. When I woke up I had a BM (already had one earlier today), wasn't diarrhea but it wasn't solid either and it was a good amount (not sure if it matters, but I've been trying to eat more fiber lately as well). I should also note I've suffered from panic attacks/anxiety/depression this year, but honestly have been feeling like I'm beating all of that as of late (haven't had a panic attack in months and feel more optimistic now than ever). Also have had some bouts of indigestion throughout the year, was burping a lot for awhile, but all of that seemed to go away as of late (I've been trying hard to eat better when I can). I recently had blood work done and everything was perfectly fine. I also drink lots of water regularly. Just wondered if any of this is cause for alarm or if this is normal? And if it is normal, what exactly happened to me? Was my body just not agreeing with what I ate?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. No, it is not related to the food you are taking. Possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more because you are already having panic attacks, anxiety and depression. But better to rule arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) first because pulse rate of 120 is very high. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hour continuous monitoring of ecg). If all these these are normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia or other heart diseases. You should consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need additional anxiolytic and anti depressant drugs. Your indigestion and increased Bowel motions are also due to stress and anxiety. So consult psychiatrist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I can understand your concern. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is tachy arrhythmia. If not controlled, it can cause lethal and life threatening complications. You are now symptomatic since last 1 week. So all these symptoms can be due to AF. And hence you need to treat AF as soon as possible. You are not improving with medical treatment,so you need Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA). Before this you need to get done Electrophysiological study (EP study). So consult cardiologist and discuss all these. RFA is having excellent success rates. Hope I have solved your query.

During menstrual cycle your body loses blood and it can aggravate chronic anemia or low blood pressure. I recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure during those days and perform a complete blood work to exclude possible chronic anemia. An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring may be necessary to examine your heart rhythm trends during the day and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia.

She had an aortic valve replacement back in January, a full hip replacement in July, takes over 17 various meds including seroquel and quetiapine. She wants to be independant however I am becoming more and more concerned about her safety. Numerous times when I have gone to visit her I find pills either on her bed or her bedroom floor, pills I believe to be Rx not OTC. (Sorry, I m off topic...) Tonight s question is about heart rate.... Her heart rate is running at 136. What is a reasonable range for heart rate?","Doctor":"Hi, it is not normal heart frequency of 136 bpm.The normal range of the heart rate is 50 to 100 beats per minute. Above 100 bpm called tachycardia. There are various types of tachycardias including sinus tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation ...To identify which type of tachycardia is occurring with your mother is necessary to make an electrocardiogram during these tachycardia crises. Another way research is with the Holter 24 hours.Another thing we need to do is look for the cause of tachycardia. For example, if a sinus tachycardia, it may be due to psychomotor agitation and how your mother uses neuroleptic medications such as quetiapine, this type of tachycardia to be diagnosed. Another type of tachycardia is atrial fibrillation, which usually affects people over 75 and especially those who have heart disease, such as your mother.I suggest checking your cardiologist to complete the research and define how to treat your mother.Hope I have answered your question.

I exercise regularly (walk approx 4 miles a day (approx 4.0 mph) sometime in our neighborhood with steep hills). Since beginning blood pressure medication, I have been experiencing a lot of light-headedness, dizziness, and weakness. I passed out once, and have been very careful since then. I had a headache last night that kept me awake most of the night, and when I got up, I felt like passing out. For a couple hours, I would exert myself at all, I had to lean over to keep from fainting. It was definitely worse when I would climb stairs. I ate breakfast (a vegetable and fruit smoothy), drank lemon water, and a couple other glasses of water, and after taking a 45-minute nap, I feel better, but I still feel faint - even when walking across the room. This light-headedness began when I started taking blood-pressure medicine, and I have assumed that is why the symptoms have continued.","Doctor":"Hi, there are many causes of dizziness and fatigue after the use of medications for hypertension such as a sudden fall in blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension, symptomatic bradycardia.These causes are related to syncope and pre syncope you reported (fainting and feeling faint). It is important you check your pressure during these crises, write down the values and lead to his cardiologist. Another way to search is to ambulatory blood pressure and even a Holter 24 hours to assess the possibility of bradycardia (slowing the heartbeat).In the investigation of syncope we should do an echocardiogram to rule out diseases such as severe aortic stenosis, exercise stress test and even a tilt test (patient is lying in a special bed that after a few minutes is placed in standing position for 30 minutes or more).As you see, it is not something simple, an experienced cardiologist is necessary to define exactly what is happening to you.

The most common cause of chest pain is the pain arising from the chest wall (muscle, bone, tendon, skin) and they do not usually cause death. However, we should always research the most common causes, but that can bring risk of death, such as a heart attack, pulmonary embolism, dissecting aortic aneurysm ...The heart attack has sudden onset, intense chest pain like a bunning pain, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, profuse sweating... Theese makes everyone go the emergency room immediately. The chest pain pulmonary embolism also has sudden onset, is accompanied by severe breathlessness, faintness and impending death, so the discomfort makes patients immediately seek the emergency room. The dissecting aortic aneurysm is a very serious disease and the chest pain is described as the worst pain a human can feel, looking like a spear into the chest, causing the patients also seek the emergency room.For all that, the description of pain you reported does not appear to have the characteristics of these serious diseases.

What we should do is look for the cause of this problem and propose a targeted treatment.First, it is important to explain what it means myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction, also known as heart attack is when a piece of the heart is destroyed. Once destroyed, that area will no longer contraction function and the rest of the heart will have to work more to address the lack of that piece. When this piece destroyed is bigger, causes larger contraction deficits, including severe heart dysfunction and can cause death of patients.Second, when there is loss of contractile function of the heart loses some of its ability to pump blood forward and liquids become accumulated in various parts of the body, especially the lungs, causing pulmonary edema. This fluid accumulation in the lungs is responsible for the sensation of breathlessness.Then, I believe the heart attack you had, may have destroyed a large area in your heart, leading to a condition known as heart failure.

For 2-3 weeks now he has been having very low blood pressure in the 80s to 90s. The Dr has recently put him on Mododrene. This was to increase his pressure. He started on Monday. Only once did it go to 145. Most around 105. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi, your question is somewhat confusing, but I'll try to help you.We must find the cause of low blood pressure, and check if the pacemaker continues to function properly. The battery of modern pacemakers can last from 5 to 10 years, but older models have batteries that last less time. When the battery is low, you must replace the pacemaker generator. And this could be a cause of low blood pressure.If your husband has severe heart failure, it can also be a cause for low levels of blood pressure. In this situation, we must optimize the specific therapeutic to this problem. Moreover, in this situation, also the use of medications to raise the pressure can be deleterious to the patient.Therefore, before seeking a remedy to increase pressure levels of her husband, it is necessary to exhaust efforts to identify the causes of low pressure. So, we can provide the best therapy for him.Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help you.

We should check if your skin is dry, has flaking, redness ... In addition, we must rule out the existence of contact allergies or even scabies.So, I suggest you see a dermatologist for diagnosis and guide treatment.

I did just return from a trip to the mountains, and last week started taking a diuretic because by blood pressure was a little high, but other than that nothing has changed. Please advise. Lisa B","Doctor":"Hello, Lisa, there are several causes for the loss of balance, the most common is not related to blood pressure levels and is known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a horrible name, but it is not a serious illness. It occurs when some pebbles that we all have within our inner ears leave their usual place. Typically, they send signals to the brain about the position of the head relative to gravity. When they leave the place, they start to send wrong signals of position, coming into conflict with the coming of sight information, generating a loss of balance. And it is common that these stones leave the site after trips to high mountains after ship trips or even plane.Both very high blood pressure levels, as the very low can also cause loss of balance, but is much less common than benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. So it is not safe to take medications to lower blood pressure, such as diuretics, and it may even worsen the symptoms.I suggest you look for a ENT specialist to evaluate and treat possible benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and a cardiologist to determine if you have high blood pressure and need to take medications or can begin treatment only with changes in lifestyle.Hope I have answered your question.

It is normal to have up to 3% of all our beats can be isolated supraventricular extrasystoles, without this being pathological.

Just to give you some information and background to my step-father. He died very suddenly on 07/07/2010 at the age of 53, prior to his passing he had been in good health and didn t show any signs of distress. His medical background was that he had an ICD pacemaker fitted in June 2008 and had his heart ablated. He went into hospital in February 2010 for a minor TURP Prostate operation under aesthetic , prior to performing the surgery the hospital had to adjust his ICD. He went on holiday in June 2010 but prior to flying abroad he went for a check up at the pacemaker clinic to make sure he was ok to travel, he was informed by the clinic that the ICD was running at the wrong setting, stating that the hospital must not have changed it back correctly. He went away on holiday with my mum and enjoyed his 10 day holiday in Egypt without any problems. He arrived back from his holidays on 25/06/2010 and was fit and well until his sudden death two weeks later. When my mum had found him he was lying on the floor, previous to this he had been sitting at the table completing a crossword. There didn t see to be any sign of life, so my mum immediately called the paramedics, on there arrival they said he had already died and produced a print out of his heart reading showing a flat line. We have many unanswered questions and unfortunately at this stage two post-mortems have been carried out and the pathologist has not been able to determine the cause of his death. Can I ask you, is it possible that somebody can get an electric shock from an ICD that would be strong enough to kill somebody, the reason I ask is that he didn‚Äôt die slump at the table and the position he was at on the floor next to the table with one foot caught around the chair leg. He also had what looked like a blue mark on his forehead. When we finally brought his body home to rest there was extensive bruising to the top of his head in a different location to the first mark. Can you think of any other explanations in relation to the ICD why he may have died. I really appreciate your time and feedback.","Doctor":"Hi, After going through your medical query I understand your concern and I would like to tell you that most likely cause of death was fetal cardiac arrhythmia in the setting of non-functioning ICD which wasn't switched on after TURP surgery.

It's effect accelerate your heart beat, raise blood pressure, palpitations and could cause dizziness that you reported. This hormone works only for a few minutes, so if your stress goes away or if you rest for some minutes the epinefrin effects goes away too.Proper technique for blood pressure measurement requires rest for at least 10 to 15 minutes just to reduce the effects of epinephrine. Thus, when you measure your blood pressure outside the doctor's office, follow the routine of sitting and relax for at least 15 minutes before checking, furthermore, make two or three measures following with 5 minute intervals between such measurements.Following this technique, the measurement of your blood pressure will be more precise and not suffer much interference of epinephrine.Hope I have answered your question.

Angina is caused by a significant obstruction in one or more coronary arteries. To confirm these obstructions is necessary to do a coronary catheterization and thus organize a definitive treatment.There are four forms of treatment for patients with blocked coronary arteries:1- Clinical treatment: Made with medications that reduce metabolism and oxygen consumption of the heart muscle, as well as medications that dilate these arteries.2- Coronary Angioplasty: It is usually used for patients with one or two obstructions in arteries and consists of placing a stent device at the site of obstructions by facilitating local blood flow.3- surgery for revascularization of myocardium: Used for patients with unfavorable obstructions angioplasty, with better results in the long term in relation to the placement of stents.4- Cardiac transplantation: It is only indicated in extreme cases, when none of the above treatments are possible or effective, associated with significant worsening of cardiac function. It is the least common treatment used.If the optimal medical treatment is not working well, the ideal is to evaluate the possibility of using one of the other alterative described above.Hope I have answered your question.

The feeling of heartbeat is known as palpitations. In your case, I believe that these palpitations have been caused by the stress caused by the headache and the sleepless nights.Complaints you reported are consistent with chronic sinusitis. This disease causes persistent headache, purulent nasal discharge, coughing and disrupts sleep quality. All of this cause stress.When you're stressed a hormone called epinefrin is released in your blood. It's effect accelerate your heart beat and this is the most likely cause of the palpitations that you reported. These hormone works only for a few minutes, so if your stress goes away, the epinefrin effects goes away too.So, I suggest you look for an otolaryngologist to confirm the diagnosis and begin treatment for chronic sinusitis.Hope I have answered your question.

Your comments and suggestions please PLATELET TO LARGE CELL RATIO(PLCR) 36 % 19.7 - 42.4 PLATELETCRIT(PCT) 0.26 % 0.19 - 0.39 Hi, thanks for using healthcare magic A full blood count provides information on the hemoglobin, the white cell count and its breakdown of the types of white cells, platelet count, the structure or shape of the red blood cells present, the intensity or colour of the red blood cells. Anisopoikilocytosis- this means red blood cells of different shapes and sizes The term normocytic means that the red blood cells are of normal size, microcytic means that they are smaller than normal. Normochromic means that there is a normal concentration of hemoglobin in the red blood cell, hypochromic means that the concentration is decreased. Anemia/low red cell mass (with a low hemoglobin) is classified as (1)normochromic, normocytic anemia ( 2) microcytic hypochromic anemia (3) macrocytic anemia. The most common cause of microcytic hypochromic anemia is iron deficiency, though there are other causes. Futher investigations would normally involve checking serum iron and total iron binding capacity- these would determine if the cause is iron deficiency or otherwise. Iron deficiency is often due to small unnoticable amounts of blood loss and if this is found , there will be other investigations to be done. An elliptocyte is an oval to cigar shaped red blood cell which is seen in some types of anemia such as iron def anemia. They are also called ovalacytes. 15% or less of red blood cells can be shaped as elliptocytes , if above this it is considered abnormal.","Doctor":"Hello,Above mentioned question is about thalasemia minor. Well thalesemia minor manifests as old mild anemia which is  microcytic hypochrmic anemia. The red cell count (RCC) is usually normal or above the normal range in thalasemia trait. It won't cause any change in platelet configurations mild anemia related shortness of breath not responding to iron supplements. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is est done to diagnose this disease and is always done just once in life. Patient should know about his thalasemia trait status to avoid recurrent investigation of his anemia. The other parameters of platelets as mentioned may be discussed with a hematologist to get a further insight in this blood picture.Hope I have answered your query.

Arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supra ventricular tachycardia etc can also cause skipping beats.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, he should continue blood pressure pill with lowest dose. Blood pressure of 162/110 mmhg is high. And it should be treated with antihypertensive drugs. Along with drugs, you need to follow strict salt restriction in diet and exercise. These will also help in control of blood pressure. So he should definitely take antihypertensive drug in minimal dose to achieve controlled blood pressure. Drug for hypertension should be continued for life time but titration should be done on the basis of regular blood pressure monitoring. So despite of Normal blood pressure reading (130/90), I suggest to continue anti hypertensive drug and titrate. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I can understand your concern. Clindamycin is not causing hypertension or breathlessness. So clindamycin is not a cause for your current symptoms.

This in turn cause breathlessness. So blood pressure control is must in your case today relieve the symptoms of breathlessness.
