In food poisoning, there is simultaneous appearance of fever and vomiting. After sometime, the child may develop loose stools.In acute gastroenteritis both loose tools and vomiting are present. Fever usually accompanies both of them.In my opinion, your child needs antibiotic like ofloxacin for a period of 3 days. Child should also be given antiemetic drug like ondansetron.However, since these are prescription medicines, and dosage depends on weight of child. Therefore, a visit to a doctor should be done for starting antibiotics.Child should be given adequate liquid diet, so that the dehydration does not occur.I hope this will help you.

About a month ago he was complaining that the right side of his abdomen was hurting a lot. We took him in for testing where they did blood, urine and xray and said he has pneumonia in the right lung towards the bottom which would explain the abdominal pain. However he was not coughing, no fever and even his pediatrician listened with a stethoscope the next day and said he sounds fine. I insisted on another xray which she did and then she appologized that she was wrong, and yes he has pneumonia. So he took amoxicyllin for 10 days, 6g twice daily. 3 weeks later we scheduled a follow up xray since she says that it takes a while to clear up. We did the xray and there was no change whatsoever. So now she says its probably not pneumonia and need to see a pediatric pulmonologist. The pulmonologist looked at all the xrays and says no pneumonia. He recommended a CT scan, whcich we did. Now he says good news, the CT is good, no cancer or anything however the right outer lung has thickened tissue. He says this could be due to a old infection and in any case he is fine. Now my question is is this thickening dangerous, will it pass and is this ok for a three year old. Also, what type of infection could have gone unnoticed by me earlier. I like this doctor, but I am a mom who is very worried about my son.

The pain caused by ovary and itching in the anus are rather unrelated. However close to the ovary there is a large intestine, and maybe this is what causes the pain. Anus itching can appear with hemorrhoids, rectal fissure or pinworms. Lower left abdominal pain can be caused by urinary tract infection (usually frequent urinating and pain while urinating appears), diverticulitis. As hemorrhoids and diverticulitis ca both appear because of constipation, it should be considered (if you have had constipation). Fresh blood in stool (on the surface of it) is characteristic for hemorrhoids. Pinworms usually give itching in the morning. I suggest you to visit your doctor and rule out mentioned conditions.

Each attack can be so painful that I can hardly walk on my left leg. Strange, as it may seem, the pain comes and go over days/weeks at a times. I am waiting to have L5 S1 fusion but Nuerosurgeon is satisfied this groin pain is unrelated to spinal problems. At the moment, I am barely able to walk for the pain and not sure if I should have it investigated further before spinal surgery in 3 weeks time. Would really appreciate your advice as very desperate for help. Thank you - Carol","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Groin pain can be caused by inguinal hernia, enlarged lymph nodes, spine disc herniation, urinary tract stones. Inguinal hernia can give noticeable lump in the groin which does become bigger when standing and coughing (however there can be no lump at all).  You can perform simple test. Put your hand on the groin where the pain is located and push gently. Try to cough while standing. If any movable lump will be palpated or the pain will aggravate hernia is possible. Enlarged lymph nodes sometimes can give groin pain. You should be able to find some lumps in the groin if enlarged lymph nodes. It is possible that your pain is caused by the spine disease, however such pain usually radiates from the back to the groin and leg. Urinary tract stones usually cause back pain, lower abdominal pain, radiating to the groin, frequent urinating and burning while urinating. I suggest you to have groin ultrasound performed (will rule out hernia and enlarged lymph nodes), urine analysis and abdominal ultrasound. If all this tests will be negative, you might have the spine surgery (as you are scheduled for it) and see if this will help. Hope this will help.

It be reasonable for you to be patient a bit and do a blood pregnancy test, Beta HCG levels which is relatively very accurate.

I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Warm saline gargles will be soothing and will give a lot of relief if the kid can do that.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I know of a 14 year old girl who is frequebtly urinating in school and bed wetting.

The Ct scan shows cysts means the physician might either to an endoscopic procedure, open abdominal surgery in very extreme occasions. Functional cysts might simply require some drugs. management of these conditions requires a good clinical and scan results correlation. I suggest you stay calm for now first til you meet your doctor for  a proper clinical reevaluation. However, simple analgesic or low dose anti inflammatory drugs might help for now. But if you notice any acute severe pain with sensation of seeing stars in the sky on severe  abdominal tenderness, you might need to consult the emergency room. For large cysts could bleed, undergo torsion or get infected at some point i time. taking an appointment with your gynecologist is a good idea in  my humble opinion.

Twenty-four hour SPECT CT images of the abdomen were also obtained. Additional 48 hour delayed SPECT CT images of the chest abdomen and pelvis were obtained on 03/22/13. The low-dose noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation correction and anatomic correlation only. The SPECT CT images were reviewed on the Siemens Leonardo SPECT CT workstation. Findings: There is physiologic uptake of activity by the thyroid gland, liver, gallbladder , spleen , GI and GU tracts. The head, neck and thorax appear unremarkable. Within the abdomen, the liver has a mildly inhomogeneous appearance. This degree of inhomogeneity is probably within normal limits. The spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands appear normal. The appendiceal region appears unremarkable. There is no convincing evidence for a carcinoid tumor primary lesion. The inguinal regions appear unremarkable. The upper and lower extremities appear unremarkable. Impression: 1. The liver has a mildly inhomogeneous appearance. This is probably within normal limits but is nonspecific.

It might have triggered from the stimulus of severe pain. In this the blood pressure becomes low, resulting in decreased supply of blood to the brain leading to fainting and the other symptoms you have experienced. Whenever you feel the symptoms of the vasovagal attack, you should lie down with head end lower than the feet so that blood reaches the brain faster and you will feel relieved from the symptoms. You should consult a Physician and get yourself clinically examined. Also get an ECG and a scan of your head done along with Hemoglobin levels to rule out ither possible causes of your symptoms. Also get your blood pressure and pulse rate monitored. Also get yourself investigated to know the cause of your pain in abdomen and get treatment accordingly. You may take antacid like Omeprazole 20 mg once a day before meals. This will help in relieving pain in abdomen due to increased acidity and gastritis. I hope this is helpful to you.

I will be overwhelm if you answer me.","Doctor":"Hi there...I understand your concern. Green stools is absolutely normal, all babies pass yellow or green stool after every feed as their intestine is short. Stools may be slightly loose while you're breastfeeding, and that is normal too. When you should be concerned:1. She has blood in her stools2. She is peeing less than once in 6 hours3. She has vomiting more than 5 times/day4. She is not gaining weight5.

Yesterday I noticed little red bumps on her legs; 6 little raised papules on one leg and 7 on her other legs. Could the appearance of these bumps be related to any kind of vaccine. She was 5 months old yesterday?","Doctor":"Hi there! I understand your concern. It is unlikely that the vaccination caused the bumps, especially since it has been 12 days. She most likely has a viral exanthematous illness or depending on where you stay, mosquito bites? Press the papules and see, if they blanch and turn pale for a second or two, they are most likely insect bites. Meanwhile if she seems irritable (she is too young to itch), give her cetrizine to ease the irritation.Watch out for:1. More lesions, especially near the face2. High grade fever T>102 F3. Refusal to eat or drink anything  If the above are there, take her to a pediatrician, otherwise the bumps should disappear in a week or so.

I have tried treating with anebesol (?) but he is not keen on this. Is there anything else you can suggest to alleviate the pain? Thanks","Doctor":"hi there, I share your concern. It is difficult having a toddler who has a mouth ulcer. My advise to heal the sore quickly is to apply kenacort ointment thrice a day- works like magic and the sore disappears in a day or two maximum. You can stop the anbesol if he s not keen on it, it doesnt help much anyway. Give him icecream and chilled fruits and liquids. Definitely avoid hot or spicy/salty foods.

With the available described symptoms, there could be possibility of peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcer disease is a combination of multiple pathology including nodular gastritis, follicular gastritis, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer, adenocarcinoma and esophagitis. Aggravation of pain on eating could be due to acute pancreatitis and cholecystitis and peptic ulcer disease. You should also go for complete blood count, blood sugar both fasting and postprandial, serum amylase and lipase, serum electrolytes, ultrasound imaging and endoscopy & biopsy.

She had diarrhoea one week ago and now her stools are soft and pale but no more diarrhoea....Is this just post-upset tummy from last week? Or should I be more concerned re; diet issues and malabsorption of fats..?","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting in healthcare Magic. Pale faeces as you have said, can come from a problem of malabsorption, but can also indicate cholestasis which is a problem in the movement of bile (which gives the colour to faeces) from the liver to the gut. Does she also have very yellow coloured urine, and yellowish eyes or skin? Diet issues do not make faeces pale, so that is not a cause.I would suggest you get a urine examination along with a liver function test with bilirubin, ALT/AST, GGT, albumin, and an ultrasound abdomen.

As per your query your grand daughter have symptoms of  purple discolouration on gum which can be a bruise caused by some injury to the gums and toothbrush bristles or it can be due to some hard food like chips that can cause injury to the gums and rupture of small blood vessels can cause blood accumulation below the soft tissues leading to formations of red to purple bruises. Need not to worry much if it is painless as it will resolve on its own and in case if it spreads or there is pain in the area you should consult a dentist to get ruled out for infection in the gums or teeth.

I completely understand.Would you please clarify a few things for me ?1)How is your son's overall condition , other than the fever? Is he eating better, playing, having some amount of normalcy? or is he cranky, irritable, lethargic?2)Does he have any other symptoms other than fever (cough-dry or productive, cold, headaches, digestive problems, urinary symptoms, swollen glands on neck /under chin/under jaw, does it hurt to swallow)?3)Did his pediatrician see him before changing the antibiotic?Tonsils are the watchmen that protect the body from infection that crosses though the nose or mouth. They take most of the blow and brunt when an infection occurs. This prevents it from entering out body ,thus preventing severe disease in most cases.Tonsillitis in the inflammation of the tonsils caused due to infection by bacteria or viruses.Viral tonsillitis is more common and will resolve itself in normal individuals without treatment (symptomatic treatment may be taken to ease through).This maybe accompanied by a fever, cold, cough running nose, throat ache but may not elicit a systemic (body) response , such as increased Leuckocytes( cells that fight infection).These infections find it easier to attack an individual when they are already weak (from a bacterial infection, for instance).Bacterial tonsillitis (Strep. throat, for instance) is associated with similar symptoms and  also with a systemic response. After two days of antibiotic therapy the bacterial infection and its systemic response begin to regress. This is an opportune moment for the virus to kick in. Unfortunately, antibiotics don't work against virus.This may be the scenario with your son. Certain complications of a bacterial tonsillitis - peritonsillar abscess ( a collection of pus around the tonsils) can cause persistent fever.I recommend seeing his pediatrician ( if you haven't already done so)If there are no complication from the bacterial tonsillitis, and no localizing signs (evidence) of a Urinary tract infection, diarrhoeal disease, meningitis,  a viral infection is most likely.This will settle on its own and the mainstay of treatment is rest, hydration, more rest, proper diet, and more hydration.Fever medications can be given as prescribed. The full course of the antibiotics will need to be completed.If he seems otherwise fine, dont worry too much about the fever. Act to prevent its complications like dehydrationMonitor the quantity and colour of the urine. it should be a light yellow in colour (except for the first urine of the day which may be dark as it is concentrated through the night). check his tongue. it should be moist all the time. Fatigue is expected. Lethargy (inability to even walk on his own), excessive daytime drowsiness or altered sensorium, seizures, low urine output, loss of weight more than 5% of his current body weight, fever that does not reduce with medications should caution you for getting medical help right away (ER)Drug fever is a rare event. Certain antibiotics elicit fever as a response to the antibiotic. In the absence of other serious allergic symptoms, the medicine can be continued if it is  necessary to treat the infection.Once the medicine is stopped, the fever subsides.Children are resilient and will bounce back in no time. They make everything obvious which makes it easy for watchful parents to monitor. The minute they start to feel better, they'll be back to playing, an improvement in eating and longer waking hours can be observed.If something is wrong, they wont eat or want to be held and will cry incessantly.Please follow your instincts.

Fever is usually mild and the number of vesicles depends on the viral load (severity).The diagnosis is made on clinical findings. There are other infections that can present similarly and may need treatment.I urge you to consult his physician/ pediatrician to confirm the diagnosis.If it is chicken pox, it is usually self limiting and may require only symptomatic relief (fever,itch). Hydration, rest and proper diet  will help him be comfortable.Avoid anything that increases body heat (fatty food, animal fat, oily and spicy food, caffeine to name a few.) Cool drinks (fresh juices, tender coconut water and just plain water , soups will suffice), bland foods taken in smaller quantity and more frequently will enable better digestion.Cool baths help relieve the itch (refrain from itching as this could lead to scarring).Rarely, antivirals may be necessary to treat complications (meningitis, severe infection).Monitor him closely, follow his doctor's advice and the above suggestions and he'll be back to his feet in no time.hope this helps.please get back to us if you have further queries.

Children are not always able to control their emotions and sometimes burst out in anger. Anger reactions in some children are quite frequent and troubling to parents and teachers who witness them. The child’ s intense anger may erupt quickly and intensely in reaction to limit setting by adults, to teasing or to seemingly minor criticism by peers or adults. This is a distinct psychological problem in children which is separate from diagnoses such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder. It can co-occur with ADHD or learning disabilities, but may also occur separately from these diagnoses.

They usually occur form 6 months to 6 years of age and usually are self limiting after 6 years of age. They usually do not leave any focal neurological deficits also. Rather than the height of the temperature the rapidity of rise of temperature is more important. In general, antiepileptic therapy, continuous or intermittent, is not recommended for children with 1 or more simple febrile seizures. Parents should be counseled about the relative risks of recurrence of febrile seizures and recurrence of epilepsy, educated on how to handle a seizure acutely, and given emotional support.Viral illness can cause RBC presence in the urine and also high grade fever like this. But most importantly in-between 2 fever episodes the kid will be active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I have a 6 year old girl who the last few days has passed stools which had a whitish film around them.

Menstruation's are very irregular after child birth, especially if you are breastfeeding your baby, but when the mother wean her baby from breastfeeding the menses will have to come back to it's regular cycle. If this doesn't happen it indicates a potential hormonal problem. I suggest you to see your doctor and make some tests for hormonal balances. It is nothing to worry about. You can start some contraceptive pills and your cycle will become normal again."},{"Patient":"Hi I have an 8 week old baby who has been diagnosed with severe reflux and an allergy to milk protein and lactose.

As a Lactation Consultant i would suggest you to relieve the milk from your breast with hand pumping. You can apply ice packs after pumps or some cabbage leaves. Also don't stimulate your breast too often because this will make more milk production.

She strains with bowel movements and appears uncomfortable. Otherwise, no fever or other symptoms. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your query. As a Lactation Consultant I would suggest you to keep the baby more on the breast. Sometimes green stools are from getting more fore-milk than hind-milk.

So if your baby has eaten something green than the poop will come also a little green. If your baby has eaten red beet than his poop will became red. So it might be from this. Or something from mothers diet that passes through breast milk. Don't worry.

Welcome to HCM. Don't worry. A breastfed baby can stay also for a maximum of 10 without any pooing and that is normal because breast-milk is easily absorbed and that is what makes breastfed babies to poo not frequently.

He says he has not had any bathroom problems. He has not been vomiting at all. We have been avoiding milk products for the last week. My son has also been talking of stress lately although he is only 9 years old and has always been a very happy and content, easy-going and well-adjusted boy. He does seem to get concerned about certain schoolwork (but is doing well and has plenty of time to complete his work) and he also sometimes worries about the next day and has a hard time getting to sleep (he loves to read and often reads in bed for 1 or 2 hours). I don t think the stress has anything to do with the stomach pain but just mention it in case it is a factor, because my son has mentioned it to me (very bizarre for a 9 year old to be talking about stress but he has 3 older siblings). What do you think this might be? I was thinking of trying an antacid tomorrow. The other conditions I saw do not look likely as he really has no other symptoms.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I have twins who was born after 31.5 week pregnancy by cesarean section. They stayed inside incubator for one month. They are 3 months old now, the second twin has started stretching her neck backward as result of colic or cramp as I note if there is another reason I don t know. The twins are fed by infant formula (artifitial milk) S-26. the second twins starts stretching her neck backward for 6 hours every day, crying as well, I want to know is this as result of lacking some digestive enzymes or there is another problems, I make her burp after feeding her, I used feeding bottle that prevents gas entering beside anti-colic medicine, but I don t see any results, what should I do?","Doctor":"HI...by what you quote I feel that the infant is having severe form of GER (gastroesophageal reflux). The stiffening  and stretching of neck  backwards is called Sandifer's syndrome and in this they arch their back so much to avoid recurrent reflux and aspiration into the lungs.

Incidentally by blood was diagnised and found screening test hbsag-positive. SGPT-18 Imeediately Doctor advised to check my hbcab and hbeag they were positive and negitive respectively. When my wife(30) and children (9-f, 8-f) were checked for hbsag screening test they all negitive and their LFT are also normal but my child isolated ALP alevated (20 points) . My wife previously did not take any HBV vaccination but my children got vaccination after theri birth during the routine vacination schedule. Are they infected with hbv? what is the mean of hbv mutations? Every one those who have hbsag will suffer from liver cancer and chirrhisis?. Any medicine is available to prevent chirrosis and liver cancer Please explain . What is the clinical research of this medicine? is it better of HBV eradication? Recently I feel pain at right abdomin and the hole right abdomin feel wighty.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome.Thank you for your queries. I have read your questions and understand your concerns. With the information you have provided, if HBsAg screening test is negative, and if your wife’s testing was negative, and the children received their Hepatitis B vaccine series, then the chances of infection are very low, likely negligible. HBV mutations refer to the changes in the genome/genetic composition of  the virus occurring naturally or as a response to antiviral treatment. The mutations usually depend on the viral genotype (that can be tested by a blood test, mostly done if treatment is contemplated).  Not everyone with positive HBsAg will suffer from cancer or cirrhosis, however, up to about 25% of patients with a positive HBsAg will develop these complications. Risk factors for cirrhosis or cancer are very high viral loads in the blood (tested by HBV DNA PCR in the blood) and abnormal liver biopsy findings. So as an Infectious Diseases doctor, whenever I see patients with similar presentations, I would advise close follow up and monitoring of liver tests and Ultrasound of the liver at least annually with your treating doctor and if possible, also an evaluation by a liver specialist (Hepatologist).There is research going on for Hepatitis B medications. All medications are being studied and a few are approved for treatment,however, the indications for treatment would be a high viral load in the blood (>20,000IU/ml, if HBeAg negative), elevated liver enzymes (ALT) for more than 6 months or abnormal findings on liver biopsy. Therefore, most doctors treat patients only if they meet the above mentioned indications. None of the approved medications causes Hepatitis B eradication but all are only suppressive for the virus. If you are having pain and heaviness in your right abdomen, please get an Ultrasound of the liver and liver function tests (ALT, AST, Bilirubin), and I would also suggest seeing your local doctor. I hope to have answered your questions. Please do write to us if you have any further questions and I would be happy to help. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"My 16 year old son has a spot on his foot that the pediatrician said is infentigo. he has been using an ointment that the dr gave us for about about 2 weeks now. the sore (about the size of a quarter) is now turning black under the sore area. What could that be? It seems that it might be getting worse...? What do you think is causing it to turn black? Could it be an emergency?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome.Thank you for your query. I understand that your child was diagnosed to have impetigo. From the information provided, it seems most likely that the child may be developing ecthyma- a bacterial infection that usually causes skin and soft tissues to have a black discoloration. Common signs of worsening include increase in the size of the sore, pain, swelling, fever, not eating well and appearing sick.When seeing patients with similar presentation, I usually advise oral antibiotic treatment, including a \\"fluoroquinolone\\", and an anti MRSA antibiotic, for ecthyma especially if not responding to a topical medicine.  I would suggest seeing your doctor for prescribing antibiotics and evaluation especially, if your child has any of these above mentioned signs of worsening.Another rare cause of turning black would be a reduced blood supply and gangrene formation which would be usually very painful and is an emergency and needs to be evaluated.I hope this answers your question.

I get headsches, can t sleep when having pain nothing helps ease it lay, walk otc med","Doctor":"Hello, kclarkie7114, You mention that you had two surgeries for removal of carcinoid tumors. If these were in the area near appendix and completely removed that would be a cure. However if the carcinoid has spread to other organs such as liver, you can have flushing etc. If the HIDA scan was mainly for the liver it might show how the liver is functioning. It may not be specific for showing recurrent tumor. You may need additional studies to confirm along with blood tests. CT-Scan and biopsy might confirm the carcinoid. If you still have your gallbladder , HIDA-Scan can show if you have acute inflammation of the gallbladder. The location of your pain does suggest, it could be a gallbladder attack.

However enlarged thyroid can happen in thyroid hormone deficiency and it can lead to poor growth. Before analyzing all that, its mandatory for you to confirm objectively if he is actually having poor growth. No point comparing him with his age other kids, every child is unique.

This being said. Images are very important, so take plenty of pictures of the lesions so you can show your doctor. Please don´t get discouraged by unexperienced doctors, dermatology is a somehow subjective matter, so the more images, the better the chance to find the correct diagnosis and the desired definitive treatment.Best of lucks,Dr. Lino, MD"},{"Patient":"my 14 year old daughter was born with gastroschisis and corrected with surgery. No problems until this past year. After periods of severe stomach cramping and pain and nausea, she had her gall bladder removed this past February. The surgeon also freed up her right fallopian tube as well as removed adhesions. The surgery corrected most of the abdominal cramping; however, she still has very painful periods which to date, birth control is not providing much relief. While on her period, she experiences painful unrination. We believed that the new birth control was the cause of the headache she has had for 4 weeks; however, her doctor doesn t think so. Dizziness and shaking hands accompany her headaches. Recent CT Scans didn t show any problem with kidney stones. She has had many tests but still isn t feeling any better. The symptoms and list of tests is long. I am tempted to take her to ER just so they will do another round of tests all at once.","Doctor":"Being born with gastroschisis is a major malformation with lifelong consequence potential. Adhesions are one of the reasons. Other hidden malformations are possible.That is to say, her pains and complains may be long or lifetime, without it meaning incomplete medical management of her troubles.I´m sure you can find a doctor who can view her problem with a fresh perspective considering all factors, not only physical, and review every system for interactions.An ER will not do that.Best of lucks,Dr. Lino, MD"},{"Patient":"I need to know can scoliosis be caused by a road traffic accident or DO YOU HAVE TO BE BORN WITH IT. My daughter now 14, NEVER EVER suffered with her back until the rta in jan 2006.

Eventually in Dec 09 age 12 she had first SPINAL surgery spinal fusion. She is in constant pain and on constant pain killers and stomach tablets as a result to date. She had a second surgery in may 11 as a section of one of the rods detached from her spine went into a muscle so had to be removed.

We had lot of treatments but no improvements in his activity. As Doctors suggested, he is going to the school where low children are getting trained. Our objective is to make him to live normal (in personal and social behavior) in this world. Please advice.","Doctor":"Dear, Welcome to HCMWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Once the child's IQ score falls down below 70, it is intellectual disability. Early identification of children with developmental delays is necessary to begin receiving early intervention services. The mainstay of treatment of MR/ID (mentally retarded / Intellectually retarded) is developing a comprehensive management plan for the condition. The complex rehabilitation plan for the individual requires input from care providers from multiple disciplines, including special educators, language therapists, behavioral therapists, occupational therapists, and community services that provide social support and respite care for families affected by MR/ID. The procedure is tiresome and the best place you can do it is in the special school your child already in.Written, verbal and pictoral forms of communication as well as gestures and demonstrations are helpful. Annual counseling and referral on these issues to community agencies and programs is recommended.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

Any skin tags outside the ear- we call it as pre-auricular skin tag, could be internally associated with certain kidney related problems. So an ultrasound abdomen to look at the kidneys is very important for this twin. Well, there can be a few syndromic associations, wherein the heart kidney and the genital abnormalities can be associated together. Also your description about the genitalia is not very clear, but i get it that there is some kind of genital abnormality. Very unlikely that dying the hair at 14th week could cause any of these changes since the organ formation happen in the first 12 weeks.

Last weekend, i tried to get some latest updates on my blood chemistry and I got elevated results from my Creatinine at 118.1 umol/L and SGPT at 78.10u/L.

Out of this the Creatinine can not be elevated to 118.1 - this may be something else. Anyways, the pain in abdomen can still be due to amoebiasis and you need to take a combination of Metronidazole and Diloxanide Furoate for the cure.

I m considering asking for an X-ray of the full area to see it there is anything untoward?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Abdominal X-ray (if this is what you are thinking about) is good for bowels obstruction and perforation diagnostic. Urinary tract stones are sometimes also visible on it. In other cases it is completely useless. As you have had ovarian cyst before, another one can appear. Especially if the symptoms you have are very similar to those caused by ovarian cyst. If the laparoscopy have been performed, adhesions caused bowels obstruction is possible. However it usually gives nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, abdominal cramping. Lower right abdominal pain can be also caused by urinary tract infection, stones, appendicitis (only if the pain has appeared recently), inguinal hernia. If you are 50 or older, large intestine polyps or cancer should be always ruled out. I suggest you to have some diagnostics. You should start with blood work, CRP and abdominal ultrasound. Gynecologist consult and transvaginal ultrasound should be also done. Hope this will help. Regards."},{"Patient":"HI, my 3 yo son has a hard lump on his right rib that is hard and the size of a pea.

According to the information given by you, sounds like this lump has its origin from the rib. Before commenting further I would also like to know if the swelling has been increasing or is it the same in size? If it is increasing in size, you definitely have to get it checked from a pediatrician. If it is same size over past 3 years, then just keep a check over the size. Most of the times such bony swellings reduce with growing age. Also keep a watch on similar swellings anywhere else in the body.

It is more a group of symptoms which reason can not be found (as present medicine still does not have many answers). So in other words IBS means \\"We do not exactly know what is causing your symptoms\\". Colospa (Mebeverine) is a medicine which affect smooth muscles of gastrointestinal tract relaxing them without impeding bowels movements. Most of the abdominal pains are caused by muscles spasm, so you may find it effective with severe pain what does not mean that you have an IBS. Lower left abdominal pains is very often caused by diverticulitis (especially if you do have chronic constipation). It can also appear due to urinary tract infection, left ovarian cyst or infection, inguinal hernia. If all this diseases has been ruled out (with colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, transvaginal ultrasound, urine analysis and blood work) you may be suffering from IBS. IBS in some part of cases is caused by chronic bacterial infection, therefore Rifaximine treatment can be very helpful. Hope this will help.

Here is the detailed scenario, When my son was one month old baby, suddenly he fell ill and after radiological examination the doctor said that he is having sub dural hemorrhage with intraventricular extension (right brain hemorrhage),during that period he got convulsions. Convulsions were controlled with phenytoin, gardenal and midazolam drip. In the medical report they have mentioned, Final diagnosis: intracranial hemorrhage secondary to late hemorrhagic of new born. Then he recovered, during discharge they suggested to give EPTOIN medicine 2.5ml (morning and night). We continued giving him Eptoin syrup and he grown with normal behavior. We consulted famous pediatric neurologist in India name Dr.Kumaresan MD, DCH, DM, he suggested us to do MRI scanning when my son was 7 months old. In the scanning report they have mentioned, Observation: significant atrophy involving right temporal, parietal, occipital lobes with dilatation of right lateral ventricle He also suggested continuing with Eptoin syrup and visiting him once in 6 months. Then when he was one and half year old we did EEG for him, The report suggested that, Conclusion: EEG is mildly abnormal and the findings suggest frontal parietal dysfunction only. But my kid activity was very normal as like other children. Once again we consulted doctor before coming to Beijing, he suggested the same Eptoin syrup morning 2.5 ml and night 5 ml and folic acid tablet once in three days in night.

When your little girl has a fever, we don't want to turn it off with medication. The main goal is to keep her comfortable so only give the fever reducer if her fever is above 102.  Of course you can give it for other cold symptoms such as body aches and sore muscles. Give her plenty of fluids to keep her hydrated and you can even give her some warm clear liquids such as warm tea or apple juice to soothe her cough. Hopefully your daughter will start to feel better soon!"},{"Patient":"My daugther is 3 yrs old and is suffering from throat infection may be tonsills and little ulcers. Having high fever and cold with nose blockage and difficultly in breathing and sleeping with a sound due to this. I am giving azithral 200 and piriton and maxtra, should i continue this or and this medicine combination is perfect for treatment?","Doctor":"Hey there,Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. First off, why is your daughter having difficulty breathing? Is it due to the nasal congestion or because her tonsils are enlarged? The sound that she makes while sleeping could be due to the stuffy nose. She is having to compensate for air so she's mouth breathing. You are probably also hearing chest congestion if she has a cold. If you hear a high pitch whistle sound called wheezing, then I would recommend a visit back to the doctor to make sure her airway isn't being affected by her swollen tonsils.The medications that you listed are exactly what I would want to see given to her. Strep throat is treated with antibiotics and that is what the azithral is for. Remember, with any antibiotics, it will take 2-3 days before her symptoms start to resolve. The fever, sore throat and ulcers will usually still be present during the first 24-36 hours. The two other medications you listed are to make her comfortable in terms of her nasal congestion and other cold symptoms. I would have to agree with the doctor who prescribed the medications and say that it is a good treatment plan. Hopefully your little one will start to feel better quickly. Have a good day!"},{"Patient":"My 7 year old was using sidewalk chalk on Sunday and then on Monday she woke up with a rash over both legs. It is still there and is very itchy.

She is solid.","Doctor":"Dear, Welcome to HCMWe understand your concernsI went through your details. When children of 5 year old are always hungry, it means they are deprived of some nutrients. You must be able to identify which food the child is always craving for? Is there any association or patterns etc. Identify the food and include that food in everyday meal. Second reason could be, that they are making food association. TV and food, video game and food are great association they make. When they sit there, they ask for food.Some children require more fat, because of the child's physical requirement. Such a child will be thin or skinny. Sometime you fail to provide those foods they enjoy. They eat less and then ask for more. You can easily identify the child's habit and pinpoint the problem.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.  Make sure that you include every minute detail possible.

Plz advice some medicine or ways to gain wt for my daughter......","Doctor":"Hello there,Thank you for your question with HCM! You have to know that some kids have a very fast metabolism due to genetics. It also may be normal for her depending on how tall she is.  However, when you want to increase the weight of your daughter, you need to focus on her diet. Try to increase the amount of protein, choose higher calorie foods and increase milk. Maybe add some chocolate syrup to the milk for calories.Foods that contain a high amount of protein include cheese, meats, nuts, peanut butter, tofu and yogurt. Try to introduce those protein rich foods in her diet and have her eat more frequently.  Make sure she is taking a daily multivitamin so she gets all the nutrients her body needs. There is also specialized drinks for children that are picky eaters or have trouble gaining weight. Pediasure is one of the more popular supplements.Hopefully this advice is helpful. I just want to stress that her weight may be normal for her height. Try going to a website such as the one listed below. It is a good start to determine if she is truly underweight.Good luck and keep me posted!"},{"Patient":"Hello, I m a clinical psychologist and I conducted an eval with a 9 year old client who is diagnosed with ADHD, and currently taking Focalin - I don t have the dosage.

The term tachycardia is used when a newborn's heart rate is over 200. There could be an issue with the ventricles of the heart.

It could be a kidney infection or bladder infection. Blood can also indicate a possible injury to the genitals. It is important to ask questions to your child to find out if anything did occur.

Take care, Dr. Mayank Bhargava"},{"Patient":"My grandson is 3 years old and beginning yesterday afternoon his bowel movements smell like a petroleum based product. His bowel movement this morning was the sane. The consistency is pasty. He has no health issues, intact very healthy. Could this b a little bug going around or is it something more serious. He is eating and drinking. He is drinking only water right now. Would yogurt be helpful or maybe sone pedialite. His diet is really no different than any other day. Could pool water cause this. My pool has a salt generator that produces the chlorine needed for my pool. Sometimes he ingests some of the pool water when swimming.","Doctor":"Hello,Based on the information you have provided, it sounds like it could be from his diet. The main thing you want to monitor is the color of his stool. You said he is not constipated or having diarrhea so that is good. If the odor becomes foul smelling or if the color becomes white, gray, black or contains blood, that's when you would want to think about taking a stool sample in. He is also acting normal and does not have any other symptoms, which again indicates that it has to do with the food."},{"Patient":"My son is 9, he just had a very large bowel movement that was a bright pea to lime green. He has not had any foods with green, blue, red or purple food coloring in the last few weeks, nor has he eaten a great deal of green vegetables - he eats as few as possible in fact. The stool had some small light brown round stools attached to it, but he has never exhibited anything like this before. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi there,Thank you for your question. Stool color can be caused by foods, liquids, mild virus or medication. There is no concern for a green stool. As long as he is not having diarrhea or constipation, there is nothing to worry about.The only color of stool that would be concerning is gray, white, tarry or jet black in color. Hope this helps out and if you have any further questions, we are glad to help."},{"Patient":"My 3 year old little boy has what looks like a hemmorhoid on his anus. He sometimes complains that his bottom hurts, and I was wondering if it was ok to use a topical cream, such as preparation H on it to relieve the pain? His stools are of normal consistency, not hard or small, so I m not sure why it s there. Thanks!","Doctor":"Hello,Sounds like your little guy could have a rectal skin tag. Hemorrhoids are painful, itchy and will tend to bleed. If his stools are normal consistency and you have never noticed him straining, I would lean more towards a skin tag than a hemorrhoid. The skin tag can be uncomfortable and will swell at times. I would apply an ointment to it such as Aquaphor to help ease the irritation. Good luck and please let us know if we can be of any more assistance!"},{"Patient":"I have a daughter (5-years-old) who has been bruising very easily then started getting petechiae all over her body now in her mouth, she has no appetite (she feels full all the time) and is tired, but has been acting like her normal self, could this be a dietary issue?","Doctor":"Hello,That is a very good question. Anytime we see petechiae on a patient, it can mean internal bleeding. The flat dots that you see are broken capillaries that can be due to straining. Now you said her appetite is decreased. Is she sick in any other way? Does she have a cough or fever? Petechiae inside the mouth can be from prolonged coughing or vomiting. Does she take any daily medications? There are a handful of medications that can lead to petechiae and skin bruising. Lastly, when a child comes into the office with skin bruising and petechiae, I would typically do a blood test to check for a fungal, viral or bacterial infections. Those include Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, Meningococcemia, Mononucleosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Scarlet fever and of course Sepsis.  A bunch of those can be ruled out upon physical examination but blood testing would be best. I hope this helps and if you have any other questions, let me know. :-)"},{"Patient":"My three year old has not had a bowel movement in almost two weeks. I have cut out the dairy and sugars. She has had a lot of fruit, fiber, water, and apple juice, nothing has worked. Tonight I gave her two chewable pedia-law tablets. It has been four hours and she still has not shown any signs of having a bowel movement. Is this chronic constipation? Is there anything else I can try before calling my doctor?","Doctor":"Very good question. This seems to be a common issue among toddlers due to their picky diet. My main concern is that it was been 2 weeks since a bowel movement. At this point, you ruled out her diet. The next step is to try a laxative such as OTC Miralax. You can start by giving 1 tablespoon twice daily. It will take about 12 hours to see any results. If hat doesn't work, I would try a glycerin suppository. For kids, they come as liquid glycerin that you insert rectally. if it doesn't produce a stool within an hour, I would have her evaluated in the ER for a possible blockage. There they will have to possibly do a fleet enema or give some very strong medication to break it.Let's cross our fingers and hope that the Miralax will work! Good luck!"},{"Patient":"My 6 month old has a rash around his eyes. He seems to be his normal self, feeding well, smiling, laughing, playing, etc. Not acting out of the ordinary.

What could this rash be and should I take him to the doc to have it looked at right away?","Doctor":"Hello,So right off the bat, has your child had a head injury of some sort? There are times when children can get \\"raccoon eyes\\" after having a pretty severe head injury. It looks more like bruising around the eyes.The second cause could be due to the constant cough. Any straining that happens such as cough or vomiting can break the capillaries that are just under the surface of the skin. So if he has had this cough for a couple of months, the rash could be from the straining. Do you happen to have a picture of the rash?"},{"Patient":"My 6 month old baby (about 17 lbs, 27 inches, was 2 months premature) had an issue last night with what seemed like gagging/choking in his sleep. Which then would make him scream. Once he calmed down and that all stopped he was fine and has been fine since. Is this normal? Is there anything I can do. He has been drooling a lot and I think he is teething. For the most part since he has bee able to roll over on his own he sleeps on his stomach and sometimes his side.","Doctor":"Hello there,A baby who gags in their sleep is more than likely caused by spitting up. Whether a child is breast fed or bottle fed, any can spit up. It could be due to an intolerance of the formula or an intolerance of a food that mom is eating. Some babies will have acid reflux and parents won't even know. They tend to do it when they are lying flat on their back, so sleeping. I would encourage you to look into possible acid reflux and try to notice if you baby is swallowing a lot of makes a face and then swallows. this will usually happen within an hour of eating. There is a medication to treat acid reflux. Along with the medication, I would encourage you to keep your baby in the upright position for 45 minutes after eating or drinking. This will allow the food to digest.Let us know if there is anything else we can help with! Good luck!"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, My daughter is one year 2 months. She does not drink milk at all except breast feeding. I am working so can feed at night. She does not go to anybody so it is very difficult to leave her with someone, she keeps crying all the time, grateful if could suggest any medicine for that, waiting for your reply.","Doctor":"Hello there,I can see how frustrating that is. Unfortunately there is no medication to help with that. If you are wanting to switch her to cows milk,  I would advise you to start feeding her a bottle or sippy cup of the milk. You can still hold her close to your chest for a similar bonding experience. Maybe halfway through, you can pass the bottle to her new babysitter but sit near so she can see you.Now if you are wanting to continue breastfeeding, you can pump your milk and then do the same as above. Just use the bottle with the breast milk. It's more of a mind game with babies and feeding. Again, there is no medication to assist with the changeover. if you have any further questions, don't hesitate to contact us.

Of course is does have to be prescribed by a doctor so I would encourage you to at least call the doctor. Bactroban, Bactrim and Cleocin are the main drugs to treat impetigo.

When a child comes to the office with the red dots, the first thing I ask is if they were recently sick with a cough or vomiting.

You had already consulted an ENT specialist and they said there is nothing pathological or physiological. Snoring is a noise that occurs during sleep when the child is breathing in and there is some blockage of air passing through the back of the mouth.The opening and closing of the air passage causes a vibration of the tissues in the throat. The loudness is affected by how much air is passing through and how fast the throat tissue is vibrating. Children who are three years or older tend to snore during the deeper stages of sleep.The following tips may help you.1. Change the sleep position2. Help open the child's nasal passage3.

I ve been taking both prilosec and penicillin. I ve noticed I ve had stomach aches and have more bowel .movements about 3-5 a day. Right after eating.

I may suffer from stress and anxitey","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. If your doctor thinks this is the peptic ulcer, he should run upper GI endoscopy. Your symptoms can be caused by ulcers indeed however stomach cancer should be always ruled out with such symptoms. Moreover it is necessary to check Helicobacter Pylori infection (during the endoscopy) and if positive, eradication should be prescribed. Without it your symptoms wont go away. Antibiotics do affect natural intestines bacteria and if no probiotic is given along with antibiotic, such symptoms like more frequent bowel movements can be present. That is why I suggest you to start probiotic treatment as well. Hope this will help.

Welcome to HCM. 1st of all its not good to give a baby water until she starts solid foods, because you risk Water Intoxication. At your baby's age only saline drops can be given for relieving her congestion. Just drip 2 drops of saline in every nose opening and try to suck the secretions with a baby nose suction. For night sleeping try elevating her mattress a little bit so the p helm will not disturb her.

Thank you for the query. As you do associate abdominal surgery with symptoms begin, you may be suffering from chronic intestines bacterial infection (if antibiotics were given before or after the surgery), partial bowels obstruction (due to abdominal adhesions). Your symptoms can be also appear regardless the surgery and in such case inflammatory bowels disease, rectal fissure or hemorrhoids(however it seems less possible) should be also considered. I suggest you to visit gastroenterologist, have physical examination and some tests performed. Blood work, abdominal ultrasound, stool tests should be done at first.

Neomycin itself can be a reason for gas production. I would advise :-Stop all the foods and beverages including carbonated drinks that cause increased problems like bloating and gas formation., -Try another antibiotic with Tinidazole-Reduced stress and anxiety as they do cause aerophagia. -ColonoscopyCT scan of the abdomen to rule out any other problems like cancer.-Movements - ambulation in house ."},{"Patient":"I had my appendix out in January I went home the next day surgery was on a wednesday started calling over the next couple days about high fever and chills was given amoxicillin didn t work got worse ended up back into hospital for 10 days and was on 5 of the strongest antibiotics you can get come to find out appendix had torn into in bag trying to take it out we were told surgery was fine at first are these actions normal I still have pain thanks for your time","Doctor":"Hi After cutting appendix,it has to be caught in a forceps to bring it out or put it into a bag.

Sometimes the red spots in the babies stools may be due to something that the baby has eaten.So you do not need to worry. If the blood is bright red this indicates that the blood may come from the intestines. If the blood is brownish this indicates that blood have passed from the stomach. In the second case the baby may have hurt his gum or mouth and the blood is digested. If the blood is bright red this may be a medical condition and i suggest you to visit your pd if the blood persist in the stool after several days. A stool analysis may also give you the right answer you are looking for."},{"Patient":"hi,i have a son 13 months , he just recovered from herpesangina and had fever for a week. he was on amoxycillin and meftal-p for a week..now he is ok but he now wakes up at night 2-3 times and he is teething as well..his night sleep patterns are disturbed..any help would be appreciated...thanks..","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your query. In order to relieve his teething pain you can buy some teething gel and put it to babies gum every night before sleep.

Sometimes excess hair may be due to the hormonal changes that passes through mothers milk, or it may be the Lanugo. Lanugo is the tiny hairs that baby is covered in your womb throughout pregnancy.

Cow's milk is not advised to be given to the babies younger than 1 year because the cow's milk contains more casein than whey. Casein is the solid protein that is harder to digest by the stomach of a baby. While breast milk or formula has a ratio of 60% whey and 40% casein. The proteins of the cow's milk are not as easily digested as human milk. This leads to iron deficiency in babies. But this is not the only reason. The other reason is that babies are born with iron deposits, and at 6 month the baby development is so big that the iron deposits are used. You can give your baby some iron supplement and a multi-vitamin also. Don't worry. It is treatable. You can ask your pd for the dose of the supplementation."},{"Patient":"My 16 day old baby boy has been in and out of the doctor since he was born. He has been vomiting since born.

As a Breastfeeding Specialist i would advise you to feed your baby small amount and very frequently. If the baby shows the symptoms that you have describes above this is because the baby is overfeeding or he has reflux. In both situations you have feed him frequently small amounts of formula or breast milk. With his tiny stomach he only need 50-80 ml formula 8-12 times per day. So be careful and do not overfeed him.

Welcome to HCM. As a Sleep Baby Consultant and also a Certified Breastfeeding Specialist i would say that this has nothing to do with worms in the stomach. The sleep disturbance in babies are very often due to behavioral manners than a medical condition manner. He uses a prop/association to sleep.

Welcome to HCM. As a Certified Breastfeeding Specialist i would suggest the mother to make the baby nurse more time in one breast and to not offer both breast at one feeding. The runny greenish stools are due to the large amount of fore milk that the baby is taking.

For the rashes i would recommend wash the baby after each bowel movement and in addition apply some creams that have high concentrate of zinc because the rash is because of the moisture.

Alcohol consumption can affect the liver could also cause pain in the area of the bile tract, or in the liver itself.Abdominal pain is not easy to diagnose, especially for a lay person, so you should not simply assume that you have a gall bladder problem.

Alcohol  can also cause fluid retention in your hands and feet, also known as peripheral or dependent edema leading to swelling .

Evaluation of the colon is limited die to mild diffuse residual colonic fluid and stool.

You Report is suggestive of mild sigmoid diverticulosis Diverticulosis of the colon affects nearly one-half of individuals older than age 60 years. Fortunately, only 20% of patients with diverticulosis develop symptomatic disease. Asymptomatic diverticular disease discovered on imaging studies or at the time of colonoscopy is best managed by diet alterations. Patients should be instructed to eat a fiber-enriched diet that includes 30 g of fiber each day. Fiber softens the stool and helps prevent constipation. It also can help decrease pressure in the colon and help prevent flare-ups of diverticulitis. High-fiber foods include: Beans and legumes,Bran, whole wheat bread and whole grain cereals such as oatmeal Brown and wild rice,Fruits such as apples, bananas and pears Vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, corn and squash. Drink at least 8-10 cups of fluid daily. Fluid will help soften your stool. Exercise also promotes bowel movement and helps prevent constipation. The incidence of complicated diverticular disease appears to be increased in people who smoke. Therefore avoid smoking. Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease with confirmation of inflammation and infection within the colon should be treated initially with antibiotics and bowel rest.  Patients should remain on a limited diet until their pain resolves. For long-term medical management of uncomplicated diverticular disease, rifaximin (a poorly absorbed broad-spectrum antibiotic), is associated with 30% less frequent recurrent symptoms from uncomplicated diverticular disease. Furthermore, the use of probiotics has been shown to decrease the incidence of recurrent attacks.

For improving this condition I suggest:-Elevating the head of the child's bed.-Keeping the child upright for at least two hours after eating.-Serving several small meals throughout the day, rather than three large meals.-Limiting foods and beverages that seem to worsen your child's reflux.-Encouraging your child to get regular exercise. If the symptoms don't improve i suggest to talk to your pediatrician in order to take reflux medications .

Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hi!!Need not worry.The abdominal pain that you are getting may be from menstrual cramps or it may indicate a problem in a reproductive organ(uterus,ovary etc).As of now try these home remedies to  avoid prescription medications: Apply a heating pad to your lower belly area, below your belly button but never fall asleep with the heating pad on. Do light circular massage with your fingertips around your lower belly area. Drink warm beverages,eat light but frequent meals. Follow a diet rich in complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, but low in salt, sugar, alcohol, and caffeine. Keep your legs raised while lying down, or lie on your side with your knees bent. Practice relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga. Try over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicine, such as ibuprofen. Start taking it the day before your period is expected to start, and continue taking it regularly for the first few days of your period. Try vitamin B6, calcium, and magnesium supplements, especially if your pain is from PMS. Take warm showers or baths. Walk or exercise regularly, including pelvic rocking exercises. Lose weight if you are overweight. Get regular, aerobic exercise. You will be fine if you follow the above recommendations. Even if the tenderness persists after your periods are over ,then its likely that you are suffering form acute appendicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease.It is then suggested that you approach your family physician.

Children at this age are usually averse to pooping not because of lack of training or pain or something. This is because of their developmental period's peculiarity.

I know this do not last for days together. When the urge becomes uncontrollable, the child will evacuate it. This is part of the development and there is nothing to worry about it.

First of all you did not mention the age of your child. At childhood, hyperactivity and fidgety is the basis of ADHD diagnosis. When age progresses, hyperactivity comes down and attention deficit become predominant. Anxiety is also common in childhood which usually is not associated with ADHD.I suggest, instead of asking for medicines here or online, please consult a psychologist in person. Let the psychologist assess the mental health of your child to determine whether the child has ADHD or not. Most of the ADHDs do not need medicines. Household and school training methodologies provide relief from the symptoms. There is no need to worry.

A night terror is a sleep disruption that seems similar to a nightmare, but with a far more dramatic presentation. Though night terrors can be alarming for parents who witness them, they're not usually cause for concern or a sign of a deeper medical issue. occur in children ages 3-12. Night terrors in children are usually due to Stressful life events, Fever or Sleep deprivation. The following tips may help:a. Make the child’s room safe to try to prevent the child from being injured during an episode.b. Eliminate all sources of sleep disturbance.c.

I had some pain behind my belly button this morning that lasted a little over an hour. It was on and off for an hour and ranged from mild pain to sharp stabbing/pulling pain behind the belly button. I ve only experienced this once before, around 6 months ago, a few days after an early miscarriage . The pain then was also on and off but milder and lasted maybe 2 days. I took a pregnancy test again today and it was negative. I m at day 34 of my cycle so I am a few days late. My average cycle is 30 days. If I m not pregnant, what is the cause of the belly button pain? Pre- menstrual cramps feel different. I would appreciate your help. Thanks!","Doctor":"Hello Maris, Thanks for posting on HCM, Abdominal pain around your periods may be due to many causes. Taking pregnancy test in an early stage of pregnancy might come negative (UPT are not 100% effective) and so it is required that you visit your doctor so he can request for a serum beta HCG test and also for an ultrasound to determine the cause (and exclude pregnancy as cause). Other cause of abdominal pain might be pre-menstrual (and since you mentioned that yours feel different during this period, then that should be excluded), pelvic infection, threatened abortion etc. I suggest you get properly investigated for pregnancy before you repeat another miscarriage again. A preventable cause of miscarriage could be detected early enough. Hope this helps and wish you the best"},{"Patient":"well my boyfriend of 4 yrs has been having problems with his stomach and testicles weve been goin to the doctors and we didnt get answers until today when the doctor told us he has rheumatoid arthritis my question is does itaffect the stomach and testicles","Doctor":"Hi...rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a vasculitis or a disorder which will cause inflammation of the blood vessels. It is an autoimmune disease and can affect blood vessels anywhere in the body. Stomach pain is common in this disorder. But testis getting affected is rare.

Thanks.","Doctor":"Dear, Welcome to HCMWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I do not think you have to worry about your child's penis size. Your child is 10 years. In the initial years, it is quite natural that the ratio between penis size and testicle size is non-comparable. Testicles size is always bigger. Upto the age of around 12 years, or till the child reaches fully puberty, the penis size will never be more than 3 inches, at the maximum. But after that, there could be a drastic growth in the length and the penis can grow upto 6 inches. Therefore, as of now, the penis size is reasonable.

By what you say I feel that your kid might be having a very initial stage of viral watery diarrhoea.

These are the Red flag signs which should make you take the kid to a pediatrician or the nearest Emergency Room.

Most likely you do suffer from gallstones which do migrate to the bile ducts and give its obstruction. Obstruction causes jaundice (symptoms of jaundice are itchy skin, pale stools, dark urine, yellowish skin). Alcohol can trigger your symptoms indeed. Moreover, it can happen that some stone will obstruct pancreas duct and will lead to acute pancreatitis. That is why I suggest you to do not wait anymore. You should visit your doctor, have blood work, liver tests (AST,ALT,GGTP,AP), amylase, lipase, urine amylase and abdominal ultrasound. If stones are present, surgery should be performed which should permanently solve your problems. In a meanwhile you should avoid fatty foods, fried foods, spicy foods and alcohol.

There can be number of reasons that a newborn baby can have such incidence.Since you were told that the cause is a heart ailment, I will only concentrate on that, since otherwise its a big list of causesTo make you understand in simple terms, you have to understand that the heart system that works inside the body of a baby inside womb and outside womb is strikingly different. BASICALLY THE PATH AND VALVES INVOLVED IN THE CIRCULATION are altered post birth. There are few heart conditions where in baby cannot do this transition of intra uterine to extra uterine heart cycle. This are usually serious heart problems which are basically structural deformities, and many a times may not be visualized in ante natal  investigations too.Hope this helps youRegards Dr Poonam Sambhaji"},{"Patient":"My baby is 4 days old she is very calm most of the time. she will start screaming at times and do so until I beliueve her throat is soar.

This are all baby blue, which parents have to go through after birth. there are number of reasons why a baby will cry. They are still in adjusting phase to external environment. Most small babies cry for between one hour and three hours each day. Your baby can't do anything for herself and relies on you to provide her with the food, warmthand comfort that she needs. Crying is your baby's way of communicating any or all of thoseneeds and ensuring a response from you.It's sometimes hard to work out what your baby is telling you. But in time you will learn to recognize what your baby needs. And as your baby grows she'll learn other ways of communicating with you. She'll get better at eye contact, making noises and smiling, all of which reduce her need to cry for attention.I usually refer to them as 7 reasons for baby cry1.Hunger2. Wet nappy3. Its too cold or too hot environment4.I need to be held close5, Ineed rest6.I need something to make me feel better7. I need something but i dont know WHAT? Slowly you will learn to answer this questions for your baby.

Since from the scan you apparently do not have gallstones meaning that the origin of your cholecystitis is probably not due to gallstones, your treatment will be purely non-surgical with antibiotics (for infection), low-fat diet (when food tolerated) and pain medications (avoid NSAID) such as paracetamol or better still stronger tramadol or opiate derivatives such as codein and it may be associated to antispasmodic medication such as hyoscin butyl. Also required will be antiulcer medication to treat both the ulcer and the duodenitis such as proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and/or antacids. It will be worthwhile to discuss treatment options with your doctor after he is settled with the exact cause of your pain.

Sometimes it's difficult to recognize the difference between a strong-willed or emotional child and one with oppositional defiant disorder. It's normal to exhibit oppositional behavior at certain stages of a child's development. I think this is the stage the child goes through at his age of 11.There are certain therapeutic guidelines given by American Psychiatric Association. According to those criteria, the child is assessed psychologically by a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. If the child is diagnosed Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), the child will be treated with Parent training, Parent-child interaction therapy, Cognitive problem-solving training etc. Medicines are used for impulse control and anger and aggression.Please review this web link for clinical psychologists near Pasadena.

Thank you, Kimberly","Doctor":"headaches associated with specific notes could be  either a trigger for migraine or tinnitus ( ringing sensation in the ear). look for any associated symptoms. whether his pain gets relieved with sleep, worsens towards the end of the day, any other triggers for his headache or visual disturbances. also look for positional changes if it is a vertigo. some simple tests by physician could differtiate them. treatment mainly relies on the right diagnosis."},{"Patient":"my girl child is 10 months old, weighing 10.15kg..is it normal..she takes breastmilk and nan milk 210 ml twice daily and cerelac and apple, pear and banana purree but she does not like to take rice with carrots or beans...can u suggest a meal plan for her, thanku","Doctor":"if your child is weighing 2.5 to 3 times her birth weight, its absolutely normal. whatever she is taking now seems fine. try to introduce one new feed per week. for eg. apple this week, potato next etc. the more the flavours she is getting used to less choosy she ll be with her food in later life. if she doesn't like rice, try adding ghee/ sugar or different flavours with some food items she is already used to. feeding on demand is ideal, if not every 3 to 4 hrs 200ml / as she requires will suffice"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr, I have a 23 months old baby and his has been scrating his penis for the last 6 days.

He is so into scrating that when he wakes up in the middle of the night he will be scrating his private area. could you please advice. thanks","Doctor":"as you ve mentioned, this scratching could be due to the persistent moisture in his private areas. try him off nappies at least for few hours everyday and try to keep his genitals dry. see if he has any urinary symptoms like increased frequency or burning sensation while passing urine. if there is curdy white stuff seen you can use candid powder over the same area"},{"Patient":"Hello doc, My daughter has been coughing from last thursday mostly at nights in her sleep for say half an hour to forty five minutes on and off and when she stops she sleeps for the rest of the night.

He has been sick and is on antibiotics and ventalin. Could this have something to do with it. they are only small and at back they actually look like they go in a triangle shape if that makes sense? thanks","Doctor":"what you ve mentioned is nothing but hypertrophied taste buds. there are few varieties of them. the one that lines the back ( as you said in an inverted v shape) is called circumvallate papillae. they get enlarged especially after a course of illness. it's quite normal that they become visible at the time they enlarge. they subside in a few weeks. drinking plenty of fluids might help at times"},{"Patient":"Hi.

And if not, what is the cause of the rash and how can we treat it?","Doctor":"changing milk has no relation with the pimple. it's called a neonatal pustule quite a common finding in newborns. count the number of pustule she has. if it is more than 10 then she might need to be seen by a practitioner. cleaning it with betadine douches and keeping dry will be enough."},{"Patient":"My son is 3 he fell off the bed hit the knob perfectly on our dresser and you can see and fell the indention from the knob.

What should we do?","Doctor":"bleed from the nose could be due to epistaxis. just because the blood supply around our anterior part of the nose is abundant, its more prone for bleeds. repeated pricking of the same area could also cause bleeds. small amount of blood in streaks is not worrisome. just make her sit up leaning forward and apply ice pack with gentle pressure on the bleeding area while breathing through mouth. bleed will stop in few minutes"},{"Patient":"Hi, My Son 5months 2 weeks old, uses Diaper all the Night, on the Morning Urine am finding White Jelly discharge along with his urine, He is not having any pain while urination.

Any thougths?","Doctor":"this description is less likely to be asthma that too if it is the first episode. looks like more of a airway obstruction caused by some mucous plug, drying of the airway could cause thick secretions. this together with some cough suppressant could ve caused such a cyanotic spell. other than that, a viral bronchiolitis can cause such a symptom. but just because she is already on treatment, this is less likely"},{"Patient":"My 4 year old son was diagnosed with an ear infection 2 days ago.

I dont know if I should take,her to the hospital or not. Oh and she also has it looks like warts or something on her fingers around the nails and now they are spreading and getting bigger.","Doctor":"Hi....the tummy pain of two weeks just above the navel could be due to either mesenteric adenitis or it could be due to a mild stomach flu.Coming to sore throat - i feel that your kid might be having a viral sore throat or a streptococcal infection. I suggest you see your pediatrician and get a rapid streptococcal antigen test done. If it is positive then she will require antibiotics. if it is negative then it might be viral illness and doesn't require antibiotics at all.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son has been running a slight fever and was complaing of stomach pains yesterday hes not eating or drinking and just wants to sleep, he did dirty a few times yesterday.

Your son is suffering with fever, few motions, stomach bloated, and not feeling hungry. It appears to be Enteric fever, or may be any fever. any fever can show the same symptoms, besides its typical symptoms.

These non specific symptoms along with fever and blotchy face are pointing towards this.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 14 month old has a bump on her labia.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son is 3 yrs old, and is having coughing for last four months, without any fever or loss of appetite.

This is definitely not an infection so no need to use antibiotics at all. Simple logic is that an infection cannot go on like this for 2 months. This is definitely allergy. Coming to your query about adenoids - you should consider adenoids only if the kid is having snoring and inadequate or disturbed night sleep and daytime sleepiness. If these are not there this could be simple allergic rhinitis. I suggest you consult a paediatric allergist who can assess the kid and prescribe intranasal steroid which is the drug of choice in such cases.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, my one year old has had a fever for a couple days and isn t getting better better, ended up wit 40.1 temp today so I took to the hospital.

I too feel that this could be a viral illness. At the same time the slimy secretion of sweat could be due to the sebaceous secretion on the scalp getting mixed with sweat.If a kid is active when the temperature normal then you need not worry, this seems to be a viral illness. But if he develops lethargy or seizures or respiratory distress or bloody stools or green and bilious vomiting then you need to take him to the nearest physician or Emergency Room.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello, my boyfriend keeps experinencing stomach pain....he says it feels like hes been kicked in the balls....it can hurt alot for hrs then as quick as it came it goes off again?

She keeps catching cold and cough often. Earlier, she used to be presecribed only saline neblisation with the usual syrups of chlorpheniramine, terbultaline etc. But, this time she has been presecribed saline + duolin nebulisation. What does that indicate ? Is she predisposing towards asthma ??","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting your query at Health Care Magic. Duolin, as you have rightly surmised is used for babies with wheezing or fast breathing, which will be greatly helped by the salbutamol and ipratropium in Duolin.     They must have used Duolin as she had a wheeze, which could be due to viral infection as such. If there is a stronjg family history of asthma, there is a chance that your baby is predisposed to develop it. If not, the wheezing and fast breathing is probably because of intercurrent viral infections. What can you do to decrease the frequency?1. Vaccinate her with influenza and pneumococcal vaccine2. Decrease triggers for her wheeze or fast breathing. Avoid the following:   - agarbatti/incense    -perfume     -face powder      -dusting or sweeping near the baby   - pet hairs -cockroaches      -soft toys 3. Wash her bedsheets weekly in hot water to get rid of dust mites which will cause frequent wheezing4. Clean AC filters once in 10 days5. Keep an allergy diary: each time your child develops fast breathing, note down all the foods she has eaten that day, any particular activity she has done. you can compare notes over a period of time and try to identify a common allergen    Hope she feels better and this has helped you.

What your baby has is called a BCG lymphadenitis (swelling of the lymph node in her armpit). Her weight gain so far has been good and if there is no weight loss or fever or pus from the swelling, there is no need to investigate. It should resolve in the next few weeks.When you should take her to a doctor:1. High fever2. Prolonged cough3. Pus from the swelling4.

Jumping in trampoline is stomach churning exercise and while doing that it is natural to have chest discomfort due to digestive tract churning fluids. Many children even experience vomiting or nausea during or after trampoline exercise. Your son is not experiencing any chest discomfort while cycling or walking or during other periods.

Your infant is not conversant with chewing and eating, and needs to be trained. Usually, before this period, the child is supposed to chew on soft toys. Parents or caregivers should encourage chewing on soft toys during the period of 6 months to 1 year. That is the basic training step. In between feeding, you should provide your finger or some semi hard food between his teeth and encourage him to chew. Regarding the digestion part, the children will be able to chew and friend their food completely to assist in digestion only when their molar teeth appear. Therefore, the current scenario is not at all alarming. You should provide the food well blended or ground.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

Do not worry it.What your son is having could be  a colic.This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put  the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If  still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi my three year old has a rash.

It all started when he was two and there was a visit from his older brother who was 6 at the time. Anyway, his older brother broke out with white bumps in his mouth. A few days later my two year old son had bumps on the oustide of his mouth. We took them to the ER and they said it was Hand, Foot & Mouth, which I thought was silly, especially given the fact my step son was 6 and doesn t put his hands in his mouth. Anyway, my step son goes back to his home in Maryland and each visit (about 3 times a year) my two year old would break out during each visit my step son would come. He wouldnt break out any other time except when my step son would come around. The year before last, my son began breaking out each time he gets a fever. I took him to his doctor and she said it was Impetigo. Treated him with an antibotic and a cream for his face. These worked fine. Well I figure it is not Impetigo because it continues to come each time he gets a fever and the cream doesn t work but when she gave him that antibotic, it does.

I have taken her to her pediatrician who cannot give me reason for any of this. Emily weighed 62lbs in October of 2011. In December of 2011 she had her tonsils and adenoids removed, still weighing 62 lbs. Emily was out of school for one week per Drs. orders following the surgery. Emily went back to school and ended up with strep throat due to an apparent outbreak of scarlet fever at her school. She was then back out of school for approximately one more week because of this. Emily still maintained her weight of 62lbs through all of this. She had no complaints of stomach pain and had not lost or gained any weight. then one day right after being back at school after Christmas break I was in shock when I looked at her and she looked completely bloated and her stomach was hard. I waited about 2days before I took her to the Dr. figuring she simply needed to go poop. I gave her some apple juice and a light diet filled with some extra fruits and vegetables. Which she normally ate anyways, she loves fruits and vegetables so she was ok with the extra. She claimed no issues of using the bathroom and no pain other then get stomach being so big. so I called the Dr. she went in and to my surprise Emily gained ten pounds in less then a week. The issue has been on going and Emily has gained 30lbs since January of this year. Emily is active eats healthy and uses the bathroom regularly. She has had all kinds of blood work done, test on her phecies and a CT Scan all showing nothing significant. The only thing that came up in her blood work was a possible exposure to a bug from another country( we have never left Michigan) And when the phecies was cultured it showed nothing abnormal. The CT Scan showed she has Messentric Addenitis, which as her pediatrician stated should not last more than about 7 weeks. As previously stated Emily has had these issues since January of 2012. Emily has been taken off of all products made with any milk as it seemed to bloat her stomach more. Emily was allergy tested to ensure its not from any allergies. The only food allergy she was slightly positive for was eggs which she is no longer getting any product made with eggs now. Emy has also been tested for crossed and ibs to which she does not have either of. Emily still has stomach pain is not losing weight and will be weighed this weekend in hopes of her at least not gaining any more weight.

Itching occurring after operation at the site of the incision occurs due to the growth of new nerve cells and release of histamine at the wound site. Itching can be quite a discomfort, however its also a part of the healing process. You can try by keeping the area of that skin well moisturized, keeping the area clean, applying cool compress, taking anti-allergic medication and avoiding any irritation with the clothes.
