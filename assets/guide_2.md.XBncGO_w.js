After a short period of time I began to have pain in the scapula area in my back, then my left shoulder began having tremendous pain and limited motion in my left arm. I have had two MRI s and a torn rotator cuff was eliminated. It was determined that I have a bulging disc in the 5-6 vertebrae with a pinched nerve causing the limitation of motion and pain in my back and down my left arm to the left thumb. This may have been caused by the fall. Now I am having pitting edema in my left ankle. Also I have severe indigestion (which I feel is not connected) and I am not taking any medications. I did have cortisone injections in my neck which helped the pain for a short while, but is returning. Is there any connection with the swelling and the pinched nerve?","Doctor":"Hello elmogreeneyes.  Welcome to healthcaremagic.com. A broken thumb does not cause a pinched nerve at the c5-6 level.  That is coincidental. The fall could have caused the pinched nerve at the same time that your thumb was broken.  The nerve intervations of c5-6 may explain the pain in the left arm that radiates to the thumb, however, those nerve paths do not have a connection to the difficulties of your left leg. Unilateral swelling (swelling on only one side) indicates a disease process that is not related to your heart.  Some causes of unilateral swelling include fractures, ankle sprain, thrombophlebitis (blood clot), cellulitis (skin infection), venous stasis dermatitis (skin infection due to pooling of fluid in the lower extremity). If your leg is hot and red, go in for emergency evaluation of your swelling, if not, contact your family physician for evaluation of your condition. Be well, Dr. Kimberly"},{"Patient":"My son suffer a brain aneurism 2 months ago he had open brain surgery and thank god he didn t suffer any damage he s 17 years old loves to play basketball and wants to play again with he s traveling team also he wants to know if he will ever be able to ride roller coasters please help me with my questions thank you appreciate","Doctor":"Hi,  your son has recent undergone surgery of aneursym but you have not mentioned about were there any smaller aneurysm left. Some patients can have multiple aneursyms and very smaller ones are left alone and angiograms are done at regular intervals to see whether they are increasing in size.

First of all i like to congratulate you for giving first aid and taking him away from risks. Grand mal involves whole body.. Associated with aura before seizure and then little depression after seizure. Keeping him calm, relaxed, Loosening his tight dress, putting him in open clear space, Avoiding biting his tongue by keeping hankie/cloth between teeth, avoiding tongue fall, Assisting proper respiration are some of the first aid. Cold water wont help him much.Turning bluish is due to vascular phenomenon due to reduced blood supply to body (periphery) during seizure. Usually he ll recover from it .

Strokes involving the posterior circulation can cause vertigo, imbalance while walking and double vision. In most cases the symptoms slowly improve/resolve. A few may have residual symptoms.

Cortisol levels have diurinal variation - meaning the levels of hormone vary according to the time of test. Presuming the test was done early in the morning cortisol level of 563 nmol is in limits.

He took treatment in staedford hospital he took medicine regularly. but in 2010 Blood pressure has raised. we took to hospital. but proper treatment was not given there. doctor told to take CT scan . in that CT Scan report blood clot was affected in mid brain. after that he is unable to walk, he is unable to talk. there are 3 strokes in brain My question is will that blood clot will remove or not? speach will come or not? please answer to my question","Doctor":"Hi Sarala, The blood clot could have been removed surgically at the time when the incidence occurred in 2010. If the surgical intervention was not done, then it should have been managed medically. Prompt and immediate medical attention is necessary in this kind of Hemorrhagic stroke. Early intervention prevents motor and sensory disability. I am sorry, you have not mentioned about his treatment that he underwent in 2010. In the later periods, regular physiotherapy can help in bringing back the motor ability of a person. In your father's case, his walking ability can be regained though not to 100%. The blood clot will dissolve in due time. Speech therapy can help him get back his normal speech but the percentage of recovery cannot be commented on and it is individualized. I hope to have answered your query. Regards,"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor... My father had brain stroke and he had lot of complications while treating it, and since his pressure to the brain didn t get decrease they did brain decompression Surgery. After that surgery he was better and was discharged( he is completely parasitic on his right side and he will not be able to speak) . Again he had fits after 5months later from the surgery and when we went to the doctor they gave him EPITOIN and Fermium which he had side effect like rashes and sleepiness, so they stopped the medicine. Now he is had fits again within 20 days. Now doctor advice us to give Levipil 500mg(morning and night)... please advice whether is there possibility of him getting the fits again. Levipil is a good medicine for Fits??","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. Levipil or levitiracetam is a good drug for management for the treatment of fits. The possibility of rashes cannot be predicted but people who have a rash with Eptoin do not necessarily have a rash with Levipil.

Presuming you meant the small ischemic foci is on the right cerebral hemisphere, the affected brain is not huge and prognosis is good. If his complaints are recent one and my presumption is right, then he should be able to recover easily. The medications given to him are appropriate and he needs to continue with it religiously. In addition the most important aspect is to start and continue effective physiotherapy with the help of an experienced physiotherapist. This is the most crucial element to make your father recover from the paralysis and get back to his normal activity. So if you haven't started the physio yet, discuss with your neurologist and start it at the earliest. He should improve very soon with it. Hope this helps.

However, 3 months ago I had a really bad one and was told today by my neurologist that I have epilepsy because of seizure like activity that showed up on two EEGs. On my first visit with him, he told me that the extremely bad sinus infection that I had not been treated for could only be a trigger not the cause of a seizure, especially in people who have epilepsy. I had an EEG and a CT scan performed on me when I was about 18 years old and there was nothing abnormal at that time. The reason for the checks when I was 18 was because I was having sharp pains in the right side of my head, which I called headaches. However, about 8 years ago, I was checked by a Dr who told me that these headaches were probably due to ear problems. These headaches, as I call them, have been persistent everyday for the last 20+ years with the exception of when I had a tooth extracted and the dentist gave me a shot of Lidocaine in my upper left jaw area.

Please advice ASAP.","Doctor":"Hello Ravi and thanks for writing in at HCM I am Jr. to cardiologist and wants to help you out. You have not written any thigh about the site of the clot in your query. The nature of treatment lots depend on the site and size of the clot and the symptoms caused by it. As you have said you have done Color Doppler of neck, so there is more possibility that the clot may be in the carotid artery. The clot sometimes stops the flow of blood to the brain and causes unconsciousnesses and weakness of one limb for a short period of time. Now coming to the treatment, whether the clot in carotid or anywhere less, it can be treated by: 1. Anti-coagulant drugs: you are taking only a minimum dose of anti-coagulant drugs i.e. alone asprin. You can also take drug like clopivas along with asprin, which are more effective. But please consult your doctor before taking it. 2. Stent implantation: If the block is in the carotid or internal carotid than it may need revascularization with stent implantaton. By this the normal blood flow is achieved.

Please advice if this is bppv related or what sort of specialist is need to consult","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for using the HCM. I am happy to address your questions, BPPV is due to a disturbance within the inner ear. The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. The canals are very sensitive to movement of the fluid, which occurs as you change position. The fluid movement allows your brain to interpret your body's position and maintain your balance. The spinning sensation and dizziness is usually triggered by moving the head, often starts suddenly, lasts a few seconds to minutes. The most effective treatment are exercises (as advised by your clinician) that can readjust your response to head movements. Medications like  antihistamines (betahistine) may be prescribed to relieve the spinning sensations. To prevent your symptoms from getting worse during episodes of vertigo, avoid the positions that trigger it. Benign positional vertigo is uncomfortable, but usually improves with time. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help. Thanks"},{"Patient":"Yes. I have trouble speaking at times during the day. I also have trouble typing and reading at times. Like now it is not a problem. I have had an MRI , EEG , tested for Alzheimer s, and did a Mercury detox .

Exposure to mercury can be a cause for your symptoms. Other possible causes can be depression, thyroid dysfunction and primary progressive aphasia as well.

Myoclonus refers to involuntary jerky movement of a part or whole of the body. This is a benign, harmless condition which occurs especially during a sleep. Presuming you are perfectly alright preceding and following the episode, you need not be concerned. However, if these episodes are recurring or if you had any physical disturbances during the episode, you would need to get investigated. The primary set of investigation that is needed is radio imaging of brain (CT/MRI scans) and EEG. Management will be needed if any of the tests reveal significant abnormality.

Try  Rhustox, Ruta, Colchicum, Arnica  remedys in 200 potency  . These medicines often provide significant benefits. Try alternating between hot and cold packs. Some doctors recommend changing from hot to cold every 3 minutes and repeating this sequence three times. Others believe ice packs should be applied first. This routine should be done two or three times during the day. Supportive back belts, braces, or corsets may help some people temporarily, but these products can reduce muscle tone over time and should be used only briefly. Exercise, diet, stress, and weight all have a significant influence on back pain. Changing certain lifestyle factors can help reduce, and possibly prevent, backaches.Yoga relieves low back pain better than conventional exercise Dr Rajashekar"},{"Patient":"It feels as though I have strained my lower back, pulled a muscle.

For some conditions like infection, due to low sugar level, intracranial leision etc seizures will stop occuring once underlying cause is treated.. For Epilepsy ideally the patient is put on anticonvulsant therapy and followed up for 3 years..If seizures doesn't appear for 3years even once then he is less likely to get in future..Then gradually they taper the dose and finally discontinue it..

Impression: 1.several scattered foci of signal abnormality within the deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, some of which are oriented perpendicular to the caliosal septal interface and are nonspecific in appearance. Condsiderations include chronic microvascular ischemic disease, demyelinating disease , migraine headaches, or history of seizures. What does this all mean? My other MRI s of cervical, lumbar has problems that suggest a near surgeon.","Doctor":"Hi, . Magnetic Resonance Imaging findings are to be correlated with clinical history in order to give a clear diagnosis. In the absence of any clinical history, these scattered foci of signal abnormalities have no significance. As such they could represent areas of ischemia or demyelination.  Ischemia represents areas that have reduced vascularity resulting in microscopic damages to cells. And since neural damages are irreversible old and previous damages stays permanent as visualized on scan. Demyelination also causes similar changes, however the pathology is due to damages to the structural covering of the nerves. Demyelination as such when early is reversible. That being said, what is seen on scan is most often an age related vascularity changes and needs no intervention if you are asymptomatic. Hope this helps.

I do not understand much about the levels of his spine that are affected but the doctor says they are multiple. The doctor has given two options, surgery or a back brace . My family has decided to take the back brace option because my grand father is 87 years and they fear a surgery may be risky. Please what do you think is best in this situation? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi, . From what I understand your grandfather was diagnosed to have multiple slip disc based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Yes, both conservative and surgical treatments are available to treat slip discs. Surgical treatment is restricted only to those cases where there are neurological deficits secondary to nerve root compression and where conservative treatment have failed to relieve the symptoms. That being said, spine surgeries are definitely associated with risks. There is a small possibility of worsening of the condition. Besides surgical and anesthesia risk are plenty in elderly patients. Weighing the benefits and risks, I feel there are plenty of risks involved in operating an 87 year old gentlemen. And the choice to manage him conservatively is right one. Continue with braces. If the pain is severe a brief course of anti-inflammatory agents / steroid injections can be used. Discuss with his treating surgeons. Hope this helps.

How soon should I be able to return to work?","Doctor":"From your description I understand that you are going to undergo a laminectomy and you want to know about the recovery from the operation.I will try to explain the various stages of your recuperation.Usually after an uncomplicated laminectomy you might have to stay in the hospital for 2 to 5 days.This might increase if you have any complications like bleeding or infection.After discharge in the first two weeks you might have to deal with severe pain(for which you will be given pain killers from the hospital) but inspite of this you have to walk a little to reduce the scar tissue and prevent a large amount of scar tissue putting pressure on the nerves which were released by the laminectomy.You might have to visit your doctorin the third or fourth week for a review.Usually if no complications occur you can go back to work after 6 weeks.The idea here is to start walking to reduce the scar tissue from your operation and keep your lungs and heart in good shape.The later you start walking the more time you will take to go back to work."},{"Patient":"I just got my c-spine MRI report and was wondering what some parts meant.

Facial spasms can be controlled either by oral medications / Botox injections/ Surgical intervention( if it is due to Facialnerve compression). Although you have to take regular medications or repeat Botox injections at regular intervals( may be once every 3 mths),under your neurosurgeons guidance it will temporarily relieve your problem . Surgical intervention will be finalized only by your neurologist/ neurosurgeon after monitoring your response to oral drugs and Botox injections. Every problem has a solution. So Never Ever give up and have positive thoughts.

About 5 months ago, he said he also passed-out when he massaged his right shoulder and and felt something clicked . He woke up...as if he fell into a deep sleep. We re not sure if he had seizure before he woke up because he was alone in the house playing his favorite video game. Recent EEG showed abnormality but MRI and MRA are normal. Is this an epileptic attack? If so, what type of epilepsy is this and what is the appropriate medication and care for this condition? Thnks!","Doctor":"Hello Liby, The latest episode your son has had is suggestive of Pain induced Syncope. All the features described is fitting with a Syncope including the brief uprolling of eyes and jerks and waking up quickly without much confusion. The earlier episode while he was playing the Video game is more difficult to comment on as there were no eye witnesses and we are not exactly sure about the duration of the event.(how long he remained unconscious) Even this episode could have been brought on by Pain-the shoulder click. In Seizures many a times the EEG & MRI Brain can be Normal. The only worrying thing is the abnormality in the EEG. You could take a second opinion about the EEG to see if its a significant abnormality. I say this because antiepileptic treatment is longterm and hence we need to be reasonably sure about the diagnosis before medications are started. What is certain is that your son has tendency to lose consciousness when he encounters pain. He could lie down immediately in such circumstances or flex his legs close to the chest in a sitting position to avoid falls. I think you could wait on starting medications as the evidence is not overhwhelming in favour of a Seizure. Discuss with your doctor regarding precautions you can take to avoid Syncope other than the ones i have mentioned above.

At 3 weeks she had open heart surgery for Shones Complex. After an attempted extubation following surgery she went into cardiac arrest and the doctors performed CPR for 2 1/2 hours on and off. She was in status epilepticus and an MRS showed a strokes in 3 lobes. Her seizure meds(phenobarb and dilantin ) were stopped 1 year ago- when she was about 9 months. She had some mild gross motor delays but from a neurological standpoint, overall she is doing great. She has now been diagnosed with acquired microcephaly . She has always been Failure to Thrive with no known GI issues. Her HC is 17 1/4, height is 31 3/4 and weight is 19lbs. I have started noticing signs of possible petite-mal seizures with the worst lasting about 15-20 sec. My question is: Does Acquired microcephaly tend to be degenerative or regressive in nature? She has hit most milestones to date, but is it possible that she will regress? Also, are the petite mal seizures a result of the microcephaly and can these turn into grand-mal? I have read that the severity of microcephaly and its relationship with developmental delays can correlate with overall growth percentiles. Is it possible that her lack of appetite is caused by the microcephaly and be making it worse at the same time?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcaremagic.com. This is going to be a rather long answer.  Please bear with me as I talk through this.  I will also quote a study on this disease process from a journal, Pediatrics.  The article is entitled Acquired Microcephaly: Causes, Patterns, Motor and IQ Effects, and Associated Growth Changes. Acquired (also known as progressive) microcephaly is a condition in which a child's head circumference is within the normal range at birth and for an undefined period thereafter but then does not increase as fast as normal and, as a result, crosses percentiles to below the second percentile. In our experience, this is a relatively common form of microcephaly. Although there is extensive literature on microcephaly, there is little on this subtype. Recognized causes include acquired brain damage as well as Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Down syndrome, and other rarer syndromes, but these account for a minority of cases. There are also differing head growth patterns for children with microcephaly, which have not been studied. As a result, there is no currently available information to give to most families whose children show acquired microcephaly. This is the first attempt to study acquired, or progressive, microcephaly systematically. Causes were divided initially into multiple subgroups, but a final review allowed these to be simplified into 5 groups, defined as follows: (1) idiopathic, that is, no cause could be recognized from the history, examination, or investigations, and there were no other abnormal findings; (2) familial, that is, a parent and/or sibling had a head circumference at or below the second percentile; (3) syndromic, that is, with associated anomalies; (4) symptomatic, that is, following a pathogenic event; or (5) mixed, that is, ≥2 of the aforementioned. My understanding of this disease process as it relates to your daughter is that she falls under the category of symptomatic.  Following her cardiac event and the subsequent CPR, she developed a brain injury.  This is evidenced by the MRI showing lesions in three lobes.  The brain injury most likely resulted in the epileptic state.  Her petite mal seizures are a result of the injury.  Her acquired microcephaly is most likely also caused by the brain injury. The microcephaly your daughter has does not appear to be regressive in nature.  There is a correlation between acquired microcephaly and a failure to thrive.  The study shows there is a correlation between head circumference size and height and weight.  Lower head circumferences generally lead to a lower height and weight. Her failure to thrive is the cause for the lack of appetite- not the microcephaly. There is little information on acquired microcephaly.  I hope that I have answered your questions adequately.  If you have additional questions or need clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me.

This has affected your eustachian tube (tube connecting back of your nose to middle ear) leading to stuffy feeling in ears, imbalance. The same thing can explain if you are getting any noise in ears but not if it is in your head. Your examination is likely to elucidate more about your problems. So please consult an ENT specialist. He/she may advice C T scan of sinuses. If sinus infection is confirmed, he may advice antibiotic, nasal decongestants etc. After that if your imbalance and strange noises in head persist, you may have to consult a neurologist to rule out any cause for your those symptoms. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"A 54-year-old Type-A male business executive had been experiencing migrainelike headaches . One afternoon he also experienced light-headedness, slurred speech and mildly impaired motor function on his right side. One of his colleagues rushed him to the emergency room of a nearby hospital where blood pressure , blood gases, electrolytes, and an ECG were run. His blood pressure was 195/100 mm Hg, which he said was typical of what he had experienced during the past two years. Blood gases and electrolytes were normal. The ECG showed no arrhythmias but did demonstrate a left axis deviation. The gentleman was admitted to the hospital and a cerebral angiogram was performed which showed left cerebral hemorrhaging. 1. What is the diagnosis of this individual s disorder? 2. What are the major contributing factors to this disorder? 3. What could have been done to prevent this problem? 4. What are the early warning symptoms prior to the complication? 5. Why did the ECG show a left axis deviation? 6. Why was there impaired motor function on the right side from cerebral hemorrhaging on the left side?","Doctor":"1. Hemorrhagic stroke. 2.

Since you might have read lot about stroke on the internet I will directly come to your questions : Recovery after stroke : 1. Majority of patients >2/3rd who survive the first month after stroke improve, many back to their pre-stroke level of function. 2.  The rate of recovery of all impairments is maximum in the first few weeks, slows down after 2 or 3 months, and probably stops at about 6-12 months after stroke. 3. It is very difficult to predict to what degree a person will recover immediately after stroke but becomes somewhat easier and more relevant, once it is clear that the person is likely to survive (which is at about 2 weeks after stroke). 4. At this stage good prognostic signs include young age, initially mild functional impairment, fully conscious, god sitting balance, normal orientation, no memory impairment, good bladder control, and rapid improvement. Survival after stroke : 1. 90% of patients with first episode of stroke remain alive at the end one month. 2. Best single predictor of early death is impaired consciousness. 3. After the first month, the risk of death becomes much less (about 7% per year) but it is still about twice that of the background population because stroke patients are particularly likely to die of a further stroke and even more likely to die of the consequences of other associated diseases like heart disease etc. Wish a good health to you and your family members"},{"Patient":"Yes.

There is no link between sciatica and high blood pressure as such. If you have been taking any pain killers for the sciatica, they can sometimes impair the effects of the medications used to treat high blood pressure.

Everyday since the accident I get strong pressure dominatly on the left side of face; temple and behind left ear. I also have heavy pulsating that runs right up the left side of neck and up into the back left side of my head. My left ear is always very clogged and muffled.

Moderate left neural foraminal narrowing and mild right neural foraminal narrowing are present . Neurologist said I need surgery right away. Is surgery my only option?","Doctor":"Hello You are right in asking the question. The radiological report does indicate a status in which many physicians advise surgery and many patients get operated upon. However, the decision of surgery is not made completely upon the imaging findings. The clinical history and examination findings are the foremost things a physician keeps in mind. A patient with neurological deficits, like weakness of hands or feet, constipation, urinary complaints etc., is usually advised surgery straightaway. But patients who come only with pain and no compression of the spinal cord on MRI, are put on physiotherapy and medications first. Only if this conservative line of management fails, then surgery is advised. Most patients who comply well with the conservative line management are able to delay surgery for a significant period of time, or even totally prevent the need of surgery sometimes. Hope this solves you query... But remember, the physician who has seen you and examined you is usually the best judge...

She had severe neck & left arm pain also feels a tingling sensation in her left thumb , otherwise her movements & motor reflexes are alright. Does she require a surgery? What are the complications of the surgery? What if we don t go for surgery? Can this be treated with medication?","Doctor":"Hai,1. Disc herniation with cervical canal stenosis is basically a mechanical issue which cannot be treated with medication. Medications can only improve your symptom / pain or may be numbness to a part, but cannot get back the herniated disc.2. Since she had developed tingling sensation in her left thumb --> nerve compression by the herniated disc.3. Not all cases of herniated disc +/- nerve compression require surgery. Give a trial of cervical traction and see whether her numbness improves. If she is not benefited by traction, then surgery is the only way to get rid of the numbness.4. Surgical complications can range from none to immediate postop blood collection inside canal. Risks are always involved in all surgeries (simple to more complicated) that we have to accept - ranging from infection to technical difficulties with added co-morbid conditions of the patient themself (age, wound healing, bone quality, diabetis / heart disease/ hypertension / thyroid or metabolic diseases etc..). Better surgical techniques with use of microscope has decreased such complications.

It seems your mother is suffering from age-related osteo-arthritis of the spine,2. Forward slipping of L4 over L5 vertebra is called anterolisthesis. Sideways curving of spine is called as scoliosis. Since both are minimal, they can be age-related changes / osteo-porosis.3. SI = sacro-iliac joints. These are the joints connecting the spine / sacrum with the pelvic bone.4. If your mom is suffering from pain in low back more on lifting objects / on prolonged forward leaning posture = indicates instability at L4 and L5 segment ---> then you might need CT-scan to find there is any defect in the spine and MRI to rule-out any nerve compression / canal stenosis / associated disc disease.5.

MRI findings are are suggestive of degenerative changes of disc with prolapse and the resultant lumbar canal stenosis. These changes are less likely to be a sequelae of your injury. Pregabilin helps reducing the shooting pain. Strengthening of spinal flexors and abdominal muscles will be helpful as these align spine to a more accommodating position. Daily therapeutic walking (increasing the walking distance slowly) will be of help to increase the pain free walking distance(claudication distance). Surgery is not advisable unless you have severe intolerable pain despite adequate conservative management or have symptoms progressive neurological deficit (like decreased sensation in your limbs, weakness in your limbs, decreased control or sensation over bowel or bladder) Nandrolone is not preferable in your present condition as regular exercise is sufficient to  strengthen your muscles.

The whole pressure on the brain really concerns me!","Doctor":"Papilledema is a very specific diagnosis which refers to optic nerve edema from increased intracranial pressure... this is by definition. So, for the moment, your mom has swollen optic nerves or optic disk edema. Optic disk edema has multiple causes including... 1. uncontrolled high blood pressure,2. rare bilateral diabetic papillopathy and 3. strokes to the optic nerve (anterior ischemic optic neuropathy) which can rarely be bilateral, are associated with vision loss and may be associated with giant cell arteritis. Since these are all treatable easily, they must be considered. (Likewise infiltration of the optic nerve through neoplastic processes such as CNS lymphoma can cause the appearance of edema and will show up on an MRI.) Once these possibilities have been considered, the next logical step is MRI...This is looking for CNS tumors and should be performed with contrast.  If negative, lumbar puncture measuring openning pressure should be performed with removal of cerebral spinal fluid for cytology to look for signs of infection or tumor in the brain. ( This test will actually diagnose the patient with papilledema.) The swollen nerves in this case are just a sign... the underlying reason is most important.  The most common CNS tumor in middleaged women is meningioma which is benign and can be resected... everything is worse.

However review of his blood tests may help us rule out any missed causes. Meanwhile it is absolutely important to be regular with antiepileptic medications.

He has been on pain pills and muscle relaxers for various pain issue and has had no help from them in general which I believe is due to the fact that he is a drinker (whisky and diet coke mainly).

Epidural steroid injections can be given to back pain because of degenerated disk, 2.

In short-term relief of acute pain, they are indeed helpful in giving a brief pain free period, 4.

There are several disorders which can cause fainting in children. This could include arrhythmias, seizures, problems in the heart like coarctation of aorta or a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or simply a hot shower.  It is good that you are keeping him hydrated, but to take this further, I would like to know whether an echocardiogram has been done for him. If not, please get it done. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart which allows us to look at the valves and the chambers of the heart. If this is normal, we can be sure that there is nothing wrong with the structure of the heart. The possibility of seizures also needs to be evaluated. Ask your son if you can tell when he is going to faint. If he can, there is a chance that he has a complex partial seizure. we would need an EEG to find out whether he is actually having these seizures. Hope this helps.

Based on the findings your wife is suffering from Cervical spodylosis. You have not mentioned her age and her profession. Cervical spondylosis is a common problem among women. Although seen in all the age groups it is usuallyseen in women above 35 years of age. Your wife's condition is not serious as the MRI is showing early changes. Osteophytes are excessiv bone groth secondary to stress or trauma to bones. It is the pressure of osteophytes on the nerves that causes the symptoms. As per the report they are not compressing neural structures so the problem is severe. There are few precautions which needs to be taken apart from using medicines. Try to avoid too much movement of neck. Do not use pillow while going to bed. Coming to medications- Calcium supplements need to be taken. Along with them Anti inflammatory drugs must be used. Taking Preparations containing Vitamin B12 alone or in combination with Benfotiamine, thiamine and pyrridoxine would help. Few people require Vitamin B12 Injections. If that does not give response you might have to use preparations containing gabapentin have to be used ( Not required for your wife as these are used in severe cases). Get her Hemoglobin, Vitamin D3 and Calcium levels checked. Based on the values treatment can be initiated. Please consult an orthpaedician or a neurosurgeon and take his advice. If you can post the details of your wife's age , comorbid conditions ( Daibetes, Hypertension, thyroid problem or any gynaecological problems) and daily activities she does and profession, I can give you a better advice.

Pyridoxine (vit B6) supplementation is required along with INH.Intermittent use of AKT4increases the risk of development of resistance by the TB bacilli, and the reason why a combination of drugs is used for treatment is to prevent the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. The use of AKT4 must have been prompted by a clinical diagnosis of TB."},{"Patient":"Dear Dr. how are you PLS can some one help me I m Muhanad From Iraq I have AS Ankylosing Spondylitis my doctor tell me to take medicine called salazopyrin 500mg but when I start to take it it cause for me Breathing difficulties I start by 1g daily (one pill twice ) is that normal or it is some thing wrong? or it must stop this medicine please help me","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCM, The first symptoms Ankylosing Spondylitis  are typically chronic pain and stiffness in the middle part of the spine or sometimes the entire spine, often with pain referred to one or other buttock or the back of thigh from the sacroiliac joint.,which may itself present as dyspnoea(difficult breathing ).

Because both sides of my forehead was little bit pushed forward. Therefore, I was trying to bring it to the normal shape. When I did this for five – six days I faced a problem; when I bend my forehead (from eye side to upside) I was feeling pain on the upside part of my eye (left side). Then gradually I felt like the left side of my head (just upside of the forehead) is benumbed. So I stopped rolling the forehead. But I did not show this to any doctor and did not do any self treatment for this for two and half years. During this period my face, forehead and frond side of my head become paralyzed. I felt that I have no face, forehead or head. I was feeling neither cold nor hot. I felt cold on the frond side of the head. When I touch my forehead, I felt like I am touching some other thing.i have neck pain & sensation low also I approached many doctors. doctor is saying sub nerve has damaged in forehead I request you to kindly help me to solve my problems.

It is diagnosed as hemifacial spasm . Is t paralysis? Your treatment with medicine or massage therapy? Pls reply to follow. Varadharajan R, madurai.","Doctor":"Hello Varadharajan, Hemifacial Spasm involves involuntary contractions of muscles of one side of face.It usually begins around the eyes and can later involve other muscles supplied by the facial nerve. Its usually seen on one side only although it can occur on both sides of face. These movements cannot be voluntarily suppressed like in a condition called Tics and can continue even in sleep.It is thought to be due to blood vessel pressing on the facial nerve although it can be due to other causes also. It is not paralysis like you fear. Effective treatment is taking Botilinum toxin injections or doing microvascular decompression surgery if there is pressure on the facial nerve as earlier mentioned. It is  possible to maintain reasonable control over the movements with treatment.

Your Mri has indicated of disc bulge and encroachment to neural recess of L4-5 So this can be taken as tentative cause. Well mr. Nambiar I believe I will not recommend surgery as the first option in such cases. In Ayurveda there is a procedure which is called Kati Vasti in which medicated oil slightly heated is kept over affected area for about half an hour to 45 minutes. These oils contain analgesic, anti inflammatory and muscle tonic herbs. I have seen excellent response in such cases. More so it is non invasive technique. In case the cause is with muscles then fomentation with herbs and oil massage is beneficial. I wish and hope that this will cure you."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, i am 55 years old and am a diabetic.

Homoeopathy is one of the best treatments for lumbago, cervical spondylosis, lumbar spondylitis, disc prolapse, buldge and many other conditions associated with back as it treats the person as a whole.

I will try my best to provide you with best possible professional recommendations to your questions. Myelomeningocele is a birth defect in which the backbone and spinal canal do not close before birth.Most children will require lifelong treatment for problems that result from damage to the spinal cord and spinal nerves. Shivering hands might be due to neurological losses. It should be treated accordingly. For patients of spina bifida Follow-up examinations generally continue throughout the child's life. These are done to check the child's developmental level and to treat any intellectual, neurological, or physical problems. So I advice you for regular check up of your girl from physician. Yet again, I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further queries.

We did for 5 hours and when enquired how long we have to do that, we were told that they do not have any working ventilator and then we shifted to different hospital where he treated on Octroid at first to control insulin and then diazoxide for controlling sugar and saved the life but because of hypoglycemia and non supply of oxygen to brain , his brain has a gross damage. The second MRI reflected many pot holes at different place and in the left brain there was a clot also (subdural haemotoma) which later drained out surgically and placed a shunt there. Now as were told there is no chance of recovery of brain and he surely be moving towards spastic. I want to know if any thing we can do to revert such damage??

I developed severe neuropathy symptoms with this and have numbness in both legs. I have tightness and pressure in my shoulders, chest and trunk. I am not diabetic but the neuropathy prevents me from everyday tasks and the numbness even prevents me from walking because I cannot feel the ground. I had a SSEP test done today. Will this tell me for certain if I have GBS? Also, how do I get any relief from this neuropathy? I already take Cymbalta, Neurontin and Oxycodone , and I attend physical therapy 3 days a week but with no relief at all. I also have back pain and facial numbness. Does this sound like Guillain Barre in your opinion?","Doctor":"Hello, . Guillain Barre Syndrome or simply GB syndrome is a condition that affects nervous system leading to progressive weakness of skeletal muscles. Sometimes sensory disturbances may be accompanied by muscle weakness (motor dysfunction), however pure sensory disturbances are unlike GB syndrome. Definitive diagnosis can be established by EMG studies, examination of cerebrospinal fluid and detailed neurological examination. Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) needs to be ruled out when symptoms are predominantly sensory as seen in your case. A brief course of steroid and other immune suppressant might help you. I encourage you to consult a neurologist if you haven't met one yet for a detailed neurological examination. Review of your earlier tests and if needed re evaluation may be needed. Hope this answers your query.

This might have happened because you are predisposed by some underlying connective tissue disorder, congenital defect / anomaly or benign intra cranial hypertension. 3. A proven route of CSF leak is barotrauma causing a perilymph leak in the ear, draining to the nose via the Eustachian tube. This is also known as CSF Otorhinorrhea.

With this presentation in my clinic, I would first of all rule out an ectopic pregnancy. It is possible to have a negative urine pregnancy test in ectopic pregnancy because serum levels of  beta HCG (hormone that is detected in urine during pregnancy) do not rise quickly as in normal pregnancy. To arrive at the diagnosis in early ectopic  pregnancies, a test has to be carried out on blood complimented with a pelvic ultrasound.

Since she in on steroids do make sure she is taking Calcium and Vitamin D3 supplements to help prevent progression of Osteoporosis at her age. The pain she experiences is due to nerve getting pressed by the degenerated and herniated discs from her spine. She can try using a Lumbo-sacral corset belt to attain better posture while walking and reduce her symptoms. Usually, the main exercise you will be asked to do is that of extension which is leaning backwards by propping yourself up on your elbows when lying on your front.

From the information you have provided, you probably have an infection that is never really treated completely(Abscess). Recurring infections often have favoring factors and one of the is a foreign body. So long as this predisposing factor is not addressed entirely, the infection would keep recurring. I will suggest that you consult with your doctor and get this condition addressed entirely to identify the favoring factors and address them. Only after doing this would you be able to confidently expect that the problem is over. It may need imaging tests to locate the infection pocket and map out the possible predisposing factors. A culture of the secretion should be strongly considered as well.This infection is certainly just below the skin and does not involve any structures in the abdomen.I hope you find this helpful.

In fact, what you feel as memory problem is actually decreased concentration due to which you are not able to focus properly when you read. This can be because of many reasons like stress, lack of interest or distractions.Here are some things you can do:1. Set short term and long term goals, so that you know why exactly it is important for your to study. This will increase your motivation and also your interest in studies.2. Study with full concentration (without distractions), even if it is only for a short period (1 hour). Reading for hours without focus does not help you in long run.3. Take breaks in between so that your mind does not drift away while studying. You can utilize the break to relax and refocus.4. \\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\\". Integrate some play or exercise in your routine. Deep breathing exercises will also help calm your nerves.5.

At his 6 month check-up they decided to do a EEG and an MRI because sometimes (more so when laying down) his eyes would roll downward for a split second then right back up, the results for the EEG were normal, but the MRI showed a subdural benign extra-axial fluid of infantcy.

Assuming that you are a student, it is unlikely that you have a refractory error (near vision problems are usually seen in middle age). Association with studies almost rules out other causes like sinusitis and migraine. When mind is forced to do what it does not like, it will react in such a way that you have difficulty doing it. Headache, decreased concentration and forgetfulness are some of the problems commonly seen in students. High expectation from self and others only add to the burden. Following points may help you overcome this problem: 1. Take frequent breaks in between study sessions 2. Make the Studying process interesting (like group discussion, audio-visual aids etc) 3. Take help for difficult subjects(coaching/tuitions) 4. Plan well to manage time.

As I've gotten older - I'm 17 now - I've had pains on the left side of my abdominal(?) area. The experiences differ - there'd be times when I'm about to sit down, that something on that side of my body just feels like it's popping out of where it's supposed to be and it causes this weird tingling pain. When this happens, I have to take short breaths or else it'd hurt worse. If I brave the pain and take a huge breath, I'd have to go through excruciating pain until something \\"pops\\" again, and everything gets better. (I've only done the deep breathing thing once. It REALLY hurts.) Other times, I would get up - like out of bed - and something inside just doesn't want to move, and so I have this freaky feeling that I'm stretching my insides. If I sit down for too long, I make sure to stretch out and straighten up a little before I make any movements. I have freaked out, thinking my heart was coming out through my ribs (because that's what it feels like), but I know it's not that. I'm not even sure if it could be relative to my past surgeries - it might be a coincidence. I can't go see a doctor and my parents would call me a drama queen if I asked them to take me anywhere, so.

They say eventually she may starve and weaken because she is only supplied food through the liquid food attached to her and it is unhealthy to stay bed ridden for too long. Can somebody please give me a better idea on what may be wrong and how exactly a stroke works and what are the chances of her waking up considering she has some psychical movement and at times opens her eyes and just stares into the distance. Is it possible for the brain to reconstruct its self somehow?","Doctor":"Hi!!  .. Strokes are of 2 types - Ischemic stroke where there is obstruction to the blood flow secondary to either narrowing of blood vessels or dislodged clot obstructing the blood follow. The other form of stroke is bleeding. Symptoms of stroke depends on the area and extent of brain affected by stroke... In this sense, stroke causing unconsciousness indicates a larger/important area of the brain has been affected.. Though stroke affected brain doesn't recover, clinical symptoms will improve gradually. On the contrary, other areas of the brain can also get affected due to edema and pressure effects or fresh stroke development. This can lead to worsening of the condition. Such events are common during the initial few days following a stroke. They are not so common after a week. Apart from the risks of other areas of brain getting affected, an unconscious/bed ridden individuals have a higher risk of developing bed sores and infections which add to the morbidity. The progress of the illness is monitored closely through a set of parameters - Glassglow coma scale, heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory activity... The extent of recovery depends on the right choice of treatment and later the physiotherapy. It's isn't an easy task to predict the chances of recovery from this far. The doctors treating her too may face the same difficulty predicting the chances of recovery. A positive approach, right treatment and active physiotherapy are the factors enhancing recovery..

The autonomic nervous system (ANS or visceral nervous system) is the part of the peripheral nervous system that acts as a control system functioning largely below the level of consciousness, and controls visceral functions. The ANS affects heart rate, digestion, respiration rate, salivation, perspiration, diameter of the pupils, micturition (urination), and sexual arousal. Whereas most of its actions are involuntary, some, such as breathing, work in tandem with the conscious mind. It is classically divided into two subsystems: the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Relatively recently, a third subsystem of neurons that have been named 'non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic' neurons (because they use nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter) have been described and found to be integral in autonomic function, particularly in the gut and the lungs."},{"Patient":"I have had pain in my right abdomen approx. 1 inch below and to the right of my belly button for more than 3 weeks.

I am a 32-year-old female. Over the last month and a half I have had some bizarre symptoms. On Oct. 13 I awoke from sleep with a vibrating sensation in my neck and shoulders. This vibrating sensation now comes and goes even during the day. Some days I have it all day some days just occasionally. I also notice random numb spots on my arms, hands, legs and face. Even burning and tingling type sensations. I went to my family doctor and he ordered a CT scan of my head with contrast which was normal. I work for a Radiation Oncologist and he looked at the CT scan to confirm and said it was normal not to worry. Well yesterday and today I have a new symptom. I have afterimages in my vision. I can look at something and as soon as I look away I see an outline of that image. Not the same color as the image just an outline. I have had these before but they have always gone away. Im really worried I have a brain tumor. I know they say the CT with contrast was normal but could it have missed something?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Healthcaremagic A contrast CT is very sensitive to rule out a brain tumor. If it is normal it is unlikely you have brain tumor. Since you are working for a radiation oncologist you anxiety level for a malignancy is very high which may also be partly responsible for aggravation of your symptoms. The problem could be related to cervical spondylitis as you have numbness in the arms and hand and even tingling on face can be explained with this. It could also be related to vision. It is more important to get cervical spine X ray, ESR, CBC, and to see opthalmologist. A carotid doppler, if indicated by your neurologist, may rule out any insufficient vascularity of brain.

First of all, the chiari malformation that was picked up on your MRI may be just an incidental finding. If it is not causing you severe symptoms, there maybe nothing to worry about. Most commonly this may present as some headache and dizziness. According to me, there is no connection with your psoriatic arthritis for which you should consult a dermatologist who will start you on some tablets.

Atrophy refers to a decreased size or wasting away of any part of the body. Cerebral atrophy can happen in either the entire brain or in just one part of the brain and can lead to decreased brain mass and loss of neurological function. The symptoms of cerebral atrophy depend on the cause and location of cell death. Cerebral atrophy can occur due to brain injury, as in the case of stroke, or to a neurological disease, such as Alzheimer’s disease, cerebral palsy, or Huntington’s disease. Infections of the brain can also lead to the death of brain cells and cerebral atrophy. Symptoms of cerebral atrophy include dementia, seizures, loss of motor control, and difficulty with speaking, comprehension or reading. Dementia, which is marked by memory loss and an inability to perform daily activities, may be mild or severe and may worsen with increasing atrophy. Seizures can range from absence seizures (sudden loss of responsiveness) to convulsive seizures. Depending on the underlying cause, cerebral atrophy may progress very slowly or very rapidly. Cerebral atrophy is life threatening, and there is no known cure. Treatment for cerebral atrophy focuses on treating the symptoms and complications of the disease. In cases in which cerebral atrophy is due to an infection, treatment of the infection may stop the symptoms of atrophy from worsening. Symptoms of cerebral atrophy can be generalized (affecting the whole brain) or localized (affecting only one part of the brain or one function). Generalized symptoms include symptoms of dementia, such as problems with memory or changes in personality. Localized symptoms include seizures and problems with speech, vision or movement.. Anticonvulsive medication to stop seizures Cognitive or behavioral therapy to improve quality of life Physical therapy to slow loss of muscle control Speech therapy to decrease the impact of aphasia (impaired speech and comprehension) Treatment for the underlying infection or injury leading to cerebral atrophy this ans is just for growing more knowledge bout cerebral atrophy."},{"Patient":"Hi my 15 year old daugher has been sick for over 7 weeks with abdominal pain.

This leads to a narrowing of the spinal column, which is what spondylosis refers to. The lumbar region bears the brunt of most of the body's weight, so with time everyone's vertebrae degenerate. Even if you consult an orthopedic consultant for your problem, after investigations, he will tell you that there is no definitive treatment for spondylosis and treating it symptomatically by prescribing analgesics is what they will do.

Transverse myelitis is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation across both sides of one level, or segment, of the spinal cord. The term myelitis refers to inflammation of the spinal cord; transverse simply describes the position of the inflammation, that is, across the width of the spinal cord. Attacks of inflammation can damage or destroy myelin, the fatty insulating substance that covers nerve cell fibers. This damage causes nervous system scars that interrupt communications between the nerves in the spinal cord and the rest of the body.  As it is the damage within the spinal cord at cellular level only medications can cure the condition.  Usually in many of the cases inflammation resolve on its own. Medications( Steroids, Immunotherapy and plasmapheresis) will help the patient in speedy recovery. Rehabilitation along with medication play a major role in recovery.Surgical options are still at experimental stage as they cannot intervene the damage at cellular level."},{"Patient":"I have a minor herniated disk ( L5-s1). I take good care of it but sometimes i just forget about my condition and then I get into a really bad situation. I think i twisted in a bad way and have gotten into a really bad situation. Now standing straight is causing really excruciating pain in my lower back which is radiation to my thighs a bit. The pain is also radiating outwards from the center of my lower back. I am getting relief while sitting. Usually its the otherway round i.e my back starts hurting after prolonged sitting and standing used to cause relief. My question is whether I have injured by disc again or it can be something else.","Doctor":"when ever some pressure compresses your disc it bulges out of its place and presses the spinal cord or the nerve root which is the cause of your excruciating pain. discs tend to go back to their original position unless they are mishandled . continous sitting and standing both are different ways of compressing the disc. it doesnt matter whether standing or sitting is causing your problem as long as yourdisc is weak. its your duty to take steps to stop further degeneration and to try regenerating your discs which is possible for sure. some of my patients are sportsmen who were suffering with herniated disc and trust me they are back into their sports. all we did were some cleansing therapies, some metabolic correction therapies, an ancient ayurvedic therapy called Vahnikarma or agnikarma, along with food and life style modifications. consult your nearest ayurvedic physician who practices both panchakarma and agnikarma and you will surely get cured with out any painkillers and surgeries."},{"Patient":"since last two year i am suffering from headache doctor says that i am patient of migraine may i know what care should be taken for this?i suffer from headache minimum twice a week.","Doctor":"Hi, .

For the last 5 years I have been treated with; Oxycontin/160mg three x day, Lyrica / 150mg twice a day, Panadol, Vit c, Vit b, Neocytamen / 1ml a month, Colon Cleanse- nightly ( magnesium oxide, magnesium carbonate). But I have never been well enough to manage and have been bed ridden with; extreme pain, vertgo and vomiting when sitting or standing long, spinal headaches, temporary partial paralysis in limbs and head etc, various pain sensations - some of which are severe etc etc etc. But the most horrific pain is an unbearable pain deep in my sacrum at the site of the myelogram, that caused my arachnoiditis. After a problematic colonoscopy 8 years ago the pain in my sacrum has been more intense and my bowel periodicaly produces such severe pain I cannot manage it. I also have a hiatis hernia , constant nausea, vomitting with severe pain, along with bouts of diorrea. So I lose my meds easily, putting me in a cycle of pain we cannot control. Since immigrating I have not found any knowledgable GP s so I get no advice or refferals and my full time Caregiver has no help, leaving us to manage alone. My old GP told us my meds would need revising yearly as pain levels will only increase as the nerves are damaged and that gradual paralysis will happen. But we have tried for 2 years to get a reveiw to see what stage I am at and increase pain medication etc. However all the Doctors here seem to think arachnoiditis is just long term pain rather than the insidious disease it really is. The pain I go through is so severe I never even knew it existed and we do not understand why Doctors are happy to repeat my scripts, but dont understand that the pain levels increase with the progression of the disease and my meds need reveiwing. Most Doctors do not want to take me and very few even prescribe these kind of meds. Due to selfish drug abusers who never think of the suffering Patients in real pain go through, just so these addicts can get their highs. Specialists authorise my meds and the GP just issues them. But why prescribe a dose which will not even allow me to function in the community and have some quality of life? When I first went on these meds they worked and I got some of my life back. But just like my GP advised; the pain levels and my functions got worse with time, so why dont they increase my dose? I have been told by a few Doctors that my dose is small so what is the difference? If the pain is worse than death why dont they stop it and prevent it? Some GP s go on about addiction to my meds but I have no history and no symptoms of drug addiction or abuse and considering I have absolutely no life with this incurable disease addiction is the least of my worries. Doctors here refuse to discuss arachnoiditis and will not help. We are at a loss as to what to do and I cannot go on much longer like this.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Healthcare Magic Forum. Arachnoiditis is a pain disorder caused by the inflammation of the arachnoid which is one of the membranes that surround and protect the nerves of the spinal cord.  This can happen because of an irritation from chemicals, infection from bacteria or virus, as the result of direct injury to the spine, compression of spinal nerves for a long term, or complications from spinal surgery or other invasive spinal procedures. It is indeed a Difficult condition to treat and Most treatments focus on pain relief and the improving the daily function. This includes pain management, Physiotherapy, psychotherapy and exercise.

Brain tumor symptoms depends upon its location and size of the tumor. if the size is large it will rise the intracranial pressure. you will get severe headache and vomiting. the physical symptoms totally depend upon the location and size again. bleeding from nose not necessarily from brain tumor. fatigue and trouble in concentrating may be due to your over stressful condition or hypoglycemia condition if you dont take meal at times. gas problems depends upon your type of foods , time of meals and if taking any medication. . depresion and anxiety is the cause of palpitaion. anxiety also one cause of shortness of breath and anemia also one cause. so all the symptoms what you are telling not necessarily of brain tumor. the brain tuimor can only be confirmed by CT scan or MRI of brain. all your symptoms can be well controlled by proper medication. if you dont have any insurance then i would suggest you start your homeopathy treatment. it will be well controlled by proper homeopathy treatment. if you would take the decision to go for homeopathy treatment then can contact me. i would be happy to bring your health back to normal condition. contact me at multicare.homeo@yahoo.com   or   visit www.multicarehomeopathy.com   thank you"},{"Patient":"aneurysm on both sides of my family does that put me more at risk Hi, my grandfather on my mothers side died of a brain aneurysm at the age of 51 and at the age of 45 my father died of a brain aneurysm. my question is I know genetics play a part with this but are my chances even higher because it is on both my mother and my fathers side and is my brother more likely to have one because he is a man and so where they.","Doctor":"HI, welcome to health care magic forum, aneurysm is  widening or ballooning of a portion of an artery, due to weakness in the walls of blood vessels, the causes are still not clear but there are many risk factors which raises the condition, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking. surgery is mainly recommended but you can go for Homeopathy also which has good results in treatment for aneurysm and is safe effective and has no side effects.

I had surgery for a 2 cm disc herniation end Nov 2010. This caused problems down to S5. I lost feeling in left leg and would fall. Needed emergency surg.

For the past couple of weeks have had really bad pains again in left calf, numbness , falling, dizziness ,nausea ( I do not eat well due to this however I am really overweight), and recently last week or so I am having trouble with bowel movement .

Cuada Equina usually presents with following symptoms.. 1)Low back pain 2)Pain in one leg (unilateral) or both legs (bilateral) that starts in the buttocks and travels down the back of the thighs and legs (sciatica) 3)Numbness in the groin or area of contact if sitting on a saddle (perineal or saddle paresthesia) 4)Bowel and bladder disturbances 5)Lower extremity muscle weakness and loss of sensations. Since you have more than one of these symptoms you could have re-herniated.

Both of these are Anti Epileptic (anti seizure ) drugs.Although anti-epileptic drugs can control seizures, they cannot cure epilepsy. This is why they need to be taken every day to help stop seizures from happening. It is important not to attempt to reduce or withdraw medication without specialist advice.A number of factors have to be considered, including whether there is a physical cause for your epilepsy and how long it took for your seizures to be controlled. If it is decided to come off medication, it is usual for this to be a very gradual process as abrupt withdrawal can, in itself, trigger a seizure. Some types of epilepsy, such as Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy, respond well to anti-epileptic drugs, but the majority of people with this type of epilepsy need to take medication for life. This is because there is a high instance of seizures recurring when drugs are stopped."},{"Patient":"my son is suffering from microcephly and cerebral palacy.He is six and half years old.

This is also called as postural hypotension / Orthostatic hypotension. The only way to control it is not to rush from sitting to standing position. As far as nose bleed is into the picture. It seems that the blood vessels of your nose have been damaged with regular blowing.

There is nothing wrong with you and you certainly don't have to see any psychiatrist. We have control over ourselves and not others. Hence, try to develop control over senses (like the famous drawing of Lord Krishna holding five reins of a horse, representing our five senses). What will help you in this case is: a) define what you want in your professional life. If what you define professionally is driven by your passion/ knowledge, its probably better. b) define what you want in your personal life. If you aim for a peaceful/ loving/ sharing life, it probably would serve you well.

People may emerge from a coma with a combination of physical, intellectual, and psychological difficulties that need special attention. Recovery usually occurs gradually, with patients acquiring more and more ability to respond. Some patients never progress beyond very basic responses, but many recover full awareness. Patients recovering from coma require close medical supervision. A coma rarely lasts more than 2 to 4 weeks. Some patients may regain a degree of awareness after vegetative state. Others may remain in a vegetative state for years or even decades. The most common cause of death for a person in a vegetative state is infection such as pneumonia. Duration depends on the severity of the injury and patient general condition, often short; rarely more than 2-4 weeks."},{"Patient":"I have hairline skull fracture and blood clot in the brain.

We feel that you have not provided the sufficient information like the Impressions on the MRI, Xray, Whether the SCI ( Spinal Cord Injury is present or not) if so is it complete or Incomplete. What is the level of inury? We assume that your mother is in a state of Spinal shock. Spinal cord injury results in the loss of sensations and motor loss too. Some parts of the body may develop complications.Complications may include a loss of Urinary bladder, bowel( Stool) control, increased risk for urinary tract infections, impotence, sexual dysfunction, skin break down, pressure sores, spasticity, blood clots, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease due to decreased physical activity.To reduce the risk of complications it is important to follow the advice of your physician. Complete bed rest is mandatory till the swelling in the spinal cord is reduced, Catheterisation of bladder,check for pressure sores daily at buttocks and back, Nasogastric tube to prevent lung complications and participation in physical activity with uninvolved body parts (Say hands in your case), for example an upper body therapeutic exercise.Psychosocial support for individuals with spinal cord injury is a key factor in successful rehabilitation.The prognosis is much better for the incomplete cord syndromes.If some sensory function is preserved, the chance that the patient will eventually be able walk is greater than 50%. Ultimately, 90% of patients with SCI regain independence if properly taken care of. Frequent neurological examinations are mandatory.

Unintended weight loss more than 10 per cent in last six months2. Loss of appetite or difficulty in swallowing more than 6 months3. Early satiety, which means you have been eating less than before and you feel that you ain't hungry anymore.4. Altered bowel movements - diarrhea or constipation more than six months.5. Nausea and vomiting - usually associated with one or more of the above symptoms. If you are experiencing any of the above, then I suggest you see a gastroenterologist - the stomach doctor, who will examine in detail and run some tests and investigations and take things ahead.

I am a 56 year old female. I was diagnosed with Stage 1, Grade 3 Ductal Carcinoma in 2015. I had a double mastectomy and chemo. Earlier this year I had a colonoscopy and a precancerous adenoma was found. I was told that I wouldn t need another colonoscopy was needed for 5 years. Since my oncologist told me they couldn t be certain that they got all the cancer, this naturally concerns me. Not that I want to do another colonoscopy but I do want to make sure I catch anything early, as I did with the breast cancer. So my question is why is it medically reasonable to wait so long? Thanks for your time.","Doctor":"Hello, If I were in your place, would have also been worried. Usually, breast cancer and colon cancer are two different cancers without any association between the two. In general, a person has diagnosed with cancer, the risk of him or her developing second cancer is slightly higher compared to normal individuals. Usually, colonoscopy is recommended every ten years, in your case, it has been recommended, I presume, for this very reason, to detect early when it is still curable. Secondly, usually any cancer takes a certain time to grow, for a precancerous adenoma to become cancer, it will take time. However, it depends upon the type of adenoma, since there are different types ranging from benign with minimal risk of developing into cancer to dangerous ones which have the highest probability in turning into cancer. In order to comment upon your risk, would like to know the details of the precancerous adenoma, whether it is single or multiple, shape (sessile or pedunculated), etc. Whether to wait or not, depends upon the type, I am guessing the adenoma found is one of the mild types and hence the advice of repeat test after 5 years.

Isnt there a blood test to tell if you have cancer? I am diabetic","Doctor":"Hi, It is very important to detect cancer early when it is still curable. However, none of the tests you have mentioned is for cancer. Unfortunately, the answer to your cancer is not that simple. Cancer is a disease that can be presented in various types and can arise in any body part. Depending upon the type of cancer, there are different tests available for early detection, however, there is no one test, that can detect all types of cancer with certainty. For example, for breast cancer - tests like mammography (special types of x-rays of breasts) can help in detection. For Lung cancer - tests like CT scan can help. For Prostate cancer - blood test like PSA can give clues. For head and neck cancer - a simple examination by a doctor can help in detection. Thus for every cancer, we have a different test for its detection. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

He s was told to use ice and heat on it until Dec. when a dermatologist suggested seeing a specialist. Saw the orthopedic PA who took X-rays and said ice and heat. Two days later the surgeon saw us because of the extreme pain, ordered blood work, a CAT scan, and an MRI. Technique: multi planar multi sequence MRI of the right shoulder without intravenous contrast on Jan. 24, 2017. Indication: right/deltoid plemorphic Sarcoma. The ortho doc never mentioned sarcoma and had he done the MrRI further down the arm they would have realized there were tumors below the elbow. The surgeon did surgery on Feb. 3, 2017. He said he d removed the mass/tumor that presented as the Popeye muscle, and sent it into pathology, calling 3 days later with the news. We were referred to the Sarcoma clinic at the Lemon Holton Cancer Center in Grand Rapids MI. After the plan was presented, radiation then surgery. The only problem is, they did 5 treatments on the upper arm, and only when I told the Radiation Oncologist he was to have radiation below the elbow too, the last two treatments have included all infected areas.

However she does not regularly see a doctor for annual check ups. Just this month she cancelled a trip over seas due to finding blood in her urine. Ever since then she has had all kinds of testing done including: a physical with breast exam, blood work (Glucose-fasting, cholesterol, TSH, CBC), urinalysis, mammogram and bone densitometry, seen an OBGYN and had a pap, and a pelvic/abdominal ultrasound. Out of all these tests the bone densitometry showed signs of osteoporosis and the abdominal ultrasound showed some enlarged lymph nodes, everything else was normal including WBC. So her doctor recommended an abdominal/pelvic CT scan to “rule out malignancy” we did the CT and everything was normal except “at least 3 enlarged lymph nodes within the root of the small bowel mesentery the largest measuring 3.3x 1.8 x 2.9 cm. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy by size criteria. No ascites” –this is quoting the radiologists report. In this report he recommended we follow up with a chest CT to look for any other lymphadenopathy or overt intrathoracic malignancies and also that we biopsy the abdominal lymph nodes by ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration. So we did the chest CT and it came back as a normal chest CT with “no signs of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy”. Now we are booked in for the Fine needle biopsy on Thursday. My question is have we missed looking into anything that may have caused these 3 enlarged lymph nodes or could this be a purely isolated case? Would a PET scan help diagnose anything lurking that we may have missed? I understand that lymphoma could be a possible diagnosis and that is why they are doing the biopsy but does lymphoma generally start in the abdominal lymph nodes?Thank you very much","Doctor":"as no remarkable lymph nodes cud be seen in thorac and all her other tests are normal ...now only option left is to biopsy of abdonimal glands ..biopsy will be done and according to me biopsy is best method to diagnose an exact cause of any growth...second best are tumour markers ...trust your doctors they are on right path .."},{"Patient":"Hi my dad is 86 years old and has had blood in his urine.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Breast density is a comparison of the relative amounts of fat versus fibroglandular tissues in the breast. Women with ‘dense‘ breasts have a higher percentage of fibrous and glandular tissue and less fat tissue. (Fibroglandular parenchyma, basically means breast tissue). For a woman, having dense breasts is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. Only age and BRCA gene status carry a higher risk than dense breast tissue according to research. A woman who has a first-degree female relative with breast cancer has almost twice the risk of a woman without this family history. If she has more than 1 first-degree female relative with a history of breast cancer, her risk is about 3-4 times higher. In your case, you're at high risk because of a strong family history of breast cancer, you and your doctor will develop a screening plan tailored to your unique situation. Recommended screening guidelines include: a monthly breast self-exam, yearly breast exam by your doctor or nurse practitioner, mammogram every year starting at age 40. Your personal screening plan also may include the following tests to detect any cancer as early as possible: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the breast, ultrasound Hope I have answered your query.

Stage IV cancers have already spread to nearby areas such as the bladder or rectum (T4), to nearby lymph nodes, or to distant organs such as the bones. A small portion of T4 cancers may be curable using some of the same treatments for stage III cancers. Most stage IV cancers can’t be cured, but are treatable. The goals of treatment are to keep the cancer under control for as long as possible and to improve a man’s quality of life. In you case treatment seems working good.

I have some good effects with the Chemo, such as I don t scratch my skin bloody in my sleep,","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Mycosis Fungoides is the most common type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. There are studies that reported and confirmed the early efficacy of gemcitabine (Gemzar) in advanced-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. However, results contradict the safety profile of gemcitabine previously reported and underline the high incidence of severe complications including visceral and cutaneous involvement. Cutaneous T cell lymphomas are treated with skin-directed or systemic therapies including retinoids like bexarotene. In advanced stages, histone deacetylase inhibitors, interferons or chemotherapeutic agents have been used with variable efficacy. In my opinion, Gemzar is a good treatment. However, there are newer treatment options available for cutaneous T cell lymphoma including monoclonal antibodies (Alemtuzumab, brentuximab vedotin and mogamulizumab).

With Gleason, less than six and PSA levels less than ten would be considered low risk. And PSA is greater than ten and Gleason is greater than seven come under a moderate risk.

Ask your pharmacist for help in selecting a laxative (such as a stimulant type with stool susea, vomiting, constipation, lightheadedness, dizziness, drowsiness, or sweating may occur. Some of these side effects may decrease after you have been using this medication for a while. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.oftener). prevent constipation, eat a diet adequate in fiber, drink plenty of water, and exercise. Ask your pharmacist for help in selecting a laxative (such as a stimulant type with stool softener).Another strong pain relief she can try is Fentanyl transdermal patch.Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.The fentanyl skin patch is only used for opioid-tolerant patients. A patient is opioid-tolerant if oral narcotics have already been used for severe pain. Check with your doctor if you have questions about this.This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.You will receive the Ionsys® patch while you are in a hospital. A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine after surgery. You will be taught how to use this medicine in the hospital, but the patch will be removed by your healthcare provider before you leave the hospital. Do not leave the hospital with the patch on your skin.To use the Duragesic® patch:Use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. It will work only if it has been applied correctly.This medicine should only be used on skin that is not irritated or injured. Do not put the patch in your mouth, chew it, or swallow it.Fentanyl skin patches are packaged in sealed pouches. Do not remove the patch from the sealed pouch until you are ready to apply it.When handling the skin patch, be careful not to touch the adhesive (sticky) surface with your hand. The adhesive part of the system contains some fentanyl, which can be absorbed into your body too fast through the skin of your hand. If any of the medicine does get on your hand, rinse the area right away with a lot of clear water. Do not use soap or other cleansers.Be careful not to tear the patch or make any holes in it. Damage to a patch may allow fentanyl to pass into your skin too quickly. This can cause an overdose.Apply the patch to a dry, flat skin area on your upper arm, chest, or back. Choose a place where the skin is not very oily and is free of scars, cuts, burns, or irritation. Do not apply this medicine to areas that have received radiation therapy.The patch will stay in place better if it is applied to an area with little or no hair. If you need to apply the patch to a hairy area, you may first clip the hair with scissors, but do not shave it off.If you need to clean the area before applying the medicine, use only plain water. Do not use soaps, other cleansers, lotions, or anything that contains oils or alcohol. Be sure that the skin is completely dry before applying the medicine.Remove the liner covering the sticky side of the skin patch. Then press the patch firmly in place, using the palm of your hand, for a minimum of 30 seconds. Make sure that the entire adhesive surface is attached to your skin, especially around the edges.If the patch becomes loose, tape the edges with first aid tape.If the patch falls off after applying it, throw it away and apply a new patch in a different area.If you need to apply more than 1 patch at a time, place the patches far enough apart so that the edges do not touch or overlap each other.Wash your hands with a lot of clear water after applying the medicine. Do not use soap or other cleansers.Remove the patch after 3 days (72 hours), or as directed by your doctor. Choose a different place on your skin to apply the next patch. If possible, use a place on the other side of your body. Wait at least 3 days before using the first area again.In young children or persons with decreased mental alertness, the Duragesic® patch should be put on the upper back to decrease the chance that the patch will be removed and placed in the mouth.After a Duragesic® patch is applied, fentanyl passes into the skin a little at a time. A certain amount of the medicine must build up in the skin before it is absorbed into the body. Up to a full day (24 hours) may pass before the first dose begins to work. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose during the first few weeks before finding the amount that works best for you. Even if you feel that the medicine is not working, do not increase the amount of fentanyl transdermal that you apply. Instead, check first with your doctor.You will probably need to take a faster-acting narcotic by mouth to relieve pain during the first few days of fentanyl transdermal treatment. You may also need another narcotic while your dose of fentanyl is being adjusted, and to relieve any \\"breakthrough\\" pain that occurs later on. Be sure you do not take more of the other narcotic, and do not take it more often than directed. Taking 2 narcotics together can increase the chance of serious side effects.DosingThe dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.For transdermal dosage form (Duragesic® skin patch):For relief of chronic pain:Adults, teenagers, and children 2 years and older—Your doctor will decide which dose of the patch you need based on your present daily narcotic dose. The patch is applied to the skin and left in place for 3 days (72 hours). Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed.Children younger than 2 years—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.For transdermal dosage form (Ionsys® skin patch):For short-term relief of acute pain after surgery:Adults—Your healthcare will decide which dose of the patch you need based on your present daily narcotic dose. The patch is applied by your healthcare provider to your upper outer arm or chest. Your doctor will show you how to adjust your dose if needed while in the hospital.Missed DoseIf you forget to wear or change a patch, put one on as soon as you can. If it is almost time to put on your next patch, wait until then to apply a new patch and skip the one you missed. Do not apply extra patches to make up for a missed dose.Remove the Duragesic® patch 3 days (72 hours) after applying it.Your healthcare provider will remove the Ionsys® patch before you leave the hospital. The Ionsys® patch is not for use at homeStorageStore the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.Keep out of the reach of children.Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.Fentanyl can cause serious unwanted effects or a fatal overdose if taken by children, pets, or adults who are not used to strong narcotic pain medicines. Make sure you store the medicine in a safe and secure place to prevent others from getting it.To dispose of the Duragesic® patch, fold the patch in half with the sticky side inside. If the patch has not been used, take it out of the pouch and remove the liner that covers the sticky side of the patch before folding it in half.

Avoid taking more than one multivitamin product at the same time unless your doctor tells you to. Taking similar vitamin products together can result in a vitamin overdose or serious side effects.Many multivitamin products also contain minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and zinc. Minerals (especially taken in large doses) can cause side effects such as tooth staining, increased urination, stomach bleeding, uneven heart rate, confusion, and muscle weakness or limp feeling.Take your multivitamin with a full glass of water.The chewable tablet must be chewed or allowed to dissolve in your mouth before swallowing.Measure the liquid form of multivitamins using a special dose-measuring spoon or cup, not a regular table spoon. If you do not have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist where you can get one.Liquid multivitamins may sometimes be mixed with water, fruit juice, or infant formula (but not milk or other dairy products).It is important to take multivitamins regularly to get the most benefit.Store this medication at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

I will be highly thankful to u!","Doctor":"HelloAbdominal tuberculosis can be classified into the Tubercular mesenteric adenitis,intestinal tuberculosis, omental or tubercular peritonitis.The first investigation is blood test which can show increased ESR with raised lymphocytes count.Then an USG should be done to find out any enlarged and matted lymph node,thickening or adhesion of the intestinal wall or any collection of fluid.The next investigation may be CECT abdomen for better delineation of anatomic abnormality or if USG is doubtful. Sometimes there may be formation of cold abscess or mass,then aspiration of pus or USG guided biopsy of mass may be needed.The pus should be sent for test of tuberculosis.A test called Quantiferon gold test may also be advised for diagnosis.Tuberculosis is a communicable disease and mainly spread through droplets.Most communicable is pulmonary tuberculosis.Chances are very very less in abdominal tuberculosis if not associated with pulmonary TB.If there is only abdominal TB no specific precaution is needed.Regards"},{"Patient":"Recently, I've had water retention and high blood pressure.

Oral palonosetron is not yet available. Palonosetron has a significantly longer half-life and a higher binding activity than the other 5-HT3RAs.Defecation can be treated by drinking clear liquids. As soon as your diarrhea starts, switch to a diet of clear liquids, such as water, apple juice, clear broth and ice pops. Avoid milk products, as lactose intolerance may be part of your diarrhea. When you have diarrhea, you may need to drink eight to 12 cups of liquid a day.Eat low-fiber foods. As your diarrhea starts to improve, add foods low in fiber to your diet, such as bananas, rice, applesauce and toast.Eat frequent small meals.Eat foods that are high in potassium. Potassium is an important mineral that you can lose through diarrhea. Try eating bananas, potatoes and apricots to boost your potassium levels. If you have kidney problems, consult with your doctor before eating foods that are high in potassium.Avoid foods that can irritate your digestive tract. These include dairy products, spicy foods, alcohol, foods and beverages that contain caffeine, orange or prune juice, and foods high in fiber and fat.Try probiotics. Found in yogurt and dietary supplements, probiotics are beneficial bacteria that may help restore normal digestion. Lactobacillus and bifidobacterium are two examples of probiotics.

WHAT IS YOUR OPINION PLEASE. DESPERATE WHITE CELLS 1.8. RED CELLS 2.7, PLATELETS ARE 73. YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"HiMelatonin dosages vary depending on the reason this supplement is being used. Dosage guidelines for adult range from 0.3 mg to 5 mg per day. For sleep disorders, most individuals will take 2 – 3 mg one hour prior to bedtime.Produced from the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain’s pineal gland, melatonin is a hormone that is released into the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Secretion of this hormone increases when external light is low. Its release is inhibited by the presence of light.Using a natural melatonin supplement can help to improve sleep disorders and alleviate insomnia. Taking a small dosage of this supplement in the evening can shorten sleep onset time and improve sleep quality and duration in some cases.Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) may have additional benefits for health, including acting as an anti-oxidant, improving mood, supporting muscle growth and exhibiting several anti-aging effects. Melatonin dosages are considered safe when used appropriately, but should not be used for longer than six months at a time without doctor supervision.Melatonin is a hormone that our bodies produce in the pineal gland. It is released when it is dark out and drops off when it is light, suggesting that it is involved in regulating our circadian rhythms and sleep cycles.In recent years, melatonin has been synthesized in laboratories and released in supplement form. Melatonin tablets have become a popular option as a natural sleep aid with low risk of side effects.However, high doses of melatonin can result in psychological effects similar to a hypnogogic state. Some users report feeling very relaxed, while others report hallucinations or impaired cognition. Many report serious side effects, such as memory loss, disorientation, confusion and disrupted sleep patterns.Melatonin is used to for insomnia, shift work disorder, sleep-wake cycle disturbances, jet lag, circadian rhythm disorders in the blind and other sleep disorders.Research shows that it is effective for alleviating symptoms of primary insomnia and it may have benefits for certain types of secondary insomnia. For these purposes, melatonin is taken in pill or capsule form approximately 30 minutes before bedtime.Melatonin can also help prevent sleeplessness in hospital settings, where bright light and disturbances can make sleep difficult.Melatonin supplements also have an anti-anxiety effect and can promote better moods for some users. Recent research suggests this supplement has anti-aging benefits and it demonstrates efficacy as an anti-oxidant.There is some evidence that melatonin, when applied topically, can prevent sunburn when it is applied before sun exposure.There is no formal research into whether you can get high from melatonin. There are, however, anecdotal reports of melatonin’s recreational use on forums like Reddit and Erowid.Users there report a melatonin buzz that comes from taking high dosages of melatonin or combining it with other drugs such as cannabis.The reports on how much melatonin to take to get high are varied. In one Reddit post, a user says that he and several college-aged friends took anywhere from 15 milligrams to 50 milligrams. All were males weighing between 150 and 180 pounds.Some consumed only melatonin, while others combined it with cannabis. At least one user was a daily user of the ADHD stimulant medication Adderall, as well. They reported intense intoxication and a feeling similar to extreme drunkenness.RegardsDR DE"},{"Patient":"Hi.

In neutropenic patients, chances of acquiring infection are far higher.Personally i feel you should avoid visiting him at  present until it is utmost necessary.

I have had a basel cell carcinoma in that area before, but it was removed years ago. I am familiar with the signs of skin cancer and they typically do not develop this fast.

Cleansing your skin twice a day helps to reduce the excess oil and dirt from your skin to help reduce or eliminate pimples.Apply benzoyl peroxide to infected pimple.

Sometimes you may just forget to drink enough water. Most of the time, though, dehydration happens when you exercise vigorously and fail to replenish the water lost through sweat. On very hot days, especially when it’s hot and humid, you can lose a significant amount of water through sweat. Dehydration is also a common side effect of many prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications.The human body relies on water to perform its most critical functions, so having too little of it can be very dangerous. When it’s severe, dehydration can cause brain damage and death. Severe dehydration is more common in:childrenolder adultspeople with chronic illnessespeople who don’t have access to safe drinking waterBut it only takes a mild case of dehydration to cause a dehydration headache.Dehydration headche remedies areDrink waterFirst, get a drink of water as soon as possible. Most dehydration headaches resolve within three hours of drinking. You don’t need to overhydrate: A simple glass or two of water should help in most cases.Drinking too quickly sometimes makes dehydrated people vomit, so it’s best to take slow, steady sips. You could even suck on a few ice cubes.Electrolyte drinksWhile plain water should do the trick, drinks like Pedialyte and Powerade give an extra boost with electrolytes. Electrolytes are minerals your body requires to function. You get them from the foods you eat and things you drink.

What is the prognosis for sternum cancer & do you think radiation would be in order? Suggested Ibrance capsules, took for 27 days, but copay of 3,500 is something I can t afford and patient assistance has been denied by Pfizer.","Doctor":"HITaking radiation treatment is recommended for sternum cancerRadiation therapy uses high-energy rays or particles to kill cancer cells. External beam radiation therapy uses radiation delivered from outside the body that is focused on the cancer. This is the type of radiation therapy that has been tried as a treatment for bone cancer.Most bone cancers are not easily killed by radiation, and high doses are needed. These high doses can damage healthy structures like nerves in the nearby area. This is why radiation therapy is not used as a major treatment for most types of bone tumors, (except for Ewing tumors, and these are discussed in a separate document). Often radiation is used to treat bone cancers that are unresectable (they cannot be completely removed by surgery). Radiation may also be used after surgery if cancer cells were present in the edges of the removed tissue. Another term for this is positive margins (this is discussed in the section about surgery). In this case, radiation may be given to kill any cancer that may have been left behind. If the cancer comes back after treatment, radiation can help control symptoms like pain and swelling.RegardsDR DE"},{"Patient":"I just had a colonoscopy and a non cancerous polyp was removed.

A small amount of free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas is completely normal, and may just be an indicator of where a woman is in her menstrual cycle. The Pouch of Douglas typically holds a bit of fluid immediately after ovulation monthly. This fluid dissipates on its own as a woman continues on her cycle, and reappears during the next month's cycle.However, an infection of the peritoneal cavity can also cause fluid to build up in the pouch of Douglas. Infection is usually due to gonorrhea, fungal and trichomonal organisms.Common causes of fluid in the pouch are :-*    irritable bowel syndrome*    ovarian cysts*    Pelvic inflammatory diseaseI personally feel that Taxim or, preferably Azithromycin should be given along with anti-fungal (such as Fluconazole) + anti-amebic drug, such as metronidazole, tinidazole or secnidazole.

Shall I call the HEARST!! THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO MY PROBLEMS. Sincerely BEVERLY GAYDOS","Doctor":"Hi Ms Beverly,Thanks for your query.Firstly, painful sex was apparently due to dry vaginal internal lining as part of post-menopausal state (post-hysterectomy). Hormonal replacement therapy will certainly be of great help.Further, excessive sweating and abdominal problems are apparently due to Irritable bowels, which is commonly due to mental stress/anxiety. However, colonoscopy (if you can afford the cost) will confirm the diagnosis, while ruling out inflammatory bowel diseases and diverticulosis. Eat high fiber diet or, add psyllium husk/powder 20gms/day to your diet, which will be of great benefit. A regular course of anti-depressants + anti-anxiety drugs certainly gives relief. Regarding the cold sores in and around mouth, extending to the nostril, are most likely due to flare-ups of old herpes simplex infection. There is no curative treatment, though it disappears almost invariably, over a period of few years.Also, oral herpes can also be associated with genital infection. You may give a trial of anti-viral course, such as acyclovir/vancyclovir which would relieve vaginal infection.Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion.

Hope it helps."},{"Patient":"I am a 52-year-old woman, 155 pounds, 5 7 , and I have several health issues, but one that remains a mystery, and that is extremely uncomfortable, is the discomfort I have in my upper abdomen when I exert myself. This is a sensation of extreme pressure in the area of my diaphragm, like I am having the wind knocked out of me, and is most extreme when I am climbing stairs or doing anything that elevates my heart rate. I can no longer do aerobic activity because of it, and I would like to be able to work my body, but this condition won t allow it. This sensation occurs right in the middle, just underneath my ribs. It feels like my stomach has been replaced with a brick--it feels weighty. I also get mildly nauseated, and it doesn t matter if I have eaten or not. It happens on an empty stomach as much as it does on a full stomach. It feels as if I ve eaten a huge meal and can t catch my breath, even if I haven t. There is also pain that I would rate anywhere between a 3 and a 6. The pain can also extend to closer to where the pancreas is, and while I have had a few cases of acute pancreatitis in the past, my blood work has not shown to be positive for it since 1996. The other mysterious thing that nobody seems to have an answer to is that I wake up in the morning with a thin lower torso, but I put a few inches on in fluid throughout the day. This is not ascites - it is all in the tissue, under the skin, surrounding my abdomen and back. This has happened every single day for the last five years, and is also worse upon exertion. High temperature can bring it on and exacerbate it too. It s so frustrating, and I have been called a hypochondriac numerous times. I was even yelled at by an ER physician when I went in with extreme PACs and a combo of bradycardia & tachycardia that wouldn t abate - something that occurs a few times a year and that makes me have to go into the ER for i.v. Lopressor. These are the things I know for sure (and I ve been tested for many, many things). I have Fibromyalgia, Osteoporosis, Ptosis (which is worse first thing in the morning but usually goes away after time), and I sometimes get these little painful blisters on my upper abdomen, under breasts, on my knees and elbows. They are red and full of liquid and very painful. They last just one or two days, and then they are little painful scabs. They flare up fairly often - usually I get them once or twice a month. Cholesterol is 240 (I ve brought it down from 283 with diet change and fish oil). I have some connective tissue issues (hypermobility and possibly Ehlers Danlos, which my daughter was diagnosed with too) and possibly Sjogren s Syndrome (Schirmer test result is 0 and I get frequent salivary gland pain and swelling, very dry mouth, and several other symptoms) although ANA tests are negative. I had a spot removed from my chest which was positive for Lupus, however, a subsequent biopsy on normal skin from the same area was negative. I also have frequent inflammation of the medial epicondyle and it s quite painful, and painful swelling in other joints. Tests for inflammation are also negative but I was diagnosed with arthritis. I have, what a couple doctors have called Myotonia, but others dispute it. When I squeeze my hand tightly for several seconds, then relax, my fingers stay gripped. They will relax over time, or I can open them with my other hand. The doctor who diagnosed it was a primary care physician, and she observed my daughter and I both showing her, and she used the little hammer and tapped on the muscle near my thumb, which caused the thumb to cramp up. However, muscle testing was negative. I get a combination of PACs, bradycardia, and tachycardia, that leaves me unable to function because I have near-syncope when it happens. I have had three major episodes in the last twelve months or so that required ER trips and i.v. Lopressor to fix it. The first time it happened that extreme was in February of 2012 and I ve had three like that since. They don t know why it happens, but I ve had heart rhythm issues for years. An ablation didn t fix it. I have frequent flare-ups that leave me unable to perform daily tasks or work on a regular basis so I have had to go on disability, which I hate. I would like to have my life back. I would also like to find a doctor who can help me figure out this mystery, which has robbed me of so much time. I can t do the things I used to do and I am kind of afraid of the daily edema, which is uncomfortable in itself. I want to find a doctor who will not look at me like I m a freak who is making it all up. I m not. Here are some pictures of the edema in my torso. You can also see pictures of the Ptosis and blisters if you go up to the top and click on the heading. WWW.WWWW.WW","Doctor":"Hi ma'am,Thanks for your query.I have gone through your detailed query very thoroughly.I am of the strong conviction that you are indeed suffering from MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY, since majority of your problems fit into this condition. I will try to solve most of your problems, if not all.Firstly, the heaviness in the center of chest and upper abdomen with minimal exertions; swelling of the lower torso during the day, is STRONGLY suggestive of failing of the entire heart along with co-existing coronary artery disease. Investigations like 2-D Echo, stress TMT/Thallium test and coronary angiography will confirm my views. Medicines like digoxin, diuretics, low-dose alpha-beta blockers (such as carvedilol), coronary vasodilators in adequate doses and ACE inhibitors in titrated doses will certainly help you.Further, the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome (also called Sick Sinus Syndrome, which is part of the manifestations of Myotonic dystrophy) can be kept under control on anti-arrhythmic drug, such as, amiodarone and, ideally a dual chamber pacemaker.Difficulty in opening fingers after sustained squeezing of fingers, as well as, transient ptosis (drooping of the eyelids), is also part of the symptoms of Myotonic Dystrophy. Perhaps, serum Potassium estimation should be periodically.Since the disease primarily affects the muscles, the intestinal smooth muscles too tend to get involved, leading to bloating, constipation, poor digestion. Perhaps, pro-kinetic drugs, such as metoclopramide + omeprazole will be of some help.For osteoporosis, adequate calcium + Vit D3 (1000mcg) daily intake will of significant benefit.Lastly, may I inform you that it is a genetic disease and has NO TREATMENT. Only symptomatic treatment can be given to relieve different problems associated with the condition.Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion/recommendations and treatment. I am certain that he will agree  with my opinion and clinical acumen;  order required tests, and- based on the reports-  will prescribe suitable treatment as advised. If you find my response helpful and informative, do not forget an “excellent” rating to my answer, to encourage all doctors- engaged in social service- to render sound advice to the FREE queries. Fond regards and have a nice day,Dr. Rakesh Karanwal"},{"Patient":"Hi , besides letrozole, please tell me what other medications are used for receptor positive breast cancer.  I am having so many side effects, I'm ready to stop the letrozole, but don't want to exchange one set of side effects for possible WORSE side effects from another medication.  Thank you, I hope you can help.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for your question.An alternative to letrozole is tamoxifen.I would advise you to discuss this with your oncologist.Wishing you good health.If you have any further questions please feel free to contact me.Best regards."},{"Patient":"My husband had bladder cancer & his bladder has been removed.

He’s taking zofran tablets for nausea but they do not help him at all.  What you recommend for him to take for the awful nausea in place of a tablet?","Doctor":"Hi,If zoffran is not working for him then I would advise you can give him Metoclopramide 10 mg x 1 tablet thrice daily. Also you can give him prednisolone 5 mg x 1 tablet daily for 5 days.I hope this will help.Wishing him good healthRegards."},{"Patient":"The results of a CT scan of my aorta came back with non specific lymph node enlargement; my aorta was fine. I have had a mastectomy on the right side close to 18 years ago with no further evidence of cancer. I’ve also had 2 knee replacements within 2 years due to severe arthritis. Otherwise I am a relatively healthy woman of 64 years old. I have been doing a little reading about enlarged lymph nodes and am not terribly alarmed, but of course the thought of breast cancer on the left side has crossed my mind. I guess I would just like a few logical reasons why my lymph nodes might be enlarged other than cancer.","Doctor":"Hi,I would advise you to see an oncologist.Enlarged lymph nodes can be with or without cancer.Its better to do a PET scan for re-assurance.The PET scan would give you the value of activity happening in the lymph node (cancerous lymph node lights up more on PET scan).I think PET would be good for reassurance.I hope it helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I think I have or am at risk for cancer and I know it takes a while for it to develop but I got birth control and everyone knows they don t mix, this isn t the first time but I ll explain most recent. The roof of my mouth is blue and yellow, my veins Are bulging everywhere even in my tonsils, trouble swallowing, and white spots. Is this serious?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for your question,I would advise you to see an ENT doctor who should do an examination of your oral cavity and throat.Regards."},{"Patient":"My husband has been bleeding from his rectum every time he goes to the bathroom. It seems to be getting worse instead of better. He has prostate cancer and is currently being seen by a doctor. Could this be Pancreatic Cancer and is that hereditary? Any suggestions or answers?","Doctor":"Hi,If the cancer spreads to the rectum then it can cause bleeding.However your husband needs a rectal examination to rule out any hemorrhoids that can be present locally which can cause bleeding.Regards."},{"Patient":"My mother is a 79 year old cancer patient, going through chemo finishing her last treatment 2 weeks ago..severe diarrhea and having to have rehydration treatments. Hemoglobin drops and has several pints of blood since the beginning. Now 2 pints of blood scheduled for tomorrow. I know nothing about nothing but I heard along time ago in Paramedic, sodium bicarbonate is helpful to patients.. all her doctors at this point want to give in mag and potassium...I like the idea of trying bicarb and baking soda. Your opinion please ?","Doctor":"Bicarbonate doesn't kill cancer cells, nor does baking soda. Sodium bicarbonate is only given in rare instances of electrolyte imbalance, in tumor lysis, etc. Potassium and magnesium are also given in electrolyte imbalance only. nothing to do with cancer."},{"Patient":"Upper abdomen very painful and swell, distended for 3 weeks, no pain on lower abdomen at all until appendix ruptured very suddenly. Had surgery, however surgical oncologist is putting me through ct scans finding many tumors, in right lung adrenal glands have tumors as well as colon, soon to have biopsy. Also checking breasts with mammogram and ultrasound. Does she suspect cancer somewhere in my body? I am 56 years old and have lupus.","Doctor":"you seem to have lesions in lungs and other organs. Definite diagnosis of malignancy can be made only by biopsy. Colon cancer can spread to lungs but lung cancer doesn't show masses in colon. If there are multiple lesions all over with good patient wellbeing, cancer is unlikely."},{"Patient":"My loved one (age 51) has colon cancer mets to liver. just diagnosed after having painful symptoms, a colonoscopy and liver biopsy. he is receiving chemo. since there is no cure, what is the likely prognosis? I have no reports or images to provide. In addition to chemo, would you recommend any naturopathic medicine? even medical marijuana if pain was not relieved? YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"The prognosis for colon cancer has improved over the years with targeted agents. Even in stage 4, with good response to chemotherapy, surgery can be attempted. both lesions in colon and liver can be resected. Median survival is around 2to 3years."},{"Patient":"Hey Doctor, Please Help I am Unable to Sleep and I am totally in fear. 7 Days Back I was smoking Cigrate I am not heavily smoker.

Usually insidious in onset. Except some rare variants but such rare variants have systemic symptoms also. Better to get throat swab for culture and then start appropriate antibiotics. if symptoms still do not subside and a mass is seen, then get a biopsy done.  Just worrying will not solve the problems.Take care"},{"Patient":"My son is having thyroid surgery now. It is half over and they have said he has multiple lymph nodes involved. It is papillary cancer. One of my daughters and my husband have also had this cancer. They are fine. No lymph node involvement. What is his prognosis as compared to theirs? And thank you, Audrey","Doctor":"She needs a radioiodine scan after surgery. Initially a diagnostic scan. If the scan shows uptake, then therapeutic radioiodine scan needs to be done. This will ablate all the remnant tissues. once this is done, she is put on follow up. Papillary carcinoma thyroid has a very good prognosis. Most do not die with this disease. In one series cancer related mortality in non metastatic disease is  only 6% after 16years."},{"Patient":"I feel sick to my tummy all the time, haven't vomit yet, food makes me sick, I gained weight, hard to breath sometimes, sharp pain in side when I bend over to pick somethimg up, acid run up my throat when I lay down, muscles twitchy, tired all the time.

You need to get tests done again. Colonoscopy and CT or PET CT. If all these are negative and if there is no disease, other causes need to be checked. Since you are losing blood in stools, it reduces hemoglobin and causes fatigue. Hemoglobin levels need to be corrected. Iron supplements or packed cells transfusion as per hemoglobin level."},{"Patient":"Thank you for offering your help. I am interested in the use of Saffron to fight/slow the spread of cancer.

I am a snuff dipper (up to 2 cans a day) , but I m also a paraplegic w/ serious constipation issues, which I understand can be a cause of a greenish tongue. Is this likely to be oral cancer?","Doctor":"oral cancer usually manifests as a nodule or ulcer. An ulcer that doesn't heal with antibiotics with induration beneath warrants further studies like biopsy. Just a discoloration without induration or ulceration can be safely ignored. But make sure all bad habits are left in order not to have any risk in future."},{"Patient":"My husband gets pains on the left side of the navel, but lower, where we think the prostate is, we were told by a doctoe that he thinks he has prostate cancer because of a lesion on his c-3 in the neck, he had a act scan 3 wks. ago, because he fell off a aldder. Could it be possible he has prostate cancer? Thank You, Carmella Kessler","Doctor":"Prostrate cancer can be easily picked up with tests that image abdomen like MRI, CT or PET scan followed by biopsy of suspicious lesion.

Though Inflammatory bowel disease has a slightly higher risk of cancer, it is not absolute that all patients with IBS will have cancer. Go for regular screening tests.

I can t stop mashing to find this thing. Help.","Doctor":"You said you are in remission now. That means you must be having history of cancer. If you have  history of cancer biopsy of the enlarged node needs to be done. Else you can take a course of antibiotics and wait till sinus discharge subsides.

But you have not mentioned what lymphoma it is. lymphomas usually respond fast but aggressive types also recur fast. In cases of recurrence, chemo is unlikely to respond quickly. All treatment is by a protocol. let them complete the protocol and then reevaluate."},{"Patient":"I've seen a gastrointestinal consultant about pains in the lower left abdomen in a similar position to where I had a hernia repaired 20 years ago.  The pains are also accompanied by severe wind.  The hernia was a congenital inguinal hernia that was accompanied by a hydrocoele.  The consultant has carried out a CT scan and a colonoscopy and ruled out a reoccurence of the hernia.  He says there is a little evidence of wear to the bowel but nothing serious.  However, the pain is there.  Both the pain and the wind sometime get less but at other times they are both severe.  My family doctor says I also have a left hand variocoele, which may or may not be related, though it too causes quite a bit of discomfort at times.  I am occassionally feeling the need to pass water more frequently but this sensation isn't always present.  All these symptoms feel very similar to my original hernia and the pain is in a similar place but have had no more than the occassional bit of discomfort since the original surgery.  I'm therefore still worried it may be something else.  I'm happy to accept I don't have a serious bowel problem but something is not right.  I don't know what to do.","Doctor":"if everything is normal you may have food protein allergyget allergy doctor consultation who can find by blood serum test to which protein you are allergic and after witrhdrawl of protein will be better"},{"Patient":"Hello, my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (tumor in the head) in the beginning of June. 2 weeks after he underwent Whipple procedure.

Till he started chemo with Gemzar. 3 infusions after and he is now with severe abdomen pain radiating to his back (left side). Is it the cacer progressing or it could be a side effect of the chemo? We got used to the fever and the mild edema but the abd pain?

Would a testosterone treatment be adviceable or could it bring the cancer back? I am 84 years old but look 60.","Doctor":"The main driver behind Prostrate cancer is testosterone and all treatment first aims at bringing testosterone levels to castrate levels. This leaves impotency as a consequence. But you are fortunate that the disease is under control. Taking testosterone injections is not advisable. Remember life is more important than anything else.

My gastroenterologist suggest the FOD MAP diet as a guideline. I just wondered if there was any diet suggest strictly for whipple surgery patients. Thank you","Doctor":"There are no strict diet guidelines in cancer patients. But in those undergoing chemotherapy, cooked food instead of preserved food is preferable. Preservation increases the risk of infections. You said surgery was done four years ago. Now no strict dietary measures are required but it is advisable to take small frequent means. Also make sure to include more of fruits and vegetables in your diet."},{"Patient":"My 61 yr old daughter was recently diagnosed with Stomach cancer. Surgery was performed, and she had her first Chemo treatment this past week. The surgery went well, but, there was one small area that the doctor was unable to reach. Her next treatment is in 3 weeks. I read an article which claimed that H86 was having good results and with no side effects.

I experienced hemorrhaging and they did a D&C for a biopsy. I believe I ignored some signs of exhaustion and low back pain in July, with a diagnosis early September. Since this is an aggressive type of cancer, have I waited so long that it will be invasive?","Doctor":"Prediction to cancer in not in our hands.

Is the wallowing difficulty a side effect from shingles on his scalp? 2. How does the doctor diagnosis a virus versus a bacterial infection? 3. Best treatment for throat virus. Thank you.","Doctor":"answer to question one: Shingles on scalp are unlikely to cause throat pain. nerve supply to scalp is different from that of throat. pain is perceived by nerve endings. since nerve supply is different, throat pain is not caused by scalp disease.2.
