I took it about 30 minutes after having sex. And then I took the second pill 12 hours later. 3 days after that I got like another period that lasted 3 days. It couldn't have been spotting because it was too heavy, or maybe it could have. I don't really know. Well when I was supposed to start my period I got some cramps in my lower back but my period never came. I took a pregnancy test a couple days after my missed period and then another one a couple days after that. Both of them were negative. I am now 20 days late and I'm getting spotting. Am I pregnant? Or is it from plan b? I'm super stressed out too because I over analyze everything. I CAN'T be pregnant. My parents would execute. Somebody help me?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. It is very common and normal to have yourcycle be abnormal after using plan B. You used the product immediately after your condom accident which also has the greatest chance of preventing pregnancy. Many women have a small amount of bleeding a few days after taking the pills, this is a good sign that it worked. And you have done many negative pregnancy tests.So I really do not think you need to worry about pregnancy from this particular encounter. It will probably take until your next real cycle for your period to come again normally.I hope this information was helpful and thaf I was able to answer your question.

It is not all the time and i noticed it wasn t so bad the week that i forgot to take my pregnacare vitamins. Could this just be coincidence and is it anything to worry about?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Most women experience constipation from both the hormones of pregnancy and fromtaking vitamins, because they also tend to cause constipation. But everyone reacts to different medications differently, and the particular brand of vitamin you are using may be hard to digest. I suggest you just try a different brand of prenatal vitamin. There is nothing to worry about if you have looser stools as long as they do not contain blood or are not completely watery diarrhea, or causing severe abdominal pain.

The fumes from bleach may be caustic to your eyes and nose, but they will not harm the baby. However, if you are not feeling the baby move well, you should go somewhere well ventilated and quiet, lie on your left side, and eat or drink something cold. Monitor the baby's movements- if you do not feel the baby move at least six times in the next hour, I suggest you call your delivering provider for advice or go to the hospital to make sure the baby is ok.

Could you suggest if Ovacare will assist me in the hormone production or you recommend any other tablet?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.A low FSH is actually a good thing and means that you likely ovulate have normal estrogen levels.  If you menstruate regularly, it also means that you likely ovulate.Ovacare has nothing to do with helping you get pregnant, or hormone production- it is just a vitamin supplement recommended for women to take while trying to conceive to provide adequate levels at conception.So 80 percent of couples will conceive by one year if they have regular unprotected intercourse at least 3 days a week.  If you do not conceive by 9 months or so, it would be reasonable to see a fertility specialist for evaluation, which would also include your partner, since 50 percent of the time it can be a male factor.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Bets wishes, and good luck conceiving, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Should I get pregnant agin?

The reasons are..Anti D (Rhogam ) is not given in abortion less than 12 weeks .Anti D is most effective 72 hours after sensitizing event(Abortion,fetal death,delivery ,trauma to abdomen), but can be given upto 10 days.Also, before you worry so much, I would like to know your partners blood group, if he is also Rh negative you need not worry at all.Even if he is Rh postive but heterozygous to Rh there is a 50% chance that your baby will Rh negative and you will not need Anti D.It is not at all dangerous for you to get pregnant. You can consider getting pregnant as soon as you are mentally and physically ready.You could inform the obstetrician in next pregnancy and she could check fetal Rh by a technology called Cell-free fetal DNA. If this confirms that your baby is Rh negative, then you don't need extra monitoring. If this shows the baby is Rh positive, she could monitor you and inform the neonatalogist when baby is born. Also take Anti D then after delivery if baby is Rh positive.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 35 weeks pregnant and in colour doppler ultrasound doctor found a single lose loop of cord around baby's neck.

I m pregnant with my second baby. My first pregnancy I was diagnosed with having low blood plates. Throughout the pregnancy they went down further and further. When I went in for my induction they were at 60,000. I tried for a natural birth but ended up having to have a c section. They really didn t want to with risk of me bleeding a lot. But I ended up bleeding normal. Well I just went in the other week for my first appointment and they checked my blood and said that my blood plates are already down to 120,000. I know the normal is 150,000. So my question is if they end up being so low again s my risk really high again? Or since I bleed normal the last time I will do so again? And I m probably going to have to do another c section and I m scared. Could I try for a natural birth? Just curious. Thmks so much.","Doctor":"Hi,You probably have a condition called Gestational Thrombocytopenia.In this the platelets count comes down due to pregnancy, but after delivery it goes back to normal .So you need not worry about, and if counts are above 50,000 it is generally considered safe, with no extra risk of bleeding. But before we diagnose gestational thrombocytopenia, we need to rule out other causes of low platelets like pregnancy induced hypertension, immune thrombocytopenia which can affect the pregnancy.Do you have a high BP? Edema? Tendency to bleed more?With one previous cesarean you can definitely try for vaginal birth after CS. The chances of success are close to 75%. If you have gestational thrombocytopenia it is unlikely you will bleed in excess after delivery.But it would to be wise to deliver at a center where blood and platelets are readily available if required.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"OK well my girlfriend and I had sex about 3 weeks ago and the condom broke.

There is not much that can be done other than to wait and see if she is not telling the truth, but at least you can be reassured that the morning after pill is very effective.I hope this information was reassuring and that it answers your question.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"i am getting my follicular ultrasound done today...i am 23 and trying to concieve for the past 4 months..i have regular periods..and i am on my 13th day of the cycle today..we had sex yesterday..will a follicular study today reveal if i have concieved today ?","Doctor":"Hi,A follicular study shows the development of the egg in the follicle, and can indicate the size of the follicle and can identify when the follicle ruptures.It cannot say if fertilization has occurred or not.Have you taken ovulation induction as well? If you have been trying for 4 months only, I would advice you to wait for 1 year, as most couples(85%) conceive in a years time on their own. The remaining need to be evaluated for the cause and then treated.The most likely period to conceive is 36 hours after the follicle ruptures.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

An ultrasound done in the first three months of pregnancy is more reliable to date the pregnancy than even the dates of missed period. We now consider the date as calculated from the first ultrasound more accurate.So it is very much advisable if you went for a scan as soon as possible. Also take folic acid if not taking already. Better to get checked, especially since you have had a history of miscarriage.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello.

Avoid tight clothing, use moisturizer cream, avoid soaps and deodorant that cause allergy. Use tablet Cetrizine twice a day for five days.

Your wife is just completing her 3 months after this stage vomiting usually stops.Possibly,she would the eat well/ digest food & regain her health back.

The position of the head or a sharp body part (like a knee) can hit your sciatic nerve, which exits your pelvis in an area near your lower buttcoks.Lying down and elevating your legs can help relieve this, or wearing an abdominal support (like a girdle or pregnancy \\"belly band\\"- sold in Western maternity stores) can support the baby and take pressure off your pelvis.I hope I was able to answer your question and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hi im 35 weeks pregnant and have been suffereing with tummy pains and diaroeah for 11 days now. the first time i had contraction-like pains for 3 hours with the diaroeah. In the last 2 days my stools have changed to a more solid state but with mucous. Should i be worried?","Doctor":"Hello, and i hope I can help you today.I do not know what area of the world you are located, but diarrhea for 11 days can be caused by intestinal bacteria and parasites that have nothing to do with pregnancy.  Even in Western countries there are forms of infectious diarrhea or forms of colitis that can cause these symptoms and they are unlikely to be due to pregnancy alone.You really need an evaluation by a physician and a stool sample analyzed in a laboratory to make an accurate diagnosis.  If you are having contractions, you also really should be evaluated by your OB as well to rule out premature labor.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that you follow my advice and see a physician for a proper evaluation and treatment.Best wishes for the rest of your pregnancy, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am in my 1st trimester in pregnancy (5th pregnancy). After giving birth to my youngest 18months ago, I developed a painful leg with swelling and was given clexane and a scan which turned out not to be a clot. I have just noticed it s hurting my leg to walk so have had a look and it s a big bruise looking vein, should I be concerned? I ve had previous DVT and about a stone overweight.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If you had a DVT before during pregnancy, you do have an increased risk of recurrence.  Women who have a history of DVT during pregnancy also should be on DVT prophylaxis to prevent clots if you don't already have one.  So you should see an OB or especially a perinatologist (high-risk specialist) who is comfortable prescribing Heparin (or similar medication) and you will need to begin preventative injections.However, DVT by definition is a deep vein thrombosis, which means the veins you can see are not DVT's.  If they become clotted, the treatment is warm compresses as much as possible, leg elevation and wearing support stockings.  So I do not think your symptoms now are due to DVT, however you do need to be on preventive medication for safety for the rest of the pregnancy.I hope this information was helpful and that I answered your question adequately.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. BrownHowever,"},{"Patient":"The first day of my last menstrual cycle was September 21.  I had sex on September 30, October 3 and several time after.  I have a 32 day cycle.  Could I have gotten pregnant on September 30 or October 3rd? I am trying to figure out the closest possible due date.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Contrary to what many women think- ovulation does not occur on day 14 of a women's cycle... it happens 14 days before the start of your period.So if you have a 32 day cycle and your last period was September 21, you likely ovulated 14 days before your period would be due for October (the 23rd) which means you likely ovulated around Oct. 9th.The bst way to know for sure, however, is with an ultrasound (you must wait until at least 5-6 weeks of pregnancy) which can measure the fetus and make the most accurate estimate of your due date.I hope this information was helpful, and best wishes for the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am 4 days late on my period and have no signs that it is coming. I have a pretty regular schedule, so it s weird that it is late... I have been having slight mild cramps, nausea, fatigue, backaches and headaches, increase in appetitie, frequent urination, and thick white vaginal discharge. Could I be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If you are having unprotected intercourse, then you have a risk of pregnancy.However, pregnancy symptoms vary widely in women, and the majority of women have no symptoms at all other than a missed period.  And your period can even be delayed from the stress of worrying about pregnancy.All of your symptoms can be caused by other reasons, including vaginal and urine infections and premenstrual syndrome.So the only reliable way to know is to perform a commercially available urine pregnancy test and follow the directions.  Your first urine of the morning has the highest hormone concentration and is most reliable for testing.I hope this answer was helpful and best of luck with your situation.Sincerely, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"im in the 6th month of pregnancy and experience very bad catch/cramps in the groin region wenever i get up from a sitting position lasts for about 10-15 mins before i can straighten up and walk straight is that normal and wat shud i do to prevent them.","Doctor":"Hi,   I understand your concern.   The cramps/catch in groin while walking/ straightening up .. is mostly due to pressure on nerves in groin by growing fetus .. this in turn leads to muscle pull causing the symptom.    This usually disappears when the baby grows.. & occupies abdominal cavity.. to return back as baby' head is fixed in pelvis in 9th month.

So you may resume trying to conceive as you wish.However, Bartholin's cysts tend to come back.  If you start to notice swelling in the area or discomfort, immediately begin daily warm baths or application of hot compresses twice a day.

The stress and anxiety about trying to conceive can even delay your cycle.So- try to relax and just keep trying.  Having intercourse every other day is actually more effective than every day, because it helps to maximize the sperm count in each ejaculate.  If you do not menstruate for a while, I recommend doing a pregnancy test every two weeks.  If you miss your menses for more than 3 months and are not pregnant, I would see a GYN doctor for evaluation.80 percent of couples will conceive within one year.

I am 35 years old, I have had 2 healthy pregnancies in the past and never miscarried before. Could I be miscarrying and what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Unfortunately your symptoms are consistent with miscarriage, and because you are having pain on one side- there is also a possibility of a tubal pregnancy (unless you already had an ultrasound that saw the pregnancy in your uterus)Either way, you need an urgent medical evaluation.  The most efficient way to do this- and get all the tests you need right away; including a blood test for the hormone level of your pregnancy and a pelvic ultrasound- is to go to a local emergency room.  I am sorry that the prognosis of this pregnancy looks bleak, but nothing can be done to prevent miscarriage once the body has started the process.  At the age of 35, one in 7 pregnancies will miscarry.

Basically, my question is, should I be worried, am feeling so ill, naturally I am worried about my baby?  Any reassurance /advice would be gratefully received.  Thanks!","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Unfortunately, being pregnant does not mean you cannot get sick like anyone else.  Pregnant women get much sicker from the flu than other demographics, because their large belly makes it harder to cough and their body caring for the baby drains their energy.However, your body is designed to protect the baby. And regarding your blood test, it is normal for your alkaline phosphatase to be elevated in pregnancy.But if you have not been officially diagnosed with the flu, or have not had an evaluation of the baby since you started feeling sick, I strongly suggest you go to the hospital for evaluation for you and the baby.  There are other conditions that can cause shivers and fatigue during pregnancy, and if you have a fever higher than 104 (or 40 Celsius) it can harm the baby's hearing.  So please get a full medical evaluation as soon as possible if you have not yet done so.  In the meantime, you can safely take Tylenol (Acetaminophen) or Paracetamol at the regular adult dosage safely while pregnant.  Also drink lots of fluids and try to rest as much as possible.I hope you get appropriate medical care to make sure you're OK (and the baby too)Best wishes for your health and the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi.

Two days later i had sex with friend B, we did it twice in a row, but both times he didnt come in me. and i took \\"the morning after pill\\" the day after. So after that i had my period on the 9th or 10th of july (dont remember exactly). After this i have only had sex with friend A, havent had sex with friend B since that one day on the 28th/29th of june.. On august 5th when i should have gotten my period ( i have a cycle of 27 days every month ) I did a clear blue indicator test and it said was conceived 1-2 weeks, which means i was 4 weeks pregnant at the time. Period stayed away, i only had a little bit of brown blood like 2 weeks later when i was about 7 weeks if i remember correctly. I had an ultra sound on sept 2nd and my gyn told me i was 7 weeks and 5 days. I am so worried the period i had on the 9th of july wasnt a real period at all ( if i remember correctly i had it for about 3 days which i almost always have when on my period. but i dont remember if it was as heavy as regular ), and i am contstantly telling myself the indicator from clear blue can be wrong as well... I have also smoked cigarettes ( i stopped when i was 8 weeks ) so now im also telling myself because of the smoke the baby was smaller then she should be and that she wasnt really 7 weeks but more like 11 weeks from the month before...

Thank you for your help in advance.","Doctor":"Hi,You are pregnant with friend A, and your last menstrual period was on 9/10 of July. This corresponds to your ultrasound dates and your urine pregnancy result as well.Do not be anxious about it. Though the baby forms only after ovulation, the pregnancy is always calculated from the last period day, which might be confusing you.Do not worry and the early pregnancy ultrasounds are very accurate in diagnosing the exact dates of pregnancy .You were wise to stop smoking, but smoking will not cause the early fetus to shrink as you have described. Smoking usually causes the baby in the last trimester to be underweight by 500 gms or so.It doesn't affect so early in pregnancy.

You had sex on your 4th dauy of menses.. that too without penetration, just rubbing with possibility of precum being rubbed. Let me tell you, precum   has possibility of having few sperms.. which are less likely to enter vagina in given circumstances.  And even if they do, they can not cause pregnancy on 4th day of menses. ( pregnancy is possible around 14th day before expected day of periods.)   So, be relaxed you have least possibility of pregnancy.   Still as you seem to be aware never have an unprotected sex hence forth.   Do use  at least barrier method  or regular ( oral contraceptive ).. as per your sex frequency.. according to a gynecologist's advise .

These infections are more likely to happen in initial weeks. Since you have had them twice already in this pregnancy, you should get fully evaluated including renal function tests which include serum creatinine, urea and also get a renal ultrasound, which could detect any stone or abnormality .Also you may have to consider long term antibiotics to prevent the infection from recurring. For this a opinion from a renal physician will be required.Please get the infection treated promptly as not treating it can have a negative impact on the pregnancy, lead into preterm,hypertension in pregnancy.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"can bromergon help reduce my high prolactin levels and can i get pregnant while taking the tabs. also what are the side effects of the tablets, i had a fibroid op 9 months ago and still having lots of milky secretions from both breast and still cant get pregnant","Doctor":"Hi dear, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns.Bromocriptine is the drug to reduce the levels of prolactin and it is quite effective in its action.It has side effects like gastric upset, dizziness, nausea.Inability to conceive and milk secretion from both the breasts are suggestive of increased prolactin levels and Bromocriptine is the correct medicine for its treatment.Hope you found the answer helpful.Dr Deepti Verma"},{"Patient":"I was at stationed at Camp Lejeune doing the contaminated water crisis in the 70s and 80 80s I was diagnosed with urethritis prostatitis I had a drip discharge from my penis and they gave me antibiotics but it didn t solve the issue because I still continue to have the drip because I feel that these issues were caused by the contaminated water more information than bacterial infection I m in my sixties now and was diagnosed with cancer prostate cancer is it possible that that could have been the cause of my prostate cancer I still after today I still have a penile discharge","Doctor":"Hi, You have to know the difference between prostatitis like prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland; the four types are acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, chronic (nonbacterial) prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis.

Better to rule it out with internal check up by your obstetrician.  Diarrhea with jelly like substance in stools suggests infection. Also mild abdominal pain through out day might come from bowel infection. Please consult your doctor & get proper medication for diarrhea .

Pancreatits can be a life-threatening condition of it is not diagnosed and treated properly. Even if you had your gallbladder out, thickening of your bile can still cause blockages and pancreatitis.

If you have symptoms of upper abdominal or back pain, and nausea, you really should go to an emergency room to be evaluated... I find it difficult to believe your insurance doesn't cover even a regular visit to a medical doctor to evaluate your symptoms.

Excessive white discharge can be a feature of pregnancy as well as premenstrual. You are right in asking whether your habits can harm the baby if you are pregnant. Yes, they can and you should avoid them. If you follow healthy habits from now on, if you are pregnant, there is not much to be worried about possible harm to the fetus since you are in very early pregnancy. Regular follow up, proper diet, rest, medication and periodic sonograms are needed.

There can be slight variations in the menstrual cycle occasionally due to transient hormone imbalances which often settle down in a couple of cycles.

It is not the exact value of the titres that is important, because, these values can vary with each individual, but, the way they rise. Doubling titres every 2-3 days are suggestive of good progress in the pregnancy. This can be coupled with serial sonograms to detect the status of the pregnancy.

Most commonly gonococcus or E. coli or Chlamydia may present like this. Until examination is done it is difficult to say what it is. Please get urine examination and culture, collecting the secretions of the prostate by milking it then send for microscopy and culture.

He removed the adhesions during my surgery and told me that i had nothing to worry about. I read further and seen that it could cause infertility. I have never been pregnant and now i am thinking this may be why. Is it possible for me still to have a child??","Doctor":"Hi,Fitz Hugh Curtis syndrome is caused by chlamydia. Chlamydia can affect fallopian tubes and if you have evidence of infection/adhesion on surgery, you need to confirm the patency of the tubes. This can be done by HSG (hysterosallphingo graphy ) or laparoscopically by dye,the added advantage of laparoscopy is adhesiolysis and if the tubes are blocked cannulation can be attempted simultaneously.But if blockage of both tubes is identified then IVF could be a  better optionHope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"im abit confused because im suppose to be 15 weeks pregnant today but when i went scan last week my sac was empty and only measured 28.7mm just wanted to know how many weeks should you be for that measurement... i have been given no information but have looked up what could be wrong...","Doctor":"Hi,If at more than 20mm, the gestational sac is empty then you have a missed abortion,especially since its also quite a while since your last period.Please get a repeat scan done and if the findings are same and no fetal pole is seen, then it is best that you go for a medical miscarriage under the guidance of gynaecologist. You will also need to do a few blood test before taking the medication for miscarraige.Sorry about the bad news.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, My name is Mandy. I am 31 years old. I have been having pain on and off for about 4 days in my pelvic area. I have the symptoms of a UTI, but am also having symptoms of pregnancy. the pain is getting more prominent, and I am feeling bloated. My stomach feels swollen. I have endometriosis, and I had an ovarian torsion on my right ovary in 2009. with the removal of my right ovary. weve been trying to get pregnant for 4 years. with 1 miscarriage in Jan. 2010. after researching my symptoms, its saying it could be an eptopic pregnancy. My period is 2 days late. I know thats not much, but it is late. I feel pressure also. the reason i am worried about this. is because the pain I am experiencing is different from the other pain that I experience. and the pain is different than a uti also. but I have that pressure feeling like a uti. along with a sharp nagging pain. and cramping. Do I need to seek emergency care? or wait to see my doctor in 2 weeks?","Doctor":"Hi,Please do an urine pregnancy test urgently and if positive see a doctor immediately. History of endometriosis and previous surgery in pelvic area makes the chances of adhesion and thus chance of ectopic pregnancy more common. Also if pregnancy test negative, test for urine routine microscopy and if infection present take appropriate antibiotics.You cannot neglect sharp pain and so should get medical help as soon as possible.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Ive been in the middle of an IVF cycle and I was scheduled for retrieval on Tuesday. I took hcg at 10 pm on Sunday night. And cycle was cancelled on Monday because my husband could not make it in town in time for sample. My question is could I possibly get pregnant naturally with my 20 plus follicles..","Doctor":"Hi,Yes it is possible for you to get pregnant naturally, but also chances of multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy and heterotopic pregnancy are more.I would advise you to have the option sperm banking and use of the frozen sperms for IVf if husband cannot be available on the day of retreival.

But if your baby doesn't have any other significant finding on ultrasound and the structure of heart seems normal, then you need not have to worry. It is more difficult to see ultrasound findings in women who are overweight or obese, than thin.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I started having pain in the right testicle with some swelling, I m due to go to the va Friday but have a two day drive, will it bee ok to wait that long and what is the worst case scenario if I wait.

You can definitely take other medications which will be more helpful and help with the cough. At 34 weeks your babies are quite mature and you need not worry about affecting them with the side effects of the medications.You will require a good anti-tussive cough syrup, and also probably antibiotics, especially if you have been having the cough for long.Do not worry about these affecting your baby ,as maternal health is very important for babies health and development. Only if you are fit can the delivery of the babies be uneventful, if you don't recover well, then it may complicate delivery.Also, if at all the chest physician requests an X-ray, do not hesitate to get it done ,with an abdominal shield .Proper diagnosis will help in recovery.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"HI YA i am 29 weeks pregnant and have rencently had my last midwife appmt.

Will he put me on it since I am unmarried?","Doctor":"Hi,You will need to try and further reduce your BMI. This not only increases your chances of a pregnancy but also lesser chance of complications during pregnancy. Also water pill should not be taken during pregnancy as it can affect the baby. This medication has to be changed before you plan a pregnancy. Since you are not having a normal period on your own, you will need ovulation induction with either clomiphene or injectible gonadotrophin if clomiphene doesn't work ,but before that you need to rule out all other factors, such as male,tubal.Unmarried status should not be an issue.So, first step would be to consult your doctor and change your water pills.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hi, my last period was on 27th nov '10. i have a 29 days cycle, i always have a regular cycle, but this month my periods have still not come. i feel the period cramps and tiredness but no periods, could pregnancy be the reason, for how long should i wait to get the test done. thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Healthcare Magic.I am Dr Ramadevi Wani.

Since you are in the early weeks of pregnancy when organogenesis or organ formation begins, it is not safe to use any medication to relieve your symptoms. Instead, you can use simple techniques such as a hot bath at bed time, a glass of milk, reading some book which you are fond of or listening to some soft music to ease your nerves, avoid all anxiety and restless thoughts, breathing exercises etc. You can also set your sleep timings to when you can sleep sound breaking from the usual routine.

Any idea what would cause this pain? Would a warm cloth help ease it for her if it happens again. The wrist & elbow pain are better, but the armpit discomfort continues.","Doctor":"Hi.Armpit discomfort could be due to a hormonal fluctuation resulting from pregnancy, as the lymph nodes leading to the breast lie in the armpit region.

Home pregnancy tests read well when performed 3-7 days after a missed period with a fresh early morning sample of urine. If you did not do this way, please repeat the test this way. If still in doubt, you can go for the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres and a trans-vaginal sonogram. Please remember, an early pregnancy cannot be felt over the abdomen as the uterus is still in the pelvis until 12 weeks.

We have put up new drywall, painted (with Olympic paint((zero VOC)), put down new carpet in the whole basement, in which titebond glue was used to put the tac strip down (high 200 VOC) as well as a wooden beam was stained with a water based polyurethane ((high 200 VOC)). We have ventilated as much as possible, I wore a repirator mask some of the time as well as I have been staying upstairs. However, the smells still dissipate to the upstairs.

I would think that a hormonal cause is more likely, and if that is the case then we cannot really do much about it until you deliver.

Phimosis is a very common problem. In most of the cases you can clear the problem yourself. Phimosis could cause moderate to severe pain while having vaginal intercourse. Apply oil on your foreskin and on the glans. Move the foreskin forward and back slowly without hurting you much. Because the oil is lubricant, it will be easier than without oil. Do this forward and back movement 20 times several times in a day. Repeat the same every day for around one month. You will get the elasticity and you will be able to retract the foreskin completely. In case if there is no result from the above massage, you can always go for a minor surgical procedure called circumcision. Therefore I suggest consulting a skin specialist for physical examination, diagnosis and treatment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards, Dr. K.

In addition to these, various systemic diseases can also manifest with itching. It could also be due to  some liver problems like cholestasisI would advise you to do certain lab tests like CBC, absolute eosinophilic count, liver function tests (to rule out suspected cholestasis of pregnancy).A physician consultation is then recommended.Meanwhile you can use calamine lotion on the affected area which is a safe medication during pregnancy.Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"Hi, me and my wife are planning to have a baby. her last periods started on 28 jan. we are having unprotected sex since then. three days back she has got a tooth extracted from dentist and has been given crocin and some other tablets for five days. are these safe to have in case she has concieved?","Doctor":"HiI can understand your concern for the safety of Crocin during early pregnancy.Yes, Crocin (Paracetamol) is safe during early pregnancy.Since you did not mention about the prescribed antibiotics, whether it is used before the tooth extraction or prescribed after the tooth extraction?Generally antibiotics like Amoxicillin, Ampicillin and Cephalexine are safe during pregnancy and should be taken only if there is a genuine indication.Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"Hey ive missed my shot by 5 days and have still continued to have unprotected sex and he doesnt [pull out] im suddenly experiencing tender sore breasts, drowisness, certain smells make me gag, tiredness, back aches, weight gain. this is my second shot & i missed it. could i be pregnant?","Doctor":"HiDr. Purushottam welcomes you to HCM virtual clinic!Thanks for consulting at my virtual clinic.

My query is: Is it normal to use all the above mentioned medicines..are there any side effects on the baby....expecting your response, thanks a lot (0000)","Doctor":"Hello Ms. Megha,All these medications have been used during pregnancy with no reported untoward effects. In view of your past obstetric history, your doctor has prescribed chorionic gonadotropin injections to help sustain the pregnancy until the placenta takes over the function of hormone production. This is why progesterone supplementation also is being used. Metformin is prescribed when insulin resistance is seen as in PCOD to prevent abortions and gestational diabetes. Duvadilan is a uterine muscle relaxant. Please do not worry, you are on the right track.

Initially there were a few concerns that repeated sonography in first few months can affect, but no substantial scientific evidence has come to show that it can affect.So it is safe ,but not advised unless there is an indication for it .Since both you and your partner are fine, it is very unlikely that your baby will have any birth defects, especially if the 20 week scan has been normal.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am suffering from Hematospermia (Blood in semen) since December 2015.

Your doctor will also help you with a few modalities of treatment to help prevent that.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been told i have low amniotic fliud at 36 weeks pregnant and i have had a torturous cough for months now and i have leaked what i hope is urine, on many occassion and i am constantly coughing up clear or white frothy sputum.

Can I go for IVF treatment in May without using any medicines if all results comply with fertilization? How much does it cost in Kuwait to go for IVF?

There is also increased pelvic pressure owing to the enlarging uterus. Together, these can cause varices of the rectum and anal canal which may bleed on pressure while defecation. Infections of the bowel also can lead to such symptoms. You can see a surgeon for a local careful examination to rule out any external or internal hemorrhoids and fissures.

While breastfeeding, you should not give only nipple to the baby to suck. Baby's lips should rest around the areola and nipple with areole should enter baby's mouth. Thus  the baby roles the tongue under the nipple with pressure on areole.  This way baby gets milk without getting fatigued.    By sucking the nipples only, the milk flow is only by baby's suction and the baby gets fatigued. this leads to incomplete emptying of the breasts. Emptier the breasts, more the milk is formed. After baby is fed on one side, should be held vertically on mothers shoulders to burp so that the trapped air gets expelled and the baby drinks more milk. Your history suggests that you do not have problem in producing the milk. It seems the faulty technique of suckling is causing the problem. After feeding the baby, if any milk is left behind, it should be squeezed out to empty the breasts. The expressed milk may be preserved or you may drink it. Arrowroot powder helps more milk secretion, does not disfigure the breasts after breastfeeding and even takes care of falling hair also.  I hope this helps you in brestfeedin your baby"},{"Patient":"i went to my dr on friday as i am 21 days late from my period and been trying for a baby for 1 year. i have had 2 negative home pregnancy tests.

It did not occur with the first two. A few times with the last one. This is occuring much more frequently with this one.

Iron supplements are necessary if haemoglobin is less than 11gm/dl.If iron is low and you are not able to tolerate oral, you can take injectable iron also .This discontinuation will not affect baby in any way.So do not worry if you are not able to iron and calcium.Another advise is to take diet rich in iron and calcium.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi I m 26 and had my tubes tied 2 years ago.

After breaking water, usually woman starts labour pains. However, if she does not go in labour naturally, there is a risk of infection which may prove to be dangerous for the baby. So please do not waste time. In the hospital, they will wait for due time if they find it safe and will induce the labour at the appropriate time. Let the Obstetrician take the decision and no one else. Mostly you will be given oxytocin injection slowly in the parenteral drip to induce the labour. If all the water has been drained out and it has become dry labour, you might have to undergo caesarean section.

That is why it was used to induce labor pains in past. Only thing is it leads to sever loose motions.. & wealness due to dehydration.    In modern medicines we have better drugs to induce labor pains .. so better to avoid caster oil.

There is also increased risk of miscarriage and fetal problems.The baby may be large which can cause more chances of cesarean ,and also bleeding after birth. So, depending on your BMI calculated with weight/(Height )2 , I would advise weight loss before embarking on the pregnancy.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello sir...... my gf and i had a oral sex yesterday...... and now she is  not feeling well.... means she had stomach pain and also omitting... is there any chance of pregnancy ??? plzzzz help me out.... and if so what is the solution for avoiing it???","Doctor":"Hello and I hope I can help you today. You do not need to worry sir- there is no chance of pregnancy from oral sex. A woman can only get pregnant if semen gets inside her vagina or very close to the opening. I hope this reassures you and that your girlfriend feels better. She is probably ill from something else and please let her know it is not possible for her to be pregnant if she is worried about it. The stress from worrying can make her feel sick so I hope this information is helpful.

I know that can happen when women get further along in their pregnancy, so that is not what I am worried about.  I am wondering though, is it a problem if my husband sucks on my breasts during foreplay?  It probably only happens about twice a week.","Doctor":"Hello and I hope I can help you today. It is true it is not harmful to have early lactation during pregnancy. Many women even make some milk from repeated nipple stimulation who are not pregnant. Certainly it is not harmful for anyone to ingest breast milk, and if you and your husband enjoy that type of foreplay it is no problem. The only issue may be in later pregnancy you may get uterine contractions with nipple stimulation, as it produces natural pitocin to be released in your body. So if you get any uterine contractions (if you are not full term) it might be beneficial to avoid it then. Regular sexual activity is not harmful during pregnancy as long as you have no bleeding or pain. I hope I was able to answer your question and that this advice was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hi, i m swapna, i am 8th month pregnant now, since 2 days white discharge is happening and some times with some slight brown colour and also i am feeling pain in my legs, vagina, bachache and some sort of ,little pain in stomache . is there anything to worry plz advice","Doctor":"Hi,Yes, its best that you get checked by a doctor immediately.Discharge and pain in later months of pregnancy could be an indication of labour. It is best if you get examined and the exact cause of pain found.As, if you are in labour, and the baby is still not fully formed at 8 months, medication's such as steroid injection for baby lung development have to be given to you before delivery.So its best that you seek medical help, get an abdominal and pelvic examination to see if the neck of the womb has opened or not which will tell if you are in labour and an ultrasound done.Hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"I had pregnancy induced hypertension in dec 2010 still on meds now also iron deficiency which causes weekness and fainting spells, my heart also races when i get a faint spell.

Iron deficiency  is hazardous in pregnancy - for maternal & fetal health. It's good you have already stated with iron supplements with your doctor's advise.  If you are digesting iron well, you should start feeling improvement in 3 weeks of medication.    -  Addition of proteins, vitamins C, B6, B12 & folic acid help improvement.   - You should check your Hb% in a month & consult your doctor.   - injectable iron preparations/ blood transfusion is advised to non responding patients/ patients in late pregnancy.

You seem to have an abscess of a mucus secreting gland present in side part of outer vaginal fold. It's Bartholin cyst.   It occurs due to occlusion of the duct of gland.

By affected do you mean that you have Antibodies to rubella ,which was checked by a blood test.Usually if you have already had a infection /vaccination of rubella it is very unlikely for you to get it again. And so you can safely go for the next pregnancy.I would like to know if your 1 child has any other developmental problems or delayed milestones. As that could change the diagnosis and cause of hearing loss .As, if it an inherited or a genetic cause and not rubella which caused the hearing loss ,there could be a recurrence.It would be best to get yourself and kid seen by a fetal medicine specialist to know the cause of hearing loss.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am 36 weeks pregnant and ALWAYS feel like I need to urinate.

I do not want to use anything with artificial hormones anymore","Doctor":"Hello,If you wish to continue only with barrier methods, you can take double protection by using the female condoms or spermicides. You can get additional protection by practicing safe period also. This is the period when the chances of conception are almost nil. Safe period is the period of the menstrual cycle falling one week prior and one week after the onset of a period in a regular 28-30 day cycle. If you are sure of your expected date, you can also make it more since ovulation occurs two weeks before the due date and any unprotected sexual act between five days before and two days after is unsafe.

She has pain inbetween her legs sometimes and is worried that the babys head might be stuck ? This is her 2nd child.Please type your query here...","Doctor":"Hello,Pain in between legs mostly means pain in the vulval region and also over the pubic symphysis due to widening of the joints. Also, with cervical dystocia, a condition where the cervix does not dilate as needed during labor, pain is felt along the vagina and also over the back. This, if it happens, is not a favorable condition for normal delivery. Since your daughter has already passed full term, it is advisable to assess the pelvis for labor and also check the fetal well-being to plan further management like inducing labor to cause a vaginal birth or go for an elective abdominal delivery. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"We had a safe sex, but it spilled over from the condom near the vaginal mouth. we were sure that it didnot go inside, still for safety I took an ipill. i was also having a drug named deviry to control heavy bleeding.

From your history of heavy bleeding and its treatment, it is likely that you have hormonal imbalance. Emergency pills contain high hormone doses which can make this scene worse. The bleeding you saw after the pill intake is the withdrawal bleeding. The spotting you are currently experiencing suggest some breakthrough bleeding. You can exclude pregnancy through the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres and if negative, go for further help from a specialist.

They said that it is micro in size, approx. 7mm.","Doctor":"Bromocriptine is absolutely safe drug for pregnancy. Whether you need it or not depends on your blood prolactin level. If it gets normalized, then you can stop the drugs.

You should take a home pregnancy test if you are overdue by more than 3 days, with a fresh early morning sample of urine. If positive, see a specialist for a proper clinical evaluation and also a trans-vaginal sonogram to confirm the pregnancy, locate the gestation sac and also to note the age of the pregnancy for future referral.

My doctor has given me antibiotic for 5 days course but still dont relief. I have also concern with chest specialist and all is clear but have cough. Kindly advice me for further.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.It is good that you sought care from a chest specialist and took antibiotics.  That means your cough is not due to anything dangerous, like TB or pneumonia.So two possibilities remain, either that you just have a chest cold (virus), or the antibiotics you were taking for 5 days was not long enough.  If you are coughing up mucus that is yellow or green, you may need a longer course of antibiotics.I would discuss whether or not you need more antibiotics with your doctor, but some medicines you can buy that can help your cough are available over- the counter.  Cough drops are all safe while pregnant.  Dextromethorphan is the active ingredient in cough suppressants.  You can safely take cough syrup containing this ingredient in short-term use.  This medicine is frequently combined with others like Guaifenasin, which are also safe.Also it is important to stay away from smoke and dust, and to drink lots of hot liquids.I hope this information was helpful and that you feel better soon.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi I m 8 weeks pregnant now as per my lmp I.e.,dec 19th 2010.but the today s scan says it is 5.1 weeks and there is only a gestational sac of 16 mm seen, no yolk sac,fetal pole and cardiac activity.the doctor says to repat scan after a week and in the meanwhile to get the bhcg done.I m very much worried as to hw to go about it and morever I had a misscarriage at my first pregnancy the same time last year.pls advice","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.Iam very sorry for your condition.In my opinion the presence of empty gestational sac without yolk sac ,fetal pole and cardiac activity  might need to be evaluated to rule out any blighted ovum.Usually fetal pole and yolk sac are visible in abdominal ultrasound by 7 weeks.Anyways repetition of ultrasound after a week and serum B Hcg will help in diagnosis.Take progesterone and folic acid supplements.Nothing to worry.Have hope and avoid stress.Best regards...Dr,srilatha"},{"Patient":"Hello Sir,My wife is about to in 9months of pregnancy, from last week she is getting loose motion 4 to 5 times...due to which I am getting my BP low, is it a serious...?

However, that is no longer working and my doctor is recommending total hysterectomy. This may be a dumb question, but I think I may be pregnant. If I am can I carry a baby with this cancer, or will I miscarry?","Doctor":"In early stage of endometrial cancer, we advise pregnancy only after cure (i.e., when hormone therapy has been given at the highest possible dose for at least one year and biopsy shows no growth). So, we need to see your recent imaging report, review the drugs you are taking (before calling them ''not working\\") and also get a biopsy done and then we can recommend whether you can go for pregnancy or not."},{"Patient":"In 2008 I had an abortion at a local Planned Parenthood office... after my procedure i was to recieve a shot because of my Rh factor results..

Of course, it can affect the baby in some cases (by causing fetal anemia and jaundice and later heart failure). All these can be diagnosed early and treated very effectively. But it NEVER causes problems in having conception."},{"Patient":"Hi.... i m 28 yrs old female and married since 2 yrs, had an abortion after 4-5 months of marriage, started taking contraceptive pill Femilon after that and took that for nearly a year, however stopped taking that from august 2010.

What is going on? I m worried.","Doctor":"Dear Mumma,Any amount of bleeding at any stage of pregnancy is not a good sign. At this stage of pregnancy, if the bleeding is without any pain, first get the ultrasonography done for low lying placenta. If it is placenta praevia, since you are already 37 + weeks, there is no need to wait further with placenta praevia. The baby at 37 weeks is sufficiently mature enough. You can go for delivery - may be caesarean section if the position of the placenta demands for. First episode of placenta paevia bleeding is with little bleeding and the subsequent episodes are alarmingly heavy. Continuing the pregnancy with placenta praevia is like sitting on a sleeping volcano!May be it could be  a spotting from the cervix which is eroded during pregnancy. In such case no intervention is needed. Please report to your Obstetrician ASAP to sort out the matter."},{"Patient":"Yes, just curious. But I m 7 months pregnant. For a while now I have not had any vaginal discharge. My vagina has been dry and slightly itchy on the outside. I m worried that its trich or bv. In the beginning of my pregnancy, I was treated for trichomonisis. What do you think?","Doctor":"This itching may be due to fungal infection or dryness due to hormonal changes in pregnancy. Trichomoniasis and BV are of course important causes of itching but they cause profuse discharge, rather than itching alone. So, I think it's simply fungal infection, although for confirmation you need check up by gynecologist. In the mean time maintain hygiene, avoid using ordinary soaps in vagina, rather use medicated soaps."},{"Patient":"Now i am in my 8th month(30 weeks) of pregnancy and i am suffering with blocked nostrils with cold.

There is a 1/100 chance of the amniocentesis leading to abortion.So, you have to decide between risk of downs and risk of abortion.A 1/38 is significant enough for you to undergo amniocentesis as if negetive for Down's it will be reassuring. And if at all positive then we can decide on further care during this pregnancy.This cannot be cured or treated by medicines.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"My brother is having a pulsating pain that sometimes is quick single thrust, sometimes several really fast pain stings , sometimes it hurts, sometimes just irritating.

Could i be pregnant?","Doctor":"HiI can understand your concern for the delayed period following unprotected sex.Delayed period following unprotected sex and symptoms like cramps, breasts tenderness, pimples are suggestive of an early pregnancy.Withdrawal method is not an effective form of birth control. Sperms can enter the vagina if withdrawal isn not properly timed or if pre-ejaculation fluid contains sperm. Of every 100 women whose partners use withdrawal, 4 will become pregnant each year if they always do it correctly. Of every 100 women whose partners use withdrawal, 27 will become pregnant each year if they do not always do it correctly.    Pregnancy is also possible if semen or pre-ejaculate is spilled on the vulva.So, I advise you to get the pregnancy test done on an early morning urine sample and consult a gynecologist.Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"hi doc. im 21 weeks pregnant an mon i hurt my belly trying to get you an i have a appt. wit my doctor n th morning but im a little worried cause im use to feeling alot of movement all day n i havent felt any movement since i hurt my belly/ there is wetting comin from my private . dizzy n head aches and my feet ankles are huges should i call 911","Doctor":"these symptoms can suggest a psychological fear and there may be a threatened abortion so get a USG done as early as possible"},{"Patient":"I have had a friction burn for about a year now. it started out bad and got better for awhile. About 6 months down the road it turned shiny and pale on my shaft i tried to masturbate without touching the area but i had a slight pain right below the shaft a bit. And a new vein showed up or what i assume is a vein seem to pop up during a erection. Currently I m about a year in and the shaft still is pale and a bit shiny. The pain i had is more dull then anything now. Touching the pale area feels cold to the touch and stings/hurts still. This made me worry so i went to have it checked and the doctor tells me i don t know what the problem is...he can t seem to find anything wrong. But the pain still remains It s not as bad as it was a year ago but is still there. I ve had no discharge no swelling nothing weird in urine No infection as far as i know. Nothing has gotten worse over the year but nothing has 100% healed either. I was told to leave it alone no sex or masturbation for a month and see if it heals. I was masturbating in between (i shouldn t of been at all ) but for the most part i left it alone also i never touched the area when masturbating. I went from extreme pain to medium-min pain in a year. So my question is is this going to heal on it s own? I was also told i could of gave the shaft trauma or bruise and needs more time to heal. i beat it up pretty bad last year there was no bleeding either.

However, you have taken morning after pill within first 24 hours. This pill is having a good success rate (>95%) in preventing the pregnancy. So you need not be under stress. These pills contain high concentration of hormones Oestrogen + Progesterone. It takes few weeks for their levels in the blood to come down. Hence in many cases the menstruation is found to be delayed. Your period has been delayed by just a day. Please do not be under stress. Wait of few more days for it to appear. If it does not appear for 10 days, you may get your urine tested for pregnancy to confirm the status.However, I feel, you should get menses in few days."},{"Patient":"Hi, I took postinor 2 about 7days after my period. a few days later I bled lightly for about 4 days and then stopped.

This pill contains Levonorgestrel. It is a Progesterone preparation. Thus the Progesterone levels in the blood increase preventing the menstruation. Moreover, you have repeated the pills again.

It is commonly prescribed during pregnancy as a mild blood thinner for prevention of different disorders during pregnancy, like recurrent miscarriage, preeclampsia and others.  It is very safe and even though it is not recommended to take adult dose aspirin during pregnancy, this dose is safe and also may help the prognosis of your current pregnancy.  So you need not worry at all about the medication and its effects on the baby.However, it concerns me that you are being treated with this medication without actually knowing the cause of death of your last child.  I do not know if an autopsy was performed on the baby or if you had any tests after the baby died.  Stillbirth can be caused by a number of factors, some due to maternal clotting disorders, infection, birth defects or complications with the pregnancy itself that may not be helped or prevented by just taking aspirin.  In addition, many practitioners would recommend monitoring of your baby's heartbeat in the doctors office on a regular basis (non-stress test) to watch for any signs of distress before the baby is born.So in summary, the aspirin you were prescribed is safe but may not be beneficial to you if the death of your baby was unexplained.  Tests like screening of your blood for thrombophilias (inherited disorders of blood clotting) and infections (TORCH titers) really should be done if you haven't done so already to make sure that your aspirin treatment is not the only thing that can be done to help prevent complications with this pregnancy.  Consultation with a high-risk pregnancy doctor (also called a Perinatologist) may be helpful in figuring out if you have a condition that can adversely affect this pregnancy.I hope that this information was helpful and that I was able to answer your question.

But some time test results are showing 84-98 and 112-158. she was getting fear kindly give your suggessions","Doctor":"Hello and I hope I can help you today.Insulin is used to treat diabetes during pregnancy at all stages and is safe and effective. The disease of diabetes and high blood sugar is the part that is dangerous for the baby, and good glucose control is the best way to ensure a healthy child.Good blood glucose levels should be less that 95 for fasting levels and less than 120 after meals (2 hours).  If this is the way your wife checks her sugar, and you test at least 4 times daily, she is under very good control and should not need further adjustment of her insulin if her levels stay at the current level.  She should be checking her sugar fasting and then 2 hours after every meal.  So in summary, insulin is safe and absolutely necessary for the health of the baby if your wife has diabetes.  PLease discuss the dosing regimen with your treating physician on a regular basis and make sure your wife checks her readings at least when she wakes up in the morning and then 2 hours after every meal.  She should also write down what she eats so her doctor can also know if any changes need to be made in the diet.I hope this information was helpful and answered your question adequately.Best wishes to you and your wife for the rest of the pregnancy.Sincerely, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"well, i am 25 years of age and i am not having my periods... my regular cycle is of 27- 30 days and it has never got delayed. this time i am 9 days delayed. 12 days ago i along with my boyfriend had some sexual activities...although he was not inside me but we were very close to that. i have not taken any medicine...... am i pregnant??","Doctor":"Hello and I hope i can help you today. Pregnancy symptoms vary between women, and many women can have their period be late for different reasons- stress, changes in body weight and other hormonal issues. You can even be late from the stress of worrying about pregnancy! So really the best and most accurate way to determine if you're pregnant is to take a urine pregnancy test. The ones that can be purchased are just as accurate as ones done at a doctor's office. But if you did not actually have sexual intercourse and there was no contact of semen with your vagina and surrounding area you really do not need to worry about pregnancy.If you continue to have irregular periods it would be advisable to consult with an OBGYN doctor who can help diagnose the reason behind your symptoms and possible treatment.

It is better you avoid intercourse till you complete 14 weeks of pregnancy. After that, depending upon the stability of the pregnancy, you may have sexual intercourse. However, please take care to avoid full insertion of penis. It is not the orgasm which it responsible for the abortion; if at all, it could be physical disturbance or infection. To avoid full insertion of the penis, the best positions are either sex in the side position or penile insertion from back side in side position. You may get details of safe positions for intercourse during pregnancy in an Epic named Kamsootra by Vatsyayan. If at all with all these precautions you find any discomfort during or after the intercourse, it is better to observe sexual abstinence. Otherwise sex is not contraindicated during pregnancy. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"I am a 56 years of age male, i have a white spot on my right nipple, it has now been there for around one month and does not discharge, i am very fit, 5-9 in height and 11 stone in weight, i am in Iraq and it is very hot, i wondered if that had anything to do with it!","Doctor":"Hello, Probably it will be a fungal infection known as tinea versicolor . Other possibilities are eczema and rarely eczema. It would be better if you attach a picture in the follow up query. As of now you can apply anti-fungal ointments like Clotrimazole to look for any improvement. If the lesion persist, better to consult a dermatologist and get evaluated.

The fact that there are no foetal heart beats observed during ultrasonography indicate that the baby is no more viable and nothing can be done to bring it to life now. The only option left for you is to get the pregnancy terminated ASAP. Delaying termination or continuing such pregnancy has a risk of developing clotting disorder (DIC), infection, kidney failure, etc. It is very difficult to pin point the cause for the foetal wastage at this stage. It is likely to be due to the viral infection you had or chromosomal abnormality in the baby. You may think of getting genetic work up done for both of you. Please do not loose your heart. Next time you have opportunity and chance of having a normal baby."},{"Patient":"good day,I m 30 yrs old my height is 5 0 my weight i think is 58 kilos,5 years ago when i was pregnant at first 5 weeks of my pregnancy i have to undergo ultrasound because my first 5 weeks of pregnancy is critical.My doctor advice me to have bed rest for at least 3 months of pregnancy but after 3 months i miscarriage,after my operation it takes 1 day i dont know what you call that but to clean me inside i think, just after that i feel pain for 9 days of staying in the house and go back to the doctor again and i have to undergo ultrasound for the second time and they found out that i have an ectopic pregnancy another pregnancy,is this really happening?because i ve been ultrasound for my first 5 weeks of pregnancy and why they didn t saw inside that i do have an ectopic pregnancy? and now after 5 years my problem right now during intercourse i need to stop my husband because i feel pain feels like hitting something inside,what will i do?hope to hear answers soon.thank you very much","Doctor":"Dear Madam, I have gone through your comprehensive history. Let me assure you that your miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy were sheer two coincidental unfortunate events. Ectopic is not a complication nor is due to miscarriage. Many a times, ectopic is missed in ultrasonography at very early stage. If you are getting deep pain in the abdomen during the intercourse, particularly with the movements of the penis, it is likely that you are having some tender pathology in the pelvis. It could be some tumour, infection, collection of endometrium in the pelvis, back fallen tender uterus or ovaries fallen back in the pelvis between the uterus and the rectum. There could have been a tender mass formation at the site of the ectopic surgery on the tube also. I know you are worried about repeat ectopic pregnancy, which can be diagnosed and treated only by Gynaecologist. Have you missed your periods? If so you may get urine tested for pregnancy after a week. In ectopic pregnancy, it is usually weak positive. I feel you should report to your Gynaecologist regarding this deep painful intercourse. If diagnosed in time, it can definitely be treated and relief obtained. I am sure, you will again start enjoying your normal sexual life after the treatment."},{"Patient":"hi i actually have 2 questions about my menstrul cycle and pregnancy...its about the time for my period and im usually a heavy bleeder...but ive just been lightly spotting on and off....and also wanted to know how soon after intercourse can u get pregnant and when do signs(like spotting) start to show??","Doctor":"Hi dear, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns.

Please type your query here...Hi, I m 29 weeks primary gravida, yesterday my baby started increase movements which last for 4 to 5 hrs but intensity of movement was low. Today I think that movements are less than normal. Thanks","Doctor":"Dear Mumma to be,At the outset let me congratulate you for your first pregnancy. The baby movements depend up on the activity of the baby. The baby does not know our day and night. It has got its own biological clock according to which it sleeps. When awake it moves, while in sleep it does not. Too many movements of the baby are also not good. So if in last 4-5 hours it has not moved, it denotes that the baby may be sleeping. During 12 hours continuous period if you feel the movements of the baby minimum for 10 times, the baby is healthy and active. If it does not move that much, then it may suggest the risk to the baby and you will have to report to the Obstetrician immediately. So count the foetal movements from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm. If they are about 10 or more, nothing to worry. Continue your antenatal care and medicines, which includes immunization also. Wish you a safe delivery and bony baby to breastfeed."},{"Patient":"Hi, I was travelling to India  and just arrived back to Canada.

I have an appt with my gynae in a couple of days but dont want to wait and lose more fluid in the next 2 days. Need Help!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Loose motions would not harm your baby so long as you are not dehydrated. If you get dehydrated and land into keto-acidosis, it may pause risk to the baby. So best way is to keep yourself well hydrated. Drinking only water is the most unscientific way of hydrating yourself which does more harm than good. In loose stools, you are loosing water as well as electrolytes. You have to replace both the components. In India, you get many Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) packs. Electral is a good preparation. Dissolve one sachet in a litre of boiled and cooled water. After each motion, drink a glassful of this solution. (Please read the instructions on the sachet.) The best way to monitor your hydration is :1. Have a look at your tongue. It should be wet.2. Pinch your skin on the back of the hand. It should straiten out immediately and not remain as fold. 3. You must pass sufficient urine through out the day. The urine should not be concentrated and dark coloured.Get your stools examined. If it is amoebic infection (which is very common in India), you may have to take metronidazole tablets. Bacterial or viral infections usually get washed off and cured. Please be very selective about the food. Avoid the open food from the street venders. Chat, which is very popular and freely available in India is most of the times source of amoebic infection. I hope this should help you. If your looses motions do not get controlled within 48 hours or if you start developing any sigs of dehydration, please report to an Obstetrician ASAP."},{"Patient":"hiii i am 26 years old .from last few years i feel some flucation like a heart beat in my stomach.and whenever i eat something my stomach grows than before .i also suffer a problem of periods from last few months my periods are not getting normal in firs two days some brown substance came and then in third day normay breedind starts.are these symptoms related to pregnancy or some other problem","Doctor":"No its not pregnancy.

It started four months(22 May) ago where i was diagnosed with a grade three varicocele. I went to the hospital 22 May because i got pain in my testis during workout in the GYM. They said it was a varicocele, and a month after uv sound also showed grade 3 varicocele on left testis. 2 july i Got dull ache in right testis after running excersice, i began here to think about what it could be, 4 july two days after i got pain above right testis, like my testicle get cut of the spermatic cord, i went to the urologists 9 july, he did uv sound and didnt find anything wrong. He said it could be a pinched muscle in groin. Fact: the pain in right testis increased while i weared briefs for decrease pain for the left varicocele. This weird terrible pain in right testis where it is like cut above right testis/burning sensation didnt go away, i noticed pain occurs most when lying on back or on left side. Fact: pain decreases alot in Night, and occurs mostly when waking up and until evening. The pain didnt disapear and i went to another urologist again 21 july, urologist did uv sound and examined me and he couldnt find anything wrong too.

However, I discovered this because I was looking at a \\"pimple\\" looking spot on the underside of my penis close to where it meets the scrotum. This worried me as being an STD since I had unprotected sex 7 days beforehand. I went to see if it were an ingrown hair, and after some digging I found a hair and removed it 2 days ago. The swelling has almost entirely gone away from the spot, but is still red. I believe that this was either caused by Trichomycosis Pubis or just ingrown by coincidence. But I am still worried that this may be an STD that happened to create an ingrown hair (such as herpes, etc.). I have been very worried about this and I am seeing the doctor on Monday.

Early morning urine sample, as soon as waking up from bed is what's usually advised. At least 2 tests taken a week apart are generally needed to confirm the results.In case of irregular cycles or when the dates are not know, a blood test for pregnancy hormone- beta HCG is recommended. The test can be done as early as 6 to 12 days after conception, with 11 days being the average and is considered confirmatory. On an average, most doctors recommend taking the blood pregnancy test at around 3 weeks after the date of the last unprotected intercourse.Commonly, at the doctor's, in the presence of a negative urine or blood pregnancy test, an examination of the abdomen may be followed by tests such as blood tests for hemoglobin/blood counts, other hormonal levels, scan of abdomen/pelvis to see ovaries/uterus and endometrial thickness, the placement of the IUCD etcetera, if and as needed.Hope I have answered your query.

Please see your health care provider for further management if she becomes overdue by ten days.Prefer regular contraception.

If so, chances of pregnancy are high and you need to go for a pregnancy test.If you have been regular with your medicines throughout, your cycle is well protected and this delay in the onset of menstruation could be due to stress, infections, etcetera.

It is common to have an irregular period on this. The protection continues as long as one takes the forgotten pill within twelve hours of forgetting it. The chances of falling pregnant increase if there is a delay of more than twelve hours from when it was due to be taken. Up to two tablets can be taken together if one misses on one day. However, missing 3 tablets puts one at risk of becoming pregnant. It is recommended that one uses emergency birth control measures in such a situation. You could repeat the pregnancy test two weeks after the test that you have taken and tested negative. Or else do a blood test to check for pregnancy hormone level, if you are really worried. Emergency contraception is the other course of action if you realize you have had unprotected intercourse. It could give you 95-99% protection of pregnancy if taken with 72 hours of unprotected sex.Hope I have answered your query.

Her boyfriend just moved to school across the country and they ll on;y get to see eachother every other month for the next 5 yrs. i think oral contraceptive use for a low rate of intercourse may be overkill and they should switch to condom use.

If she is likely to see her boyfriend every month or more then, it might be best to continue with this method for the reasons described below. COC is >99% effective and Junel acts by preventing pregnancy in more than way. It stops egg release, thickens secretions from the cervix to prevent sperm from reaching the egg for fertilization and also makes the lining of the womb unfavorable for pregnancy to establish. It provides reliable birth control along with added desirable benefits for a young person such as less bleeding and pain during period, prevents the formation of cysts or fluid-filled swellings on ovaries. It might help with improving skin by reducing acne. Condom by itself will be a less reliable method for a young couple. However, if they are motivated enough to use it alongside pills, it may be protective against infections that can be passed between partners through sex.Hope I have answered your query.

There is data from long term use of most birth control pills that are generally prescribed and used. These do not suggest any evidence of harm on the chances of a future pregnancy. It might be worth discussing with your doctor, which method would be more suitable for your needs, given that the sex is infrequent.Regarding the concern about the muscles in your bum area (I suppose that you are referring to gluteal muscles when referring to 'pussy') - their tome depends on exercise. With age, especially after 40 years, these muscles tend to go lax. The remedy lies in a diet with good protein content and structured physical exercise that focusses on toning and strengthening these muscles. Hope I have answered your query.

It has both female hormones (oestrogen + progesterone). From the way you have described, it appears that you started the pills in the right way - from the first day of the period.The period that one gets after starting pills is not the same that one gets when not using it. The dark coloured blood could have been old blood which took time to come out of your body. This should not change the way you take pills.You have to take it continuously as instructed.

Your description of symptoms, however, calls for further evaluation. I would suggest proper clinical assessment by an expert, blood counts, urinalysis, pregnancy test and a sonogram of the pelvis preferably through the transvaginal route. Coagulation profile also needed. If pregnancy is excluded, cysts of the ovary have to be looking for. Styptics help in controlling the spotting. Infections, if any, have to be attended to.

The bending of the device should not affect it, as long as it is not mispositioned. In any case, please bear in mind that no method of contraception is 100% effective. With implant also pregnancy can occur. It fails in less than one out of 100 women using it.Regarding the issue with the menstrual periods, I would like to remind you that this method stops or reduces bleeding during the menses. It usually returns to its usual regular rhythm after some time of having it removed.I would still advice you to visit a doctor locally and have the bent device removed because the position might have in the attempts to remove it. It may affect how effective it is for birth control by affecting the dose of progesterone hormone released into the bloodstream.

It sounds like the position of the IUD likely forced it partially through the wall of the uterus, and they could not remove it with a camera through the cervix.

I cannot for sure correlate your pain with an impending period.The use of an emergency contraceptive pill creates hormone imbalance, hence there can be a delay in the next natural period.

You did not state whether you are on the pill or not. Also, bacterial vaginosis not considered an STD so it will not be caused by having intercourse.

My body then expelled it. We replaced it with another one and it was expelled once again (along with 3 months of continuous bleeding and severe cramps). Looking for a long term birth control I decided to get Nexplanon because of the issues with Mirena. I continued to have continuous bleeding for 3-4 months and it was beginning to affect my everyday life. I was tired, moody and constantly in pain. I asked to have it removed and they put me on birth control pills for 3 months in addition to the nexplanon to regulate my cycle. By the end of the three months it was back to normal. I have now been off the pill for 3-4 months and I ve currently been bleeding for 4 1/2 weeks. I have two questions: Based on my history is it best to get the nexplanon removed? I feel as though my body is rejecting it. Would it be safe to take the pill every day for a log period of time in addition to the nexplanon? I am worried that it may have too many hormones when taken together that may cause long term issues.","Doctor":"Hello,First of all, it is not unsafe to have the Nexplanon in place and to use birth control pills to control breakthrough bleeding. But, given the pain, bleeding, and expulsion of the IUDs as well as the continued problems with bleeding, it would not surprise me if you have something going on in the uterus such as fibroids or polyps.

Thanking u in anticipation","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for posting your query. I have gone through it and would like to offer some suggestions. Abdominal pain is a side effect of the emergency contraceptive pill, but, seen soon after use and not so much later. The most likely cause for the abdominal pain you have experienced is due to the hormone effect as withdrawal bleeding has ensued. Your chances of pregnancy are very minimal because you had the intercourse during the safe period and in addition, you consumed the emergency contraceptive pill. Bleeding is due to the withdrawal effect caused by the high hormone content in the pill. See a specialist for further help if you become overdue for your next natural period by ten days. You may need a test then. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi im 18 and i always take my pills regularly at the sane time.

I am worried because the Ortho Evra instructions only provide those two days as starting points.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. Your current cycle may not be well protected since you started using the patch well after the last period. So, you need to use additional protection. Also, you have to continue using the three courses of the patch followed by a patch-free week. This means your cycle is rescheduled. Do not use grapefruit and grapefruit juice while using the patch as norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol have interactions. Avoid using skin creams, lotions etc., to the area of the skin where the patch is applied since this may lead to detachment of the patch.

I have a 10 months old baby and i'm scared if i got pregnant again.I took misi prestol tablet but i scared as days go by. Pls advise for any tablets that could help me..","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for letting us know your health concern. I have gone through your query and would like to offer some suggestions. If you have been receiving regular menstrual cycles after child birth and are sexually active without any protection, your chances of pregnancy are high. However, if you are lactating, there is a chance that you could be experiencing anovulatory cycles and hence naturally protected. Please do not self-medicate in the current scenario. See a specialist, get a proper clinical evaluation followed by a urine or blood test for pregnancy and a sonogram of the pelvis. Further management can be planned accordingly. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have itchy bumps on my penis and scrotum.

You can apply Miconazole ointment. Avoid wet cloths keep the affected part dry. It will take a week yo recover. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hi. I've been on a low dose bc pill for a few months now after switching from the IUD. All periods have been normal until this month. No period. It's several days late now, I start my active pills again today. I've had lots of cramping for the last two weeks and nausea off and on for the last 2-3 days. Home pregnancy test was negative...? I know there were a few days I took my pill later than usual by a few hours. Not sure what to think.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. Since you have switched over to oral contraception, you have to use additional protection during the initial couple of months to avoid failure due to breakthrough ovulation. Since you are a few months into the pill, your hormone milieu should have settled by now. A few hours delay in the pill intake should not affect much. This delayed period is hence, of significance. Your symptoms are also suggestive of a possible pregnancy. Home pregnancy tests read well when performed 3-7 days after the missed period with a fresh early morning sample of urine. Since you have to start the active pills now, it is better to exclude/confirm pregnancy through the blood test and plan further management. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello, I m a young boy with bad anxiety and I have a question. My girlfriend started taking the birth control pill Sprintec the Sunday her period started. She stopped taking it on the following Friday because of the side effect. It has been about 20-22 days since she has last taken it and about a week or two after getting off of the pill she started saying she feels nausea and gets bad cramping. We ve had protected sex and I always take caution and pull out before I finish. It is the 25th and she usually starts on the 1st. Could she be pregnant? Or are they side effect of getting off of the pill? And can the pill push her period back some? She did have spotting about 2-3 days after she stopped taking the pill.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for letting us know your health concern. I have gone through your query and would like to offer some information. Withdrawal effects of the oral contraceptive pill can cause the symptoms she is experiencing and also the spotting that she saw. If you are practicing only the withdrawal method, chances of failure are more. You need to use double protection for better result. She may also experience a delayed period in this cycle since she used the pill for sometime. Please get further help if she becomes overdue by ten days. Pregnancy chances are less in the current scenario. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I ve had the mirena for almost 3 years now and during sex my boyfriend said he sometimes can feel it poking him, so that made me question has it moved ? Also my periods are starting to last 10 days or more & im not sure if its stress or thr mirena. Sometimes after a few days its barely bleeding jus pinkish or brownish slimy clots I just need to know if I should go and see a doctor about these things .","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. In the current scenario, I would suggest a proper clinical evaluation for several reasons. 1. Once the IUD is inserted, periodic check up to see if it is in place is mandatory. 2. As you have noticed abnormal menstrual pattern in recent times, you should get tested for abnormal endometrial pattern, local causes like erosion of the cervix, polyps of the cervix and endometrium, infections etc., and also cysts of the ovary. 3. Coarsening of the threads may lead to the pricking sensation, but, displacement of the IUD should always be considered and excluded. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi I was implanon for 3 years with no period for almost the entire time, then I had my implant swapped to a nexplanon which I was told would be the same.

Doctor gave me pills (microygen) which I have been taking for a week no change. Should I just have the thing out?? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. It is true that the hormone contained is similar, but, the bio-availability of the drug varies for each preparation. This leads to breakthrough bleeding/spotting which you seem to be experiencing. You may also use styptics to arrest the bleeding. If you find no relief with any medication, if the bleeding is heavy and persistent, you may have to change the contraceptive. In addition to medication, take adequate rest and maintain proper nutrition. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have 2 kids(not normal delivery) and undergone with tubectomy(open surgery) also. I didn t get my periods in the last month. I have checked using the pregnancy kit and it is positive. How it is possible. Is it a doctor mistake that she didn t do properly?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. I have gone through your query and here are your answers. 1. Any contraceptive procedure, including tubectomy, has a failure rate. This does not mean that the doctor has not performed the procedure correctly. It only means that the tubes have re-canalized after surgery. 2. If you do not wish to continue with the pregnancy, please get further help from a specialist. Either way, you need to see a doctor for further management. 3. If you wish to clarify further, you can go for the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres and follow up with a trans-vaginal sonogram.

From the description you have given, it appears that you are experiencing side effects of the emergency contraceptive pill. The pill contains high doses of progesterone and hormone imbalance is created after its use. Ample protection is achieved with use of the pill soon after an unprotected intercourse. So, your chances of pregnancy are very less. You may see some withdrawal bleeding in a couple of days. Please wait for your next natural period which is likely to get delayed by a week or two. Please get further help if you become overdue by ten days. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am almost 24 years old and I would like to get sterilized.

I am tired of having to remember taking pills and the pills have really affected my mental health. They make me depressed and they have also caused weight gain. Is it possible to find a doctor who would sterilize me at age 24?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. In the current scenario, I would ask you to go for some other mode of temporary contraception, like an implant or an IUD. This is because, if your thoughts change in future and if both of you wish to have children, you still have a chance. You need not continue with the oral contraceptive pills if you find it difficult to use them. I am not sure any competent doctor would agree for such an early sterilization, without any children, for no medical reason. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"siri did sex at 1 pm and give my gf i pill at 11 pm and i did sex again 11:30 pm same day i m want to knw that should i need to give new pill again or that was effective .she just having period few days ago 2-3 days ago plz help me out  thank uwaiting for ur rply","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for letting us know your health concern. The emergency contraceptive pill provides high protection when used soon after the unprotected intercourse, within 6-12 hours. The effect however, stays until 4-5 days as shown by half-life studies. Moreover, presuming she has regular monthly periods, she is in her safe period. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next cycle and this is the fertile phase. So, she did not need the pill in the first place; and another pill is not necessary. In future, please choose regular contraception as the emergency contraceptive pill can cause hormone imbalances.

She does not want any other procedures for permanent sterilization. Any suggestions to taking her off the injections and what risks are there to leaving her on the injections other than bone loss?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. Bone loss or osteoporosis, is one long term side effect of hormone use. However, regular monitoring is needed to assess the hepatic function, coagulation profile, breast condition, cardiovascular function, uterine state and blood counts, since there is a systemic influence. If your patient needs to be transferred from depo shots, if she is fit to continue hormones, you can try an implant or other forms of topical applications, if oral pills are to be avoided. If hormones are to be avoided, barrier methods are to be used with double protection. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hello, my brother has experienced pain in the testicles and surrounding groin muscles for multiple years, this pain is usually aggravated when sitting for long periods of time, and is increased with stress. he has had mri s and injections with no positive results, he has been seen by 2 separate urologists with no success. he recently has been seeing a holistic doctor that has made some muscle and nerve manipulations in his nerve posterior to his testicles which has given him huge relief but it has only been temporary. suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

Since you have taken hormone medication as emergency contraception soon after the unprotected intercourse, you are amply protected. However, you may experience withdrawal bleeding in a few days. Your next natural period may get delayed by a week or two. If you do not see your next natural period even after ten days after it is due, please get evaluated by a specialist to plan further management.

Yesterday on the 22nd day while having sex the condom broke with semen getting inside. I am considering taking postinor but would not want to expose my fertility to unnecessary risks as I read that the consequences could be quite unpleasant and dangerous. Information is very different from this medication being absolutely safe to causing infertility.i am 27 so would like to have children in next couple years. Could you please advise. Thank you very uh in advance.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next menstrual period and this is the fertile phase when pregnancy can occur. Since you have 28-32 day cycles, your ovulation would occur from day 14 to day 18. The ovum lives only for 24 hours. Since you had the intercourse on day 22, you are safe. There is no need to consume the emergency contraceptive pill. The pill contains high dose of progesterone and hence can lead to hormone imbalance. Repeated pill usage can lead to infertility problems in future. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello, I'm asking on behalf of my girlfriend.  She's been experiencing sore nipples and cramps at times while on birth control.  She's been on it for several years now and we have sex regularly.  What might be the causes of this?  She's not due for her period for another week","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. Experience of sore nipples and occasional cramps is a side effect of hormone contraception. However, if she never experienced these while on the pill all these years but only during this cycle, you must check for the possibility of failure. To detect early, you can go for the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres a few days later. If positive, please see a specialist for further management. If negative, consider this as a normal phenomenon and wait for the next period. Periodical follow up is necessary while on hormone contraception to monitor hepatic, cardiovascular and coagulation profiles. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"My doctor switched me directly from the pill to the depo provera. I never got off of the pill; I took it the morning I got the shot. I was wondering, how long will it take for me to be protected from pregnancy? Am I already covered because I switched straight to another birth control?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. Depo-Provera starts working within 24 hours if taken during the first five days of the menstrual cycle. As you were regular with the oral contraceptive pill, protection should be complete. If you switched over without attaining a period, you could experience some breakthrough as the body adjusts to the altered hormone milieu. The content of the pill also influences the change over. Anyway, you need not worry about failure as protection is sustained. You are well covered. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I am nicole, I had unprotected sex, I took postinor2 and a week later I bled for 11days bsefore it stopped in november, ihave also seen my period this december for 3days and now I feel funny about to puke like I am pregnant, could I really be pregnant???","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. Emergency contraceptive pill contains high doses of progesterone and this is the reason for the withdrawal bleeding you experienced after taking the pill. If you took the pill within the stipulated time you are well protected. Moreover, since you experienced a natural period you need not worry about pregnancy. Your symptoms are not specific for pregnancy; you could be experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms also. Please remember to restrict the use of emergency contraceptive pill for one or two occasions per year to avoid hormone imbalances. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hmmm i taken different brands birth control pills this time.... i had the left over 3 mercilon pills and then i had 5 yaz pills in the past 8days n my partner ejaculated inside my body on the 8th day. May i know is the protection active or i might face the risk to become pregnant too?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for letting us know your health concern. I would like to know the reason for using the two types of pills during the same cycle. Definitely, this will create hormone disturbance and protection may not be as effective with a single variety. Though both are combination contraceptives, the drug combination is different in both, hence the activity. However, since you had the intercourse on the 8th day of your cycle, you are mostly safe even if ovulation has occurred, presuming that you have a 28-30 day cycle normally. This is because ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period in a natural cycle and this is the fertile phase. Please wait for your next period and get further help if you miss it. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Had sex on d 12th of december and the condom slipped,I took postinor 2 3 hours later and d 2nd pill 12 hours later.on the 17th of december I bled till the 21st and now I was meant to get my last period on the 2 of jan but had it on d 8th of jan with my normal blood flow.Do I still need 2 get a pregnancy test?","Doctor":"Hello,thanks for sharing your health concern with us. In the current scenario, there is no need to perform a pregnancy test since you attained your natural period, though delayed by a week which often happens when an emergency contraceptive pill is taken. The bleeding you observed soon after the pill intake was the withdrawal bleeding owing to the high hormone content in the pill. The pill offers 85-98 percent protection depending upon the time interval at which it is consumed after the unprotected intercourse. Please make sure that you restrict the use of the emergency pill to one or two occasions per year in order to avoid hormone disturbances. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am on the nuvaring and i keep all of my period info, times and dates of when to take it out and put a new one in Inside my phone.

And my husband and i used condoms while i had it out.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for letting us know your health concern. Well, the most likely cause of the delayed period in the current scenario seems to be hormone imbalance. Failure of contraception leading to pregnancy seems to be a remote possibility since you used double protection. Please remember that home pregnancy tests read well when performed 3-7 days after the missed period with a fresh early morning sample of urine. If you still suspect pregnancy, you can go for the blood test and follow it up with a trans-vaginal sonogram. Further management can be accordingly planned. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"sir i have taken first dose of cipla kit, then after 48 hours a have taken all 4 tablets orally. after half an hour i had vomating ..... i get only dead and red small pieces of muscles from my vagina .......but didn't get bleeding yet. please suggest what to do???????","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. I have gone through your query and would like to offer some information. Self-medication is contraindicated in inducing a medical abortion. You seem to have taken an inadequate dose since you vomited soon after ingesting the pills. The amount of vaginal discharge depends on the duration of pregnancy. Please remember that a medical abortion can be induced until 9 weeks of gestation only. In a very early pregnancy, the products amount to a small blood clot and associated with very little bleeding. In the current scenario, I would ask you to see a specialist for further management to avoid complications. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I am 27 with 3 children. My fiancé and I decided to try for one more. I was on the depo shot for around 3 years and the ortho evra patch for almost a year. I stopped using the patch about a month ago. Had a period followed by ovulation. We are actively trying to conceive and I think I am having symptoms of pregnancy. What are our chances of me being pregnant now?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. It is good that ovulation has returned after stopping the patch. If you have had regular unprotected intercourse during the ovulation period, you have very good chance of conception. If you have been plotting the basal body temperature, you will notice a rise in temperature at ovulation which remains persistent if conception has occurred. The earliest test for pregnancy is the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres, done 7-10 days after ovulation. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"My 17 yr old son told/showed me a recent balloon-feeling area near his groin.

With any form of hormone contraception, it is usual to experience some menstrual disturbances during the initial couple of months owing to alteration of the hormone milieu. As the body adjusts to the new status, the situation is stabilized. In your case, it appears that your body has not adjusted to the altered hormone milieu and hence these abnormal bleeding patterns and other symptoms are seen. I would ask you to consult your health care provider and choose an alternate form of contraception. You also need to have monitoring of hepatic, cardiovascular and coagulation status.

I have gone through your query and here are the answers. 1.There is no 100% safe procedure. Every method has its own side effects. Yet, Copper-T is considered to have lesser side effects and more efficacy. 2. Some people experience heavier bleeding with the IUD, especially during the initial months. If this persists, the IUD should be removed and an alternative method of contraception is chosen. 3. Weight gain is not a problem as it is not hormonal. Likewise, there is no hindrance to breast feeding. 4. If you are asking for other ways of birth control, there are several options available. You can get details from your health care provider. 5. There is no medication in the IUD. Hence, adjustment should be immediate. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, My self purusottam.

After that on 1 June 2014 she face more problem like to much bleeding. Please give suggestion what i do?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. In the current scenario, the most likely cause of the heavier bleeding is the use of the emergency contraceptive pill. I would suggest a proper clinical evaluation by an expert to exclude other causes like an undetected pregnancy. If the intercourse took place during the fertile or ovulation period, she has higher chance of conception as she had vomited soon after the consumption of the pill thus reducing the contraceptive effect. If pregnancy is negative, styptics and hormones can be prescribed to control the bleeding. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"okay so saturday september 22. 2012 me and my boyfriend had sex and he ejaculated in me and he had a condom on but it broke on the side so idont know it got in me and i took plan b 18 hours later on september 23, 2012 so can you please answer this please?!?!?!?!?! im freaking out!!","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. The efficacy rate of emergency contraceptive pill decreases as the duration of intake from the unprotected intercourse increases. However, as you took the pill within the stipulated time, you are well protected, the range is around 85%. In addition, if you are in your safe or non-ovulation period during the intercourse, you are naturally protected. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next menstrual period and this is when conception can happen.

In the current scenario, you seem to have experienced withdrawal bleeding after using the emergency contraceptive pill. Subsequent scanty menstrual flow with altered color of the discharge is due perhaps to hormone imbalance created by using the emergency contraceptive pill. I would ask you to get a proper clinical appraisal, a sonogram of the pelvis preferably in the trans-vaginal route, to clarify. Further management can be planned accordingly.

I would like to know if your wife has been under medical surveillance while taking the medication for induction of medical abortion. If not, I would ask you to contact a specialist right away. Uterine contraction caused by the medication leads to the pain. Though bleeding is a feature of the abortion, heavy bleeding should call for concern. Also, medical abortion is to be done until 9 weeks of pregnancy only. Better results are seen until 7 weeks. Inadequate dosage can lead to an incomplete abortion and heavy bleeding, infection and infertility problems in future. Please get further help from your health care provider. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I'm definitely not sexually active, but yesterday I found this purplish brownish discharge in my underwear. I'm supposed to start my period in about a week and am on birth control for my migraines. I put a tampon in and took it out later to see if I could figure out if it was blood or whatever it was. But it didn't smell right or look right. When I put it in the toilet it filled up with water and definitely showed that it was, in fact, a purple. Could you tell me what it possibly is? Maybe a side effect of the sronyx(the birth control I'm using)?

You can take your first birth control pill any day of the month, but you may need a backup birth control method (like condoms) for the first 7 days.Combination Pills (COCs)If you start combination pills within 5 days after your period starts, you’ll be protected from pregnancy right away. For example, if you get your period Monday morning, you can start the pill anytime until Saturday morning and be protected from pregnancy right away.If you start combination pills any other time, you’ll be protected from pregnancy after 7 days of taking the pill. Use another method of birth control — like a condom or female condom — if you have vaginal sex during the first week you’re on the pill.Progestin-Only Pills (Mini Pills)You can start progestin-only pills at any time. You’ll be protected from pregnancy after 48 hours (2 days). So use another method of birth control (like condoms) if you have vaginal sex during the first 48 hours.Your nurse or doctor can help you figure out the best time to start your birth control pills, and when they’ll start working for you."},{"Patient":"I've recently been having a period after sex and some clotting,I had a smear this year which came back clear but I've changed my birth control pill this year to the mini pill which has never seemed to have settled just wondering if these two are linked.","Doctor":"The progestin-only pill is better than regular birth control pills if you are breast-feeding because the mini-pill will not change your milk production.The mini-pill may be safer for some women to use. This pill is safe for women who are older than 35. It is also safer for women who smoke, have high blood pressure, are overweight or have a history of blood clots.Regular birth control pills make some women feel sick to their stomach. The progestin-only pill might not cause this problem.EFFECTIVENESS:No contraceptive method is perfect, even when you use it the right way. Two or three of every 100 women who use the progestin-only pill the right way could still get pregnant. This risk of pregnancy is almost the same as the risk with regular birth control pills. Remember that both kinds of birth control pills are better at preventing pregnancy than condoms.SIDE EFFECTS :You might have a little bleeding between your periods for several months after you start taking the progestin-only pill.Common side effects of the mini-pill are weight gain (which usually goes away when you stop taking the pill), tender breasts, and bleeding between your periods."},{"Patient":"For the past several weeks I haven't felt myself. Firstly some basic data about myself: I'm 5'10, 130-135lbs, 32 year old Caucasian male. I suffer from allergies and take Claritin, I am also allergic to penecillin. I take excedrin for migraines on occasion.For symptoms, I have been feeling overall fatigue. Great difficulty wake up in the morning as I feel very groggy. This week or so I have headaches that fade in and out. The past few days I've had abdominal discomfort (dull ache around the navel area). Every so often I also feel chest discomfort of pain. It is NOT a radiating pain, and it's always the same location. It's a slightly stinging pain but also a bit dull at the same time (I'm aware it's a bit of a contradiction) and sometimes I feel a kind of sinking feeling in my chest.In general I have difficulty getting to sleep as i just do not feel like going to sleep, even though I may be physically and mentally exhausted. It has gotten worse the past couple weeks and now I just don't know why I won't go to sleep even though I'm barely able to stay awake.My question, as it were, is there something terribly wrong with me? Something I'm not aware of?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Sleeplessness, tiredness, chest pain, difficulty in waking up, etc. can be due to stress disorder or depression or anxiety.

Abnormal menstrual pattern is usually observed with hormone contraception until the body adjusts to the altered hormone milieu. Also, weight gain while on the hormones increases the need for higher doses thus creating hormone imbalances and hence, menstrual disturbances. If you do not fit into either pattern, you need further evaluation. Styptics help to control the spotting. Please maintain proper nourishment and good genital hygiene. Please take the help of your health care provider for further management. Take care."},{"Patient":"I had my period on July 7th I had intercourse July 11 got a little paranoid and took the next choice pill on the 13th now six days later I'm bleeding like its my period again and I just had my period last week??! Heard this might be a side affect but how long does the bleeding  last and will my cycle go back to normal? I have taken plan b so many times and this has never happen?","Doctor":"Hello,After taking emergency pill (Next Choice), you had gotten withdrawal bleeding. It is quite common and natural phenomena.It will stop automatically within 3-5 days in most cases. But next cycle may be delayed 1-2 weeks due to hormonal imbalance and mental stress.In case of delayed period more than 1 wk, you need to undergo one home pregnancy test for confirmation. Maintain genital hygiene. Practice safe sex in future.Good luck."},{"Patient":"I'm on birth control, I stayed at my boyfriends house and we had unprotexted sex and I ended up staying the night there, so I didn't take the pill for that night. So I took the one I missed the next night, along with the one I was supposed to take. Is there any chance that I'm pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. I have gone through your query and would like to offer you some information. If you have been on oral contraception for more than 3 months, you are well protected. Since you made up for the missed pill, you need not worry about failure since it is only one pill. Please remember that you will need additional protection if you miss more than two pills. There is no need to go for an emergency contraceptive pill. This can lead to hormone imbalance and breakthrough bleeding.

It is common for abnormal menstrual presentation to be observed while on hormone contraception during the initial months until the body adjusts to the new hormone milieu. However, if such disturbance appears after sometime, you need further evaluation by an expert. I would ask you, in the current scenario, to get a proper clinical evaluation, followed by a sonogram of the pelvis, preferably in the trans-vaginal route,to know the status of the pelvic organs and to help plan further management. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi i took the pill yasmin for 3 days and stopped. My period was due 2 days ago but hasn't come and i had sex with my boyfriend but he didn't ejaculate. I'm very worried i could be pregnant. Is it normal for my period to be late after stopping taking the pill 3 days into my period?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. If you used the oral contraceptive pills only for three days and then stopped, hormonal imbalance is bound to be developed and this is the most likely cause of the delayed period. Pregnancy cannot happen with an intercourse, even if unprotected, around the expected period, because it is safe. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is when pregnancy can happen. Sudden weight changes, stress, infections, use of certain medications and cysts of the ovary are other possible causes for an abnormal menstrual pattern. Please get further help from your health care provider if you become overdue by a week. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi,i had sex on 12 13 and 14.my periods occur on 14th of every month except in emergency case when i take i pill.i took regesterone tablet on 14th and i hadnt got my periods yet.am worried.please help.how many times its safe to use i pill.i use it 1 time for every 2 months.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. Emergency contraceptive pill contains high dose of progesterone and hence can cause menstrual disturbances due to altered hormone balance. It should be used only once or twice a year and not more frequently. You need not worry about pregnancy during this cycle since you had the intercourse during the safe period. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next menstrual cycle and this is the fertile period when an unprotected intercourse can cause conception. Your period may have been delayed due to the use of Regestrone. Please wait for a couple of days and get further help if you become overdue by a week.

Is it essential that the withdrawal bleeding will happen within 5-7 days? If it doesn't happen does it mean the pill did not work?2.

It is not necessary that withdrawal bleeding should occur always after the use of the emergency contraceptive pill. This does not mean that the pill did not work. 2. Please specify if you are asking about the blood test for pregnancy. Hormone assay can detect the high progesterone levels but detection of the source of origin needs analysis of the hormone compound. 3. Since you did not have a proper intercourse and also since you took the pill within the stipulated time interval, you are well protected.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"About a week a a few days ago I had unprotected sex with my girl who has been very faithful. 2 or 3 weeks before I ve had unprotected sex with 2 others but both of them were and still are clean.

If you self-medicated for inducing the abortion, you should see a specialist for further help. You also need a sonogram of the pelvis preferably in the trans-vaginal route to clarify. Any retained products would have caused persistent bleeding/infection and so on. Ineffective abortion can lead to continuation of the pregnancy,but, since you had heavy bleeding after medication, this is unlikely. Pregnancy test remains positive for sometime after the abortion since the hormone levels take time to decline. The test can be repeated now.

Since her ovulation status is unpredictable owing to irregular periods, the best way out in the current scenario is to get the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres now. If positive, you have to see a specialist for further management. If you do not wish to retain the pregnancy, preliminary investigations like blood counts, urinalysis are done and a trans-vaginal sonogram to locate the gestation sac and the age of the pregnancy and go for an induced medical abortion under surveillance. If negative, it is mostly due to the hormone imbalance which needs to be corrected.

Firstly, pregnancy cannot be detected soon after conception unless you have been taking the basal body temperatures from day one of the cycle. The earliest way is the blood test which can be done ten days after ovulation. In the current scenario, the most likely cause of the spotting is the withdrawal bleeding seen after consumption of the emergency contraceptive pill which will give enough protection as you took it within the stipulated time after the intercourse. You can also expect your next natural period to get delayed by a week or two and if this prolongs, please get further help from an expert.

In the current scenario, your chances of failure are very remote since you have been on oral contraception almost continuously. However, if you have taken a long break before you started the fresh course of pills, you need additional protection in this cycle. Then you have to consume the emergency contraceptive pill. Please remember that you may experience withdrawal bleeding subsequently as the emergency contraceptive pill contains high dose of progesterone. Hope your query has been answered.

I have gone through your query and would like to offer you some information. If you have had the period after completion of the monthly pill course, you need not worry about failure.

In the current scenario, I would ask you to seek help immediately from your health care provider. Your symptoms are suggestive of a possible displacement of the IUD.

There need not be complete penetration to cause conception. Deposition of semen or the pre-ejaculate on the vagina is sufficient as the sperms can swim efficiently.2. Use of emergency contraceptive pill within the stipulated time interval, like you have done, offers very good protection. Even if ovulation had occurred, the pill effect makes fertilization difficult and if there is chances to happen, makes implantation difficult. 3. You can expect withdrawal bleeding a couple of days after the intake of the pill.

There is no need to use an emergency contraceptive pill around the menstrual period because this is the safe period. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period. So, in the manner you have described, you cannot get pregnant and hence, there is no need to worry.

In the current scenario, I think your bleeding is due perhaps to the instrumentation during the procedure of removal of the IUD. It can also be your natural period, if it is due. Do not worry if the bleeding is lesser than normal, worry if it is heavier.

But then after couple of months I haven't had a period at all, Is that normal? But there's day I feel bloated feeling like I'm 4mths pregnant. Is that normal too?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. About 20 percent of people using Mirena can develop absence of a period or 'amenorrhea'. However, if there is more than 6 weeks interval since the last period pregnancy should be excluded, as this is the first time. If amenorrhea is established, there is no need to worry. In the current scenario, therefore, I would ask you to go for a pregnancy test and a sonogram of the pelvis, preferably in the trans-vaginal route to clarify. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi im 29 i was on birth control mirena for a year because i had alot of side effects plus i wadnt getting periods once i took it off my period came for like a week after that i didnt get no periods after 4 months and now I ve been on my period for over 12 days and with think blood clot and real bad sharp cramps i did pregnancy test and they were all negative im scare don t know what is going on can you help","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. I have gone through your query and would like to offer some suggestions. Your symptoms are related to the withdrawal effects of the IUD as it is hormone based. The subsequent hormone disturbances take some time to get stabilized and then, your cycles should get back on track. Pregnancy is not the likely cause as evidenced by several negative tests. You can clarify through a trans-vaginal sonogram and plan further management. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi I went to have a coil fitted thismorning, unfortunately I was unable to have it done because I was told i Have a tight neck of my womb and was told to see somebody different. Do u think a a coil will be suitable for me, am 31 and have had 3 children via c-sections.  Thankyou","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. If your last cesarean section was more than a year ago and if the postoperative recovery was uneventful on all occasions, the chances of scar induration are minimal. In such a situation, you can go for the insertion of an IUD, though other modes of contraception are preferable. The tightness of the os of the cervix is more likely due to absence of a vaginal birth and this can be overcome by performing the procedure under anesthesia to help dilate the cervix. Please see a specialist for further help. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I just had my implanon removed after 2 years, about two weeks ago. I was having pregnancy symptoms while on the implant and took two home pregnancy tests. The first was positive (morning urine) the next one was two days later and was a negative (afternoon urine). I called the Dr and have me another urine test which also came out negative. My fiance and I both agreed to still have it removed and ttc. This was April 18th. I ve been cramping since before the removal. I was due for my period April 20 and never got it. My breasts are tender and I have slight cramping. My stomach is noticeably swollen and I m hungry all the time. Also, yesterday, there was a slight pink color when I wiped yesterday. No blood or anything after, and it happened twice. Should I demand a blood test? Why would I have had a negative positive?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. Here are your answers: 1. The most likely reason for the dubious result with the home pregnancy tests is the standard of the test kit and the sampling time. Home pregnancy tests read well when performed 3-7 days after the missed period using a fresh early morning sample. 2. I would ask you to go for the blood test in the current scenario for clarification. 3. The other likely cause of the delayed cycle is the altered hormone balance due to removal of the implant. Your symptoms are perhaps related to this. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Ok so Sep 25 I had unprotected sex with my bf i took plan b the morning after.

Firstly, you do not need an emergency contraceptive if you have the intercourse during the safe period of your cycle. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile phase of the cycle. Secondly, the high hormone content in the emergency contraceptive pill creates hormone imbalances and this is the most likely cause for your current symptoms.

Firstly, you had the intercourse soon after your period and in the usual case, even without any protection, this is the safe period. Secondly, your cycle is protected.

Firstly, you did not need the emergency contraceptive pill as you were in the safe period during the intercourse. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is when an unprotected intercourse may lead to pregnancy. The emergency contraceptive pill has a half-life of about 5 days. This is sufficient to cover both the sexual acts. You do not need another pill. As the pill contains high dose of hormone, you may see some withdrawal bleeding and your next natural period may get delayed by a week or two. Please go for regular contraception if you wish to delay pregnancy.

As the oral contraceptive pill has been stopped, there is some hormone imbalance created. this takes some time to settle down and return of ovulation may take a couple of months.

I have gone through your query and would like to offer some suggestions. Though it is mentioned that the pill should be taken at the same time every day, a few minutes up to half-an-hour irregularity is not a big problem.

In the current scenario, your symptoms are more likely to be due to the IUD inside, the hormone effects thereupon. I would suggest a review of the IUD and check if there is any displacement.

If the position is not disturbed and if there is no sign of any infection, the hormone effect settles down in course of time. Else, removal is the option.

I have gone through your query and would like to offer my opinion. In the current scenario, chances of pregnancy seem to be less likely as you are very regular with your contraceptive pill. Weight changes that happen while on the pill can lead to hormone imbalance thereby leading to breakthrough bleeds.

In the current scenario, it is more likely that you are experiencing some hormone imbalance. If the intercourse occurred during the fertile period, however, pregnancy has to be excluded through a home pregnancy test done 3-7 days after the expected period with a fresh early morning sample of urine or the blood test.

However, during the initial months, it is preferable to use additional protection. Menstrual disturbances ranging from heavy and/or prolonged periods, inter-menstrual bleeding, scanty periods and absent periods can be seen. This corrects once the body adjusts to the altered hormone levels. Your symptoms are not specific only for pregnancy; they can also be seen with hormone imbalance.

If you have regular 28-30 day cycles, you had the intercourse during your safe or non-ovulation period. Hence, your chances of conception are nil. There is no need to do anything to avoid conception. You can safely wait for your next natural period. Please do not stress since stress and anxiety can alter the menstrual cycles by disrupting the hormone milieu. Hope you find this information useful. Take care."},{"Patient":"i am a 23 old male 170 lbs, i have psoriasis near the bottom of my balls, and has actually come up on the head of my penis area, but i have noticed that the tip of my piece at the pee hole opening both sides have white bumps and they some times stick together. i have picked at them a little and they start to bleed right away... could it be of an std that i have not picked up on?i have to pull both sides apart before peeing and i also have had more urges to pee even if i just finished peeing","Doctor":"Hello welcome to 'Ask A Doctor' service.

I have gone through your query and would like to offer my opinion. If you happen to have regular 28-30 day cycles, you had the intercourse during your fertile period. Yet, as you took the emergency pill within the stipulated time interval, you are well protected. You can expect withdrawal bleeding after a couple of days as the pill contains high hormone doses. Your next natural period also may get delayed by a week or two. Please get further help if you become overdue by ten days.

In the current scenario, you could experience menstrual disturbances, infection at the insertion site, decreased effectiveness etc. I would ask you to contact your health care provider to plan further management. If the device is unfit for use, it should be removed and you will have to get a new one inserted. You have to use additional protection in the meanwhile. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"I got the depo shot recently for birth control but i've noticed i haven't stopped bleeding since its been effective. should i get the shot again and maybe my body will be use to it and i will stop bleeding. Or will i continue to bleed with my 2nd shot.","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. When you use hormone contraception, menstrual irregularities are often observed as the body adjusts itself to the new hormone milieu. This takes a couple of cycles. However, prolonged bleeding should be evaluated and managed properly. In the current scenario, you have to take the advice of your health care provider and plan further management. I do not suggest another dose. Instead, you may need to manage the bleeding with styptics and if necessary, hormone course. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I messed up on taking my birth control this month. I should have had my period by now  and started a new pack, however that has not happened. I took a test a couple of weeks and it was negative. The last couple of days, I have noticed that my feet are swollen (edema) and my blood pressure seems elevated. what to do?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through the query and understood your concern. In the current scenario, you need a proper clinical evaluation, a test for pregnancy followed by a sonogram of the pelvis preferably in the trans-vaginal route to know the status of the pelvic organs to help plan further management. You should also check the blood pressure, get urinalysis and blood counts. It is possible that your hormone levels are disturbed due to the faulty intake of the pills and hence, your cycle is likely to have become unsafe.

Should I be worried?!?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. There is no need to worry about the possibility of conception in the current scenario. The reasons being the use of an emergency contraceptive pill within the stipulated time and the attainment of normal menstrual pattern after the incident. The cause of the current delay in the menstrual cycle is more likely to be a transient hormone imbalance. This can happen due to stress or use of the high progesterone pill in the previous cycle thus disrupting the hormonal milieu of the body. Please check with your health care provider and plan further management. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend yesterday, and he came inside. I am not taking birth control pills religiously. I took the ECP (Nordette) 2 hours after the deed, but i am still worried that it may not be as effective as i thought it would. I am on the 3rd day of being fertile, and i am going to ovulate in 3 days, too. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. Your chances of conception are higher since you are in the ovulation period. Yet, as you took the emergency pill soon after the intercourse, you receive ample protection, so please do not worry. If you have taken only a single tablet, however, you cannot be protected and you need an emergency pill. These medications can lead to withdrawal bleeding a few days after use and can also delay the next natural period by a week or two. Please get further help from a specialist if you become overdue by ten days.

I would like to know why you used the medication repeatedly, whether to induce an abortion after confirming a pregnancy or simply to induce a delayed period. Whatever it may be, you should not self-medicate with such a medication. Please see a specialist as early as possible to get a complete appraisal of the situation and plan further management. A sonogram of the pelvis, preferably in the trans-vaginal route is needed to clarify the situation.

Nordette is often used as an emergency contraception and is shown to be effective in the dose as mentioned. You can see withdrawal bleeding 3-7 days after use of the medication. This is suggestive of the efficacy of the drug and protection from pregnancy. Your next natural period may get delayed by a week. Please see your health care provider for further help if you become overdue by ten days. You may need to get a sonogram of the pelvis and a blood test for pregnancy at that stage to help plan further management.

Definitely, your hormone milieu must have got disturbed due to the frequent use of the high dose of progesterone emergency pill intake in the past. Weight gain is a side effect of hormone use. However, other causes also should be explored. You need to monitor your work-diet ratio, use a calorie-counter to adjust your needs, get an assay of hormones including thyroid profile, serum Prolactin and blood sugar. Restrict the use of emergency pill to one or two occasions per year.

Intercourse cannot be detected through blood and urine tests. It is detected through a vaginal exam and detection of sperms.

Firstly, any unprotected intercourse during the safe period does not cause conception. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period in the cycle. So, if you happened to have the intercourse during the safe period, you are naturally protected. The intake of the emergency pill occurred during the stipulated time after the intercourse, so the protection offered is in the range of 98%. The pill can cause side effects like nausea, headaches, vomiting, breast tenderness and withdrawal bleeding owing to its high hormone content. The next natural period also may get delayed by a week or two. Please restrict the use of the pill to one or two occasions per year and get further help if you become overdue by ten days for your next period.

A kind of bloody taste in my mouth as wellI've also been sleeping much more lately and can hardly stay awake during the day. Been having some light nosebleeds too. And almost daily headaches. My weight has fluctuated a few pounds, but that's pretty normal for me I guess.From this information do you think I could be pregnant by any chance?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for sharing your health concern with us. Well, with the description of your clinical picture, it is more likely that you are experiencing some hormone imbalance and pregnancy is a remote possibility. This is because you had intercourse just around your menstrual period which is considered the safe period, even if you had some breakthrough ovulation due to irregular pill use. I would ask you to get a proper clinical evaluation, get a sonogram of the pelvis and a blood test for pregnancy to help plan further management. Hope your query has been answered. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Hello. I was just wondering how long after stopping Yasmin contraceptive pills completely do you expect to have a period? I stopped taking them about a month ago but still haven't had one and was just wondering whether this was normal? Thanks for your help.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for letting us know your health concern. It is not normal to miss a period for so long after stopping the hormone contraception as withdrawal bleeding should be seen soon after. You need a sonogram of the pelvis, preferably in the trans-vaginal route, to know the status of the pelvic organs and plan further management. If pregnancy is excluded, you may be prescribed medication to induce a period. Return of ovulation usually occurs in one or two cycles. Please maintain a healthy weight, healthy diet and regular exercise. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, I accidently took 2 microgynon 30 pills in one day. I would need to rest for 7 days, but now I am missing one tablet, I sopous to finish on saturday and start on sunday, but now i will finish on friday... So should I start next one on Saturday or Sunday as normal?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for letting us know your health concern. I have gone through your query and understood the concern. There is no worry if you have to finish a day early. You can start the new pack from day one of your next menstrual cycle. You may receive your period a day earlier than usual since you stopped the medication early. So, if you wait for a week, go for it on Saturday instead of Sunday. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"i just took an emergency contraceptive pill, i had to take one the last month as well.. and i had serious mood swings and felt psychotic at one point.. im nervous about this happening again.. how can i make sure i dont have to deal with another month of anxiety, depression and crying?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. Firstly, I would not suggest such frequent use of emergency pills since they tend to tilt the hormone balance badly owing to their high hormone content. Their use should be restricted to one or two occasions per year. In the current scenario, you can go for anxiolytics like Alprazolam in low doses after consulting your health care provider to tide over the mood swings. You can also try breathing exercises and yoga. Please use regular contraception in future. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have a 13 year old daughter whom I started on birth control as a safety precaution, however she cannot remember to take the pill regularly which is how I got pregnant with her at 17. Is she to young to get the arm birth control implant or is there a better alternative for her?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for letting us know your health concern. I have gone through your query and would like to offer my opinion. If your daughter cannot be regular with her oral contraception, you can opt either a depo shot or an implant. She may not be the ideal candidate for the insertion of a Mirena IUD, which is preferred in those who have had one or more children. Please get a proper clinical evaluation by a specialist before embarking on another mode of hormone contraception. Hope your query has been clarified. Take care."},{"Patient":"hii have a 2.5 years daughter. My wife breastfeeds her.we want to use a contraceptive pill. i read about the mini pill.

The mini pill contains only progesterone and all the available brands contain the same preparation, norethindrone. The pill may be started from day one of the cycle or on the nearest Sunday,whichever is convenient. Before starting the medication, your wife needs to be evaluated if she is fit to receive it and there are no allergies to the medication and the tartrazine content in the preparation. Periodic evaluation to check the hepatic, coagulation and cardiovascular profile is necessary. Any breast masses must be reported immediately. The brand names \\"Camila\\", \\"Micronor\\" or \\"Norethindrone\\" are some of the preparations available. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Ive been on the pill for 11 months.

Moreover, if you are in the safe period of your cycle, you are naturally protected. Another alternative is to ask for the insertion of an IUD as a measure of emergency contraception. This also serves future purposes. Please remember that your menstrual cycle is going to get disturbed for one or two months as you have consumed high hormone doses.

I had unprotected sex on June 23, I was on my 8th day of my cycle (it lasts 32 days) so to be safe i took plan B on June 25. I had a 4-5 day period on July 2. And Yesterday morning (July 28) I had sex but the condom got stuck and my bf had to take it out. He checked and he said it was dry on the outside and all fluid was in but did notice some drops outside me. so if I count my period count from July 2, I am on my 27th day.

I can understand it messes the cycles and one can feel terrible for a while. That I don t mind.. What worries me if I will be able to get pregnant later. Basically, what are the risks in all sense of taking plan B twice in a cycle/month I appreciate your responses!!","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. If I were to treat you, I would not suggest using the emergency contraception twice in a single month. In fact, the use of the emergency pill should be restricted to once or twice per year since the high hormone content in the pill is going to disrupt the hormone milieu badly creating menstrual disturbances and difficulties in conception in future. As you have already taken once in this cycle, your next natural period is likely to get delayed by a week or two. Hence, it is difficult to say if you are going to ovulate if at all, and if so, when in this cycle. Taking another pill is definitely going to add to the problem. Please wait for your next period and if you become overdue by ten days see a specialist for further help. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have been taking Junel 1/20 non-stop (with the approval of my OBGYN) since May 20, within 5 minutes of 11 a.m. each day - no pills missed.

I m wondering if the spotting will actually stop sooner rather than later...so far it has not.

It is true that during the first few months of hormone contraception, as the body adjusts itself to the new hormone milieu, there are menstrual irregularities, prolonged/heavy periods, intermittent spotting/bleeding, frequent/absent/delayed periods etc. However, if there is persistent spotting like you are experiencing, for so long, you should definitely report the matter to your doctor. Coagulation profile, liver profile and blood counts are to be done periodically in addition to general examination. In the current scenario, you may need additional hormones or may have to change the combination. Hope you find this information useful. Take care."},{"Patient":"hello!

From the description you have given, I feel that you have some breakthrough bleeding throughout. This can happen during the initial months of hormone contraception as the body adjusts itself to the new hormone milieu. This can also happen when the hormone content is not sufficient and the vascularity of the endometrium is compromised. Perhaps you have to add some more progestogen to arrest the discharge. Weight changes, stress, infections and sometimes cysts on the ovary can lead to such a situation. I would ask you to go for a proper clinical appraisal, a trans-vaginal sonogram, blood counts, urinalysis and plan further management accordingly.

Did the amoxicillin somehow affect my birth control and how it syncs my periods? I ve never bled between periods while on the pill.

The infection and the antibiotic can cause the spotting as there is reduced efficacy of the oral pill in these circumstances. If you have not had any intercourse during the course of the treatment, especially during the second and third weeks of the cycle, you need not worry about conception with a possible failure in contraception. This spotting is likely to be premenstrual. Please do not worry, it should settle down with the next course of pills. Get help from an expert if the spotting persists.

I am not pregnant either, I am worried about my health. Thanks!","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for posting your query. The emergency pill contains high dose of progesterone and this is the cause for the early or withdrawal bleeding you experienced. The hormone imbalance created is likely to be responsible for the persistent spotting. The altered color of the discharge suggests old bleeding which is retained in the uterus. Some breakthrough bleeding also is a possibility and is presented similarly. You can also expect your next natural period to get delayed by a week or two.

Thank you .","Doctor":"Birth Control Pills:Birth control pills (also called oral contraceptive pills and the “Pill”) are a type of female hormonal birth control method and are very effective at preventing pregnancy. The Pills are small tablets that you swallow each day. Most pills contain two types of synthetic (man-made) female hormones: estrogen and progestin. The hormones in the pills prevent pregnancy by suppressing your pituitary gland, which stops the development and release of the egg in the ovary (ovulation).Another type of pill contains only one hormone (progestin) and is called either the “progestin-only pill,” or the “mini-Pill.” It works by stopping ovulation and by helping to prevent the male’s sperm from reaching If you want to avoid pregnancy or want to keep gap between babies, you need to resort to the various birth control options available such as condoms, intrauterine contraceptive devices or oral contraceptive pills. The choice ultimately depends upon one’s preferences.Here is a list of some commonly available oral contraceptive pills: Rasmin: a combination of estradiol and drospirenone prevents preganancy and cures irregular periods. The pill is also known to treat ovarian cystsOvral: Progestin and estrogen pills prevent the liberation of eggs from ovaries and avoid pregnancyBandhan: this is another popular birth control pill containing lenorogestrel. This pill inhibits the fertilization of egg by sperm and interferes with the lining of uterus. So the process of implantation is hamperedDuoluton L: This common contraceptive pill also contains levonorgetsrel and protects you from conceivingChoice: It is another economical and easily available oral contraceptive pill. It contains levonorgestrel and prevents fertilization of egg by spermDeviry: This pill contains medroxyprogesterone, a progesterone derivative. Besides preventing pregnancy, medroxyprogeterone treats breast cancer and other menstrual problemsMTpill: this commonly available pill contains mifepristone, a synthetic steroid. It interferes with the hormones required for the continuation of pregnancyCentron: it contains ormeloxifene-the estrogen derivative. It prevents pregnancy and also treats dysfunctional uterine bleedingIn nutshell the oral contraceptive pills are an easy affordable and effective way to avoid unwanted pregnancy.

You can have several sexual encounters during the period of pill coverage. Though the protection offered for each sexual encounter decreases with increasing time interval, the drug has been shown to be retained in the body with a half-life of 5-7 days. This means an earlier encounter may cause conception while the later one is protected. Instead, I would suggest going for regular contraception. Also, the high hormone content in the emergency pills makes them unsuitable for regular use. Their use can be down only once or twice per year. Hope you find this information useful.

Does this bleeding mean it worked?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. The occurrence of withdrawal bleeding after consumption of the emergency pill indicates effective function and pregnancy has not happened. The high hormone content in the pill disrupts the hormone milieu and therefore delays the next natural period by a week or two.

While on hormone contraception, if antibiotics are used for any purpose, the efficacy of contraception is decreased and failures can occur. If you are pregnant, you should get a definitive reading on HPT if the hormone levels are sufficient. Else, you can go for the blood test for pregnancy as this is more sensitive and specific. I would also ask you to go for a trans-vaginal sonogram to confirm/exclude pregnancy for sure and also to know the status of the pelvic organs. Further management can be planned accordingly.

With your recent symptoms, it is possible that you could be pregnant or are in the premenstrual phase. Home pregnancy test reads well three weeks after ovulation and for an earlier and better clarification, you should get an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres ten days after your last intercourse. A trans-vaginal sonogram done three weeks after the last intercourse also helps to detect the cause. Weight changes, stress, infections and use of certain medications can create hormone disturbances and affect the contraception. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I ve had implanon for 2 yrs now.

You need a proper clinical examination, a sonogram of the pelvis preferably in the trans-vaginal route, blood counts, coagulation and liver profile and urinalysis. Pregnancy should be excluded. Local causes like erosions, polyps and infections should also be excluded.

If you did not have any side effects like vomiting soon after the pill intake, then you can expect withdrawal bleeding a few days after the pill consumption. This usually lasts for a couple of days. Your next natural period may get delayed by a week  or two. Chances of pregnancy are very remote and if you were in the safe or non-ovulation period during the sexual encounter, you are naturally protected, in addition.

It was also about the consistency of a wet cotton ball and had a secondary clot inside of it that was about half the length and a little thicker. I am having severe cramping that is getting worse. I cant get in touch with my dr at the moment so any info would really help.","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. I would like to know why your doctor suggested Tamoxifen and steroid. Your symptoms suggest that you are experiencing metropathic cycle. The clot could be a discharge of endometrium as a whole. You need further evaluation which includes coagulation profile, blood counts, hormone profile, urinalysis and sonogram of the pelvis preferably in the trans-vaginal route. Maintenance of a normal BMI and regular exercise is also important. Supplementary therapy is also needed to aid in the treatment. Styptics are needed to control the bleeding; hormone courses may be necessary to check the bleeding and set the cycles on track. Metformin is of help if insulin resistance is detected.

Return of ovulation is commonly seen in six weeks after removal of the implant. So, the same should hold good for you though you did not get the implant removed, but it would be almost non-functional. Your symptoms could be due to withdrawal of the hormone effect as the hormone leaves the body within a week of removal. If you wish to exclude/confirm pregnancy, you can go for the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres. This is more sensitive and specific and clarifies the situation. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello mam/sir, I had my periods on 15th jan , me and my husband had sex on 18 so I took ipill for not getting pregnant.

Since you have taken the emergency pill, your hormone balance will be disturbed and your next natural period may get delayed by a week or two. You may have to wait for a couple of cycles to regularize and then go for your trial for conception. In the first place, you did not need any emergency pill since you were in the safe period during the intercourse.

Since you are almost always regular with your oral contraceptive pills, you need not worry about possibility of conception, as there is none. Moreover, you had the intercourse soon after the onset of the menstrual period. There is no need for an emergency pill.

Two years ago when I was performing oral sex on my boyfriend, his frenulum got caguht on the hook. It took me about 30-60 seconds to get it off. He did not break but it tore and was bleeding. He was in a great deal of pain. Based on all of my research online it seemed like it would heal up on its own and be fine. However it is still an issue to this day. He has lots of pain with insertion durring sex and cannot mastrubate more than once in a day  or have sex for very long without having alot of pain and discomfort. This has not only caused physical discomfort but it has caused him to be depressed and have low self esteem and less of a will to live  he still resents me for it. We rarely have sex anymore. He refuses to see a doctor because he is pretty sure the only option is surgery to either repair the frenulum or have a full on circumcsion.

I presume you have been using Candid cream for vaginitis with no relief and you wish to have some prescription for oral medication. This should be done after a proper clinical examination and swab tests and not online. Please see a specialist in person for a proper appraisal of the situation. Also, if you do not wish to conceive now, you should ask for regular contraception that suits you. Your partner also should be tested and treated if necessary. Abstain from further intercourse until you are healed well. You would need prophylaxis for about six months with courses of anti-fungal medication for total relief.

Or just viginal bleeding?  Is she pregnant??","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. Here is some information I would like to offer: 1. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period. This is the fertile period where an unprotected intercourse can cause pregnancy. Since you did not have intercourse during this period, she cannot conceive even without using any pill. 2. She consumed the emergency pill within the stipulated time interval, which offers around 90 percent protection. 3. The pill contains high doses of hormone and thus creates hormone disturbances. This can cause withdrawal bleeding and delay the next natural period. She should be experiencing the usual period. Vaginal bleeding cannot happen on its own without any cause. Please see a specialist for a proper clinical appraisal and further help. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I was about 7 days late with my period. I m not on a contraceptive, and my boyfriend and I aren t ready for a baby. His pharmacist friend suggested Cytotec. He gave me 4 pills. 200mg. At about 16.00 I inserted 1 vaginally and put one under my tongue. I started experiencing immense abdominal cramps. Severe period pains . No blood by 21.00. The boyfriend suggested I repeat what I did. So again, one under the tongue and one vaginally. I went to bed and woke up by 06.00. There was no blood, but a waterish discharge. By 08.00 I checked again and spotted light bleeding. Very light. I m still cramping but not as intolerable as last night. As soon as I saw the blood I took my first pill of the Minerva 35 contraceptive. Please let me know what I can do from here on out.

In this scenario, I would ask you to see a specialist immediately for confirmation of the abortion if you confirmed pregnancy, or if you just self-medicated without confirming pregnancy, confirmation of the pregnancy followed by a trans-vaginal sonogram to see if the abortion was effective are mandatory. This done, if everything is fine, you can go ahead with the hormone contraception. Please remember that hormone disturbances and heavy bleeding with chances of infection are consequences of such self medication so please do not repeat such things in future.

Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. As for any other mode of contraception, there is a slight failure rate for the implant too. If you are not sure of the home pregnancy test, you can go for the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres to confirm/exclude pregnancy. Home pregnancy tests should be done 3-7 days after the missed period with a fresh early morning sample of urine. A trans-vaginal sonogram done a week later can give the status of the pelvic organs and clarify the situation. Hope you find this information useful.

What is going on?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for posting your query. The cause of this irregular bleeding in the current cycle seems to have sprung from the change of regime you have taken. This may have created some hormone imbalance. Hormone imbalances are common during the initial months of hormone contraception and result in several menstrual irregularities like inter-menstrual spotting/bleeding, heavy bleeding or scanty periods, absent periods etc. Once the body adjusts to the new hormone milieu, stability is attained. In this scenario, I would ask you to contact your health care provider for a proper appraisal of the situation and either adjust the doses or add progesterone/styptics to control the bleeding and regularize it. Supplementary treatment is essential to make up for the loss. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

If you are suspecting smaller genitals, you can check your testosterone status, if the testosterone is on a lower side, we can go for testosterone replacement therapy and height will increase further.

With an intercourse soon after a menstrual period in a regular 28-30 day cycle, there is no need for emergency contraception. This is because the week before and the week after the period is safe as ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period. In future, I would suggest use of regular contraception if you wish to avoid pregnancy. Use of emergency pill should be restricted to one or two occasions per year since the high hormone content creates hormone imbalances and can affect future fertility. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I got period on 22nd December,on 26,27th December I had  sex and then on 27th morning I took  an I-pill (Emergency Contraceptive Pill),then again on 30and 31st December had sex.then on 1st January morning I have taken an i-pill again.So it is safe for me? is there  any chance to become pregnant or does the i-pill have any worse side effect?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through the query and understood your concern. Firstly, let me inform you that you had the intercourse during your safe period and did not need the emergency pill in the first instance. Presuming that you have a regular 28-30 day menstrual cycle, your ovulation would have fallen around the 7th of January. Since the sperm can remain active for up to 5 days after ejaculation and the ovum remains alive for 24 hours after ovulation, any unprotected intercourse during this period can cause conception, which you did not have. The emergency pill gives adequate protection when consumed within the stipulated time interval. As it contains high dose of hormone, menstrual irregularity can be expected. Your next natural period may get delayed by a week or two. Please restrict the use of the pill to one or two occasions per year. See a specialist for further support if you become overdue by ten days. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi. I keep needing to pee all the time and am having bad headaches.

Since the menstrual pattern in the current cycle is a deviation from your normal in addition to your symptoms of frequent micturition and headaches, I suggest that you test for pregnancy through the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres. If negative, which is more likely in view of your regularity in consuming the pill, the next possible cause is a urinary tract infection which should be excluded through urinalysis. A trans-vaginal/pelvic sonogram is also needed to know the status of the pelvic organs and exclude any cysts.

Do I need to take emergency contraception pill or let the nuvaring release the hormones during 7 days to regulate my hormones again?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. I have gone through the query and understood your concern. In the current scenario, you need to use other back up method of contraception until the ring is inside continuously for seven days subsequent to the reinsertion to allow the hormones to work. If you cannot leave the nuvaring inside for seven days , you have to use emergency contraception. Reinsertion should always be done after washing the ring with lukewarm water.

It s 5 weeks and 4 days since I last had intercourse and my period is 5 days late. I am spotting brown blood but minimal - only when I wipe after a pee. I have taken 2 pregnancy tests and both have been a strong negative. Is this normal of the copper coil or could I be pregnant?

I am anxious as I desperately don t want to be pregnant. I hope you can advise me. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. The cause of the delayed period and the breast tenderness is the high hormone content in the emergency contraceptive pill that you have consumed. This is also the cause of the withdrawal bleeding you experienced. Home pregnancy tests read well when performed 3-7 days after a missed period with a fresh early morning sample of urine. If you wish to exclude earlier, please get the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres. Further, a trans-vaginal sonogram done a week or two after the missed period gives the status of the pelvic organs and excludes/confirms pregnancy. Do not worry, you have very little chance of conception. Remember that stress also can delay a period. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have had an iud for a few years. I don t get my period.

I think that you should get evaluated for the position of the IUD in the current scenario. Displacement of the IUD can often lead to the symptoms you are experiencing. Another possibility is an ectopic pregnancy that could be pressing on the bowels and bladder.A sonogram of the pelvis should be taken to confirm/exclude pregnancy. If the IUD cannot be located , MRI or CT scan of the pelvis is needed to locate the device and plan further management. Infections and other local causes also have to excluded, though less likely in this situation. Hope you find this information useful.

If she has regular monthly cycles, she was in the safe period when you had the sexual encounter. Hence there is no chance of conception. Moreover, conception is very rare in the manner you have described. Please remember that pre-ejaculate contains enough sperm to cause conception even when deposited on the vagina during the fertile period. As she vomited before taking the emergency pill and not later, the activity of the pill is not affected. The pill can delay her next natural period by a week or two as it contains high hormone doses. Please see an expert for further management if she becomes overdue by ten days.

If you ad the intercourse during the safe period, you do not need any emergency contraception. However, if you are around the fertile or ovulation period, you need to take emergency contraception if you do not wish a pregnancy. Marvelon cannot help in a single dose; you have to go for a proper emergency pill. You can also opt for the insertion of an IUD if you need prolonged contraception.

Your friend had the intercourse during the fertile or ovulation period and as a result, her chances of conception are high. Yet, since she has taken the emergency pill soon after, she is 80-85 percent protected. She may expect some withdrawal bleeding after a couple of days after the pill use. Her next natural period also may get delayed by a week or two because the emergency pill contains high dose of progesterone. If she becomes overdue by ten days, she has to see a gynecologist for further management.

It is true that the initial couple of cycles after hormone contraception need additional protection as they are not completely protected.

I know plan b can cause a period so this didn't seem abnormal. but then a few days later I started bleeding again. This was 10 days ago and I'm still bleeding/spotting. It won't stop. Is this normal or should I get it checked out? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through the query and understood your concern. In the current scenario, you should get proper evaluation by an expert. Emergency contraceptive pill contains high dose of progestogen and this disrupts the hormone milieu. This is the cause of the withdrawal bleeding you experienced soon after the pill use. The subsequent bleeding/spotting probably corresponds to your natural period which has gone abnormal. You need to have styptics to arrest the bleeding, supportive treatment to correct the resulting deficiencies, a trans-vaginal/pelvic sonogram to know the status of the pelvic organs and if needed a course of hormones to put your cycle back on track. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I was on previously on birth control to regulate my cycle and came off of it in September. My cycle has been somewhat irregular since then, but I have still been having periods every month. I had unprotected sex last month (pull out method), but had my regular period two days after. It has now been 5 weeks since the first day of my last period, and I have taken several at home pregnancy tests, which came out negative. Could the late period still be due to me coming off of birth control? Or should I go to the doctors to get a pregnancy test completed?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. You had the intercourse just before the onset of your natural period and this makes it safe. Please note that ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period. Home pregnancy tests read well when performed 3-7 days after the missed period. You should also take into account the irregularity of your cycles in recent times. You have to count the longest cycle duration and if it passes this date also, then consider it as a missed period. You can get the blood test for a better clarification and see a specialist for further management. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Im 36 I tok plan b 8 days ago and when i went to wipe myself after urinating there was some blood and now it feels like im going to start my period which will be 2 weeks early is that normal?

Usually the hormonal control of the ovulation will appear by the second cycle only , so you will need to have additional contraception for the first month. After 7-10 days of the last pill , your periods should start .Hope you have been taking the pills punctually ,as the irregular pills can cause the ovulation in between . Usually the regimen to be followed is 21 pills ---7 days no pills---start next packet of 21 pills from the 8th day, even if there is no periods . You don't need to wait for the next periods. Next periods will occur in between. Now if you have not had periods yet even after 7-10 days, have a urine pregnancy test & rule out pregnancy. When confirmed as negative - have the same contraceptive pill ( 21 pills packet) twice a day for 10 days ( throw away the 21st pill) you will have the periods within 7-10 days. From the first day of that bleeding have the same 21 pills packet once a night for 21 days----7 days no pills---- start next packet from 8th day.

The bleeding you are experiencing is due to the withdrawal effect of the hormone. Your next natural period also may get delayed by a week or two. Please see a specialist for further evaluation if you become overdue by ten days.

According to your symptoms, it appears as though you are experiencing urethritis as evidenced by buning sensation after voiding urine. This can happen due to the trauma incurred during a rough intercourse as the female urethra is superficially placed and vulnerable to injury. The bleeding can be from the urethra or a withdrawal bleeding due to the pill. Please get urinalysis and inform your health care provider for proper management. Hope your query has been answered.

Pregnancy test can be performed as usual with an IUD in situ. If it happens to be a hormone IUD, it may be difficult to read the test, but, there should be no interference with the result. In fact, in such a scenario, the blood test and sonogram help a lot. If your IUD could not be removed under naked vision, I would suggest ultrasound-guided removal, which is often successful. If still difficult, you will need a hysteroscopy. Hope you find this information useful.

Severe cramping, to the point that you are nauseous are not normal.  This could be related to migration of the IUD into an improper location or into the cervix (the lower part of the uterus).  You need to contact the clinic where this was placed and state that you need an urgent visit.  They also need to perform an ultrasound to assess its location.  In the meantime check a pregnancy test and if it is positive, go immediately to the ER.I hope that this helps and good luck.Dr. Tim"},{"Patient":"So....

This commonly occurs early on after their insertion.  It also occurs over time because the progesterone in the implant leads to thinning of the uterine lining (which is normal).  This thinning is associated with breakthrough bleeding.  I do not think that this is your period because you cannot physiologically get a period every two weeks.  Finally, make sure that you check a pregnancy test.  I agree that contacting your OB/GYN is a great idea.I hope that this helps and good luck!Dr. Tim"},{"Patient":"Hello, I have had the implanon inserted for about 2 years now, I had a lot of spotting and so a couple of months ago I took birth control pills and that made the spotting stop. A couple of days ago I smoked marijuana and suddenly my spotting returned, could the marijuana have caused the spotting?","Doctor":"Thank you for your question and I will try to help.The most common complaint with these implants (they are progesterone implants) is breakthrough spotting.  Early on after their insertion, this is very common.  Later, such as after 2 years, the lining of the uterus becomes very thin (which is normal) and prone to bleeding.  This can once again be treated with birth control pills.  This has nothing to do with marijuana use.  Finally, make sure that you check a pregnancy test now and in 1-2 weeks.I hope that this helps and good luck!Dr. Tim"},{"Patient":"I have a merida IUD. I have not had a period in 2 1/2 years but recently started spotting. I have taken benedryl to sleep for the last five years and recently decided to wean myself off and switch to melatonin. What are the risks of pregnancy while on the IUD and how does it affect ovulation. Thank you","Doctor":"Thank you for the question and I am happy to help.The Mirena IUD secretes progesterone in the inside of the uterus and prevents the uterine lining from responding to the normal cycle of hormones produced by your ovaries.  The Mirena IUD does not affect ovulation - you are still ovulating while it is in place.  The main way that this IUD works is by thickening cervical mucous and creating a barrier for sperm to get to the fallopian tube.  When the IUD has been in place for a long time, it might cause thinning of the uterine lining which can lead to breakthrough bleeding.  This can be prevented by putting you on a short course of progesterone or birth control pills.  The risks of pregnancy while on the Mirena IUD are extremely small.  They are not zero, however, and you should take a pregnancy test.I hope that this helps and good luck to you!Dr. Tim"},{"Patient":"I have a smooth light pink patch on head of my penis.

Though it is claimed that there is no need for additional protection to be used after the first week of the pill use, if you start it from day one of your cycle, it is always wise to use protection for the first couple of cycles. Abnormal menstrual patterns are seen in the initial months and this delay could be one of those. Yet, please get a home pregnancy test with a fresh early morning sample to exclude any failure. Further management can be planned accordingly. Please remember that stress can also delay the cycle.

The emergency contraceptive pill contains high dose of progestogen and this disturbs the hormone balance of the body. Hence there is often some withdrawal bleeding seen after pill use. This is what you are experiencing now. If you happen to be nearer to your natural period, it is also possible that your period has also been advanced due to the pill effect.

The pill is same hormone produced in body in the second half of periods, so when suddenly such a high dose of the hormone is given, the thickness of inner lining of uterus is increased, but this is a single dose of hormone, so it will not stay on, it will be shed within 7-10 days. As the lining has to completely go, it will be dark or thick blood for few days( 7-10 days).It will stop on it's own.It is always advisable to use some other method.Emergency pills success on repeated use may not be good.They cause such bleeding which put you in a dilemma .If No deliveries yet - Condom or better- Combined oral pillsIf delivered - Copper -T is bestThere an array of other methods.Hope I cleared your queryAll the bestDr. Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"hi i have a birthcontrol question i take trisprintec and i finsished my pack of pills this past saturday i had unprotected sex monday and picked my pills up that afternoon and took sunday and mondays is there a possibility i could get pregnant from this?","Doctor":"Hi   Do not worry , if pills are taken regularly , chances of pregnancy is not there and that too ur in safe period  , so need not worry about it"},{"Patient":"when I tried two different birth controls separately, they gave me a year long non stop period both times.

Birth control is used as a cafeteria method. Each method is good for some not for others. Without any personal / age/ medical history / pregnancy histories , it's not possible to decide. There are n number of methods.But let me put forwards  a list of methods & the the situations where they are suitable.1.Oral Contraceptive pills -- Has to be taken daily from Day 1 of periods for 21 days , give a gap of 7 days, then restart the next pack  . This is ideal for those not yet delivered/ those can remember to take pills everyday/ those with irregular periods/ those who are not breast feeding/ those without any blood coagulation problems, DVT, heart problems etc2.Copper IUD - Can be inserted by gynecologist immediately after periods- Available for period of 3 yrs/ 5yrs/10yrs.Ideal for those who want one time method, with risk to forget pills daily/ not at risk of pelvic infections / HIV or any STDs.3. Norplant - Subcutaneous implants - can interfere with normal ovulation & periods may reduce or stop. Cheap & has protection based on which typr you use Type 1 or 2. One time method for 5 yrs or lesser.4.Nuva ring- vaginal inserted ring  of hormones- Which has to be removed every month end for periods to occur . Can give good cycle control. Not very costly .But needs removal & reinsertion of new ring every month yourself.5.Injectable hormones- Will act for 3 mths, not costly, No periods or minimal periods or only discharge. Good for breast feeding mothers, those with irregular bleeding, endometriosis/ adenomyosis. Occasionally cause ovarian cyst but not significant.I have given list of common methods ,the list is very long but cam be used based on your profileHope I have cleared your queryAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"Good day I would like to find out something.... I used to be on depo provera.. I first went on it January of this year and I came off on October of this year... I had my period on October 24th and it ended on the 30th of october... I had unprotected sex on November 2nd and took postinor 2 on the 4th of November... Could I be pregnant??","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. No, you cannot be pregnant. Even if you attained normal ovulatory cycles after discontinuing the depo shot, you were in the safe period when you had the intercourse. Added to that, you took the emergency contraceptive pill which provides ample protection. Please remember that ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next menstrual cycle and the period around this ovulation is the fertile period when conception happens. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I had unprotected with my girl friend..bt she take the I pill within 3 or4 hours after unprotected sex...bt her periods are not coming even after 40 days after unprotected sex...nd one more thing I had unprotected sex with her just after her period ends...her age is about 19....is she is pregnant","Doctor":"Hallow  Dear, Let me answer your last question first. The possibility of pregnancy due to intercourse immediately after the end of period is almost nil. Since she has consumed I-pill within 3-4 hours of the unprotected sex, she is well protected from pregnancy due to this particular intercourse. I-pill is a reliable post coital emergency contraceptive pill when taken within 72 hours of the unprotected sex. These pills have some after effects:1. Few days after the consumption of the pill, some bleeding may occur which is self limiting and does not require any medical attention. 2. The following period may get delayed by few days to a week's time. This is what has happened in her case. However, since her periods are delayed rather for a longer period, for confirmation, she may perform pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample. Alternatively, she may opt fore Beta hCG test. This will confirm the pregnancy status. If she is not pregnant (which is the high possibility), you may just wait for few days for appearance of her menses naturally. Alternatively, you may report to a Gynaecologist for some Progestational or Oestrogen+Progestational preparation for withdrawal bleeding. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"i accidentally entered my penis under my girlfriends libia majora. i did not ejacuate. knowing that semen contains sperms i am worried. I advised her to take unwanted72 pill same day. then i read that they do not work after ovulation. how can i know will it work or not. or does it not depend on the ovulation time? if she gets pregnant. when and how to go for abortion?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You had just entered the penis between the labia majora. This is sufficient for depositing sperms in the vagina. Before ejaculation, preseminal or pre-ejaculatory secretions (precum)are released unknowingly. Precum does contain some sperms which can cause pregnancy. However, she has taken Unwanted 72 within 24 hours of this incidence. So she is protected from the pregnancy. If the ovulation had taken place previously, the egg has life of only 24 hours. So you need not worry. These pills may delay the menses by about a week or less. So delayed menses should not put stress on you. Still if you are sceptic about the possibility of pregnancy, you may perform pregnancy test on the urine about a week after the missed period. Alternatively, you may get Beta hCG test done on her blood 10 days after this incidence. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I stopped taking microgestin, mid-pack, on 12/5/13 after being on it for 2 1/2 months. I had withdrawal bleeding 12/9/13 - 12/13/13.I was supposed to get my period 1/5/14 but i am late. Before birth control my cycles were always regular and always 28-29 days. My boyfriend and i have been using the pullout method frequently before and after stopping the pill. Could i be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Since you are no more on the birth control pills now, you are no more having any contraceptive protection. Pull out technique is not a safe and reliable technique for contraception. In this method, the penis is pulled out of vagina before the ejaculation takes place. However, before ejaculation, pre-seminal or pre-ejaculatory secretions (precum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Precum does contain some sperms which are capable of impregnating a woman. Now that you have missed your period, please get your pregnancy test done on overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier, the test may report false negative. Alternatively, you may perform Beta hCG test on the blood. This will help you detect your pregnancy status. If you are not pregnant, you may take some progestational preparation like Deviry for 5 days (with an advice of a Gynaecologist). Then within 4-7 days, you should get withdrawal bleeding. However, if you are pregnant, you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy. Since you are regularly engaged in sexual activity and do not want to continue with oral contraceptive pills, please adopt some other reliable contraceptive method like condom or intrauterine device. I hope this clarifies the issue. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi I'm 20 years old and sexually active but not in about 2 weeks...

In a 28-day cycle, ovulation will occur on the 14th day, i.e., 14 days before the onset of the next period. Spermatozoa remain active for 3-5 days after ejaculation; please remember that even the pre-ejaculate contains enough sperm to cause conception during the ovulation or fertile period. Though you had the intercourse around the fertile period, the chances of conception are very less considering the fact that it was slightly far from the probable date of ovulation and also since the emergency contraception was taken. Though the protection offered with the pill decreases with time span, yet a good amount of protection is offered. She may see some withdrawal bleeding a few days after the pill and her next natural period may get delayed by a week or two. Please do not stress; just see a specialist for further help if she becomes overdue by ten days.

If you have always been regular with your cycles and missed this one, you should perform a home pregnancy test with a fresh early morning sample 3-7 days after the missed period. Else, you can also go for the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres for an earlier and better clarification. If positive, please see a specialist for further management. After a trans-vaginal sonogram to locate the gestation sac, if you do not wish to retain the pregnancy, you may be induced to have an abortion. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I am really confused. I am a woman, 28, live in Iran. I want to choose a birth control pill but unfortunately I can not find true information to compare the pills. My doctor recommended Yasmin but I find out tha it is not good. Now I am thinking about Belara. would you please help me?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Belara pills are have different types: 1. Monophasic pills are the most frequently prescribed preparations. They contain the two hormones oestrogen and progestin, but in a much lower dosage. However, this does not reduce the reliability of contraception.2. Biphasic pills alter the progestin/oestrogen ratio in 2 phases. 3. Triphasic pills alter the progestin/oestrogen ratio in three multi-day phases by varying the amounts of progestin, oestrogen, or both. Biphasic and triphasic OCs are thought to approximate a woman's natural hormonal fluctuations more closely by varying the progestin/oestrogen ratios. The aim of these formulations is to minimize the occurrence of breakthrough bleeding and amenorrhea while maintaining efficacy. However, some physicians and patients prefer monophasic pills because they are less confusing.You have to consider the pros and cons of these three types and choose one of them whichever suits you. Considering the simplicity of consumption and management, I feel, monophasic pills would suit you better. Yasmin also is a good and reliable birth control pill. I do not understand why you feel that Yasmin is not good product. You may choose any one from Yasmin and Belara; you will not repent; both are reliable products. Consult your Gynaecologist before choosing the type. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I hav irregular periods and PCOD. As guided by my gynocologist i used ovacet 1st and then yasmin. But they didn t suited my body, so now she recommended to use METADOZE IPR. ho much time does this medication take to show results? And please can u tell me y the earlier tablets didnt suited my body?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (Disease) (PCOS or PCOD) is characterized by delayed irregular heavy menses associated with infertility. The other features include obesity, male type hair distribution, etc. There is reproductory hormonal imbalance with high insulin levels and high androgens in this condition. Ovacet Tablet is a medicine that is used for the treatment of Low Folate Levels, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Vitamin D Deficiency and other conditions. Ovacet Tablet contains L-Methylfolate, Myo-Inositol, and Vitamin D3 as active ingredients. These medicines help in treatment of PCOS. Yasmin is birth control pill which helps regularise the menses.Metadoze in Metformin tablet which helps control the raised levels of Insulin. In fact the treatment varies as per the aim. If pregnancy is desired, then some medicine to induce ovulation (like Clomiphene citrate or HMG/hCG combination is given along with Metformin and/or Myo inositol). If pregnancy is not desired and only irregularity of the menses is the concern, then cyclical use of some oral birth control pills is sufficient. Usually PCOS is characterised by obesity. Hence, maintaining the BMI between 18 and 23.9 is very important. Suitable diet and exercise will help achieving this.I hope this clarifies your doubts.

I took emergency contraceptive pills 7th of march and got my periods which started on16th of march,I had unprotected sex on 28th of march,is it advisable to take emergency contraception again?is my cycle back to normal?what should i do?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Emergency or post-coital contraceptive pills give protection against the pregnancy if the pills are taken within 72 hours after the unprotected sex. These pills do not offer any protection against pregnancy from the unprotected intercourse performed after the consumption of the pills. Hence for such intercourse after the pills, the dose of the emergency contraceptive pills needs to be repeated within 72 hours of that sex. In fact, emergency contraceptive pills should be taken only in an emergency situation and its routine use as a regular contraceptive is not advised. If you are engaged in a regular sexual activity, I would advise you to adopt some regular routine safe and reliable contraceptive method like condom, oral birth control pills or condom. I hope this clarifies your doubts. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I ve been taking Marvelon birth control for 9 days.

What are the chances of me being pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The pills act in the same cycle provided they have been started from day 2 of the cycle. If they are started late then some backup contraception is needed. You are regular in taking the pills. So if you have started taking the pills well in time, you are well protected against the pregnancy. However, if you have started them late, you will have to take some additional precaution by taking double dose of pills on the next day of the intercourse and a day after that. I hope this helps you.

You had the intercourse during the fertile period. You took the emergency pill at 28 hours and this puts you at about 70-80 percent protection. You also had some early spotting around the date of your expected period. In this scenario, I would ask you to go for the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres and if positive for pregnancy, go for further management with your consultant. You also need a trans-vaginal sonogram for further clarification of pregnancy, the location and the age of the gestation sac and the viability. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. I stopped the taking the pill 2 weeks now right after my period (within that 2 weeks my husband and I had intercourse with no protection. 3 Days later I had spotted, been having cramps 4 days and vaginal discharge. This could be possibly I am pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If you have not taken your birth control pills for two weeks and are having unprotected intercourse, it is possible that you could have become pregnant.  Any woman of reproductive age who is not using contraception and having sex theoretically can get pregnant.Some women do have some spotting a few days after conception if the fertilized egg implants in the uterus, which is known as implantation bleeding. However, the majority of women do not bleed at all when they conceive, and pregnancy symptoms really do not start until the pregnancy is large enough to produce hormones, which really takes a few weeks after conception.Furthermore, is not unusual to have irregular bleeding and spotting after discontinuing birth control pills as well.So at this point, the only thing that you can do is wait until your menstrual period is due, and if your period is late, to perform a urine pregnancy test. Modern urine pregnancy test become positive within 10 days to two weeks after conception, so in a few weeks you will be able to reliably test to see if you conceived.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best of luck in getting pregnant,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I have been on the implanon now for 18 months and have been sexually active the whole time and never got my period.

Return of ovulation takes 1-2 months in the majority after removal of the implant. Other factors which may influence the ovulation process are weight changes, stress, hormone disturbances arising from cysts in the ovaries as in polycystic ovarian disease, infections and the use of certain medications. Since you have seen the period, which is essentially a withdrawal bleed, your uterus is responding well and please wait to see if you receive a natural period following ovulation; if you happen to conceive meanwhile you will not see the period. Either case, you should see your doctor for follow up after two months. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi there.

Since you have already missed two weeks of your medication now, there will not be any protection in this cycle should you ovulate, even if you start taking the pill the moment you get it. Thus, it is ideal to use some form of barrier protection, preferably double, during this cycle and go for the pill from the next cycle so as not to jeopardize the hormone rhythm. Further, you should use additional protection for the next couple of cycles for added benefit. Considering your age, you should think of conception in the next couple of years in order to avoid chance of infertility as hormones dwindle with advancing age.

Irregularities of the menstrual pattern are usually seen during the first 6-12 months of use of the implant. As you are used to the implant, the most likely cause for this heavy bleeding could be a hormone disruption often caused by stress and weight changes. Please see an expert for proper evaluation.

On an average, pregnancy can occur within three months of removal of the copper IUD. Return of fertility is very soon after removal of the device.

HPT should be done 3-7 days after the period. A trans-vaginal sonogram can give you a clarity on the cause. If pregnancy is negative, you should suspect a transient hormone imbalance which usually is self-corrective failing which, you should see a specialist. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi. Im mrs.

Is it dangerous for my health and is it necessary for me to take oral contraceptive if I had sex within a week after my last period?","Doctor":"Hi,Since the caption of your query mentions about emergency contraceptive pill, though not in the body of the query, I am presuming that you had consumed post coital emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of the unprotected sex. If so, you are protected from the pregnancy due to this act. Post coital emergency contraceptive pills are quite reliable for contraception. These pills have some after effects:1. Few days after the consumption of these pills, some bleeding occurs. This does not require any medical attention as it is normal. You are experiencing this type of bleeding. It is not an issue of concern. 2. The following periods  may get delayed by few days up to a week or so. If so happens, please have no stress. I hope this resolves your query.

As you have taken the emergency contraceptive pill soon after the intercourse, you are amply protected. Also, if you are in the safe period of your menstrual cycle, you are naturally protected. The use of the regular hormone contraception can be continued if you wish in future, but, there is no need in this cycle if you are using it only as prevention from that act. Your next natural period can get delayed by a week or two since the emergency pill contains excess hormone. Please see a doctor if you become overdue by 10 days. Hope this helps.

So about 13 hours after I took the morning after pill (the doctor said it would be 95% effective because it was within the first twenty four hours) and since the Friday after the unprotected sex, I ve had this weird pain when urinating, like a UTI. It s now nearly 2 weeks after the unprotected sex and I m worried that I Could be pregnant or have an STI. A friend says it could be due to the mass of hormones I took in such a short period of time but I don t want to be 17 & pregnant.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, the Depo-Provera injection becomes immediately effective against pregnancy the day you get the shot. The reason why it is recommended for you to start taking Depo while you have your period is to make sure that you have not already become pregnant and get the injection while pregnant.So if you had a shot two weeks ago, even if you had a condom accident, and especially since you took morning-after pill, there is no reason to suspect that you are risk for pregnancy.However, a urinary tract infection, which is inflammation of the bladder, can occur after sex if chafing during sex especially externally rubs bacteria into the urethra (the urinary opening).  This is common in women who use condoms as the ring on the condom can irritate this area during penetration.So I think you can be reassured that your symptoms are not due to pregnancy. However, I think you most likely do have a UTI and should visit your local physician or clinic for evaluation so you can get a prescription for antibiotics to treat it.  If you are now going to be having unprotected sex with your current partner, you both should be tested for STDs to make sure that you are not at risk of giving anything to one another.  However this point there is no evidence that your symptoms could be caused by an STD. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello, Im 15 years old and I ve just started going on the pill, this is the second time as the first one made me feel very bloated and caused my constant tummy pain, but now I ve started this pill I am experiencing, constant bloating, feeling sick, back pain, I ve been on my period for about two weeks now since I started it, I constantly feel as if I need to poo and some times I will have a very sore stinging wee, please can you let me know if this is related to the pill or is something complete different, thankyou","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, in the first month of use, all birth control pills will cause some degree of side effects of bloating, breast tenderness, nausea, mood changes and irregular bleeding.  This is because when you first are taking the pill, your body is still making its own hormones so essentially the hormones on the pill are sort of tricking your system to make it think that you are pregnant. This is why many women get symptoms that are sort of like pregnancy in the beginning when they start the pill.However, burning with urination and back pain are not usually due to side effects of the birth control. These are actually symptoms of urinary tract infection, which can happen to any young woman when they are dehydrated or sometimes after sex.  Urinary tract infections require a urine test that needs to be performed in a doctors office to determine if you need treatment.So in your case, I would recommend continue to take your pill and trying take it as close to the same time every day as possible will hopefully make your breakthrough bleeding stop. However, I do recommend you see a doctor or other healthcare provider to get your urine tested to make sure you do not have an infection, as if he urinary tract infection is not treated it can spread your kidneys and make you very sick.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful to you.Best wishes, and I hope you feel better,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hello, ive been walking up with cramps and peeing hurts abit some times when i pee first thing in the morning. and my stomach had gotten bigger so much after i started taking birth control . i dont know how i am gaining so much weight i was a vegetarian for a month but i still gain up to 15 pounds.... is it the birth control ? or i have an infection in the bladder ? uterus kidneys ? somthing ?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, the cramping and pain you are experiencing with urination are most likely symptoms of a urinary tract infection or UTI. UTIs have nothing to do with your method of birth control, and can potentially spread to your kidneys, so you should have an evaluation with your local physician to make sure you do not have a bladder infection.Regarding weight gain and its relationship to taking birth control, modern low-dose pills in general have been shown to not cause weight gain across the general population. If you have been on the pill for longer than three months, it wouldn't be unreasonable for you to see your women's healthcare provider and see if an alternate brand of pill might agree with you better, but there are usually other reasons in addition to the pill why someone would gain that much weight in a short period of time.So in summary, your burning and pain with urination has nothing to do with your birth control or your gaining weight. You should see your local physician or healthcare provider to have your urine checked to make sure you do not have an infection and if you do, to get appropriate treatment.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had sex and used a condom, but it broke and my partner pulled out right away and he did not finish, but I got scared and we went right to the store to get plan be one step, and I took it an hour and a half after intercourse. Now, five and a half hours later I went to the bathroom and had some thick gooey brown discharge is that normal?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Plan B one step is extremely effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within 72 hours after intercourse.  The way Plan B works is by creating a hormone surge in your body that that both thickens your cervical mucus and prevents ovulation in the 72 hours while the sperm could still be viable in your system.The drop in hormones that occurs when Plan B wears off commonly causes bleeding or spotting anywhere between a few hours to five days after taking it.  This is actually most likely a sign that the Plan B is working.  The other possibility is that if your period is due soon, the Plan B may be just making it come early.So in summary, it is common to have a small amount of bleeding (which when it is like can appear as brown discharge) after taking Plan B. There is nothing to worry about, and in the scenario that you mentioned, especially because your partner did not ejaculate inside you, your chance of pregnancy is extraordinarily low.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I ve had my implant in my arm for 3 weeks now and I m concerned about it. I ve had no emotional problems or anything but my arm has a red line down it and it is itchy. A friend of mine had hers done less than a week ago and you can t see hers. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi,Once your body heals from the insertion of the birth control implant, you should not experience any itching or any skin changes.  The rod also should not be visible unless someone is examining your arm very closely.The fact that you see redness on your arm is very concerning that the area may have become infected.I would recommend that you follow up with your doctor or healthcare provider who inserted the implant, as you may possibly need to be treated with antibiotics or even have the implant removed.  There is no reason to worry, however you should be seen right away (within a week) or if that is not possible at your doctors office, a visit to a local urgent care center or emergency room would be a good idea.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and I hope you get diagnosed accurately and treated soon.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I was prescribed Micronor contraceptives after having my fourth child, and I am now 29 years old. I ve never taken birth control pills before since we wanted to continue having children. I also hemorrhaged after my second was born. Are there any risks for me to take these pills? I m just nervous since I ve never taken anything before.","Doctor":"Hi,Micronor is a brand of birth control pill that is been prescribed worldwide for over 30 years.  It is in a class of birth control pills called progesterone only pills, meaning the only contain a single hormone progesterone as opposed to other kinds of pills that contain both estrogen and progesterone.Progesterone is a hormone that is produced normally by the female body during pregnancy, so it is safe to take while breast-feeding.  The combination of the progesterone and breast-feeding hormones are adequate to protect a lactating woman against pregnancy.Progesterone only contraceptives do not cause a risk of blood clots and are extremely safe to take even in women who have medical problems. The only side effect that is common with pills such as Micronor is that most women to have irregular bleeding and spotting or irregular menstruation as a side effect.So in summary, Micronor is extremely safe and if you are breast-feeding, an effective method of birth control.  If you are not breast-feeding, the only risk of this particular birth control method is failure, as Micronor is only about 92% effective in preventing pregnancy.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello. I have gotten the implanon nxt put in on Monday 23 January 2012. So far I believe it is good but I do have one concern. My implanon is put in pretty shallow in my skin. You can practically see half of it (near the puncture wound it is a little deeper). If I raise my are u can see the top of it (I feel anyways). My friend who also had implanon nxt and got hers in a week before me (with a different gp) got hers put in deeper (she can feel it in her arm) said she could almost see mine and showed me hers (I could feel, had to give it a bit of a press too). Mine I just have to wipe my finger over it. If I scratch it feels horrible. I am concerned mine is too shallow and I also concerned everyone can see it. I chose this for I would not have to worry about remembering my pill and the fact no one would see it and know. I am 20 years old and have tried 5 different contraceptive pills before so chose this due to being frustrated with the pill. Please help but telling me withersThis sounds like it is too shallow and if I need to see a gp (also making sure I am protected from pregnancy). Thanks","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As long as the Implanon does not protrude through your skin (meaning causing a scab or blister) or cause pain there is no problem with it being placed right under your skin and an area where can be easily felt. The Implanon is actually supposed to be placed right under the skin. In thin women, the implant can be seen with arm in certain positions.  It is actually not as good to have the implant placed too deep, because it makes it more difficult for the physician to remove it later.  Again, if the area is causing you pain or discomfort, or if you feel self-conscious that other people can see the implant in your arm, the Implanon can be removed, however it is equally effective as a contraceptive regardless of how deep it is placed.  So there is no reason why you need to see a doctor for follow-up unless the location of the implant is uncomfortable for you.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.

If you have a condom accident, taking Plan B or another form of emergency contraceptive within 72 hours reduces your chance of getting pregnant by 90%.  Furthermore, most women do not ovulate before two weeks after pregnancy. Therefore, I do not believe that you likely got pregnant from your condom accident. The birth control pills you are taking, Loestrin FE, should protect you against pregnancy effectively in the future. It becomes effective within seven days of starting the pill, and if you remember to take your pill every day and fall the package instructions, you should not conceive as the pill is greater than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. So in summary, it is unlikely you conceived from your unprotected encounter and since you are on birth control pills now, your adequately protected against pregnancy.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.

I have tried almost anything to get rid of this embarrassing problem. Anyway my question is can the implanon cause arm pit odor??? I need help please!!! & thank you","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Implanon is a birth control devise which contains Progesterone preparation as an active ingredient. Progesterone gets mainly metabolised in the liver and gets excreted through urine and faeces. However, some part also does get excreted through the sweat. Offensive odour to the sweat due to Implanon is not a commonly reported problem.In the armpit, the amount of sweat is rather excessive. It gets stagnated there due to hair. You may try keeping the armpit cleanly shaved and apply good fragrance talcum powder. Still if the odour persists, you have following options:1. Use underarm deodorants which will mask the odour of the sweat. 2. Switch over to some other method of contraception. However, if you switch over to any other hormonal contraception, it will cause the same problem, since they contain progestational products. Therefore if at all you are switching over, you have options like condom (male or female) or intrauterine (non-hormonal) contraceptive device like Copper T. I hope this provides you the valid and useful options. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I had unprotected sex with my husband yesterday which was the sixth day of my menstrual cycle.

You had put it in 2011. So its life has ended in 2013. It is not good to keep it in the body after it is no more active. When we say it is not active, we mean that the hormones released from the implant are not in sufficient quantity to prevent the pregnancy; however, it is not completely devoid of the hormones. The very fact that you have started having irregular bleeding, the implant is releasing the hormone erratically in low doses. You should get the implant removed and replace it with another one if you still want to continue with the contraception.

Which means bleeding when you're not supposed to have your period. When blood travels very slowly through your genital tract, it mixes with your vaginal discharge and frequently turns brown or blackish. Breakthrough bleeding is most common in either the first three months of pill use, or after being on the pill for very long time, or if you miss a pill, or if your schedule changes or if you're under a lot of stress.This is not a symptom of anything being wrong, or of your contraceptive not working, however it can be bothersome.  If you do take your pill close to the same time every day and didn't miss any, and you continue to have breakthrough bleeding, you might want to discuss with your healthcare provider the possibility of changing to another brand of contraceptive.So in summary, there is nothing to worry about from the dark discharge you are experiencing or not bleeding during your actual pill free week. If this continues, you may want to consider changing to a different brand of birth control, as increasing your estrogen dose can sometimes help with breakthrough bleeding.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi. I missed lutera on day 7 of the active cycle, and took two pills on day 8. On day 9 I experienced light bleeding, which got gradually heavier with clots. I am now on day 12 and it is still occurring. What is happening? Should I be concerned for pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Lutera is a birth control pill that has a very low dose of estrogen.  If you miss a pill for a day, even if you back it up, the drop in hormones for that day can cause your period to start, which is called breakthrough bleeding.  Unfortunately, you will not likely stop bleeding until you finish this pill cycle.  You will still be protected against pregnancy, however the amount of estrogen in Lutera is probably not strong enough to stop this period once it's started.If you do not feel like waiting until the end of the pack for your bleeding to stop, you can discard the rest of your pack now, wait 7 days, and then start a new one.  You will likely stop bleeding during your pill-free week.  You should start your new pack on time though regardless if you are still bleeding or not.To try to avoid this from happening in the future, try not to forget pills and take them as close to the same time every day as you can.  If you miss more than 2 pills in a row, you should use a backup method of birth control for the rest of that cycle as 2 days of no pills can be enough to put you at risk for pregnancy.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Can I use Tri-Sprintec as emergency contraception? There s a list of birth control pills that can be used as such on Planned Parenthood s website, but Tri-Sprintec is not on there. However, a doctor on another site said it can be used and I would like a second opinion.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.It is true that any brand of combined oral contraceptives can be used as the morning-after pill.  They may list the most commonly prescribed pills on the Planned Parenthood website, however I will illustrate how you may use Tri-Sprintec correctly as a morning-after pill.The most important part of the regimen is making sure that the pills that you take total more than 100 µg of estrogen per dose.  The dose is need to be taken twice, 12 hours apart to be effective. It is recommended that emergency contraception be taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, however there may be some benefit for up to five days. So for example, with a pill with 20 µg of estrogen (like Aviane, for example) you need to take to five pills per dose, in two doses, 12 hours apart.Tri-Sprintec contains 35 µg of estrogen in the darkest colored pills the week before the placebo week.  So if you take three pills from that section of the pack in two doses 12 hours apart (a total of six pills) you will be able to use Tri-Sprintec as an emergency contraceptive.As a warning, using estrogen containing products as emergency contraception usually causes severe nausea as a side effect. Try to eat right before taking your first dose, as you may not feel up to eating when the second dose is due.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi.  I am a 21 year old student currently on Mononessa 28 day pack and I have been having heart palpitations for over the last six months.  I started taking Mononessa 2 years ago.  I have received ekgs, stress echo tests, blood work, and have worn an event monitor for 2 weeks.  Nobody seems to see the cause of my palpitations.  They think it could be an allergic reaction to my birth control pills because they have been getting more frequent.  I'm not sure if they could simple be stress or anxiety related or something else, but I was wondering if there is a possibility that these symptoms are caused by the pill?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If you have been taking the same birth control pills for two years, and your palpitations have only been an issue in the last six months, it is unlikely that all of a sudden the side effects would be produced by your birth control pills.Many doctors who are not familiar with prescribing contraceptives blame them from numerous types of physical symptoms that have absolutely nothing to do with a woman's reproductive life.\\"Allergic\\" reactions to medications usually manifest themselves by rashes, fever, or other types of symptoms typically associated with allergies, like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. So again, heart palpitations are not a symptom of an allergy to drug of any kind.Furthermore, if all of your cardiac evaluation has been negative, this means that even though you feel like your heart is beating fast, your heart rhythm is completely normal.  Women can experience palpitations from stress, anxiety disorders, drinking too much caffeine, lack of sleep, and other benign causes.So in summary, I believe that it is doubtful that your current symptoms are being caused by your birth control pills.  If you have had a thorough evaluation of your heart and heart rhythm, and all of that is normal,   it is most likely that your palpitations are being caused by emotional issues or things related to your diet and lifestyle.  Getting adequate rest, eating a balanced diet, and regular moderate exercise is the best way to ensure your overall health. I recommend that you go back to your primary care physician to talk about any life events or emotional issues that may be contributing to this problem.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Warm regards,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi there, How long do you have to be taking Noriday contraceptive pill to be protected if you dont start taking it the first day of your period initially. I started taking it at another time in the month but took it for 7 days straight before I had unprotected sex, am I covered? Regards, Laura","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Typically, women are advised to start birth control pills within seven days of their last menstrual period because it is unlikely that she would've already ovulated at that time.  If you start the pill later in your cycle, the process initiates ovulation may have already begun and your body may produce an egg that is capable of being fertilized that cycle.However, even if you ovulated right when you started to take the pill, it is unlikely that the egg would still be viable to be fertilized after seven days.  Therefore, waiting seven days before having unprotected intercourse most likely was enough time to ensure that you would not become pregnant.Modern pregnancy tests will become positive within 10 days to two weeks after conception, so if you do not have a menstrual period at the end of your pill pack, you should perform a urine pregnancy test to be safe. However, if you start your pill later than one week after the start of your period, you may not actually bleed the first month during the pill free week.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Its like that my wife had 2 ipills earlier and on last monday night we tried for intercourse , but didnt do that but as we were intimate closer and alsmot near i wish to give her third ipill, morover she has got period on tuesday night she has started period will there be any side effect if she takes ipill or is it not required","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, You seemed to be in confused state about the use of I-pills, which are post coital emergency contraceptive pills. These pills are to be consumed within 72 hour AFTER the unprotected sexual intercourse; not before the intercourse. Any intercourse performed after the consumption of these pills is not protected by the already taken pills. Each intercourse needs to be protected by I-pills within 72 hours. These pills have following after effects: 1. Few days after the consumption of the pills, there is some amount of withdrawal bleeding which lasts just for few days and does not require any medical attention. 2. The period following these pills may get delayed by few days up to a week or so. More the number of pills consumed during the cycle, more the number of days delay in the period. Such delay should not cause any concern.However, I would like to advise you to opt for some regular routine contraceptive method like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine device. You are a married person and have regular sexual relations.  I-pill like post coital pills are emergency contraceptive pills and should be used as an emergency method and not as a regular routine method. I hope you got the information, advice and the message.

Use of contraception, especially in the manner adopted by you, does not cause delay in achieving a natural pregnancy in ordinary circumstances. Use of hormones can delay return of ovulation and hence cause a delay. As you did not use any medication, there is no such worry. Please try sincerely for at least six months before going for further help. Try to have regular intercourse, at least on alternate days during the fertile period of your cycle. Hope I have answered your query. Take care."},{"Patient":"from: anonymous (kindly dont mention my name in your reply, thanks) hi doctors i am 37 yrs old with very regular menstrual cycle of 26-28 days. me & my bf had an unprotected sex yesterday afternoon. the first day of my last period was last may 7 and yesterday was my 13th day, im fertile right? i took 4 white tablets of nordette pill (its a 21 pill nordette) yesterday at 6pm and took again at 6am 4 tablets after 12hrs. question: will the chances of being pregnant high? or will nordette pill prevent it? when do i expect withdrawal bleeding? is this means that im not pregnant? how will i be so sure? when do i expect my next period? please help. thanks.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, You are right; the day of your sexual play was very near to the day of egg release; hence you had sex in the fertile window. In fact to cover this unprotected intercourse, you should have taken some emergency post coital contraceptive pills within 72 hours of the intercourse. However, you had consumed 4 pills of Nordette, which very much is near the dose of post coital pills. There was no necessity to repeat the pills after wards for two times. You are well protected from the pregnancy due to this particular intercourse. However, due to so many pills you have taken, your following menses will be delayed by more than a week or so. You need not be concerned about it. Still if you are stressed with the possibility of the pregnancy, you may perform pregnancy test on your overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier the test may report false negative results.Also due to so many pills, you may experience increased stomach acidity, nausea and vomiting. Some proton pump inhibitor antacid like pantoprazole will give you relief from these symptoms. Henceforth, please make it a point to keep some post coital emergency pills handy for such incidences.

They would not see me. I should have my period on Wednesday or Thursday of this week. I don t know whether to try and go to a dr. tomorrow (hard to get into obgyn) or wait a week and see what happens.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Next Choice Emergency contraceptive is fairly reliable post coital contraceptive pill. It does prevent pregnancy when taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. It contains Levonorgestrel as active medicine in that. You should not be concerned about your BMI 29. It will act on you to prevent the pregnancy. There is no necessity of going for additional Ella Emergency contraceptive pills. These pills also are quite reliable post coital contraceptive pills. Ella is an emergency contraceptive pill containing 30 mg of ulipristal acetate, a progesterone receptor modulator. It is effective for up to 5 days after unprotected sex. I feel you need not be concerned about the failure of Next Choice emergency contraceptive pills. For the confirmation, you may perform Beta hCG test on your blood 10 days after the unprotected sex. Alternatively, you may wait for your menses. Since you have taken Next Choice emergency contraceptive pills, your periods will be delayed by about a week or so. Even after week, you do not get periods, you may perform pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample; earlier these tests may report false negative results.

Sometimes it can even take a few months for your ovulation to resume.  Any time you have vaginal bleeding, it can be normal to have cramps as well.  It would be unusual for you to be able to conceive so soon after stopping the shot, but it is not impossible.  Pregnancy tests will become positive between 10 days to 2 weeks after conception, so if it has been long enough after your act of unprotected intercourse, you should perform a pregnancy test for a definitive answer.

It settles down to the option of taking those four missing pills from next months pack. Thus, the same issue will arise in the next month.

Oestrogen is a hormone which increases vaginal discharge due to the proliferation of glands in the mouth of the uterus (cervix) while Progesterone thicken the  secretions.

I am now 31 and lately a gyno told me that I do not have PCOS but PCO-like ovaries. I was never overweight or obese, I don't have hirsutism, I never missed a period and I had acne which got cured with Roaccutane (the same gyno said that PCOS acne doesn't go away with Roaccutane.) I got pregnant naturally in May but had a miscarriage in June (at 5 weeks, HCG levels were not doubling) then I started taking pregnacare conception and I got pregnant again in July (before letting one full cycle pass) but miscarried on August 21st at 8 weeks and had to do D&C on August 23rd to get rid of the remains of the last pregnancy which weren't coming out naturally. A week after miscarrying and the D&C - when the bleeding started to stop I resumed taking pregnacare conception and all of a sudden I started bleeding again for another week. 28 days after the miscarriage, I got my first period (on Sept 16) and the bleeding lasted for 19 days and now my period is 7 days late and am starting to freak out that Pregnacare Conception has messed up my cycle as I've always been regular and always had 6 to 7 days of bleeding.By the way, I just took a home pregnancy test now and it came out negative. Is Pregnacare Conception a bad product?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Pregnacare Conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. It has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, It is not unusual for women  to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19 day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your D and C.  So you may not be \\"late\\" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy.  There is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year.Either way, the Pregnacare Conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding.  It is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period- so I would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive.  If you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your GYN for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor I m Paula by name, 22yrs of age and I kinda have a problem which is how many intake of postinor2 can be harmful to my body ?

For lichen planus of the mucous membranes, treatment can be difficult to get right and may take years. It may be treated with corticosteroid cream. Lichen planus is treated with: 1. Antihistamines may be used to reduce itching. 2. Phototherapy with ultraviolet (UV) light can also be used to reduce symptoms. 3. Steroid creams or ointments can be very effective in reducing inflammation and redness. The medication is applied to the itchy spots. Treatment should stop when the spots change color to brown or gray. 4. Cyclosporin capsules or Acitretin tablets can reduce the activity of the immune system and may sometimes help. They are only used in extremely severe cases. Please consult your dermatologist, he will examine and treat you accordingly.

If you had your menses on 6th of this month and are planning to have sexual debut on 31th, mostly it would be safe from pregnancy point of view. Egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to next expected menses. Egg has life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 3 days. Hence a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is considered as fertile window. I shall presume your cycle to be of 30 days. Hence your day of ovulation would be on 23rd and your fertile window would be from 19th to 27th. So 31st is far away from the fertile window. Hence, you will be having meagre possibility of pregnancy due to sexual relations on 31st. However, safe period is one of the most unsafe method of contraception. Hence, I would advise you to take post coital emergency contraceptive pills. These pills need to be taken ideally immediately but definitely within 72 hours of the unprotected sex. Any sexual intercourse after consuming the pills not protected against the pregnancy. So you can cover this sexual incidence with such post coital emergency contraceptive pills within 72 hours. If you buy them well in advance, you can take the pills immediately after the intercourse. However, if you are planning to have regular sexual relationship, I would advise you to adopt some regular, routine and reliable contraceptive method like condom, birth control pills or intrauterine device with the advise of your Gynaecologist. Use of post coital contraceptive pills is recommended only for emergency purpose; its routine use is not safe. I hope this provides you sufficient information. Wish you a happy sexual life.

Ralovera is a medroxyprogesterone acetate preparation. In addition to progesterone effect, it helps controlling the bleeding. In addition, you have been prescribed Cyklokapron which is Tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid is also used for controlling bleeding. With the history of Uterine fibroids, I will advise you not to wait for the bleeding to stop; go for the Ralovera Ciklokapron therapy straight a way. I hope your dilemma is resolved.

I am 47 years old! please help me, i really dont want to go to my GP!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I would have appreciated had you mentioned what type of coil you have got in your body. There are two types of coils - copper coil and hormonal coil. In fact hormonal coil reduces the vaginal discharge. Copper coil is known to increase vaginal secretions in some cases. In fact at the age of 47, vagina is more dry. Increased vaginal secretion is from the uterus and mostly due to the reaction of the uterus to the copper coil inside. However, the possibility of infection should not be ignored; however it will more likely cause yellowish foul smelling discharge. Vaginal infection (bacterial vaginosis) also causes increased mucous discharge. Increased discharge due to bacterial infection will require a course of antibiotics treatment. If the coil is the source of infection, it needs to be removed.  Please report to your Gynaecologist to find out an evidence of infection and treatment if it is found. If the coil is making you so uncomfortable, you may get it removed and opt for other suitable contraceptive method more suitable for you with the advice of your Gynaecologist.

Unwanted 72 is a fairly reliable post coital emergency contraceptive pill. You had unprotected sex on 14th and 15th. You mentioned that she has taken Unwanted 72 within 72 hours of the sex; however, the million dollar question is after which intercourse? If the pill was taken within 72 hours of 14th and 15th both, then you are protected from both the sexual intercourse. However, if you had taken pill within 72 hours of sex on 15th which falls beyond the sex on 14th, you are not fully protected from pregnancy.  Anyway, since her next menses were due on 18th of this month, your both the sexual intercourses were beyond the fertile window. So the chances of pregnancy are very less. Please note that after taking Unwanted 72, her following period may get delayed by few days to a week or so; you need not get panicky. If she misses her period for more than 8 days, you may perform pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample; earlier, the test may report false negative results.

So you should never rely on pull out technique. Now, if you are so regular in taking your contraceptive pills Microgestin 1.5/30, you need not be worried about pregnancy due to one drop in the pills. In fact missing up to 3 pills is permissible in one cycle without affecting the contraceptive effect. While taking the active pills only for continuous 4 months, you may get a breakthrough bleeding sometimes. You need not become panicky for that. Doubling the dose would stop such bleeding.

As long as you start your pack of Althea at the same time you would have started your Marvelon, then you will be protected against pregnancy.You may notice different side effects while taking the new pill while your body adjusts to the new formulation, especially in the first month of use. These symptoms may include nausea, headaches, spotting, bloating or breast tenderness.  These will improve once you get your first period on the new brand.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hi, iam on levelin ed pills, have been for nearly two years, i finished a period on monday, had sex tuesday night and forgot a pill that day, i took two pills wednesday, its now thursday and i have a watery brown/light pink discharge. is this a result of missing one pill or implantation bleed?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Modern low-dose birth control pills are extremely effective, and it is not recommended that if you miss a pill and take the one you forgot the next day you are not significantly an increased risk for pregnancy that if you would taken the pill properly.Furthermore, deviating from your schedule for taking the pill at a different time than what is expected frequently can cause breakthrough bleeding (which is a small amount of spotting outside the time when your period should come). This is due to the drop in hormone levels that occurred in the one day that you did not have a pill in your system. So in summary, your side effect of spotting are not caused by implantation but rather as a small withdrawal bleed from the hormones during the 24 hours where you'd forgotten your pill. The bleeding will likely stop within a few days, but even if it does not your pill is still effective in preventing pregnancy. The bleeding will resolve itself by the time you're on your pill-free week and certainly when you start your next pack your regular cycle should resume when you take the pill daily as close to the same time as possible.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"How affective is marvelon?

You had taken it in the past and has suited you well to serve the contraceptive purpose. Even though in between you had taken a gap of 2 months, restarting Marvelon will definitely be as effective as it was previously. To avoid its failure and to have its action right from the cycle you are starting the pills, make sure that you start the pack from the second day of the cycle.

Please.. I need your advice :( im not ready for being mother doc.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Nordette is an oral contraceptive Pill. Nordette tablets contain two hormones, levonorgestrel and ethinyloestradiol, which prevent pregnancy if taken correctly. These pills need to be taken regularly from the second day of the menses for preventing the pregnancy. These pills are not emergency contraceptive pills and do not prevent pregnancy if taken after unprotected sex. In fact if you had your menses on September 2, then September 20 does fall in your fertile window. You should have taken some emergency post coital contraceptive pill within 72 hours of the unprotected sex. No medicine will prevent the pregnancy 11 days after the unprotected sex. Now, you have got following options for not becoming a mother at this stage: 1. Get your pregnancy status detected. For that, wait for your menses to appear. If they appear, you are not pregnant. If you miss a period, perform pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample a week after missed period; earlier the test may report false negative. Alternatively you may opt for Beta hCG test on your blood 10 days after unprotected intercourse. 2. If you are pregnant and you do not want to continue this pregnancy, you may terminate this pregnancy by medicines safely up to 9 weeks of gestation. These medicines should be taken by an Obstetrician's advise only. Once these medicines are taken, you should not change the decision of abortion as they cause developmental abnormalities in the baby. Alternatively, you may opt for surgical suction evacuation of the uterine cavity by MVA or so. To avoid such stressful situations in future in your sexual life, please adopt some reliable and regular contraceptive method like condom, oral contraceptive pills or intrauterine device.

To get right to the point, I am freaking out about the possibility of becoming pregnant after sleeping with a guy last night I ve been seeing. We had sex twice. The first time he used a condom, however I m not sure if he did because I didn t check. The second time, he did not use one, (which was honestly a mistake). I told him to not cum inside me, and he said he wouldn t. However I am equally unsure whether he did or not. Later I asked him again, and he promised he was very careful. I am on birth control, however some days I forget to take it at 2 pm, so I end up taking it a few hours later. I also think there was one time this month I forgot completely one day, and took two pills the following day. I am due to get my period either tomorrow or Tuesday, and to say the least I will rejoice if I get it. My question is, what is the likelihood of getting pregnant with these factors? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi.Good to see your concerns about your health. So far as your question is concerned lets first discuss some basic concepts. First of all ovulation occurs exactly 14 days before the start of bleeding regardless of the length of cycle  and an ovum remains viable for a period of 24-48 hours in female reproductive system. Next is if you are on a regular birth control pill and if you forget to  take pill on one day then taking two pills on next day can compensate. Keeping in view these few basic points it can be said that there is a minimal chance (almost zero) of you becoming pregnant. Your dates are expected in a day or two so my advice is just sit back and relax. If menses occur thats great otherwise you should visit a gynaecologist for confirmation of pregnancy and further planning and management.

My youngest is 7 months old, and since starting my pill my periods have become very light in the day, nothing through the night and very heavy in a morning. I am now taking my pill and am not due to come on my period for another 2 weeks and I have brown discharge. Thia has never happened before? Concerned what does this mean and what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Many women who have been on birth control for many years can develop a tolerance of sorts for the pill's ability to control your menstrual cycle, especially after they have not menstruated for a long time due to pregnancy or another cause.  This can also occur to the fact that you did relatively recently give birth, especially if you were breastfeeding.  Bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period on the pill is called breakthrough bleeding.  It does not mean the pill is ineffective as a contraceptive, but having some irregular bleeding in between periods or a different bleeding pattern that you may have had before the pregnancy is not unusual.  Having heavy bleeding in the morning is likely due to the blood accumulating in your vagina during the night and then it all comes out at once when you get out of bed due to gravity.Your cycle may get back to normal after a few more months on the pill, and taking it as close to the same time every day will help to reduce the risk of breakthrough bleeding.  If it continues for more than 3 months, you may benefit from changing your birth control brand to one with a slightly higher dose of estrogen, as the estrogen in the pill is the ingredient that controls your menstrual cycle.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"HI, I have been on implanon for over a year, no period for 7 months.

Also have gained 9lbs in weight despite watching diet and exercising really well. I want to switch to mini pill but worried will get same weight gain and constant bloated feeling. What would you advise","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,All your mentioned symptoms; i.e. feeling of bloating, soreness in the breasts and weight gain are due to Progesterone product present in the coil. Progesterone causes smooth muscles relaxation which slows the intestinal motility causing the feeling of bloating. Progesterone also causes retention of salts & water and also increases the fat deposition in the body. This leads to increase in weight. Fat deposition is more  in the abdomen, buttocks and breasts; therefore you are having soreness in the breasts. They might have engorged also. Mini pills are Progesterone only contraceptive pills; hence, your symptoms due to progesterone will continue to bother you even with the mini pills also. I may suggest you following options: 1. You may try Combined Contraceptive pills with the advice of your Gynaecologist. However, I doubt whether you will be relieved of the symptoms with them as these pills also contain Progesterone as one of the hormonal component. 2. Alternatively, you may opt for non-medicated intrauterine device like Copper t (Cu-T). Then you will be free of daily botheration of taking pills for few years; and since it does not contain any hormones, you will subsequently be relieved of the symptoms. For first few days to weeks, you may get some cramps in abdomen and/or some spotting to bleeding with Cu-T; however they will subside subsequently. I hope this helps you.

Progesterone is known to cause smooth muscles relaxation. This may lead to relaxation of urinary tube resulting in frequent urination, relaxation of intestines leading to bloating, flatulence and constipation. Progesterone does cause engorgement and tenderness of breasts. Moreover, these pills has following after effects for which you need not be worried:1. Few days after the pills, some amount of bleeding for a couple of days. 2. Following immediate periods may get delayed by few days to a week or so. I hope this provides you the required information.

Also boobs very tender sore, hard as rocks once a month in line with cycle I m not having because of Yaz.

No period happened, I did pregnancy test came back negative still no period to date 10 days ago (I ve stopped taking yaz now). Help what other treatments are there? What birth control tablet should I try next? Appreciate any input? Many thanks Catherine","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, the treatment of endometriosis with continuous birth conrtol does help a lot of women with the pain associated with endometriosis.However, the side effects of bloating and breast tenderness can be due to the birth control, and the fact that you are taking them continuously compounds the symptoms over time.Secondly, many women will have their period delayed after stopping birth control pills, especially if the pill has suppressed your period.  So the fact that your cycle has not yet returned after stopping the Yaz is not unusual.Even though you had bothersome side effects from the Yaz, there are many brands of birth control pills with different active ingredients that you can try to take for continuous use.  The pill brands vary in name by the country in which you live, but a pill with the active ingredient levonorgestrel is the most popular type of extended cycle pill in the U.S. and I suggest you discuss changing to a brand with this active ingredient with your local physician.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hey, I needed contraception and have tried about 4 different pills throughout the course of my relationship (currently a year and a half) all with negative side affects. I had to cease taking them for my own well being and when seeking a new method of contraception despite wanting to avoid hormones my doctor convinced me to try Implanon. I had it in for 3 weeks before my mood deteriorated to the point where I no longer wanted to live. I had it out a week a go and still feel incredibly emotionally unstable. I was just wondering how long will it be until my mood returns to normal?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Hormonal birth control methods like the pill and the Implanon get out of your system very quickly, usually within days of discontinuing them.  So I am a bit concerned that your mood symptoms may be due to depression or another mood disorder and not be a side effect of your contraceptive.  There are many factors involved in mood problems that have nothing to do with your hormones.  You should consult with your primary physician as your emotional problems may need medical treatment if you feel so bad that you do not feel like you want to live.The IUC, or intrauterine contraceptive, also called the IUD is a non-hormonal method of birth control that can be placed in your doctor's office that is actually the most widely used birth control method in the world.  IUD's are widely available and safe, and I suggest if you desire future contraception that could be a method that you can consider.However, I really believe that your mental health symptoms may be due to other factors and if you continue to feel emotionally labile or depressed you really should see your general physician or a mental health provider.I hope this information was helpful and that you feel better soon.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi doc I m using loop as contraceptive,the problem since yesterday I feel it with my hand when I m washing my vagina and it feels so rough on my finger and I m even afraid to have sex with my partner now my question is there any possibility that it has slipped from its position?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If you can feel the loop itself, and not the string that is attached to it to ease removal, it is possible that the device had slipped into your cervical canal.When this happens, it is important to see a healthcare provider to evaluate you because if part of the IUD is protruding into the vagina, it decreases it's effectiveness as well as putting you at risk for infection.So in summary, if you can feel the IUD itself, it may have been partially expelled and it needs to be removed.  You should not have sex again with your partner until you are evaluated to decrease the risk of infection.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that you seek medical care promptly.Regards,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I ve had irregular bleeding for the last 7 months since I ve had my implanon, and all of a sudden this evening it s gotten so itchy and red.

Please do not ignore it and do not try to manage it at domestic level lest the risk of fulminating reaction later. Please report to your Gynaecologist ASAP. Some corticosteroid locally will bring down the symptoms; however you may need to remove the implant and switch over to some other method of contraception. I hope this helps you.

If you keep it longer, the possibility to stuck there is very high and this may be cause even to hemorrhage from the uterus. If I were your doctor, I would recommend first and urgent to take it off and then control the levels of some hormones. The symptoms you are describing may be an effect of hormonal changes or due to a precox menopause (earlier than it should be).Please consult your doctor and take it off.Dr. Thano"},{"Patient":"i took my birth control pill(low-ogesteral) and then pretty much 2 hours later had one episode of loose/watery stool with stomach cramps.will this effect my birth control? ive heard it has to be severe for days to effect it but i am worried since it was shortly after taking the pill","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Loose motions may be or may not be the effect of the pill. Low Oestrogen pill means Progesterone dominant pill. In fact progesterone does cause gastritis leading to nausea and vomitting. Moreover it causes sluggishness of the intestinal motility leading to constipation rather than loose motions. So this episode of loose motions is most likely by gastrointestinal disturbance due to some other cause. Whatever is the reason, please support yourself with oral rehydration solution. After each motion, take a glassful of warm water with 2 tsf of sugar and a pinch of salt in it. Otherwise many oral rehydration powders like Electral are available with the chemists; you may opt for one of them. If within 24 hours, the loose motions are not in control, you will have to report to your physician. I hope this helps you.

The class of medication that includes Citralopram does not interfere with birth control or hormone levels, and should not cause any physical symptoms.Pelvic and back pain can have other causes, like premenstrual changes, or even a urinary tract infection, so i suggest that if your symptoms persist you consider seeing a local physician for evaluation.

In medicated devices, mostly progesterone is impregnanted in them. Progesterone is known to increase the weight; not loose it. Non-medicated devices have no effect on individual weight. If you are losing weight, please consult your physician for some unnoticed underlying disease like tuberculosis or hormonal dysfunction like Thyroid dysfunction. Accordingly you may have to take treatment. I hope this gives you some guidelines.

I have severe endometriosis, and this helps with the pain. What would be a comparable alternative, or a pill that is good for endometriosis?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Any oral contraceptive can help with endometriosis, as long as it reduces the length and amount of your menstrual cycle.  If you like the formulation of Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo, Orth Tri Cyclen Lo is no longer made by the manufacturer.  However, the active ingredient Norgestimate is present in many generic pill formulations.  There is a generic of Orth Tri Cyclen Lo, called Tri lo Sprintec, which may be covered under your plan. In addition,  Ortho Cyclen, which is the monophasic regimen (same dose all month) has a generic.  The name can vary, but some brands available in the US are called Sprintec, Mononessa, or Estarillya.

I ejaculated in the condom, but I may have ejaculated in her too. To be safe, I bought Nordette and she took it about an hour after sex, she will take it again in 12 hours. How effective is Nordette as an ECP?","Doctor":"Hello, and i hope i can help you today.All combination birth control pills can be used as emergency contraception.  However, the dose of one Nordette pill is not high enough to work alone as emergency contraception.There needs to be a total of at least 100 micrograms of estrogen in each dose 12 hours apart for emergency contraception dose.  This means that your girlfriend needs to take THREE nordette pills (that gives a total of 90 micrograms- which should be enough) in 2 doses 12 hours apart to work as EC. So I recommend, since it still has been under 72 hours since your condom accident, that she take three pills for her next dose, and the 3 pills 12 hours after that.  She may experience nausea as a side effect of the pills, which is normal, and she may bleed 3-7 days later, which is also a side-effect of emergency contraception.If she uses this regimen, emergency contraception has a 90 percent success rate to prevent pregnancy.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, I m a 24 years old male, I had developed a severe pain in my groin about 5 months ago and lasted for 2-3 days, pain went away with some painkillers and inflammation medicine however there is still a minor but noticeable bulge (not associated with swelling or pain) on my right testicle. I had occasional blood in my urine which lasted for 2 months. Got ultrasound and CT Scan done for any stone but everything came negative, Doctor prescribed some steroids and after 10 days blood was no longer there.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Where is the bulge?? Yes, blood in urine may be origin from urinary tract or bladder or from kidney. It may be due to stones or cystitis or urinary Infection. Bulge may be due to Sebaceous Cyst or sweat gland or folliculitis etc. Until examination is done it is difficult to say what it is. Drink plenty of water, avoid smoking and alcohol.

Thank u.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Nordette is an oral contraceptive, commonly known as a \\"birth control pill\\" or \\"the Pill\\". Nordette tablets contain two hormones (levonorgestrel and ethinyloestradiol), which prevent from becoming pregnant if taken correctly.It is a regular birth control pill and needs to be taken cyclically every day during cycle for 28 days for its effective action. These are not emergency post-coital pill; however they can give post-coital protection against the pregnancy if taken in double dose. If you have taken only single pill of Nordette as a Plan B pill, it will not give you protection against pregnancy.  You statement 'after 11 days, I did not bleed' is rather confusing. If you mean that you did not have withdrawal bleeding even 11 days after the pill, you need not worry as withdrawal bleeding, though common, may at times be absent, particularly with low dose. If you have missed your periods for 11 days. So you should suspect pregnancy and get your urine tested for pregnancy. If the results are positive, your pregnancy is confirmed. If this is unwanted pregnancy, you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy upto 9 weeks of gestation. However, get the medicines only by Gynaecologist's advice. I hope this helps you.

If you got pregnant, then a pregnancy test will turn positive about two weeks after conception.  Also, the symptoms you are describing are possibly related to pregnancy as you can have cramping and spotting.  Yes, this might be implantation bleeding.  If you check a pregnancy test and it is positive then get checked out immediately to make sure that this is a normal pregnancy or possibly a pregnancy in one of your tubes (called an ectopic pregnancy).That being said, it is much more likely that you are not pregnant and bleeding or spotting in the week after taking the morning after pill is also very common.  Finally, this pill will also likely delay the next period.I hope that this helps and good luck!Dr. Tim"},{"Patient":"Hello, My question: I m on the birth control nuvaring. I keep it in for the full 4 weeks instead of 3. My partner and I had sex on the 28th day. I basically had sex, then 30 minuets later I changed into a new ring. Am I still protected or should I take a plan B pill?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.As you already know, the Nuvaring can protect you against pregnancy for up to four weeks.  Normally, they recommend you leave the ring out for 7 days before you need to replace it.If you did not have more than 7 days go by without wearing the Nuvaring, you are not at risk of pregnancy, so you do not have to take additional emergency contraception.In addition, Nuvaring can be removed for up to 2 hours at a time without increasing pregnancy risk.  So it can be removed for intercourse if you prefer and you will still be protected against pregnancy.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful.

If a girl had sex n she took this i-pill next day only.how long will this pill act.i mean if she again had sex on the day after taking pill is there any chance of being pregnant ? Since these pills changes the hormone level so it shiuld stay for long.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The effectiveness of the morning after pill has not been studied specifically regarding its success rates in preventing pregnancy with multiple episodes of intercourse.  However, sperm remain in the female genital tract for up to 72 hours, which is why the pill is most effective within that window of time.  The overall success rate for preventing pregnancy with the I-pill for one episode of intercourse is 90 percent, meaning 10 percent of the time the woman can conceive anyway. So I would recommend that in this situation that a second dose of the I-Pill be taken, even if the second episode of intercourse was within 72 hours, because live sperm could remain after the first pill has worn off.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I got the Nexplanon implant in April 2013 and recently I ve been having a lot of pregnancy symptoms. Fatigue, cramps/feeling full and nausea off and on throughout the day. I haven t had a period since it was inserted, but I was on some antibiotics about a month ago. Home pregnancy test was negative, but I can t shake the feeling that it s wrong. Is there any possibility that it was wrong?","Doctor":"Hello, and i hope I can help you today. Nexplanon, as long as it is not expired (which occurs after 3 years) has never been shown to have a pregnancy failure. Therefore, as long as your device has not been in longer than 3 years, you should be completely protected against pregnancy, even if you are having regular unprotected sex.  In addition, antibiotics (except certain kinds that are very strong given by IV) have never been shown to actually increase risk of pregnancy while taking birth control- the interaction is theoretical only.  Furthermore, the side effects that most people attributed to pregnancy like nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, and mood changes are also common side effects of any progesterone only contraceptive. The reason for this is that the hormone in Nexplanon is very similar to the hormone that is produced by a normal pregnancy. In addition, many women do not menstruate on Nexplanon, which is normal.So you really do not have to worry that you are actually pregnant with the Nexplanon based on your symptoms and with a negative pregnancy test.  If you are having side effects you find unpleasant, you may want to discuss changing to an alternative birth control method with your healthcare provider.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"my name is Mckenzie and I m 18 yeArs old. and I had a few questions to ask just to clarify. me and my boyfriend had unprotected sex but both times he had peed in between ejaculations and also he pulled out and I jacked him off for a while. so he just thrusted then he pulled out. could I pregnant?

Her menstruail period has stopped 2days back. And bleeding started again at the time I had sex with her while bleeding.Pls suggest me if she get pregnent at this stage r chance to get conceive again. If yes pls provide prescriptions for unwanted pregnancy..","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Two days after menstrual bleeding has stopped is a day far from fertile window of the menstrual cycle. Egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to next expected menses. A period of about one week around the day of ovulation is fertile window. So if the menstrual cycle is of 28 days, the day of ovulation would be day 14 and fertile window would be between day 10 and day 18. You had sexual relations 2 days after the menstrual bleeding stopped. Again after 2 days the bleeding started during which you had intercourse. This day is far from the day fertile window. So the chances of pregnancy due to this sexual intercourse are almost nil. However, you may confirm it 10 days after you had intercourse by Beta hCG test. Please try to avoid any sexual relations during bleeding phase. Blood is a very good medium for any organisms; hence she may catch some infection by intercourse during this phase. Since, she has already started menstruating after delivery, please use some reliable contraception like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine device (with the advice of your Gynaecologist) to avoid pregnancy. In this phase, the chances of irregularities in menses should be kept in mind. Hence, fool proof contraception should be the practice. I hope this helps you.

For the past 2 or the months I have been going only 5 days between periods and my periods would last around 10 days. I get really bad headaches and get really lightheaded it prevents me for going about my day as normal. What should I do?","Doctor":"Thank you for the question and I am happy to help.First of all, you need to check a pregnancy test.  Given that there is no form of birth control that is 100% effective, this needs to be the first thing ruled out.  Assuming that this is negative, here are my thoughts:1.  Women can have breakthrough bleeding on hormonal birth control and this is quite common.  This is often due to the thinning of the lining of the uterus.  This is particularly common in progesterone only forms of birth control such as the depo shot and nexplanon2.  Excess bleeding can lead to anemia (a drop in blood counts) which commonly leads to feeling light-headed and is also associated with headaches.You need to schedule a visit with your doctor to check your blood counts and also to perform an ultrasound.  There are other common and benign causes of bleeding and this should get sorted out.I hope that this helps and good luck!Dr. Tim"},{"Patient":"Hi , well see I have been on the Nexplanon birt control since 10/17/13 and I had intercourse with my partner in December of last year unprotected and we than we took a break than had intercourse unprotected again in January and I am having these symptoms pregnancy.

At the beginning of this week, Friday morning around 4 in the morning I just started using the Nuvaring, first time using birth control. Well my doctor explained to me that I could just put it in my vagina and I was in the clear. I would be good to go. so I, naively, was under the impression that it took immediate effect. So that same night my partner and I has sex without using condoms or the pull out method, so he ejaculated in me three times. Then once more last night but the sperm didn t stay in, to put it crudely. My main question is what is the percentage, I guess you could say, about me being pregnant? I am 20 years old, an athlete, and I ve never been pregnant before.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,NuvaRing is an effective hormonal contraception. It is effective after you insert it on the day of menstruation. If you have inserted it as late as on or after day 5 of the menstruation, then the ring requires 7 days to start its effect and hence some additional protection like condom is advised in such situation. It all depends on which day of menses you inserted the ring. The very fact that you had many sessions of intercourses on the day of ring insertion means that your menstrual bleeding had stopped. So it must be beyond day 5 of the menses. Then you were not protected against the pregnancy on that day. If it is so, you have following options to assess your pregnancy status: 1. Opt for Beta hCG test on the blood 10 days after the last intercourse. Values under 5 mIU/ml denote no pregnancy while values more than 25 mIU/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy. 2. Alternatively you may wait for your menses after removing the ring after 3 weeks. If within a weeks time you do not get menses, the chances of pregnancy are quite high. Then 15 days after removal of ring, you may perform pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample. I hope this helps you today.

The reason for this is that a portion of the middle of the fallopian tube dies or is scarred permanently from the procedure, no matter how it is done.The overall failure rate for tubal ligation is around 1 in 2000 over a women's lifetime, however most pregnancies after tubal ligation occur in women within 2 years of their operation, or in women under the age of 30.At this point in your life, it is a much greater chance that your period is delayed due to hormonal issues rather than pregnancy.  I do recommend you perform a pregnancy test just in case, and if it is positive, you should seek medical care right away as it is very likely that you have a pregnancy within your fallopian tube (called an ectopic pregnancy) which is a medical emergency.I hope I was able to adequtely answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"my name is amanda muse i have a story to tell i had to babies already one was born march 6 2012 and the other may 1 2013 well two days before christmas i had found out i was pregnant again and in feb. i found out i had lost the baby at nine weeks so i decide to get on birth control and i switched over to the depo shot and didnt think i could be pregnant again until i decide to so my question is why am i pregnant again??","Doctor":"Hello Amanda MuseDepot shots are hormonal injections which has to be taken every 2- 3 months(depending upon the type of progesterone).

They should have been started on the second day of the menses following Plan B pills. Anyway, you have started regular contraceptive pills; so you should get the menses within a weeks time after finishing this month's pack; provided it is 21 days pack. If it is 28 days pack, you will get the menses during the last 7 different coloured pills which do not contain hormones.

It is known to cause breakthrough bleeding. In such events, increasing a dose of Progesterone helps. Norethisterone is a Progestational preparation. So it will help you control the spotting.

The pre-ejaculatory secretion ( precum) does contain sufficient number of sperm to impregnate a woman. Hence if you don't want the pregnancy to happen, you have to protect yourself by some post coital contraception. You have two options:1. Take some plan B pills within 72 hours of the intercourse. While taking the pills, you should be aware of two of its after effects. Few days after the pills, some bleeding may occur for a couple of days. It is expected withdrawal bleeding. Secondly, the following period may be delayed by few days to a week. This is very reliable method of post coital contraception, if used within 72 hours. 2. Alternatively, you may opt for intrauterine device. If inserted within 5 days of unprotected sexual intercourse, it can prevent pregnancy. Further more, it gives on going contraception for coming few years. If you have already crossed the period of 72 hours, this method is available for you.Wiping with tissue does not clear the vagina of the already deposited sperm. Use either of the above mentioned post coital contraception methods.I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"hi my wife is prgnant by 50days. i have taken a unwanted kit. we have one child of 1and 1/2 yrs by operation. first we have used mifepristone 200 mg on 18th july..and she will now take misoprostol 2 tab of 200mcg each next day means tomorrow i.e 20th july.is it ok or suggest me if abortion took then we should take second dosage of misoprostol 2 tab of 200 mcg or not. and second dosage should be taken after how much gap...and if bleeding takes more...what shoul be do..now after taking mifepristone 200 mg nothing more is happening..kindly suggest..","Doctor":"Hello dearUnderstand your concernAbortion pill should be used under the advice of gynecologist after confirming the intrauterine pregnancy by the USG scanBy procedure:Day 1: Mifepristone 600 mg after mealDay 3 (after 48 hour): misoprostol 400 ug should be put in the vagina by gynecologist.If no bleeding then another 400 ug should be put in the vagina.It should be taken under the observation of gynecologist to prevent complication like severe bleeding, excessive cramp and abnormal development of the pregnancy due to failure.Day 14: USG is required to confirm the complete process of abortion.Bleeding will not occur after taking mifepristone.

Will it affect her periods cycle","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If she had taken I-pill within 72 hours of the unprotected intercourse, she is well protected form pregnancy. Few days after taking I-pill like emergency contraceptive pills, little withdrawal bleeding may occur for a day or two. Moreover, the menses following these pills can get delayed by few days to a week or so. So such delay in menses should not cause any concern. However, your narration mentions that she missed her period of June. It is not clear whether it was delayed by few days or she has missed it and did not get after May. If she has missed her period, she has to assess the pregnancy status by one of the following:1. Pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample a week after the missed period; done earlier, there is a possibility of false negative results.2. Beta hCG test on blood: Values more than 25 mIU/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy while values under 5 mIU/ml denote no pregnancy. Now whether she should cover her unprotected sex on 15 June depends upon her status of pregnancy. If she is pregnant, there is no need to cover this intercourse. If she is not pregnant, she may take I-pill; however, it has to be within 72 hours of the unprotected sex. She should get withdrawal bleeding if she takes I-pill now.

It happened again on the 4th of July. Only difference is that I know that my boyfriend came in me this time.. so I bought another plan b pill. I was going to take it after showering but first I had to use the bathroom. When I was cleaning myself I realized I had blood. I think it s because I might be on my period. Which means I obviously started then, and I didn t know about it until after. DID THE PLAN B PILL WORK EVEN AFTER USING IT ALREADY NOT TO LONG AGO? AND ON TOP OF THAT BEING ON MY PERIOD? I m really nervous.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Plan B pills are post coital emergency contraceptive pills. They are to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex when there is risk of pregnancy. The after effects of these pills are that firstly it causes some withdrawal bleeding after few days and secondly the following period may be delayed by few days to a week. Though you may consider of the bleeding after 4 July as withdrawal of the Plan B taken on or around 27 June, it would be too late to be considered as withdrawal bleeding of the Plan B pill.  So it has to be your menstrual period. You must be aware that the first cardinal symptom of pregnancy is missing a period. Since you got the period the very same day of the unprotected sex, this intercourse cannot cause pregnancy and hence there is no necessity to cover it by Plan B pill. I hope this will take you out of the nervousness.

The ovulation calendar said I would ovulated May 24-26, but I was on my period may 11-18.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You had taken birth control pills regularly during the month of May. So your May month cycle was well protected. However, you have delayed starting the pills of June by seven days. So your June month cycle is NOT protected against pregnancy. You have to use additional protection like Condom during this month. Still, please continue to take the pills though you have started them after a gap of 7 days. This will help to give a start to next month's pills. You are  right in your calculations. If you had your menses from 11 May through 18 May, you would be ovulating around 26-27 May considering your cycle to be 30 days. However, if your have got your menses in June, you do not have to worry about this period of ovulation. I hope this helps you.

Firstly, you had the intercourse during the safe period and you did not need the emergency pill at all.

Since the condom got stuck in the vagina after the intercourse, it is possible for some spillage of semen to happen and if you happen to be in the fertile phase of the cycle, conception chances are high. Yet, use of emergency contraceptive pills should be restricted to only once or twice a year. This is because the high hormone content in the pill creates hormone disturbances and fertility problems in future.another way of emergency contraception is the insertion of an IUD soon after the intercourse to prevent implantation.

In addition, emergency contracpetion also has been taken, which offers 98-99 percent protection in an otherwise unprotected sexual act if taken soon after.

During the initial 2-3 months after initiation of hormone contraception, there is an increased tendency for menstrual irregularities ranging from heavy, early periods, intermittent spotting and mid-cycle bleeding. This usually settles as the body adjusts itself to the new hormone milieu. The vaginal soreness is due to the persistent bleeding and spotting and having to wear protection. Avoid using tampons and use sanitary pads instead. Do not douche or use strong soap solutions to clean the genital region. Use mild antiseptic solution. Take help from your health care provider to control the bleeding. You will need styptics and observation.

Will I bleed? Will I smell? Will my discharge come out irregular? Will it be painful?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. As Implanon is a hormonal contraceptive, it is natural to experience some menstrual irregularities during the initial months as the body adjusts to the new hormone milieu. Later on, you are most likely to stabilize. This does not affect the sexual life in any way. As you have not undergone any vaginal procedure like insertion of an IUD, you will not experience pain during intercourse or bleed. Yet, as for any other hormone contraceptive, you should get periodic check up.

Hence, if she has regular monthly cycles, she was in her safe period during the sexual intercourse. If this was the only act during this menstrual cycle and if she had a normal period during her previous cycle, she cannot be pregnant from a past act. thus there is nothing to worry about the effect of the pill.The protection offered by the pill intake tapers from 98-99% just after the intercourse to 70% by five days.

I even read that the dosage needs to be doubled so I took another ipill the next day. I am quite anxious? Is there a cause for worry....would there be a minute chance that I could be pregant? Kindly do get back to me as soon as possible. Thanks and regards","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood  the concern. It is true that Rifampicin reduces the contraceptive effect of hormonal contraceptives. If you had the intercourse during your safe period or non-ovulation period, you are naturally protected. Please note that ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period of the cycle. You have also had double protection and hence need not worry about failure. The excess hormone content in the pills can induce withdrawal bleeding and delay the next natural cycle by a week or two. Please see the specialist if you become overdue by ten days. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, i got my implanon removed on 22nd january.  I hardly had periods whilst i had the implant in.

Is this normal after the implant is removed?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. It is common to experience some amount of withdrawal bleeding as the implant is removed. You can wait for a couple of days to see if your period will ensue. Usually the hormone levels decline within a week after removal of the implant and fertility returns within six weeks in the majority. If you find no respite even after a week please see a specialist for a proper appraisal and further management. Maintain a healthy weight, healthy diet and regular exercise.

I had very little cramping, and a tad bit of blood, but nothing like I am used to. Also, I had a gelatinous brown substance that I saw when using the restroom. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. It is common to observe menstrual irregularities during the first three cycles after the initiation of the contraception. This is because the body takes time to adjust to the altered hormone milieu. If the breakthrough bleeding is persistent or heavy, please contact your health care provider for further management. Also, you need to use additional protection like condom or spermicide during the initial couple of months after the pill. If not, you carry a higher risk of failure. I would ask you to get a proper clinical appraisal and also exclude pregnancy. Take care."},{"Patient":"I havent been taking any contraceptive pills.

Withdrawal method has high failure rate though from your menstrual history it is evident that you are likely to be experiencing irregular ovulation.

The emergency pill you took a couple of months ago does not affect subsequent cycles. The immediate cycle and sometimes the next one are influenced by the hormone content in the pill. You should perform the home pregnancy test 3-7 days after the missed period with a fresh early morning sample of urine. If negative, you can wait for 7-10 days after your missed period before getting further help from your specialist. A trans-vaginal sonogram helps further in aiding the diagnosis.

We only waited like 3-5 minutes because I felt some liquid stuff coming out like it had dissolved already and I didn t want it to all come out before we even started.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Encare is a locally acting birth control which acts by deactivating the sperms. Its action is through the foam it forms and through the chemical reagents. Though a fair contraceptive method, it cannot be relied completely and hence it is advisable to use this method along with another protection like condom. It is advisable to wait at least for 10 minutes after insertion in lying down postion. This much time is advised for allowance of the dissolving the tablet and forming a foam. If you do not give sufficient time, it may not act and the chances of failure are there. Since you have performed the intercourse within 5 minutes of the insertion of the tablet, you cannot guarantee its success. In such case, you have following options:1. Support the birth control by additionally taking Plan B post coital emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of the intercourse.or2. Get intrauterine contraceptive device inserted within 5 days of the intercourse. This can give you further ongoing birth control for few years to come.You may find out the status of pregnancy by:1. Beta hCG test after 10 days of the intercourse. or2. Pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample after a week of missed period (if you miss it)You have an option of terminating unwanted pregnancy by medicines upto 9 weeks of pregnancy.I hope this helps you.

If you consumed the missed pills immediately after their due date, your cycle is protected.

So even if you had consumed two pills of Nordette 28, it would have given you protection. There was no necessity of repeating 4 pills again after 12 hours. Nordette 28 are levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol  pills while routine Plan B pills contain higher dosage of levonorgestrel. With your first Nordette 4 times dose, you have given due protection against pregnancy. You need not take the stress about it. Now because of all these pills, there is a possibility that you would get some amount of withdrawal bleeding after few days which will last for short period.

The doses of each regime differ. These are very successful medicines in terminating pregnancy upto 9 weeks of pregnancy. These medicines are not to be taken over the counter. They are prescription medicines. Please report to your Gynaecologist and get the appropriate dose prescribed from him/her. Inappropriate dosage may cause failure of medicines.

Some erratic cycles are common as the body adjusts itself to altered hormone milieu. Maintenance of a healthy body weight is another factor influencing the hormone balance. I would ask you to wait for another week before repeating the pregnancy test and going for further advice. Else, you can go for the blood test now for faster management. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Yesterday I had sexual intercourse....i took ipill witin 4-5 hours.. Do i need to take it again (pill). I am really worried I am 20 years old my period came on 15 August and ended on 19 August .i did sex on 26 August.. do i need to take one more i- pill.please suggest fast . I really tensioned as it was my first intercourse.Though we used condom but i dought on it??? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. If you have regular 28-30 day cycles, you had the intercourse just around the fertile period, though with lesser chances of conception. This is because ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next menstrual period and the sperms can remain active up to 72 hours after ejaculation. As you have taken the emergency contraception, you are adequately protected and need not worry. Please wait for your next natural period and if you become overdue by ten days, get help from an expert. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi i am 19 years old. I got mirena about 2 months ago. And about 2 weeks i started to notice that my urine color started to look dark yellow and has a really bad smell. I do not have pain when i urinate. I don t do any kind of drugs what so ever. What could it be?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. From the description you have given, it appears as though you are passing concentrated urine and hence the smell and color. To clarify, you can get a simple urinalysis. This presentation cannot be related to the insertion of the Mirena. The intake of several foods and also mineral and vitamin supplements can give specific color and smell to the urine. You have to increase the intake of water per day to at least 2 liters. If you notice improvement, the cause is obvious. If not, you should check with a specialist for further management. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, I just had intercourse and I m a female. He did not put the condom on correctly, therefore it went out through the sides, but didn t get to the tip to be inserted in me. I am not ovulating, but what are the chances of me still being pregnant, and if it did just happen what can I do to prevent it. I went to the pharmacy to try to purchase the plan B pill but i m not of age, so any suggestions??","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through the query and understood your concern. If you are in the safe period of your menstrual cycle, your chances of conceiving are very very less. Please remember, ejaculation is not needed to cause conception; even the pre-ejaculate contains sufficient sperm. In the current scenario, if you are not fit to receive emergency contraception, you may have to wait till your next natural period and if you become overdue by a week, take help from a specialist to plan further management. In future, please make sure to use regular contraception to avoid such difficulty. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am 22 and have taken i pill in 24 hrs after sex. Not actually a complete sex because my partner was wearing condom and I believe that only the tip went in and then it was out so basically it did not happen more than 10 secs but still we were scared so I had it . Could you please tell me what will happen next as I have eaten it now? Will everything be normal?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. In the manner described, you have no reason to worry about possible conception. The emergency contraceptive pill contains high hormone dose and as a result, you can expect side effects like nausea, vomiting and some withdrawal bleeding after a couple of days. Your next natural period also may get delayed by a week or two. So, if you happen to become overdue by ten days, please contact your gynecologist for further support. Also, please remember, emergency pill use has to be restricted to once or twice a year to avoid future hormonal imbalances. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi I have been on Noriday.

Doc said to carry on taking it, but I don t need this and my body doesn t either, clearly its not right for me Vanessa","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. During the initial months of hormone contraception, menstrual irregularities are observed and these include persistent bleeding/spotting, mid-cycle bleeding/spotting, irregular cycles and heavy bleeding etc. These usually settle down after a few months as the body adjusts itself to the new hormone level. If you do not find any respite after managing your diet, weight and styptics, you need to get a complete physical evaluation, hepatic/renal profile, blood counts and coagulation profile, stop the medication and go for a suitable alternative. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Me and my boyfriend had sex on April 21st. We used protection. The next day I ate unwanted 72. After 5 days I had my periods.

Vaginal or cervical infections - an exam and testing recommended3.

If you had unprotected sex in this period then there is high chance of pregnancy.3)If you had unprotected sex act in the fertile period of your cycle, then you can prevent pregnancy by taking emergency contraceptive pill/ after pill; commonly known as i pill or unwanted.  This pill is effective in 95% or more times, if taken within 24 to 72 hours of unprotected sex act.4) If this is not feasible now, then just wait for your expected date of periods. If you miss the periods, then get morning's first sample tested for pregnancy.Even if you are pregnant, you can opt for termination with medicines safely till 9 weeks, under gynecologist’s supervision.5) I will suggest to get proper sex counselling done.

The contraceptive pill made me sick so we have only been using a condom. I m scared because 5% seems a lot and I don t want to get pregnant. We have stopped having sex because we are so worried. Please help.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Condoms are very successful devices in avoiding the pregnancies if used properly. There failure is mainly due to:1. Rupture of the tit of condom after ejaculation. This happens if the tit is not pinched to remove air in it while putting on condom. Use of outdated condom or repeated use of the same condom also can lead to rupture.2. Failure to completely cover the penis. 3. Forceful pulling out of the penis from vagina after completion of intercourse. After completing intercourse, the girl should abduct her thighs and then let the penis slip off the vagina of its own. When such care is taken, condom is very good contraceptive device. And finally baby, there is nothing 100% fool proof in this world. Every step in the life is with calculated risk. I hope this clarifies your dilemma. If so, you may caste \\"Helpful vote\\" to this advice. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I started my birth control pill (Portia) on June 30 the day I started my period. My period ended the 3rd but I was was toil the 7th and had unprotected sex on the 9th and now I m bleeding again but it s not in my underwear it just when u whip and my boyfriend did cum inside of my ( this was my 1st time having sex )","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Since it was your first ever intercourse, the bleeding you have noted is a defloration bleeding. Defloration is rupture of the hymen (due to first sexual intercourse). Every girl has a fibromuscular membrane called as Hymen present at the vaginal outlet from the birth. During first sexual intercourse, Hymen gets ruptured causing some amount of bleeding. The amount of bleeding depends upon the extent of tear which in turn depends upon the penile size and extent of entry into the vagina. In modern era, most of the girls get their hymen damaged - partially or completely torn due to the lifestyle. Cycling, horse riding, athletics, sitting astride are some of the few non-sexual acts which can cause rupture of the hymen. The bleeding you had seems to be due to rupture of your hymen. Not an issue of concern. If the hymen is completely torn, you will not have any such bleeding after future intercourses; if it is incompletely torn, you may have some bleeding in next few intercourses. I hope this takes away your stress.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi I had sex on May 3. We used a condom and I am on birth control but I don t always take it the same time everyday. I got my period on May 24. Well my period this month was light but I still was able to use a tampon. It was mostly brown with some red mixed in. It was heavy enough that I would need a tampon sometimes but other times there was nothing at all. I took a test before I got my period and it was neg. I took another one today on May 29 and it was neg. I am feeling dizzy today and nauseous with fatigue. Could I be pregnant ? Is this implantation bleeding?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, I gather from your history that you has sex about 21 days before the menses. It is very unlikely that sex on this day would lead to pregnancy. Moreover, you are on regular birth control pills though the timing everyday may be variable. However, the bleeding during the so called period was brownish and scanty. So the possibility of pregnancy has to be assessed. Seven days after (?) missed period, pregnancy test gives reliable result. Though the first test you performed was too early to be reliable, the second test was after five days. It is also negative. So the chances of pregnancy are practically nil. Still I  would request you to perform pregnancy test on overnight sample of first morning urine sample afterv4 days again. If this is also negative, you are not pregnant. You may go for ultrasonography to rule out blighted ovum in aborting process. Mostly this appears to be less bleeding due to hormonal imbalance. If you are taking progesterone dominant pills, they can cause such a low bleeding. If you do not get regular bleeding after one week, please report to the Gynaecologist.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hello, I had unprotected sex 2 nights ago and took plan b yesterday morning.

Unwanted 72 is very effective emergency contraceptive pill when taken within 72 hours of the unprotected sexual intercourse. You have taken it within 50 hours. You are well protected. Few days after these pills, usually little amount of bleeding occurs. This is normal and not an issue of concern. Moreover, following menses after these pills may get delayed by few days to a week. These pills contain Progestational medicine; hence some gastritis can take place leading to temporary gaseous disturbances. Some antacid tablets will give you relief from this. Also due to progesterone, some heaviness in the breasts may be experienced. Wait patiently and you will; get your menses, may be delayed by few days. I hope this helps you to shirk off the stress.
