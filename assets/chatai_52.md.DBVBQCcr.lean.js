Now it is getting smaller and smaller. And also it looks like there is another issue. Right testicle does take more time to involve in ejaculation. Probably tighten. Even before the surgery it took like 30-40 minutes to ejaculate. But I feel it is somewhat blocked.

Sperm quantity and viscosity depends on many factors like stress, hydration etc. Low viscosity, color etc never determines the health of sperm cells. Therefore, don;t read too much into this.

One is psychologically you have thought that you cant cum. Second is physically you are thinking that your penis is small.

Second apply some local aphrodisiac applications which will strengthen penis vessels and help to fill cavernous spaces well with blood to get normal erection.Ayurveda's Shrigopal tel (Oil) is one such application. Other is Himcolin gel. There are many others. Orally also if semen nourishing (Shukra enhancers - as per Ayurveda) herbals are used, these will definitely improve your erectile problem.

This condition is called fungal balanitis and caused by the fungus Candida albicans.Now, candida is a normal fungus found in the vagina and is present to help with regulation of the normal organisms found there. If your girlfriend had a fungal infection (colloquially also known as 'yeast infection'), then it could be a way that you have been infected with this fungus. it doesn't mean that your girlfriend gave you an STD but rather a common infection women get via the sexual intercourse route.You can ask your pharmacist for clotrimazole cream and apply it liberally to the head of the penis 2 times a day until the issues resolves or for a maximum of 14 days. Once the symptoms have resolved, then continue applying the cream for another three days so as to make sure you kill off all the fungal spores so that this issue doesn't recur. Before applying the cream, just make sure that you have cleared as much of the discharge from the head of the penis as possible.If the problem still persists then you should consult your doctor as you may need to have this condition treated with oral antifungal medication.I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"Went to a thai massage parlour.

If you start to notice these signs, then I would suggest that you see your doctor as soon as you can so that they may prescribe the appropriate treatment for this issue.In order to prevent an infection from occurring you can continue with the following care. You can clean the wound with a saline solution (salt water) 3 times a day until the wound has made a scab over it. You can then let the area granulate on its own.I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"Hi Sir, I am 28 year old male.

Is this a symptom of STD?","Doctor":"Hi there and thank you for your question.I appreciate your concern regarding this matter and I'll try help where I can.The rash you describes sounds, possibly, like a fungal rash. The medical term is tinea inguinalis and the more general layperson name is 'jock-itch'.You can get an antifungal cream from your pharmacy called miconazole. You will need to make sure you clean the affected area as you normally do when you bath or shower and make sure the area is dry afterwards. You then apply the cream and do this 2 times a day until the issue clears or for a maximum of 14 days. After it looks like the rash has cleared, then continue the use of the cream for another 5 days to make sure all the fungal spores are dead so there's no chance of the issue recurring.If you have gone through all these steps and there's still no improvement then you should consult with you doctor to assess the situation further please.I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"Hello DrI am a 48 years old male, height is 1.63 mt weight is 68 kgs, I have been to a routine medical check up last month in my Abdomino-pelvic sonography results says The Prostate is enlarged, measures 37 x 36 x 33mm( 24gms ) do I need to worry or is it normal??

If this is the case, then you will need to go on a course of antibiotics to clear up the problem.Your doctor could also ask for a semen sample to be sent to a lab in order to have a culture and sensitivity test done in order to see what organism is causing the problem.I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"I have red spots on my penis, that have white dry skin around them.

The diagnosis would then be fungal balanitis. There should usually be a thick cheese-like discharge that forms on the head of the penis but may not always be the case. In this situation you could try applying ketoconazole cream 2 times a day on the affected area for 7-10 days until the issue resolves. You should then continue applying the cream for another 3 days to make sure the spores have been killed off so as to prevent the problem from recurring.If the problem still persists then it would be advisable to discuss this issue with a dermatologist preferably.I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"Good morning doctor. I shaved my penis recently and started developing spots all over. I used an anti-bacteria cream: Funbact-A and every morning before having my bath, I washed my penis with a little disinfectant. Now the skin of my scrotal sac is folding, it is also inflamed and itchy, please what do I do?","Doctor":"Hi and thank you for your question.It seems as if you have an inflammatory reaction to the skin of your penis and scrotum. This happens commonly after shaving the pubic area for the first time.I would suggest you stop using the antibacterial products seeing that this isn't an infection and you could possibly cause bacterial resistance to these products as well.I also suggest you use hydrocortisone 0.5% over the affected area daily for the next 7-10 days until the inflammation has subsided.I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"In the last 2 days I developed a red rash on my scrotum. It does not itch but is sensitive. For the record, I used desoximetasome on the top of my penis starting 10 days ago but that never touched my scrotum. This was the medicine recommended by my dermatologist on a spot where a mole was removed which the lab said was squamous.","Doctor":"Hi there and thank you for your question.The redness on the scrotum does sound like an inflammatory response on the skin.You can use the desoximetasone on the affected area once a day until the sensitivity disappears or for a maximum of 10 days. By the end of the 10 days the rash should've resolved but if it hasn't then it is possible that the issue is due to a fungal infection.In that case you could use ketoconazole cream which you can get over the counter and apply it twice a day to the scrotum for 7-10 days. Once resolved, you should continue with the medication for another 3 days to make sure all the fungal spores have been killed so that the problem doesn't repeat itself.If the problem still persists the you should consult with your doctor. I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"i am 42 year man ,takes liquor (scotch whisky) almost every day and i excise almost every day and for about one year iam loosing penis erection as well as premature ejuclation so what shal i do ? my body weight is 96 kg and height is 5ft 9 inches and also taking medicine for bp sugar and some for cholestrole, please advise.","Doctor":"Hello,Premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction could happen due to variety of factors like hyperthyroidism, anxiety, diabetics, hypertension or hypo-tension, stress etc. You need to get an online consultation with me so as to pin point what is the reason behind your present difficulty in erection and premature ejaculation.

And am also having the urge to urinate from time to time,i had taken spasfon and citro soda but nothing yet.. am having his for nearly 4 month and yesterday it was more intense","Doctor":"Hi there and thank you for your question.I appreciate your concern regarding this issue and I shall help where I can.There are a few issues that need to be excluded here but you would have to see your GP in order to perform the correct tests. By doing so you will be able to determine the cause of your symptoms and you can then receive the appropriate management for it.A simple test could be done to your urine called a 'dipstick' test where a test strip is used to determine whether the are any abnormalities with the urine.If there is blood in the urine then further investigations will need to be done such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out kidney stones for example.The test would also be able to pick up if there are any signs of infection which could also be causing your symptoms. Other products such as glucose and proteins can also be detected in the urine this way and if so, further investigations will have to be done to rule out other systemic problems such as diabetes and liver related pathology.I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"I had a small wart (2 cm) removed from the shaft of my penis 10 days ago. I have applied neosporin a couple times a day as instructed by dermatologist. Wound has still not healed although it appears a bit smaller. How long should this healing process normally take?","Doctor":"Hi there and thank you for your question.I appreciate you concern for this issue and I'll try help where I can.I think you can stop with the Neosporin now as bacterial resistance to the medication can occur if you use it too long when there's no active infection.Instead, you can just keep the area clean with a saline (salt water) solution 3 times a day. You can make your own by mixing 1 teaspoon of salt in 2 litres (64 ounces) of boiled, cooled down water and clean the area with a cotton swab or gauze. Just make sure that the area is dry after cleaning it.The wound will eventually make a scab and then you can stop cleaning it with the saline. The scab will eventually fall off and the granulated tissue will heal on its own. In total, this can take another 10-14 days.I hope this helps to put your mind at ease. Good luck."},{"Patient":"My nephew (16yo) is complaining of swelling to the shaft of his penis. His pcp recommended he massage the area, take a warm bath.

If the pain is still severe then he should go to an ER immediately to be assessed further and have any medical emergency excluded.Otherwise if the symptoms haven't worsened then I would think it's okay to wait to see his GP in the morning. They would then need to try and exclude an issue such as infection of the penis and/or testicles.I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"I have had red numba on the head of my penis and on the shaft that itch like crazy.

My 62 year old boyfriend has been experiencing his penis becoming glued almost shut. A few times he had fever and night sweats with shaking, and after these episodes, (at times of more stress in his life, ) his penis will be completely clear and functioning normally, only to slowly close up with glue again. Can you explain possible causes?","Doctor":"Hi there and thank you for your question.I appreciate your concern regarding this issue and I shall be glad to help.Thie issue of the recurrent discharge with swelling and closing up of the foreskin sounds like a recurrent infection of the head of the penis. This is usually caused by the fungus Candida albicans and is called a fungal balanitis.The reason this happens is because of a weakened immune system and the causes of this can be numerous.The reason behind the recurrent fevers, sweating and rigors he gets needs to be worked up by his doctor. If this is due to an infective process then the cause needs to be determined and treated. It could be a reason why his immune status is struggling and thus the opportunistic infection of the penis.Diabetes is another major cause of fungal balanitis due to its effect on the immune system and also needs to be excluded.Once all these issues have been dealt with, then the chances of the balanitis recurring will decrease dramatically.I hope this helps to steer you in the right direction and good luck."},{"Patient":"I had intercourse with my wife and afterwards I went to sleep. When I awoke to urinate I noticed me penis head was swollen and distorted so much when I urinated it was a split stream as if my foreskin was still covering part of the opening. Any way the sex was a little rough so maybe it was a little beat up. I have been applying topical otc anti-fungal cream. The symptoms seem to be easing. Not sure if it s from the cream or just because it has been 5 days since sex. I am not circumcised but my parents taught me the importance of cleaning myself. Would an infection happen so quickly or was it just recovering from a rough ride?","Doctor":"Hi there and thank you for your question.I appreciate your concern regarding this issue and I shall be glad to help.In my opinion, it seems that your symptoms are related more to the sexual activity rather than an infection.Whether it be fungal or bacterial, any infection of the head of the penis would take around 12-24 hours before causing any symptoms and longer than that before you see signs of an infection.I think you can stop using the antifungal medication now and the issue should resolve completely on its own in the next couple of days of rest.I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"thirty year old male, climbing over a barbed wire fence, has a puncture wound to his scrotm. small amount of bleeding. has had a recent tet. shot. what type of first aide do we need to provide and what symptoms do we need to look for if thing are worse than we think they are","Doctor":"Hi there and thank you for your question.The area should be cleaned 3-4 times a day with a saline (salt water) solution.

There are many such issues which is why it's important to be examined and assessed further to determine the cause. It is also concerning that you are fatigued as well which would tell me that you need immediate medical attention.I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"hello doctor. i was cutting hair on my scrotum and got slight cut on the skin of scrotum, slight bleeding occured. i applied savlon antiseptic and bleeding stopped but now i am feeling burning sensation on the scrotum. i am very anxious now. please help me","Doctor":"Hi and thank you for your question.I understand that you would feel quite anxious due to this experience but I would like to put your mind at ease and tell you that you shouldn't worry.The area is burning because nerve endings have been exposed due to the cut you sustained. Any liquid applied to the area, especially an alcohol based one, will cause the nerve endings to react and therefore burning is experienced.Try just keeping the area clean with a mild soap and water, it will still cause a light stinging sensation but it won't be as bad as what you've experienced. Dry the area and it should heal nicely on its own.I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"sir, my name is ashraf my hieght-5'7'' weight-59kg age-22 well health, but i was committed with a bad habit(handling) by some of my friends from 7-8 years, but i can't understand about it's demerits and now i leave this habit but my  penis is so small, i am so weak in sexually.","Doctor":"Hello,Masturbation in excess can affect your health adversely for some time but it will never be chronic.

Thrice daily is definitely more than high level. Thrice or four times a week is ideal. Excess masturbation can cause loss of energy (which you can regain after taking one hour rest) and may cause anxiety if you do not have proper knowledge about it. Erection while urination and while sexual urge are two different concepts and I suggest you not to confuse between them. Penis naturally shrinks after masturbation, but it cannot shrink in size.

And as far as I know we are in a monagomus relationship. First I want to point out that we live in different states. Last time I was back home in May we had sex a number of times until the end of May when I had to return to school. In the past weeks I have had stomach cramps and within the last week I noticed a discomfort on the skin near the top of my penis. I looked closer and it was a red bump and flesh colored. The next day it oozed a clear liquid but only when I squeezed the area. It appears to be healing but no golden crust formed. This bump burns and still gives me discomfort to date.

I am a male, 26 old and having a lot of problem with my beard as in some area of my face the hair hasn't even started growing. i don't have proper beards as it should be. Please suggest what to do..!!","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Facial hair growth is determined by many factors including genetics, nature and demography. Therefore you should not get frustrated even if you do not develop full facial hair.Unlike what your relatives or older men may say, shaving your facial hair constantly does not make the hair thicker. Try taking these hair friendly vitamins.Vitamin A: This vitamin stimulates the production of sebum, which keeps your hair follicles and skin hydrated—important for keeping hair healthy looking. You can find it in eggs, meat, cheese, liver, carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, and dark green leafy vegetables.Vitamin C: Not only is it good for boosting your immune system, it keeps your hair and skin healthy too. Citrus is the standby for natural vitamin C, and you can also find foods such as green peppers, dark green vegetables, potatoes, and tomatoes rich in vitamin C.Vitamin E: This has long been recognized as key for healthy skin, and can increase blood flow—leading to an optimal environment for hair growth. Foods rich in vitamin E include oils, leafy vegetables, nuts, and beans, and most people get plenty of vitamin E when eating a normal diet. Topical applications can also be beneficial.Vitamin B3: This also helps boost circulation, which may have a positive effect on hair grown. Reports find that B3 is even more effective when taken with biotin. You can find vitamin B3 in beef, chicken, fish, and wheat germ.Vitamin B5: Also known as pantothenic acid, B5 not only helps the body use fats and proteins, necessary for healthy hair, it also has been reported to help reduce stress; and stress can definitely inhibit hair growth. It occurs naturally in brewer's yeast, broccoli, avocado, egg yolks, organ meats, duck, milk, lobster, whole-grain breads, and more.Folic acid. This vitamin can help promote thicker hair, and is necessary for the growth and repair of hair.

As you mentioned that you had unprotected sex for two days and on third day you had your menstrual cycle, which was lesser in flow as compared to your previous cycles. Also you had Postinor during your period as well and also during your pervious period as well which were normal.However you should be assured that reduced flow during this period doesn't means that you are pregnant. For pregnancy to happen, ejaculation needs to happen before or during ovulation, which occurs during 14th day of cycle. However as you had your periods after as well hence, there was no ova available for fertilisation. Spotting or reduced flow during menstrual cycle can be due to anaemic state which might have been persisting due to excessive blow flow during previous period which might have been resulted due to postinor which you have taken.Hence i would advice you to consult a gynaecologist for reduced menstrual flow which might have resulted from anaemic states, which might require treatment as well.Thank you."},{"Patient":"I had intercourse with a women who was red all over her vigiana, looked more like a  red sun burn on her.

For any physical disease conditions, it is quite normal that scrotum sack shrinks or deflates itself. For your testicles to produce sperm, they must be kept at just the right temperature. As a result, scrotum will change size to make sure the testicles stay at that right temperature. This happens without you even thinking about it. So, when you are having any physical problems, your body sends a message to the scrotum to shrivel and preserve heat. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

It appeared about a week or two after unprotected oral sex from a girl from I met at a sports bar but I I didn't think anything of it so after a few weeks it didn't go away so now I'm freaking out, so I grab some peroxide and drown it. It's didn't do anything so I squeezed it and a strand of white came out so I put peroxide on it again and it fizzed up white. So next I hop in the shower and I scrubbed it raw basically to where I took it off myself. Then it started to scab but has been stuck like that for a couple of months and I've been to the er for it twice and had urinalysis done along with a swab of the scab/bump which came back negative. Then 2 months later I returned to same er which did a std panel except for herpes/hpv because of the negative swab. Another urinalysis and std panel negative after having the bump scab for 6 months. Followed up with a urologist who checked out my equipment and urinalysis (conducted by him) and said I was fine but I forgot to tell him about the scab but being my stuff was out he should have seen it right but you have to really look to see it. So next would be a dermatologist which I went to see and I showed him the spot and he said it's probably irritation and prescribed hydro valerate for two weeks and come back in three which I schedule before leaving his office but it's been healing and I keep peeling it bit by bit.

It started from the groin area and later spread to areas on my ass, inner thighs, even the belt region (below torsoe) and under my breasts, possibly on the nipples too (there were spots on the nipple and they used to itch). There used to be continuous itching and i have tried a lot of medicines, both tablets and topical creams. To mention some: clotrimazole, candid-b, cloben-g, onabet, sarfaz sn, sebifin. And internally i took fluconazole tablets. I used to apply antifungal powders too, but i stopped on the advice of some doctors that it clogs pores. Out of the above mentioned medicines, thw ointment sebifin seemed to be most effective. It worked wonders and alleviated the problem to much extent. However there are still signs of the problem that persist in all areas. It is not as chronic as before but it has not left completely. There are many marks on my body and they start to be itchy in short intervals. The areas have also turned dark and look bad. I am very upset with all of this as the problem just doesnt seem to go. Seeing my skin turning dark, i stopped applying the ointment. Currently am not undergoing any kind of treatment, but i want to get rid of this fungal infection once and for all.

I showed it to urologist, he said it is penis sensitivity. But I want to ask is that what is a difference between sensitivity and pain? I have no problem in urine. Just while adjusting boxer, wearing jeans, it hurts. Is it cancer? Or is it serious? If not, what are the remedies? Please suggest Answer I received: Hello When you feel electric like sensation we call it as sensitivity .While pain is a defense feature and if it hurts all the time. When you wear jeans etc may be a pain or sensitivity. As far as concerned about tight foreskin may be a case of paraphimosis i.e. don t retract skin of penis so that glans of penis don t expose.So consult a surgeon and get hsi opinion. My question: I dont have problem in pulling foreskin up.I have pulling foreskin down. It is pain as you described and not sensitivity. There is nothing like current feeling in there. When penis is being pushed against the boxer, it hurts. so boxer and penis are 90 degrees to each other when it hurts. I have read about adhesion. Am i facing this issue? If yes, is it serious? Is it cancerous?

I have been prescribed a complete circumcision by my surgeon. I'd be happy to go for it because sex is rather too painful for me. But I have read elsewhere on the internet that circumcision depletes the sensitivity of the penus especially for adult males. Is that true? I'd rather like to keep my foreskin if it can be helped.Are there other methodologies other than complete circumcision that I could undergo? Perhaps make a cut on my prepuce for Phimosis and elongate my frenulum using Frenuloplasty?  Again, i don't expect a cure, but rather some expert opinions on whether conservative surgery can be applicable on such cases. Other facts:-1. My penis would be 5,5 inches when erect. 2. A tight ring does form when I slide the foreskin down the head of penis, even when it is not erect.3. The ring becomes extremely tight if I witness an erection and the frenulum hurts.","Doctor":"HelloThanks for query .You have tight Phimosis .The best treatment option for tight Phimosis is to get circumcised .This will give you permanent cure and helps to have enjoyable sex through out the life .The other option that is available is to do dorsal slit where foreskin is opened dorsally so that foreskin can be retracted over glans penis .But the cosmetic results of this surgery are not acceptable by most of the female partners.As regards your doubt about sensitivity of glans penis ,circumcision does reduce the sensitivity of glans penis but it gets accustomed to this as you can see most of the people from Muslim community who get circumcised in early childhood do enjoy sex .Dr.Patil."},{"Patient":"In feburary this year I had an operation to remove a left spermatocele (testicular cyst) which was a little larger than a goose egg. There was little swelling afterwards, however within a week I could tell there was some strange matter still in the scrotum. A few weeks later this began to reform as another cyst. When I went for reexamination the specialist ask me to return in 6 months. I did, the cyst had grown back to the same size as before, and again I was put in for an operation. I had that operation 10 days ago. I was told this time there was a lot of bleeding and they kept me in the hospital over night. Immediately my scrotum appeared extremely swollen. They discharged me from hospital after one-night, I went home. My first checking of the scrotum showed that the left size was now about the size of a large orange (bigger than before). The surgeon had told me this can be normal, and told me to rest. I have a re-examination with them in 3 weeks time. Now, 10 days after the operation, there is no longer much pain related to the area. However the swelling, or whatever it is, remains the same size! That is, the size of a large orange. This is far more debilitating that the original cyst was. Further more, my own examination cannot differentiate anything between the matter in the scrotum now, and how the cyst felt before. In other words, to me it just appears to be another very large cyst which has almost immediately taken the place of the second one. Is this a possiblity? Or is this swelling normal and will it go down? How can I tell if I have a recurrence or not?

There are many potential causes of DE, including psychological hang-ups, chronic health conditions, and reactions to medications. Relationship stress, poor communication, and anger can make DE worse. Disappointment in sexual realities with a partner compared to sexual fantasies can also result in DE. Often, men with this problem can ejaculate during masturbation, but not during stimulation with a partner. Medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, high blood pressure medications, diuretics, and alcohol can all cause DE. In that sense, Zoloft could be a cause. But you should talk to your psychiatrist.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.  sure that you include every minute details possible. Hope this answers your query.

I am not experiencing any pain or discomfort. Thanks for your input.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Brownish semen can occur due to infections especially in the prostrate, and also due to bleeding in the prostrate. It is due to a tear in one of the fragile veins of the prostate.  The prostate is the organ that produces the majority of the seminal fluid in response to sexual stimulation. When the prostate contracts at the time of ejaculation, a vein may tear and blood mixes with the semen (hematospermia). Red blood indicates new and dark (brownish) discoloration indicates previous bleeding. Irritation of the gland (prostatitis) can also cause it to become inflamed and predisposed to bleed.  Some factors leading to inflammation include too frequent or too infrequent ejaculation, sexual arousal without ejaculation, withdraw at the time of ejaculation, excessive alcohol or spicy foods, prolonged sitting or bike riding, etc. Also certain tumors of the prostrate can cause this. I would suggest that you visit a urologist for complete work up and further assistance in treatment.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.  sure that you include every minute details possible.

I am uncircumcised, but i still sometimes use lotion for an added sensation. I have always wiped myself completely clean of any and all lotion after masturbating with it, as well as semen. I even pull back the foreskin and fairly roughly wipe off the glans and parts of the head that are usually unexposed. I have been doing this for years, and before recently, haven t had any problem with it. I am also a virgin and haven t had sexual contact with a girl in over six months, so an STD is not an option. I have been masturbating with lotion for about a week now that I m home. Two nights ago, however, I woke up in the middle of the night to a severe itch on the underside of my penis and scrotum. I couldn t sleep, so I scratched it until I was comfortable again. I woke up to slightly reddened skin on the underside of my penis and scrotum. The itch went away during most of the day, but at night, again, I masturbated (this time without lotion). Yesterday, I woke up to slightly more irritated skin, becoming more red and becoming slightly swollen around the scrotum and foreskin. Now, my penis and scrotum are very red and irritated, and my foreskin is very swollen. It is also slightly painful. I have been reading a lot about yeast infections, and it seems like that is the probable cause of this. I don t know how, since I have been cleaning myself with the same routine for years and I haven t had any trouble until now, but nevertheless, it seems like the logical decision. However, what deters me from thinking this is that the day before I started noticing the itchy penis and scrotum, I was out in the woods doing yard work, and it is very probable that I rubbed up on either poison ivy, oak, or sumac. I think this because even though my genitalia was the first area to become itchy, and is at this point still the worst, I have been developing rashes on other parts of my body. Is it possible that I touched my penis before adequately washing my hands and the poisonous oils from the plant spread that way? Or is this just a side effect of a yeast infection? Is it a possible solution to just wait this out, or should I seek medical attention?","Doctor":"Hello I share your concern, i will try to help you out in best possible way.Looking at your description this could be STI or infected ulcer may be due to trauma during masturbation or an allergic reaction.I would like further information help you better relevant medical history like metabolic disease or hormonal disorderAny recent exposure to unprotected sex?You should ask your doctor for few investigations to confirm the diagnosis like Urine culture and sensitivity test Blood for CBC and liver function test or urine test are advisable if it is a chronic issueMaintain good hygieneWash and clean it with antiseptic solution or soapYou can apply antiseptic ointment externally.Use condom during sex if you are sexually activeHope this answers your question please feel free to ask for more clarificationThanks and regards"},{"Patient":"A spot the base of my penis has been itching for the past 4 months .

It NEVER causes loss of energy or weight loss. this is a misconception. The option to avoid wet nights is to avoid things that sexually provoke you. For example watching a song that causes sexual attraction, thinking about someone/something that makes you feel sexually pleasurable etc. It might seem more difficult to control these thoughts when comparing to just ignoring your involuntary ejaculation. Since you are not involved in any sexual activity that lets out your sperms, your body is naturally finding a way to get rid of the excess sperms stored. this is the reason for nocturnal emissions. True it causes body pain and tiredness in morning.

Watery semen doesnot mean low in fertility. The water content in semen depends on so many aspects and the thickness varies. You need to conduct fertility tests to determine the fertility of the semen. You told you are trying to conceive. There are time periods where you should try to conceive. 10 days after your period and 10 days prior to the next period is ideal time period. You get almost 10 days. Try to conceive in these days.

Every once in a while there is a really small amount of clear liquid that's sticky like pre ejaculate if I open the tip.

I think you are being obsessive and worrying too much. The liquid you are talking about is of course semen and it is natural that body expels some of its stored semen through the penis before and after urine or through seepage. That is normal and there is nothing to worry. Your feeling of water movement through the penis shaft is supposed to be an obsession related feeling. Prostrate could not be involved.

During first sex, for boys, there should not be any complications like you are mentioning here. Vagina is supposed to be lubricated before insertion of the penis. That lubricant causes smooth up and down movement of penis without any rashes. Secondly, if the foreskin is easily retractable, it will not cause any pain or bleeding. Practice retracting the foreskin.

Please do not over read and fall prey to prostitutes and come out with diseases. Initial sexual intercourse could be painful for both boy and girl. The main reason is the lack of lubricants inside the vagina. Enough foreplay with the girl should do the trick. Insertion should take place only after the girl feels there is lubrication.

I have been doing more than 10 years","Doctor":"Dear Patient,    Thank you very much for your question. Also I have answered many questions similar to yours. Masturbation is absolutely innocent, harmless and normal sexual response in both males and females. According to an Australian study, men who masturbate frequently are less prone to prostate cancer in older ages. However, masturbation can be very annoying and disturbing once it becomes a compulsion and then it is harmful because you waste your important time that you can spend on other important activities such as studies and sport.              When masturbation is a compulsion, it can be due to an anxiety disorder called obsessive compulsive disorder. Many young people who suffer from anxiety practice masturbation frequently as a relief. However, relief you gain from masturbation is only a temporary solution for your anxiety. My advice is to consult your family doctor to treat your anxiety. Meditation, yoga ,regular exercises and anxiety relieving breathing exercises also can be useful for you. Once your anxiety disorder is properly treated, you can get rid of excessive masturbation. However, masturbation is harmful only if it becomes an excessive habit. Otherwise, it is absolutely normal and harmless.I think I answered your question. Do not worry.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe. MD"},{"Patient":"my husband has start complaining and itching in his private parts lately  also he said it burns when he pees after sex .

This phenomenon is quite normal and there is nothing to worry.

I donot think you do not need any medications for premature ejaculation. Instead of taking medications to treat premature ejaculation, you can practice \\"masters and Johnson\\" pause-squeeze technique to prolong your time of ejaculation.      In  Pause and squeeze technique, you may ask your partner to stimulate your penis untill you feel the urge of ejaculation. Once you have the urge to ejaculate, ask your partner to squeeze area where glans penis connect to shaft untill the urge disappears. Practising this method you can delay your ejaculation. However, anxiety or stress can be the underlying cause for your problem. In you have anxiety, it can affect both your erection and ejaculatory mechanism.  Therefore, my advice is to see your family physician if pause and squeeze technique finds less effective. Low testosterone level also  causes poor erection and maintaing a good erection during sexual intercourse. If you consult your family doctor, he or she can check your blood for testosterone, do physical examination to find any biological causes for premature ejaculation and treat anxiety if it is the cause for your problems.  Even some drugs like Fluoxetine which is used to treat anxiety, can be used to treat premature ejaculation too.                Therefore, see your family physician if you do not have help from pause-squeeze technique. If you have more questions, please let me know. Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe.

Masturbation is an innocent, normal sexual behavior in both males and females. It is absolutely normal and harmless. According to an Australian medical research, men who masturbate frequently when young are less prone to prostate cancer in older ages.            However, excessive masturbation can be a result of having an anxiety disorder. People who suffers from anxiety can be engaged in excessive masturbation to ease their anxiety symptoms.  Even excessive masturbation can be a compulsion of obsessive compulsive disorder which is a type of anxiety disorder. Therefore, my advice is see your family physician to treat your anxiety. You can do breathing exercises to ease your anxiety. Also try to be engaged in sports which can help you to distract yourself from this activity. Though masturbation isn't harmful, excessive masturbation can be annoying because it affects your daily important activities.

Later, when they discover that touching themselves on the genitals is pleasurable, they can use masturbation as an escape from their psychological pain. Masturbation can become addictive because it is such an instant tension reliever. There is nothing wrong with masturbation but, as with other activities, it can be destructive when used compulsively as a painkiller to cut off from feelings. Physical exercise is the best method to quit masturbation. Therefore I suggest consulting a skin specialist for physical examination, diagnosis and treatment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards, Dr. K. V.

Will it get recovered if I stop this habit permanently ?","Doctor":"Dear Patient,      Thank you very much for your question. As you mentioned, your MRI shows mild Prolapsed intervertebral disc L4-L5 which can cause your chronic back pain. The underlying cause for this condition is not masturbation and PIVD has a strong genetic component. Also trauma, poor weight lifting techniques and occupations which needs extended period of time sitting than moving like drivers , office workers can trigger PIVD up on strong genetic predisposition. Masturbation is a harmless, innocent and physiological human sexual response which absolutely does not have any correlation to your lower back pain due to PIVD.               There are certain tests like, Straight leg raise (SLR) for diagnosing herniation at L4-L5 and neurological tests for diagnosing level of reflexes, muscle and sensory weakness due to level of  disc prolapse. Therefore, I recommend you to consult a Orthopedic surgeon for proper consultation and further treatments. He is the best person to help you. Also do not worry about masturbation. It is absolutely normal and disease free. If you have more questions, please let me know.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe. MD"},{"Patient":"I am18 year boy.

As you mentioned, during oral sex glans penis due to its high sensitivity can be easily irritated by friction. However, it is hard to diagnose  without examine a patient.  Some infections can cause inflammation of the head of the penis or balanitis that may cause pain and a foul discharge.        My advice is to see a doctor soon. Also try to be responsible for your sexual health. Abstain from unprotected sex  and limit your sexual activities to  one partner who has tested free for sexually transmitted diseases. Do not think that oral sex is disease free. Oral sex can transmit infections like Clamydia, gonorrhoea and even HIV with a negligible risk.  Therefore, an unprotected oral sex is not 100% disease free and it still poses a risk of contracting an STD.  If you have any other questions, please let me know. I hope that I answered your question.Good Luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe.

First of all I want to tell you that masturbation is an innocent, absolutely normal human sexual response. According latest research men who have often practiced masturbation  are less prone to prostate cancer in later ages. Therefore, Do not worry about masturbation. It does not have side effects.  It is absolutely normal and harmless.          However, the fear or guilt you have towards masturbation has resulted to create your anxiety. I believe those non specific above mentioned symptoms are also related to anxiety. when you have anxiety and do not know a way to solve your problems it coverts into depression. Your suicidal thoughts are part of your depression.  Dear reader, you have to understand for what you are worrying is meaningless.  Almost all men have practiced masturbation in their lives. Your problem is you just overlook at your problem. Also all your above mentioned symptoms are due to your anxiety,therefore,treating your symptoms mean in other words  treating your build up anxiety.  Also men when they are sexually aroused fluids from prostate and cowper's glands start leaking through the urethra.  This is what you have seen as semen and during sexual excitement leaking of these fluids is again normal.            You do not have to suicide. You are a healthy young man. My advice is you have to see a psychiatrist immediately. He is the right person to help you.  Believe me you life will be good and happy. Stop worrying and consult a psychiatrist soon.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe.

In that case, some medications that are used to treat obsessive compulsive behavior may be helpful.  Often, SSRI medications are used to for this.  These are most effective for obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors when used at higher doses (but started at a lower dose and gradually increased).  Consider seeing your family doctor or a psychiatrist to discuss whether treatment might be appropriate.

However, If your masturbation is disturbing your daily activities like studies, sports just because you are addicted to it, then it is not good.

It is a new experience for you with your female partner,therefore,your very high level of sexual excitement and anxiety can cause your premature ejaculation. This is absolutely normal and you will overcome it when you have more sexual experiences with your partner.  Also you can follow ''Masters and Johnson\\" guidelines to delay premature ejaculation.  It means you or your partner can stimulate you but at the moment of ejaculation you or your partner can stop stimulation by gently squeezing the head of the penis. After a while you can again start the stimulation and stop it just before ejaculation. This will help you to extend your foreplay and delay your ejaculation.               Also if the course of your premature ejaculation related to stress or anxiety, you can do breathing exercises to relax yourself.  If you are needed SSRI inhibitors like Fluvoxamine to treat anxiety related conditions that has to be prescribed by a physician only.  However,  I believe by talking to your partner and practicing above mentioned pause-squeeze techniques  is the best way to solve this problem without medication.  I hope you won't need medication and those techniques will help you to overcome your problem.Good Luck!Dr. Dinesh Weerasinghe MD."},{"Patient":"I am 31 year old.

It is about an inch long and half an inch wide, rather firm and very sensitive to touch. The skin over it appears normal. It hurts him intermittently.

This procedure is scheduled in a few days. Last night, the area above the swollen node began to swell as well.

Your problem can be due to retrograde ejaculation. This can be due to overstimulation and stopping ejaculation. If this occurs regularly then get an examination by an urologist to rule out any problems regarding prostate. If this occured after excessive sexual stimulation then nothing to worry.
