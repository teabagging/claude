Onychophagia or nail biting is commonly associated with hair pulling and picking skin. In most of individuals the reason behind these impulses is severe anxiety. I would advise you to consult a Psychiatrist for expert management. Medicines like SSRIs as Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine etc are very useful in controlling impulses. Behavior therapy by a trained psychologist help in decreasing abnormal behaviour and to impart good desired behaviour.Get your complete hemogram done along with vitamin B12 levels. Low levels are associated with anxiety and consequent impulsive behaviour.Hope this helps you, thanks"},{"Patient":"My husband had a stroke when he was six years of age.

Repeated vascular insult on brain causes vascular or multi infarct dementia. The dementia is progressive but the progression can be halted by taking proper medicines. Medicines like cholinergic drugs as Donepezil, Rivastigmine are very useful in dementia. Other medicines like Memantin is also commonly used.Consult your doctor for proper treatment.

The beginning of 2009 I feel ill, severe stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and fainting. I was hospitalized 3 times for these symptoms and came up with no answers (except a very unstable blood pressure, low electrolytes and somewhat abnormal heart rate) I was checked for these afterwards and they came up normal. I was sent to my doctor who blamed my symptoms on Anxiety, sent me to a mental health office and presribed me Nexium to help with the symptoms, which it did, but only with the indigestion, the rest of the symptoms stayed and has made it difficult for me to even get a job and complete schooling but I dealt with it as best I could, thinking it was only Anxiety, and at the time was seeking help for. I was born with a hurt murmur and i ve always had Palpitations but recently i ve been getting new symptoms which have been bothersome and I have not tried to contact my doctor for fear of being shunned because of my age and given the same diagnosis. I ve always had a healthy lifestyle of good eating and exercising. I ve found that my normal strong heart palpitation has been more frequent and has actually grown weaker. During activity just from standing and walking it will Palpitate heavily, i ll have trouble breathing, dizzniess, lightheadedness, my ears will ring and I ll have a strong urge to lay down. My heart will beat fast and then slow at random then Palpitate, at unpredictable times such as laying down watching a movie, playing computer games etc but when laying down it is more a struggle to breathe, followed by chest and back discomfort and often with pressure at the same time my heart will be Palpitating. I ll have days where this happens and I can t seem to be able to concentrate on anything and my boyfriend noticed that my circulation has been bad such as freezing and blue fingers and toes as well as the area around my mouth turns blue. I find it hard to talk as well for I can t seem to get enough air even saying simple things. I was never really a smoker but I had smoked for about a month (a pack which I didn t finish) before these symptoms became more noticeable, I had a blood test and it was revealed that I was quite Anemic, I am on an iron supplement and my periods have always been very light. I would go on ignoring these symptoms but they ve been persistent and i m getting impatient. Can you tell me if i m just being silly or should I be worried? P.S. I m not sure if this is related, but i m constantly having to pee in the middle of the night which is more bothersome than anything. I have been checked for diabetes and it came up normal. I do not drink alot of beverages during late night, I only drink water during the day and that s it, though if I drink more in a day the more likely I am get up more often in the night. Thank you for your time, Olivia. ( YYYY@YYYY )","Doctor":"Hi, Olivia; thanks for the query & its indeed sad to know that you are suffering from so many symptoms without any diagnosis or relief from medications. Based on your age (18 years only) & so many investigations till date which were normal (apart from reduced hemoglobin); you are suffering from a disorder known as Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) which is characterized by pervasive ever encompassing anxiety/worries about day to day trivial things accompanied by multiple non specific physical symptoms like palpitations, racing heart, choking sensations, dry mouth, blurring vision, giddiness, fainting, urge to pass urine or stool multiple times! There is difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep, nightmares, constant feeling of muscle tension, inability to relax, irregular menses. Fortunately treatment of GAD is fairly simple. You need to take 6-9 months course of  medications like Fluoxetine, paroxetine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine based on your clinical profile & tolerability. Plus substitute these medications with adjunctive medications like etizolam, clonazepam, oxazepam, pregabalin etc. Also there is a very good but slightly underused medication by name Buspirone which takes a little longer (6-8 weeks) to show its beneficial effects but gives reliable potent relief! Also, supplement these medications with mindfulness based relaxation & counselling techniques offered by Psychiatrist & Psychologist. Just get a thyroid profile done to rule out hyperthyroidism which can mimic these symptoms. Contact your Psychiatrist or get back to me for further help.

My boyfriend takes care of his father during the day and works at night while his mother watches his father. This is taking a toll on my boyfriend’s health in many ways. Before the stroke, his father was a mean man who cheated on his mother and put my boyfriend down, not to mention gambled away 100,000 dollars in life savings. Since the stroke, the father is even worse. He constantly puts the family down and threatens to kill them. On Friday, my boyfriend said his dad threaten to kill him 4 times in the most horrible of ways. The dad has also physically hurt his mom and sister with his good hand. The sister does not want to take care of the father and goes off with her boyfriend, leaving the mom and my boyfriend to take care of him. The cops have been called numerous times and they and a lawyer have said that his mom should divorce his dad and turn him over to the state. His mom has not looked into doing anything. My boyfriend wants out so bad. He is depressed all the time, has gained weight, and barely gets any sleep. The family feels hopeless and every time my boyfriend brings up that he wants to move in with me and start a life, his family thinks he is a horrible person. He has given up 3 years of his life and contributed to the family s finances while the sister has done nothing and the mom wants to be a victimized wife. My boyfriend does not know what to do and neither do I. What can be done? The family doesn t have much money to put him in a home but they shouldn t be subjected to the Dad s cruelty. Where can we look for help?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. Lets look at this problem in 2 parts; part 1 is your boyfriends dad being an abusive kind of person even prior to episode of stroke suggesting a personality pattern (antisocial personality disorder possibly) part 2 being the recent bouts of physical & verbal abuses after having suffered from stroke. Depending upon the location of brain affected by stroke; stroke is known to cause certain behavioral & personality changes like aggression, depression, excessive unprovoked laughter or crying spells etc. These changes can be ameliorated to a certain extent by use of psychotropic drugs like escitalopram, quetiapine etc. You should consult a Neurologist & a Neuropsychiatrist for proper assessment & drug prescription. Hope this helpsGood Luck"},{"Patient":"I have been on many SSRI s over the past 26 yrs. I seem to develop a resistance to them after varying lengths of time. When this has happened, my psychiatrist switches me to another drug or adds a drug. While on medication last year I had a depressive episode, possibly triggered by my son & his family moving overseas. I was given Fetzima in addition to buproprion, which I have been on constantly for many years. I have never felt completely better since this episode. This weekend it reach crisis stage, inability to get out of bed, constant crying and for the first time, suicide ideation. Then I began reading about tardive dysphoria which made me feel even more hopeless. It seems with medication I will continue to get worse but without medication, I will surely get worse. Is it hopeless?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. Its very sad to know that you are still not able to recover despite treatment for depression. In a sizable number of patients (almost 33%) trials with many drugs or simply drugs alone dont seem to work. In your case you seem to have received trials of SSRI & 1 trial of SNRI (Fetzima/levomilnacipran) (I am assuming that you received adequate doses of each drug for minimum 6-8 weeks & still inadequate symptom relief). Hence, depending on your clinical profile drugs like amytryptyline, nortryptyline, prothiaden, agomelatine (novel drug with unique mechanism of action) can be tried or agumentation of your current drug regimen with low dose atypical antipsychotic agents like quetiapine, aripirazole, amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone or a trial of drugs like pregabalin, modafinil (to help you with fatigue related symptoms) thyroid hormone (T3/T4), lithium etc. in addition to your current antidepressant regimen can also be a good alternative. Lastly doing daily physical exercise, yoga-pranayama, regular sleeping patterns, avoiding excessive alcohol, caffeine, other substance of abuse (cannabis, heroin etc.) and taking help of psychotherapy/counselling techniques from a psychologist like cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), mindfulness based relaxation/therapies can also help you out. Dont loose hope. Be patient, this cloud of depression shall definitely subsideHope this helps Good Luck"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor,i have pblm like anxiety on my future due to iam not professional & no permanent job. bec'z of this my fingers are shaking while writing, after consulting doctor iam using rexipra 5(not continuosly), even though i have same problem still on (hand & finger shaking while writing in front of others tooo much). pls. advice me what to do?thanks.mohammed","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

I ve had depression for as long as I can remember and have been treated with practically all SSRI/SNRI medications. I recently fell into the worse depression and anxiety of my life a few months ago. Voluntarily entered a crisis stabilization center for 30 days. While there, I was diagnosed with GAD, SAD, Major Depressive Disordder, and PTSD. Upon diagnosis I was prescribed Zoloft 75 mg, Trazodone 50 mg, and vistiral 25 mg PRN. I started these 3 new medications June 2nd and go for my first follow up appointment since leaving the treatment center on Monday. The vistiral is doing absolutely nothing for my anxiety, I ve been prescribed Klonopin in the past from my GP and would like to go back on that, but don t want to seem like Drug Seeker . Is there a way I should go about asking for it? I ve never had any abuse with medications in the past, but sadly there is a stigma out there for Benzos. My symptoms are by far worse then when I started these 3 new medications. I am lethargic, extremely anxious to the point that I can barely leave my house or go to job interviews, extremely tired, and overall have NO motivation.

He is more snappy, more perfectionistic (or OCD), and has more trouble focusing than normal, some of the signs that preceded his last breakdown.

I am now currently in a very loving relationship and have been for 6 months, but sexually we aren t seeing eye to eye and have major issues. I do have desire just not as often as he d like and when I feel pressured to have sex with him I completely shut down. He understands my past and I m doing my best to overcome those hurdles, but I feel like I am losing his interests because I can t perform sexually as he d like. Any words of encouragement or advise would be most helpful. And Yes I did try therapy, but all I got out of that was the therapist telling me I m lesbian and a feeling that I was violated in a sexual way.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

You have problems of Panic disorder and Depression and are improving a little bit with medicines. But you are facing side effects like Sexual Dysfunction and jerks in muscles. See paroxetine is a safe drug and it can be taken for long periods of time without any significant risk of complications. But sexual side effects may cause significant distress.

You were on 40 mg per day and the dose halved in a week and then stopped in next one week. Abrupt stoppage of drug over just two weeks has caused the withdrawal syndrome.

Due to withdrawal syndrome the doctors have advised to start medicine again with low dose of 10 mg per day. This is a good option to prevent more withdrawal symptoms. If you don't want to take medicine then you can stop the medicine when your withdrawal symptoms improve. Hope this helps you.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Firstly this is not a joke.

However, my withdrawal symptoms are as strong as ever, ie extreme lightheadedness, crying spells, auditory hallucinations, joint pain and weakness, neasea, etc. Do you have any suggestions, perhaps natural, that would help ease these symptoms?","Doctor":"Hello Vibryd or vilazodone is a new serotonergic anti-depressant drug. It has good results but like other serotonergic drugs it can cause withdrawal syndrome if discontinued abruptly after prolonged use. You were taking 40 mg per day and then stopped to take since last 2 weeks which is precipitating the withdrawal symptoms. The withdrawal syndrome is the main reason for headache, crying spells, pains, nausea etc. As per my opinion visit a Psychiatrist for better treatment. You can take OTC analgesics for relief of pain and headache. Take plenty of water. Eat foods rich in carbohydrates. Gradual tapering of doses over 4-6 weeks don't cause withdrawal syndrome. You can start taking 20 mg per day for next 4 weeks and then take the medicines of 20 mg every alternate day for next 2 weeks and then stop taking medicine.

I do have the copper coil, which I've had for just over a year now, and was planning to have it removed and continue with the pill but i don't know if either of them are making me worse. i also have a history of kidney problems, having one kidney removed in 2012. any kind of advice or help would be greatly appreciated!thanks sophie","Doctor":"Hello welcome to Health Care MagicCommonly used contraceptive pills may aggravate depressive symptoms, and can also cause mood swings and precipitation of panic attacks. In susceptible individuals or in individuals with pre existing depression risk is high. Insomnia may be a part of anxiety or may be due to hormonal changes. If you are having serious anxiety attacks consider consulting a psychiatrist. Medicines like SSRIs and SNRIs are commonly used. Even a lot of medicines cause improvement in menstrual symptoms also. To improve your relationship with boyfriend and family you can consult a psychologist for relationship counselling.Hope this helps you, thanks"},{"Patient":"I was put on Adderall in Sept.2013 since I have always had the Major Depressive Disorder(DSM) I have tried ALL the anti depression medications on the market with the last one(s) being 300 mg Wellbutrin and 20 mg Prozac. I stopped both of these when I started taking Adderall 10 mg twice daily. Wow, did it make a difference. I was so much more motivated and focused on getting work done, up until late December when I no longer had that boost of energy. I saw my doctor again this month (February) and he added on Lexapro 10mg once daily with 30 mg of Adderall(15mg morning, 15 mg early afternoon). As of date, I have not noticed any change and feel like doing nothing but lay down and rest/sleep. I would like to try and go on Wellbutrin again. Do you think that 300mg Wellbutrin once daily, 20 mg Adderall twice daily, and Lexapro 10 mg once daily would be a safe and working combination? Also, what time daily should I take the medication? I am going to speak to my doctor about this also but wanted to see what your recommendation would be?  Thanks, Richard","Doctor":"Thanks for asking, Adderall is as such not an anti-depressant medicine but it helps to improve mood and also attention span which can be utilised in depressive disorders. Wellbutrin (Bupropion) and Lexapro (Escitalopram) are both good anti-depressant drugs which will help in improvement in depressive symptoms. Now coming to your queries-Yes taking wellbutrin, adderall and lexapro is safe and will not have serious risk.As per my opinion Lexapro and Adderall can be taken in morning time and you can take wellbutrin in evening as it may cause a little sedation. Hope this helps you,thanks"},{"Patient":"i have mental health problems  i have just self harmed i have also thought about suicide i have already done a suicide letter but i am really sceared,i had a police lady  with me last night cause i self harmed but i done it again and she comeing back 2 c me but really i dont think i can cope anymore","Doctor":"HelloI think you need to deal with the reason for suicidal thoughts.

I've had the same doctor for the length of time mentioned above; but I feel it's time to change physicians for a bunch of reasons. First off, it's a 2 hour transit time, there and back; so that in itself is a huge burden. Secondly, her office hours are during my work hours; so I always have to take time from work in order to see her. Lastly, she tends to forget things such as what scripts are due on which days: and required details on the scripts like the quantity and her signature. By doing this, I will have to return to her office to get a new script; which costs me time and money that I do not have.Furthermore, I get the feeling like I'm inconveniencing her when I have to contact her about these situations. It wasn't like this in the beginning; which is why I endured the transit times and her office hours. Prior to taking Adderall and Vyvanse, I did try other medications; but nothing worked. I don't want to go through a song and a dance when seeing a new doctor; so I guess my question would be how I should I approach the new doctor about taking Adderall and Vyvanse: and how I should go about screening doctors in my search.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

I take sertraline 50 mg once daily, and clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily. But I recently ran out of my medication, I have no insurance, no transportation, very low income, and I feel lost and have no idea what my next step is.","Doctor":"Dear young man,First of all let me assure you, it is treatable and curable with the effective support of a Psychiatrist, Psychologist and  your unconditional effort.In this platform, you need to be bit more explicit, then only the professionals available can effectively support you.Whatever you mentioned here are the classic symptoms of anxiety. To put it in right way, anxiety is generated from the animal instinct of \\"FIGHT or FLIGHT\\". That is when we see, hear, feel, or think of something dangerous, we feel anxious either to handle it(FIGHT) or to get out of it(FLIGHT). An ultimate decision is taken based on the situation in hand+ the past experiences you had confronted. Without anxiety to a certain level, you will not be able to adjust with the life or to perform well in any sphere of life. Be it in an appearing of exam, reaching on time for an interview, catching the bus or train for a journey etc. If you are not anxious, you will be missing out many opportunities. Even while crossing a road on a busy street, you should have an anxiety to keep you away from the speeding vehicles. For a person to be ambitious, anxiety is the good stimulator.In the normal course of life, we eat something and forget what we had in the square meal. The digestive system has certain juices(Chemicals) which process the food in the stomach and whatever needed is kept and remaining waste is disposed. In the same fashion, we have some chemicals (You need not know the scientific names of it) in the brain which help us to manifest appropriate emotions in any given situation.Fear or anxiety are all such emotions. You can see, you are happy in a friend's wedding ceremony or in achieving something. In the same way, you feel sad, when you are attending a funeral. It will be awkward if you feel sad in a happy situation or feel happy in a situation warranting gloom. This is the way the chemical in the brain balances and functions.Like a balance, when both the sides of it are maintaining the same weight, you are satisfied to buy something. The same is the case with all living beings generally.The situations of life are such that they always try to test your potential. It is like teaching you everything and making you ready for the final test by giving you periodical, slip or surprise tests.A basic understanding of the situations is very much needed in this point of time.As I mentioned earlier, the chemical balancing in the brain can be looked after by a Psychiatrist by the medicines. The medicines you are taking should be able to help you in balancing the chemicals.Consult the Psychiatrist and explain your concerns to him. He may increase the dosage at his discretion.The services of the Psychologist will be beneficial in letting you know of your personality traits positive or negative by taking a simple yet comprehensive peronality and anxiety tests. By this you can come to know what type of personality you are and what are the changes you need to incorporate in your personality to be a fully functional person. The anxiety can be easily reduced by having an understanding and a modification in the behavioural changes as counselled by the Psychologist based on your personality. Be ready for a change and consult the mental health professionals in town for a comprehensive treatment plan. It is always cost effective. You need not incur huge expenditure for this.Get well soon,Dr Rajesh Thottinal KalamRehabilitation Psychologist from India"},{"Patient":"I don t know what s wrong with me, i feel like i can t trust anyone, i always feel tired, and i can t stand being home.

A hereditary element which gets triggered with the social interactions can also be a cause of the mental health problem.Just like the digestive enzymes in the stomach, we have some chemicals in the brain as well. These chemicals enable a person to deal with situations in hand. For example, you felt happy when your daughter scored a good result in her academics and now you are sad when you see her suffering. Both these happiness and sadness and other related emotions like anger and disgust etc are regulated by the chemicals in the brain.The medications prescribed by the Psychiatrist will work wonders when collaborated with the services of a Qualified Psychologist who can facilitate the resolution of the emotional issues as stated earlier through patient listening, interpreting and rendering therapeutic techniques for a behaviour and lifestyle modification.An unconditional support in all respects from persons significant in her life is the need of the hour now.Happy days ahead for you and family !Dr Rajesh Thottingal KalamRehabilitation Psychologist from india"},{"Patient":"I have panic disorder.

It cannot be due to bruise. The seminal vesiculitis, prostate inflammation or some testis inflammation are the common cause.You can take chymotrypsin and serratiopeptidase containing medicine for seven days. Brufen or paracetamol also can be prescribed. If pain and swelling persist with blood in semen than investigate with ultrasonography of testis, pelvis and abdomen for further work up. You can revert back with reports once done Hope I have answered your question.

A change in your lifestyle, i.e. taking up an exercise regime followed by relaxation technique in which you relax your body by taking deeper and deeper breath (Inhale and exhale). When you find yourself fully relaxed by the deeper breath, just bring the anxiety provoking situations to your mind and try to see each and every aspect you feel nervous or anxious.

Continue the relaxation technique and bringing the situations to mind twice or thrice a day even if you don't go for physical exercise.

If you are able to make your studies interesting and based on variable principle, your concentration level can be increased. Concentration comes only when you are interested in what you do. So please be passionate towards what you are doing or do only those things which you are interested in.

I suggest you not to worry much. OCD is a mental disorder of course, but that is not severe one. The cure to the OCD lies on your attitude towards the disorder and working with your psychologist and psychiatrist. Many researches and researchers confirm that medicines alone cannot cure mental disorders. Life style changes, change in thinking pattern, relaxation etc are as essential as medicines. Psychotherapy can help you changing your lifestyle and thinking patterns. Yoga and meditation help you to streamline your metabolism and neurological balance. Please consult a psychologist for further information. Cognitive Behavior Therapy is one way to address the issue along with logo therapy. In any case you should learn to ignore those obsessive thoughts, which is possible only if you distract yourself. Play games, write, read, do what ever, be busy. Slowly being busy becomes a habit.If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL.  Make sure that you include every minute details possible.

I suggest you not to worry much. You are suppose to refer to concentration and attention as two. Attention span for any adult is maximum 30 minutes.

If you are able to make your studies interesting and based on variable principle, your concentration level can be increased. Concentration comes only when you are interested in what you do.

Timely intervention can always ease the situation. The hearing of voices, mood swings and again in to composure for a limited span of time, all are classic symptoms of a treatable mental illness.

She has asthma, a rupture disc, she suffers migraine, she was also dickered to have a rapid heart rate. 2 months ago she suffered a grand maul seizure, never had seizures before. Because she was eating at the time she also choked and lost heartbeat and turned blue. My son in law did heimlech cleared her airway and chest compressions to get her breathing. By the time emts got there she was coming out of a 5 minute seizure. She has been married 10 years to all appearances even to her husband and our very close family happily. She has a 5 yr old daughter and has tried for 3 years to get pregnant. She was on all the fertililty drugs, thrown initial menopause twice to try to help. She finally gave up 2 months before seizure. She was put on topamax for the seizures and hopefully it would help migraines combined, this med made her short term memory horrible, she would have problems even finding the bathroom or recognizing people for a few minutes apron wakening, they switched her to keppra. Very shortly after that we noticed a change to the point that she asked her husband to leave, flames she hasn t loved him for 2 years, in the same night she had a male family friend move in as her new lover, she has very easily adapted to splitting time with her daughter, and this woman was totally involved before with this child. She has yet to shed a tear over her child or husband of 10 years and the family who cries over the total change in her. She has become callous to a point, and she used to cry easily to the telling of a sad story or in empathy of someones problem. We called her neurologist, she claims medicine did not cause change and just blows it off that she just is fine. She never knew her before the seizure. Is it the seizure or maybe medicine that has caused this complete change in our daughter? She feels nothing is different with her, so working with this is very difficult. Do you see any hope in this situation?","Doctor":"Hello,Topamax can be given for both migraine and seizures. But in some cases it can cause behavioural agitation or even flare up psychosis.I think divalproex would be a better option as its a broad spectrum anti-epileptic and is also useful for migraine prophylaxis.Thanks."},{"Patient":"\\"Hi Doc, This is suparna from calicut.

But the more i try to stop myself thinking about the song the harder it is, i dont want to go to the doctor because im afraid he will think im crazy and im sure im not. PLEASE HELP ASAP","Doctor":"Hello,First of all I would like you to relax and be calm with the assurance that you are not going crazy. There is nothing to be afraid of.I think you are facing the problem of Obssesive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in which an idea/impulse intrudes itself persistently and impelling into the person's conscious awareness. Obsessions or compulsions are undesired, unacceptable and uncontrollable, the person recognizes obsessions and compulsions to be absurd and irrational and feels a strong need to resist them.Musical obsessions are those in which patients experience repetitive phrases, tunes or complex musical pieces that originate inside the head. These are less common symptom of OCD.You need to start with some anti-obsessional medications like Fluoxetine. Your problem will resilve but it will take some time.Try to divert your mind whenever the particular song originates in your mind instead of trying to repeatedly stop that song.Hope this helps you.Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am having a great deal of weakness ..sugar was fine..blood pressure was fine and 02 level was 96-98...Very weak for two days Swooshing and very dizzy over the past 2 days and sweats real bad off and on at any time,confusion..I have other smaller symptoms such as very emotional..I am considering going to the care clinic somewhere tonight.","Doctor":"You are having anxiety disorder.It is easily treatable by tab mouth dissolving clonazepam.

I come from a gujarathi family but born and brought up in Maharashtra. I am writing to you to seek help for my brother and parents. My brother and parents are having a strained relationship. Brother is 31, married and works in US. Parents (mom aged 55 and dad aged 59) stay in Dhule, Maharahtra. Dad is a physician (M.D., M.R.C.P.) and mom is a housewife. Brother has developed a feeling since childhood that no matter what he does, his parents are never happy with his achievements and they donot love him. He says that they have always pointed out only the negatives in him and never ever appreciated any of his poistives. He recalls many trivial incidents from his schoollife to graduation to current, wherein he thinks his parents never appreciated his success. Also he feels that MomDad try to micro-manage things ( as they want every small thing to happen as they want only) and donot appreciate independent thinking. (Though I know that mom dad have always been very proud of his achievements. It s just that their way of expression was way different from what brother expected). After his marraige, there have difference between his wife and parents. Parents feel that their son should take their side. But brother does not feel that right. Mom Dad are of a very traditional outlook. And this might be also because of the kind of society thet live in. They think they are always right. They think that after going to US and after marraige, their son has changed a lot. They think that their son is arrogant and not matured to the level expected. So now the case is Mom Dad are sad that their only son is being good to them inspite of they having been do so much for him all life. And brother is sad because he feels his parents have never been happy with him inspite of all his efforts and he is now frustated by their behavior/expectations. The situation is not at all good for a healthy family. I know i should not interfere in these conflicts as that would just tear me apart. But having know both the sides, feel a moral responsibilty to try to solve situations. Though they always all tell me not to worry about these things. Hence i want you to help them sort out things.Can u help here? The problem is brother is here for diwali right now and is going back to US on 10th of this month. So there is not much time. Would it be possible for you to have some phone-discussions and email conversations with all of them individually or on conference call? thanks Roma","Doctor":"Hello roma,I agree that you face a very difficult situation within your family. Just to make the environment better, your parents as well your brother has to make efforts. Your parents should understand that their son is a grown uo now and has the capacity to take independent decisions. So they should try and not judge or interfere with him.On the other hand, your brother should also take pride in that his parents have worked for his success in life. They are his responsibility and he must work for their happiness.Hope the situation gets better.I would be pleased to help you further if i can in any way.Thanks."},{"Patient":"hi sir.,          i am  a student ,           age: 20/male           problem :                       i have a problem i.e                        i cannt be active ,i have memory power less ,if read everything i cannt able to execute in exam time............especially during exam time.,i have nervous problem .,how can i recover from it.,?plz help me.................................","Doctor":"Hello,The problem of low memory in students is basically due to lack of concentration and focus.Firstly you have to be physically active.

I didn t know the reasoning behind this but it frightened me enough to keep me up the rest of the night. I spent the entire night searching the internet for answers and came up with sleep apnea. Doing this research worried me even more thinking that I might fall asleep one night and stop breathing for too long. This raised my anxiety quite considerably and I didn t sleep well for the next 48 hours. Finally I went into the ER since I don t have a primary doctor or insurance and was told that I was fine and that I could be referred to a sleep study that could determine whether I had sleep apnea or not. I was not able to attend that study for lack of the financial means to do so but that was just the beginning. The gasping feeling never returned but something else set in. That initial situation made me very anxious about myself and my well being and I could not relax. I panicked on and off for the next few days and then suddenly ended up feeling a strange pressure in my head and ears. I tried to sleep it off one night but the chest tightness and weird sensation in my sinuses was too much to relax so I went to the ER for a second time. Blood tests came back normal as well as the second chest xray but when the Doctor checked my ears she saw that I had fluid behind my ear drums indicative of a viral infection which they termed Labyrinthitis . I was told that since it was viral and not bacterial that they could not give me any medication to attack the virus and that my body would recover on it s own. I was instructed to follow up with my primary Doctor which I don t have so finding a Doctor who is not booked up and that charges a fee that I can afford has also increased my anxiety since I ve yet to find one. Eventually I ended up in deep depression unlike anything I ve ever felt before. It was a helpless and hopeless feeling of despair that I couldn t shake off. This last around 4 days straight. At it s worst it made me not desire to continue living in my current physical and mental state which frightened me even more. I had no one to talk to about this and didn t want to be drugged up with anti depressants for fear of being dependent on them and also felt that God wouldn t approve of a secular treatment. I didn t eat or sleep for days on end and I became quite fatigued physically, mentally, spiritually and any other way possible. I still haven t been eating as much as I would normally and don t really have the desire to. I ve been feeling distant from my wife and sons like I ve forgotten how to love or have to remind myself that I love them. It s almost as if in the space of 2/3 days I changed from one person to someone completely different. Although the depression hasn t hit me as hard as it had for those 4 previous days I experienced it.... I still feel very down and detached.","Doctor":"HI..obstructive sleep apnoea can cause suffocation during sleep. a polysomnography should be done...beside to relieve your anxity you may take tab paroxetine 12.5mg or any SSRI along with benzodiazepines like clonazepam 0.5mg at night."},{"Patient":"Hi I am 28 year old and have gone back to study, I am on holidays at the moment and I seem to have no motivation or drive to do anything.

I m not sure if it s just because I m a teenager and it s due to the recent starting of the school year and the stress is getting to me, or if it s something else. I ve been considering, with much regret, a plan to try and kill both of my parents. Neither do drugs or anything of the sorts. One thing for sure is that my mother s personality pisses me off to the point where I just want to murder her on the spot, I have no idea what happened to me and how I got to this stage. I m not sure about my dead, maybe I m a psychopath? Either way these tendencies don t want to stop. I ve always been someone who likes the rush of anger, and I ve always wanted to get into a fight, or a car crash. I m not really sure what is going inside me but I want to know if it really needs help or not. I wanted to try boxing to try and relieve some some of the stress but my mom adamantly believes that there is nothing wrong me. While I know that parents refuse to acknowledge that there is a possibility that something is wrong with their child, I d really just wish she d take me to a psychologist for me to talk to, after all isn t that what parents should do when their kid asks? And another thing, just thinking about this and writing it down gets me emotional. I want to cry, I WANT to, and it bothers me. I want to cry while putting a bullet through everyone s head.

I can understand what you must be going through. Anxiety is a condition where person has increased heartbeats, increased pulse, sweating, tremors, restlessness, feeling that something bad is going to happen or he/she is going to die etc. All these symptoms are due to increased autonomous nervous system activity. As I have already explained that in anxiety states there is increased heart beats and palpitations. Anxiety states don't lead to reduced heart beats. In your case the reduction in heart rate may be due to Atenolol. Atenolol is known to reduce the heart rate. Also feeling of dizziness after getting up may be due to a condition called as postural hypotension wherein there is reduction in blood pressure when person gets up from sleeping position. This again is caused by Atenolol."},{"Patient":"My boyfriend has the following symptoms and he is freaking out, I don't think it's a big deal.

I am also on 60 mcg of cymbalta as well. Neither of these medications are new.","Doctor":"Several things can cause severe mood swings, especially thyroid problems. I strongly recommend that you see both a medical doctor and a qualified mental health professional and that both these individuals communicate their findings to each other. Even if you see a psychiatrist, who is a medical doctor, he or she should communicate with your medical doctor about your thyroid issue so that you know that the medications you are taking have no negative interactive side effects. If you are currently not seeing a mental health specialist, then I strongly recommend that you see one. It does not appear that the Cymbalta you are taking is helping you so it appears that psychotherapy is warranted, especially if your mood swings are really negatively affecting your ability to function optimally."},{"Patient":"I lost my father and best friend at the same time that a new lover became my best friend. Now she has left (after 10 years) and the grief is worse than it seems it should be since it was mutual. Could I be finally facing the grief of losing my father which I didn t seem to have a difficult time dealing with 10 years ago? Do you know of any topical books on such a subject?","Doctor":"You have been through a lot of losses in your life. Grieving takes different lengths of time and is a very individualistic experience; there is no time limit in which the grief is \\"over.\\" It may very well be that the grief you are experiencing now is much worse because you did not fully grieve over the loss of  your father and best friend 10 years ago. The best thing is to not place any judgment on your feelings, and let yourself be okay with grieving your first two losses at this juncture. Some books on grieving are: How to Go On Living When Someone You Love Dies by Therese Rando, Ph.D., and Honoring Grief: Creating a Space to Let yourself Heal by Alexandra Kennedy."},{"Patient":"Hi;     I believe I have obsessive love disorder.........I fell in love with a woman who is half my age , is married and has 3 young children.

Please help me if you can.","Doctor":"It sounds like you are conflicted about your relationship with this married woman, given that you too, are married. Typically, if you are not getting your needs met in your current marital dyad, then you will tend to stray and get your needs met elsewhere. It would appear that your emotional, sexual, or other needs are currently not being met with your wife. If you are this \\"obsessive\\" with this woman, it would appear that you have been obsessive in other areas of  your life or with other women, perhaps even with your wife at one point. At any rate, your situation sounds very complex and it is difficult to assist you without knowing which aspect of it you want assistance with. It is unclear if you want to terminate the relationship with the other woman, and strengthen your relationship with your wife, or keep things as they are. It would appear that it would be difficult to maintain both relationships and have both be satisfying, given that you are so obsessed with the other woman.

I am married,from many years i am suffering problem of fear, anxiety,very less confidence etc. Now a day i am getting  so angry for every minor things u can say hyper. I can't handle my day to day life work,problem.even lot of problems are created in my married life because of my angriness. I can't understand what happened exactly with me.I don't wish to do anything.i want to sit down calmly.whole day lots of things are going on in my mind.some time i wish that i will commit suicide.My parents ,husband my friends also tells me that you are so hyper,always getting angry.I also suffer  problem while taking decision .please help me.Regards,Harsha","Doctor":"Dear Harsha,It sounds like you have been suffering a long time and I commend you in seeking help. It sounds like your symptoms have seriously negatively impacted your ability to function optimally. Briefly, here is the emotion cycle: how you think, leads to how  you feel, which leads to how you act, or think>feel>do. In order to feel better, feel less angry, sad, irritable, etc., you can change the way you think, or change your behavior--what you do. Changing the way you think would be like being grateful for what is going right in your life, thinking positive thoughts, focusing on the things you do right. Like you can tell yourself: \\"I do things well. I am a good person. I have a lot of patience. This isn't really that big a deal, so I don't have to get so angry.\\" Even if you don't believe these things, you can train your mind to think this way, which will help you to feel less angry or irritable or bad about yourself. The other way of intervening is through changing your behavior, like taking a time out before responding, exercising, eating healthy, sleeping enough, being good to yourself, so that you can feel better. Doing very slow deep breathing will also help relax you, lower your blood pressure, and decrease your anxiety and anger--breathing very slowly in, hold your breath for two seconds, then breath very slowly out, for at least five minutes three times a day. You may need to build up to that much. I strongly recommend that you obtain a full medical exam to rule out any physical problem that may be impacting your symptoms. If you have no medical issues, then I strongly recommend that you further seek treatment with a psychologist or other therapist to address your anger, irritability, low self-esteem, and suicidal thoughts. This person can also recommend whether or not you would be a good candidate for medications. Good luck to you."},{"Patient":"Hi, my name is Niesha. I'm 14 and my mother passed away 9 months ago. Lately, I have been very sad and depressed. The only tings that make me happy anymore are my boyfriend and school. The rest of the time, I feel like there is nothing I can do to feel like the normal excited, funny me again. What can I do to feel like myself?","Doctor":"Hello Niesha. You are very young and I am glad that you have reached out. You are grieving the loss of your mother, which is normal. Grieving can take any amount of time, and grieving is a very individualistic experience. It takes different lengths of time to get over the death of a very close person. One of the best things you can do is to be very good to yourself. Try to eat healthy, get enough sleep, and spend time with people and things that you can enjoy. Be okay with as long amount of time to grieve, no matter what anyone tells you. You need to know it's okay to feel sad after losing such an important figure in your life. Take note and praise yourself for the things that you do right and do well, like doing well in school. Praise yourself and reward yourself for a job well done.If your ability to function in school worsens, like your grades start to fall, you have trouble concentrating, then I would consider seeing a psychologist or other therapist for additional help. Journaling or talking to someone are two really good ways to help you feel better. A therapist can also suggest other things to help you cope better. For now, just be very good to yourself and be okay with the time it takes you to grieve. Good luck to you and take care."},{"Patient":"sir m name is suresh iam 25 old,sir one of testis is some what swollen,but i do not feel any pain,i had habbit of hand pumping for past six years.recently i found that,my semen is thick only a small amont.i was so worried about thise, give me your kind suggestion.","Doctor":"Hi, There will always be some difference from one testis to another.

There are quite a many possibilities of change in attitude and lower work performance in an adolescent. Most important and worrisome are drug dependence (alcohol, smoking etc.) and mood swings (ups and downs).As a parent, you would have to be supportive and friendly towards him and at the same time give him his personal space because adolescents tend to trust their friends most in this age. Try to talk to his friends and gather information if anything is worrying him.

When he was young he had compulsions to complete acts or something bad would happen . Even now, when taking sips of water sometimes something doesn t feel right and he will have to repeat the act until it feels okay . He admitted to having unwanted sexual thoughts earlier in life. A few years before we met he was viewing porn regularly and started using prostitutes. He admitted to having cheated on me in order to have sex. We went to counseling and he is committed to the relationship, and states he has never turned back to old behavior. He made an agreement in front of the counselor that if he watches porn or has sex with a prostitue (or other) he must tell me within two hours. However, when we are in public he has a constant looking problem . It has disturbed me to the point that complete healing (from the cheating and other behaviors) can t take place. I am beside myself. I have told him I think it is related to the OCD, but he claims he is not even aware of it. Other times he says if he is diligent of being aware of looking in every moment he can control it, but any distraction will make him forget and go right back to it. It is sad to him because he feels that no matter how well he does there will always be something I am not happy with, and he really has worked hard to deal with his compulsions. The problem for me is that I have started to dread going places with him. We both like to go to the gym, and to travel, and I am losing my joy in doing so because of the constant, repeated glances at other women. I explained it might be normal to look at beautiful people, but many, continual glances are not normal (and not respectful to me).

Then you started worrying that the symptom is coming again and again and expect it. Body brings it again as you are expecting it. You become worried and so on. That is obsession in simple terms.

I work in the computer dept. and I have been doing this since January 2009.  I get pay to sit on the computer chair, do homework, play games on the Internet, go on Facebook, etc.  I also help students with problems on the computer or printers, and sometimes help them with their homework assignment.  During winter/summer season; set up new computers, replace the old computers, put them in the package, and send them to other schools in the area.  Once in awhile, I would clean ALL the computer labs.  It may seem like an easy job, but it gets old very fast.  These computer chairs really do hurt my neck and back.  At first, I loved my job and I enjoyed working with my co workers (now, they are former co workers).  And now, I hate my job! I don’t care for my new co workers.  I just got my hours cut, my paycheck is barely enough to pay for my 200 car payment and 80 car insurance.  I am depressed 24/7 because of my job! It’s so dreading to wake up at 5:40 in the morning and drive 40 miles to work.  On the bright side, next month, I will be transferring to an online university school.  That means; I will have to quit my job once I transfer.  Once you either transfer or graduate, you can no longer work for the school.  The only time I am really happy is when I am at home or in class (not working, of course).  I know I should be thankful that I have a job and all.  I do try to make the best of it, really I do, but I just can’t! This morning at my job, I just wanted to cry for no reason! I think a lot of has to do with frustration, maybe? Next minute, I am happy and then I am sad.  I always tell people it’s my once a month thing going on; I only say that because I don’t want people to know it’s my job that’s doing this to me.  I don’t recall the last time I had a “good day” at work.  After I come home from work, I am very tired and lazy.  This past summer, I was working 2 days a week and I wanted to take advantage of working out, while I had the free time.  Then, I had to work 4 days a week and I probably gained 20lbs, if not more.  I can eat at work but I don’t have the time and when I would come home, I would eat something (unhealthy, of course).  Then I would get hungry later on at night and then I would eat again.  On weekends, I would be too tired from work, doing chores around the house, or doing homework and I don’t have time to work out.  Do you really think my job is killing me? Or am I feeling sorry to myself because of my horrible job?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. I sincerely opine the job is not killing you but you are killing self. You must understand that a person should be passionate towards his job. Job never means pay package or comfort, but includes them also. First priority is always passion. People build career around their field of interest. You will learn more only when you are passionate. So many people across the globe do routine boring jobs, but few gets irritated, that is because they find entertainment in between and that happens because they love their career. For you, you should introspect, change your job after knowing wht is your passionate career.If you still need my help, please describe the whole problem in detail and post a direct question to me.

I've researched online and I am almost convinced but i think i need an expert opinion. He suffers from extream depression and has terrible mood swings that can occur at almost any time. I've had to talk him down from a suicide attempt twice in the last 3 to 4 months. He feels extreamly agitated and hopless, and is constantly anxious. He has what looks like panic attacks and he is also has trouble sleeping most nights. His anger causes him to act out and snap and yell at people. Earlier this month he flipped off the dean to our school! His behavior is unpredictable and quite scary. He used to cut and burn himself, but i've managed to get him to stop that, and he still occasionally abuses Marijunana, but not as much as he did at one point. his parents are in the dark about his problems and are not very involved with him. He's afraid to confront them about anything, because they do not see eye to eye. I'm concurned and frightened, but I am also, only 16(almost 17).

The disease was under control till Sept, 2010. But now it has relapsed and the doctor has changed the salt (Serenace 3 mg) and till date it could not be controlled. It has been confirmed by AIIMS, Delhi. Now, I have some queries regarding this : 1. Whether it is curable. 2. Is there any test for the disease. 3. Whether you advise to visit your hospital. AK Goswami 11A, Srijan Aptt B-9/8, Sector-62 Noida","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to healthcaremagic.1st of all ,let me give you some information about schizophrenia. According to DSM IV TR , schizophrenia has 5 subtypes and paranoid schizophrenia(schiz) is one of them. In paranoid schiz ,there are hallucinations and delusions prominently as chief complaints.Schizophrenia occurs due to biological reasons especially involvement of dopaminergic neurotransmitter pathway.certain brain structures also involved specially basal ganglia.so schizophrenia is also like other physical illness where brain is involved and other psychosocial factors make impact over illness and its prognosis. Unfortunately ,there are no any specific test yet to make certain the diagnosis of schizophrenia but a good psychiatrist can diagnose the disease by using DSM OR ICD , classical diagnostic systems present for psychiatric disorders.schizophrenia has long term remitting and relapsing course. Paranoid schiz has particularly good prognosis than other type of schiz. Patient may need to take very long term medications. Sometimes if patient become defaulter for treatment then its possible that in future ,that molecule may not work.illness gets worsened after stopping medicines so its always better to continue the medicines for long run on which patient is stable. There are many drugs and even ECT ,which can control the disease.in general population per say ,100 people suffering from schiz then 33 gets completely alright ,33 will have few symptoms but at quiet manageable level and rest not gonna improve.in your case ,your wife got almost improved in past for 7 years ,that itself shows very good prognostic factor.so there are every possible chance of getting almost improved again.

Is it curable ?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to healthcaremagicYou did not have mention any clinical features so its not possible exactly to tell which kind of illness he is suffering from.but as per your given history ,he has all psychotic symptoms within these 15 days only with panic attacks. What exactly happened before illness that also you haven't mentioned.It may be provisionally brief psychotic disorder or acute stress disorder and in very less chances ,adjustment disorder.Most probably with the limited data you provided ,it's mostly brief psychotic disorder. If it is then all symptoms will go away within 30 days. Very few patients have persistent symptoms and later they may be diagnosed as schizophrenia. If its brief psychotic disorder then he will be ok on medicines.may doctor ask to take medicines for bit long likely 3 to 6 months.Very rarely ,severe panic attacks may give impression that patient is going crazy. Very vague symptoms may present.It needs more details for exact prognostic prediction.Hope I have answered your query,"},{"Patient":"hi.....i usually feel that whenwver i m leaving somwhere i again and agai check my pouch that i have put the money inside and i count it toooo even i know it that i have myself put thee money inside......simlarly i keep on checking wether i have locked the room or not even when i m sure that i myself have locked it.......","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to healthcaremagic.You have not mentioned your problems in details here.you stated that you have habit to check the things like locked door or wallet etc. But you haven't mentioned how many times you have to check it.

Prodep is Fluoxetine which is an anti-depressant medication. Anti-depressant medications should be continued for few months even after the patient feels alright in order to prevent any relapse or recurrence of symptoms. Her having pain in wrist might be a result of discontinuation effect of fluoxetine.

My mom has shown trends of possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, or any other brain related disease. The deep sleep kind of situation has been less frequent in the last 6-7 months. Before that, it happened 8-9 times (3-4 days deep sleep each time) in 8- 9 months (from May’10 to Jan’11) and each time serum ammonia level was found higher than normal level. She has been on diet for the last 10 months which is devoid of any animal protein, except 5-6 days where she had a piece of fish or meat. She has been taking lentils, but that too rarely. She is having medicine only for her diabetic condition and it is controlled. In the 8-9 months it has been within 80-110(fasting). She has been a psychiatric patient (schizophrenia) where the symptom has been episodic (once in 2 years or in 3 years). She talks all the time, screams at everyone, does not trust anyone and sleeps very less. She has been taking medicines for this whenever this happened earlier (her medicines include- SUNPRIZING/LITHOSUN, CHLORPROMAZINE ETC). Whenever the symptom receded, she did not take medicine anymore. And with the medicines, she recovered from the schizophrenia symptom within a month or sometimes in lesser time. The problem now is that she has started showing strong schizophrenic symptoms like earlier times; it started around 40 days back. She was taken to the psychiatrist who has been seeing for the last 15 years. I told him about her liver condition and the she has dementia. He has prescribed ‘QUTITIN 100 & LOPEZ 2’. After having Lopez 2 she was not being able to move and do her own things. I informed the doctor, he stopped LOPEZ 2. Now she is only having QUTITIN 100, for the last 2-3 days. The schizophrenic symptoms have not receded, but its bit less (it has only been 5-6 days). The concern that I have is that QUTITIN 100, in its side effect affects liver, and elevates TRANSAMINES. I’m concerned that this might again lead to the deep sleep condition. But at the same time her schizophrenic condition needs help. Please let me know if there is an alternative.","Doctor":"Haloperidol is a classical old drug known to be safer in patients with liver problems.

Both these conditions can lead to depression and lethargy.Treatment with anti-depressant drugs like escitalopram or sertraline would be safe and effective.

The symptoms of sleep disturbance, crying, feeling worthless and lethargic are all symptoms of depression. Since she has a history of self harm, I would be alert this time around too and would really consider getting her into treatment at the earliest.As a friend, you should really motivate her to seek a psychiatric consultation as well as open herself up to her parents. Delaying it can only worsen the condition. Treatment with anti-depressant drugs like escitalopram would enable  her to come out of this misery. In addition, she would be needing to express her emotions constantly which as a friend you can help her do.

So me and her looked for a other way and it said there is foods, and she said she will be willing to try. I agreed because i just want her to feel better and not be depressed any longer? We do have a physicist but i dont know what i say to her? My question i want to ask you is Can a minor a 14 year old get a medical marijuana card with my supervision and permissions? Can i the mother get in trouble by asking? I really need a answer thank you","Doctor":"hi Blanca, I appreciate your concern towards your daughter. The fact is medical marijuana has not been vigorously scientifically studied. The effects on respiratory tracts with smoking will be unavoidable.For depression and anxiety there are different groups of medicines. which drug had she been and what exactly you mean by \\"sickness with antidepresaants\\"? If you detail upon this, I could help you in choosing a better antipsychotic for her.Also many psychotherapies have been prooved to be beneficial and helps a lot of kids like yours. You can get appointment with  a psychologist too."},{"Patient":"srinivas chakravarthy:::HI, I am a male, 37 year old, married and working. I have had issues on and off with my work pver the last 11 years. After some analysis, I feel that I am suffering from Passive Aggressive behaviour. Childhood Had an over protective mother (adopted) who ensured that there is no dialogue regarding any issue at home. She (was later developed with some disorders herself) would brush me away loudly without an opportunity to negotiate my case. I developed my defense mechanism as not arguing (negotiating) and sulking as the only option to get my way. Education I have done my engineering and MBA from premier institutes in the country though was never very good at acads (in terms of academic performance during the course of my education). Work I have changed 5 jobs over the last 11 years. I perform very well when I have sufficient freedom to do my work. I am driven by opportunities to display cerativity in problem solving and organization. My performance is very poor under aggressive supervisors or situations where I have less freedom (micro managed, being told what needs to be done). I also develop a deep sense of anger that lingers on in these circumstances. This adversely impacts my productivity as well as leads me to take emotional decisions. Personal life I have also faced anxiety attack and went through a phase of extremely low self confidence for a period of 4 to 5 years. This was preceded by sustained stress over a period of about 2 to 3 years due to unhappy job and strained family situation. During this phase, I had doubts regarding my ability to manage a job and take up normal assignments (even meetings with clients etc.). I have been able to come out of it partly due to the easing out of stress situation at home and my ability to push the limits of my fear. While I went through a rough marriage which led to my stress fatigue situation mentioned above, I srinivas chakravarthy::: currently have a very supportive spouse and lead a very happy family life(2 children). I currently have comfortable financial situation. Issue I am unable to work under aggressive authority figures. Under such circumstances, I develop thoughts that I am being victimised and under appreciated (though on closer scrutiny, my performance levels are poor). With aggressive people, I usually am not able to defend myself effectively and apologise frequently (even if I am not at a fault). In such circumstances, I have a sense of anger at being wronged which clouds my objectivity of the situation. Solution Will wait for you suggestion though my perception is that I need help with my passive aggressive nature and support to improve upon my assertiveness skills.","Doctor":"Yes you are right in identifying your problem to some extent. To be accurate, I would call it problem with authority rather than passive aggressive behaviour. In passive aggression, to show aggression towards object of aggression which may be your boss, you actually do your work extensively. You are right in saying that you need  to be assertive. Start saying no and defending yourself when you are right. A psychiatrist or a psychologist could help you with some sessions."},{"Patient":"So I'm 19, I smoked spice (synthetic marijuana-- Possibly mind-altering and dangerous. But this was the only time I've done it.) on September, had a panic attack, and after a week I felt normal. I smoked actual marijuana early this month (the 9th) and suddenly I went through a huge panic phase where I had lost of appetite, nausea, constant anxiety, derealization, loss of concentration, loss of interest in things that I like, and I couldn't go to school or work because I would panic. Finally I overcame my fear in 2 weeks (Actually hit the second week from when I smoked the marijuana today) and my appetite came back, and I'm no longer afraid to be at work or school. My doctor gave prescribed me 12 Ativans (0.5 MG) ever 6 hours last Friday, but by Tuesday I no longer required them, and in truth only ended up taking 2 overall.However, now I have this problem with concentration. When people talk to me while I'm focusing on TV or computer all I hear is words and I don't end up hearing what they say. When focusing on stringing up lights for Christmas and I'm untangling them, I kind of get confused at what I'm looking at and it gets a little more difficult to untangle them.I'm not sure whether or not to say this is a result of my anxiety, or if I'm going crazy from something else! My doctor hasn't actually given me a name for what I'm going through (infact, he says I'm probably just worrying myself sick). I'm scared I have some kind of cognitive disorder or something. This morning I freaked out because I was afraid I was becoming Schizophrenic, but now I kind of doubt that because I don't have any serious symptoms that would reflect that.Summary:After 2 weeks I've gotten over nearly all none cognitive symptoms. I have an appetite, I'm not longer nauseated, I only get anxious when I think about possible disorders. However, my cognitive abilities are pretty bad. Am I getting better? Was this whole thing only a phase? Is this a result of my panic attack in September and the marijuana I did in November? And, Will my cognitive abilities return to normal? Am I dealing with some kind of anxiety disorder, or something more serious?Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi,Please do not worry. You are likely to regain all your lost abilities with time. But worrying will just delay your recovery. just wait for a few more weeks and see how things are.

In fact, Dementia is a slowly progressive illness, where the deterioration happens very gradually.

I have been seeing drs for a number of years with no luck (they all try to suggest depression and I am not depressed). I found a new dr that ran morning ACTh and cortisol levels that lead to and Endocrine appointment. Results (taken at 8am)ACTH Cortisol 260nmol/l (range 200 to 600) Endocrinologist said this was nothing to worry about but I pushed for a ACTh stim test So I had a high dose ACTH stim test and the results were only just ok Baseline:-ACTH 13 (range 10 to 20),Cortisol 321 (normal 200 to 600 for am) At 30 mins Cort 458 At 60 min Cort 508 Dr said these were ok but she said the Cort should of gone over 550. So they ran the low dose ACTH a few weeks later and I responded even better to this but extreme low ACTH Baseline ACTH At 30 mins Cort 630 At 60 mins Cort 630 (no change). But during this test my hand went blue/purple/cold and I got little shivers. This test was extremely stressful as they could not draw blood and I had to be jabbed several times and also screamed a few times! The dr thinks my results are normal even though ACTH is too low to register a value. The dr has advised that I don't have to worry about ACTH levels if cortisol is ok!! Now I am stuck as that is all they will do. Any ideas folks? I don't think it is addisons but my symptoms match, I don't know if I have pigmentation as I have very dark freckles (they have yet to fade even though I am 34).I am thinking an ACTh deficiency or some kind of adrenal insufficiency. Should I be worried about these ACTH levels? I have been cleared of diabetes and thyroid test were fine.I am thinking I pushed for the wrong tests and should of went the insulin stress test or metopirone overnight test.

You seem to be exhibiting signs of anxiety. Typically nervousness and worry form a part of everyday small matters. Normally everyone is able to keep control over bothersome thoughts and life’s uncertainties don’t seem to be getting out of hand. But sometimes, your defenses don’t match up to these stressors; demand overruns the supply of your personal energies, and troubles get out of your individual control.I would truly advise you to see an expert for managing your emotions. Anxiety is long lasting and disabling. Medication can be used to reduce the physiological (bodily) symptoms, but dealing with the worrisome thoughts is the challenge. Cognitive therapy (CBT) helps correct faulty cognitions that direct to undue worries. Behavior therapy reduces apprehensive performances. Emotive therapies (REBT) help to correct incorrect emotions. Supportive psychotherapy, relaxation, and biofeedback help in managing the physiological angst component. Help is always available. You must have the courage to accept it and make a difference in your life. Do not hesitate. Visit a professional, get yourself evaluated so we know what is going on in your mind. Please feel free to write in your queries, I will be happy to address them.Regards,Dr. Shefali Batra (MD)Founder MINDFRAMES"},{"Patient":"hii,Im tired of writing to docs about my problem, no one ever replies to them, after reading that u have solved over 25000 cases i thought u might b able to help, I'm 22 yr old male.I always had stage fright but then i realised that was not the only thing i had, I have social anxiety i.e. i hate crowded places,i dont get on a crowded bus or a train avoid traveling at peak hrs.

You are definitely suffering from multitude of issues. You seem to have social anxiety which makes you uncomfortable in social situations. In addition, continuity of your problems have landed you in depression which is leading to your being irritable and even trying to harm yourself.I would suggest that you should seek a psychiatric consultation again and get yourself started on medications. Medications like paroxetine or venlafaxine would help you a lot in decreasing your symptoms. You should also make efforts to quit smoking as that will only cause worsening of anxiety in long term. Daily exercise will also help you relax and feel better.You can also consider starting cognitive behavior therapy for yourself. you can discuss regarding the same with your psychiatrist. It will consist of multiple sessions focusing on learning relaxation and changing the maladaptive thoughts that are leading to problem.I do hope I was able to answer your query.Best wishes,Dr. Sunil Gupta"},{"Patient":"hi. i trough out everything in 1.5 days. i think i have fever and pschylogically i am depreesed. i need to cry and feel afraid to have social contact and need somebody to help me at the same time. last night i was thinking hurting my self.i am few sessions with a doctor who told me i have borderline personality disorder. i was fine.  i cant sleep now and feel troughing out in last 3 4 hours ... help me","Doctor":"A face to face session with the doctor who has been treating you could be helpful.

I went to my family doctor and was prescribed paxil. I tried it for awhile but it didn t help and I still had no help with anxiety and panic attacks. I tried buspar and also hydroxyzine also were of no help to me. Buspar actually had an awful reaction with me. I have been living with anxiety and panic attacks for so long with no help because I just got insurance. My Dr. told me he doesn t believe in treating with benzodiazepines and offered a referral to a psychiatrist whom wasn t in my network but recommended I seek out a psychiatrist. So I did but also have researched benzodiazepines. The only thing I can find about this is Doctors unwilling to prescribe those medications and how hard it is to get this treatment mixed with therapy, yet people are still on them. A lot swear by them and a lot don t. So I wanted to try this treatment, recommended by my doctor and insurance representative and clinical nurse representative. My question is how do I go about asking for this treatment, benzodiazepines and cognitive behavioral therapy? Is it possible and plausible? Thanks.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.

I M STILL WORRIED ABOUT MY HALITOS PROBLEM... :(( ------ Dear Sameerq, Everyone gets bad breath from time to time; there s just no getting around it. When we eat, food particles get stuck in between teeth and collect on the tongue and from there they break down into a bacteria-infested mess. We can also have germs and bacteria in the back of the throat and anywhere along the sinus cavities, all of which get caught in the breath as we exhale. And odors from food itself can linger in the mouth; just try to eat garlic or drink coffee without getting bad breath! So to ask if your bad breath is normal may seem a bit strange since everyone gets it. However there are some that seem to have a chronic problem with this no matter what, and some who seem almost obsessed with whether or not their breath is bad. There is actually a condition where a person is afraid of bad breath, whether theirs or someone else s, called halitophobia. It s thought that less than 1% of the population has this particular phobia so it s very unlikely that your thoughts about bad breath are an actual fear or phobia; chances are you just want to be sure that you re not offending anyone every time you try to talk. It s also true that some people have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which is another mental illness where a person obsesses over minor details and often feels compelled to fix them. OCD also affects a very small percentage of the population so that s probably not your problem either. But realizing that your concern about bad breath is not a true mental illness also doesn t mean that you should start ignoring the problem either. Just as a person should be concerned with all aspects of their hygiene, bad breath should be something that is addressed and prevented where at all possible. A bad odor on the body can signal a need for cleaning, whether it s an odor from the underarms, soles of the feet, genitals, or the breath. Bad odor usually comes from a buildup of bacteria and germs and of course this shouldn t be ignored. The same can be said of your breath - chronic or consistent cases can be a sign of tooth decay, gum disease, and other problems in the mouth and throat that should be addressed also.","Doctor":"HiI had gone through all details and agree with him also.But detail evaluation about OCD spectrum disorder is must.Sometimes all these are interrelated in spectrum.Olfactory referral syndrome has same features of obsession about body odors and body dysmorphia is also same type o etiology.Obsession of body odor can be part of OCD.So Treatment Of obsession and OCD make all spectrum together.It can be treated with fluoxetine 60 to 80 mg and add on other medicines depends upon psychological evaluation.So please do consultation with best psychiatrist and discuss about spectrum and its treatment.Still have a query then feel free to ask.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hello, my name is Julia.

He will not ask anyone for a referal for his tennis lessons as he does not want to bother anyone. 4. He will not eat out with friends even if they pay for him at a nice restaurant. 5.

The closer you move to him the more he backs up. 7. He believes that all guns should be banned because touching one might result in death.

Recently I found a mass under my right nipple that is somewhat painful. A friend of mine suggested I may have a hormone imbalance (low testosterone) causing this. When an MD does a hormone test like this, how exactly do they test for it? Blood, urine, oral swab? It's important for me to know this because I have been smoking and drinking more than normal for the last year due to a divorce and I can't afford to let that info hit the MIB in the way of pos. nico or elevated liver enzymes.","Doctor":"Hi, Cause for your swelling - one of the reason can be due to hormone. Other cause - it can be abscess, benign lesion, infection, chronic alcohol causing hepatic damage. Doing an ultrasound can help diagnose the cause. For hormone test - simple blood investigation is enough. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

You would know best about how you feel after you have taken your medicines.You seem to be on quite a high dosage of the medication at this point. You should wait a few days and identify how you are feeling after the ingestion of the dose. Try doing some skilled task like a puzzle or something that takes a lot of skill and try and gauge how well you perform on that task. It will give you a fair idea. Also, you can ask your treating doctor to adjust the doses to night time so that it does not interfere with your driving abilities during the day."},{"Patient":"sir my brother is a doctor in delhi.but from last 11 years he is having too much anger ,use to repeat the things,doubt on his wife unnecessarily ,beats her,due to which divorce occurs.but he is professionally sound.now he is working in delhi as a doctor.he is not  taking any cure when we told him to show phycatrist he never obey us and fight with us.kindly help us.","Doctor":"Hello,Your problem is a common one faced while treating someone who is either head of the family or high earning member of family or well settled in society.

As he is a doctor, you can contact some psychiatrist and discuss his case and may be ask him to meet the patient without  his knowledge and let him start the treatment which can be added to his food. With passage of time drugs will show effect and he will agree for taking treatment on his own.2.  You can ask someone whom he still trusts and listen to and that person can take him to a  psychiatrist and get his treatment moving.3. Last option is taking help from police. They can take him forcefully to a govt. Setup and get him evaluated and then his meds can be started.

What does that means. Does this has long lasting effects. what are the chances of leading normal life. what are things we should be careful about.he had seizures almost around every 2 months in which there is a jerking of his left hand. We walks normal but sometimes he appears tense on uneven surfaces.","Doctor":"I am so sorry to hear about your son having this. Let me try and explain it to you in simple words. In medical science, 'encephalomalacia' means a softening of the brain matter. This is a form of damage to the brain which can be due to some or the other trauma. This may be an infection, a bleed from a blood vessel or a shortage of blood supply to that part of his brain (for reasons that I may not be able to explain as I have limited details about what exactly happened). There is no evidence at this point to really tell you why this happened: was it some trauma during the delivery or some infection that your child developed and was not treated or some genetic cause that happened before his birth.Truly encephalomalacia is a 'serious brain damage'. Having such a kind of brain abnormality can have lasting effects in life. He has seizures (which is not surprising because the brain is the most complex and most important in our body). The softening of the brain as we are seeing in his case in the parietal and occipital lobes may be local as we see it but may also spread to other areas. When a particular part of the brain is 'softened' like this it cannot function normally because those cells of the brain have died. This may affect multiple organs thus changing the normal function of the body and the overall health of your child. This could also lead to a series of other diseases and disorders.As he grows more signs and symptoms may become evident depending on the severity.Somnolence or extreme drowsinessWobbliness and lack of coordinationTemporary or permanent blindnessVertigo or severe head spinningHeadacheTerminal comaI have given you  brief overview of what happens in encephalomalacia in general. Please feel free to ask me any further questions I will be more than happy to respond. Meanwhile I would definitely advise you to have regular follow ups with the neurologist and gauge your son's progress."},{"Patient":"Hi I am chandra Shekhar rai age 33 I am taking medicines since last 12 yes for depression and ocd .some time I feel OK but in between I feels problem like laziness poor concentration anxiety continuous thinking irritation repeated thought of bad old days I feels weakness in doing my routine task lack in memory I lives many jobs in those days I m very much worries 4 future some times I want 2 die but never attempted some times I weep.I lay on the bed 4 long time I want 2 live alone I become less social due to my these problems .

I am hoping that you are in regular touch with your treating professional to gain advice about your medication? I believe that besides medication for depression, stress, anxiety and OCD, you may benefit with an ongoing supportive counseling protocol.Sadness is a common emotion. It’s a ‘customary’ reaction to loss, failure, rejection; all of which are inevitable in everyone’s everyday routine existence. All such situations involve pain and the blues they cause are warranted. But staying sad for too long, letting the sorrow engulf you, and inability to snap out of it is not justifiable. That’s the difference between sadness as a passing emotion; and depression as a disorder that needs attention. You cannot ignore your symptoms because they are affecting your life in totality now.Your continuous mental pain must be seriously influencing the quality of life and the you may actually feel that life is really not worth anything. But you need to move out of this mindset and look around to find things that interest you and give you reason to move on. Sleep, appetite, fatigue, laziness, stomachache, indigestion, diarrhea, and headache; even osteoporosis and cancers are linked to diminished immunity owing to depression and stress. The mind and body work in synch; to get the best outcome, both need to be nurtured and nourished else one or both of them give way and sanity get out of hand.I think you must seek professional help and consider psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavior Therapy-CBT, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy- REBT). These are time tested to work, and require active participation from your side. Do reach out anytime for further help if needed."},{"Patient":"i have this thing, its a fear of a thief or stranger barging in my house at night. i know its not normal, but it is for me. i even carry a knife with me sometimes, and cellphone in case of emergencies. im 18, and this has been going on for as long as i can remember. i cant sleep at night under the constant fear of saving those around me, not me myself. i dont care about my safety, just of those around me. whats wrong with me?","Doctor":"Each one of us has a set of dreaded objects, real or imaginary. Someone may fear dogs or cats or rats or snakes or spiders; others may be consciously troubled by the thought of a natural calamity earthquake or flood or volcano; and as you mention you are afraid of intruders who may harm those around you. You seem to have developed a 'phobic' disorder.A real terror attack doesn’t generate as much turmoil for a phobic individual as does confrontation with their feared object. You are in a constant fear of such a situation arising and hence the restless and anticipatory anxiety of these situations. Phobias require restructuring of the faulty learning principles so the feared behavior is unlearned. There are therapy techniques like relaxation training, situational exposure, exposure with cognitive restructuring, and social skills training which can help you get rid of this fear. Medication helps assist the management of anxiety that usually co-exist because of the negative perceptions that have been established in your mind.You would really benefit with consulting an expert professional to help you deal with this fear.

He exposed himself. He has ADHD & diabetes. We have known him 25 years . This has happened two years apart. One time in 2011 or 2012 & yesterday. It never happened before his diagnosis.","Doctor":"I am sorry to hear about this behavior I can understand it must be distressing to you and your daughters. It is important to assess whether he was in the right frame of mind when this behavior occurred. ADHD is usually not the cause for this. Possibly he may have been in low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) or high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) wherein his consciousness and judgment may have been clouded and hence he exhibited this disinhibited act, but there is no definitive explanation for this.Regarding the ADHD he must visit a professional psychiatrist or counselor and gauge how to maintain his focus and attention. With regards to the diabetes you must have a regular follow up with the endocrinologist and see whether his blood sugar has been controlled and whether he has ever had other times of altered judgment. If the behavior is absolutely unrelated to the diabetes, then you have even greater reason to visit a mental health professional to look into this.

Depression is not simply a state of ‘mood’. It becomes a part of life of the depressed person. The continuous mental pain seriously influences the quality of life and you may feel that life is really not worth living. But depression is an illness and it is treatable. It is prudent to make the best of your existence in this lifetime itself; there are no second chances. You need to get back to your treating professional and have yourself assessed in depth. Maybe this is a hormonal influence, possibly there is some life event that is irking you or something in your environment that is not to your liking. There is always hope and scope for betterment. Medication and psychotherapeutic techniques can help you perceive the beauty of life; to ensure that it becomes socially, emotionally and economically more meaningful.

I think that you are experiencing intermittent explosive disorder. Aggression is a part of the nature of human beings. It seems reasonable to be angry when things don’t go the right way. However looks like you have a tendency to be upset and irritated with minimal provocation and do not know how to express your frustration rightly.Everything that anybody thinks, feels and does is controlled by the chemical activity in our brain. Certain neurotransmitter (brain chemical) alterations in the brain are known to generate belligerent behavior. Also, aggression and frustration may attributed to hormone changes. have you noticed that this happens more at specific times in the month?. Certain external factors like hot sultry climate, crowded and unclean surroundings, too much crowd, exacting demands at work, interpersonal stressors, financial constraints, excessive noise, pollution etc. all can contribute to aggression.I would really suggest that you meet with an expert to get this assessed. There are structured behavior modification techniques, tips for self-change and improvement, relaxation, visual imagery, as well as biofeedback mechanisms which help people cope with their aggressive impulses. Cognitive tasks facilitate introspection into your aggressive outbursts and their antecedent events so that triggers can be identified and dealt with well in time. The important step is insight into your aggressive behavior, and cognizance of the ill effects these can have on your life in general. Self-change can only be initiated by the self. After all it is the stepping-stone for self-growth.

You have mentioned that you had been put on Valproate - which is a  mood stabilizer and I\\"m not sure why you needed a mood stabilizer instead of an antidepressant.The only possible reason that I can think of is that you could have been diagnosed to have bipolar depression and hence a mood stabilizer may have been started. But this is just my assumption, because you have not provided sufficient details about your initial problem. In the current situation, if Valproate is not helping you and your depression is getting worse, then you may need an antidepressant medication. However, if you have a bipolar depression, then the antidepressant needs to be given under the cover of a mood stabilizer. So, please discuss about these options with your treating doctor.Best wishes,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Hi my 13 yo niece has just started speaking quickly and is making a gasping sound just before she starts speaking.

From your brief description, this symptom of speaking fast with gasps in between could be suggestive of anxiety. Some children may get anxious when they are in the midst of other people - this is called social anxiety. Also, underlying stress (due to problems in the family or at school) could also be a possible reason for her speech problems.If this has happened recently and it is severe and distressing the child, then you can take her to a child psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation. It would also be a good idea to speak to the child privately and confidentially, to see if she is stressed out or anxious about anything. You can also gently suggest her to speak slowly by taking sufficient pauses between words and phrases. Speech therapy from a professional therapist may also be quite helpful.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"i dont know but i feel like crying all the time.i get irritated without reason i argue wid people and say things that hurt them in my anger.my professional and personal life both are perfect.whats wrong with me?i m really afraid that by this behavior i might screw up everything.help","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for writing in.I understand that you are going through a difficult time.

Thanks for your query.I understand that you are worried about your habit of pulling out hair and eating the hair follicles. Its good that you have been able to realize that you are not able to control this behaviour and have decided to seek help.From the description of your symptoms, you appear to be suffering from a psychiatric disorder called TRICHOTILLOMANIA. Here the person compulsively (i,e, repeatedly and without control) keeps pulling out hair and some may even ingest the pulled out follicles.
