She was probably born with a deformed heart valve. In some people who are born with a deformed aortic valve, the aorta gets larger over time. The reason is not known. The general understanding is that when the aorta grows large, it should be repaired because if not, it might tear. It is not an emergency unless it has started to tear. Since she had a surgery in the past, she faces a second surgery. This is not as simple as the first and the surgeon and cardiologist will want to wait as long as possible.

Once you know what it is and that it doesn't matter, that alone makes it bearable.Avoid stimulants like caffeine, theophylline or guarine. No coffee, tea or energy drinks.

Didn't drink a lot but abstain from drinking alcohol now and the GGT level had reduced before pregnancy and back to nearly normal.  When I was in hospital my GGT level increased again.  I have been having it tested c every 6 weeks since March of this year.  Whilst it had been dropping by c60 every test (it was c790 in March) the last 2 tests showed no movement (stayed at c460) and I was tested last week and it's gone up to 560.  What could be causing this?  I have not touched alcohol, but do feel a bit tired and slightly dizzy from time to time.  Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello! Thanks for putting your query in HCM. I am a Gastroenterologist. There are only few causes of elevation of GGT, among which alchol intake is most common.

So i will suggest you to visit to your dosctor for evaluation for these causes.I hope I have answered your query and this will help you .

You need to take a proton pump inhibitor (like Pantoprazole) along with a prokinetic drug (like Domperidone or Mosapride) one hour before breakfast once daily is effective for the symptomatic relief of acid reflux. A prescription is needed from a GP for the above medications.1. You need to have certain life style modifications like:i. Avoid fatty, spicy vegan and non-vegan foods, alcohol (if you consume)ii. Eat home cooked food, increase the intake of vegetables, fruits, etc.iii. Avoid eating with full stomach rather you eat small frequent meals.iv. Avoid taking rest for 2 hours after meal.v. Have your dinner before 8 pm so that at the time of sleeping your stomach will be empty.vi. Do exercise regularly and reduce your body weight3. You can take OTC medications like Mefenemic acid+Dicyclomine for the symptomatic relief of pain due to gall stones.4. The maximum diameter of bile duct is about 6 mm.So, if you have smaller gallstones (less than 5 mm), they can get flushed and pass through the bile duct into the intestine.5. There are some drugs available in the market to dissolve the already formed gall stones, but they have got their own problematic side effects in some. For this, you have to consult your family physician or your surgeon.6. If your symptoms do not improve with the medications or when it causes obstruction or inflammation causing a 'sore' gallbladder, then it has to be removed by laparascopic surgery.Hope the suggestions given above would be beneficial to you.Take care."},{"Patient":"My USg result is coarse echotexture and 2 hepatic cysts.

Eventhough you should avoid : Halothane(anesthetic), Acetaminophen, Diclofenac, Sulfamethoxazole, Nitrofurantoin, Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Augmentin), Salicylates, rovafloxacin (Trovan).It is also important not to use alcohol and oral contraceptives during the recovery period."},{"Patient":"My mother in law was diagnosed with tumour in bile duct one and half years ago. In view of her age ( 80 years),  a stent was put. Recently she has started having itching problems as was experienced earlier. What could be the cause and suggest further action required","Doctor":"ItchingÂ is a symptom of cholestatic liver disease due to biliary duct obstruction from the tumor. Till now the stent helped the bile to drain in duodenum and not to rise up the bilirubin levels in blood. The most possible cause of itching in this conditions, may be the stent stenosis due to the progressive tumor growth.So the next step is to perform a ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreato-graphy) to check the stent and eventually a cholangio MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).Meanwhile, appropriate management of itching sensation is very important, because it can be very distressing for the patient. Cholestyramine is still recommended as a first-line therapy for management of pruritus. I recommend that patients take cholestyramine at night so they can sleep through most of the side effects.Second/third-line therapies include rifampicin, opiate antagonists (such as naloxone or naltrexone)."},{"Patient":"I have recently been diagnosed with elevated liver enzymes as a result of taking lymecycine for years.

I am very concerned because having had medication changed, the stools are still yellow.","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome to HCM.Incomplete data like age, gender, purpose for taking Limecycline for years.The features seem to be due to Limecycline induced liver injury.Limecycline is a tetracycline group of antibiotic used in the treatment of various bacterial infections. Although less common, but it is capable of causing a distinctive form of acute fatty liver disease which is associated largely with long term use of Limecycline.For complete recovery to occur following the discontinuation of Limecycline it may need 4-6 weeks for the liver functions to restore to normal, hence the color of the stool may remain yellow for quite some time.Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"I have a gallstone which needs to come out with occasionally, twice a fortnight very painful biliary colic.

I have a wedding tomorrow and although I don't drink very much, over the course of the day I would normally have 2-3 white wine spritzers. Do you think this would cause my biliary colic, as i would not want to ruin my day with that.","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome to HCM.Yes, wine can exacerbate the symptoms of biliary colic.This is because heavy alcohol intake can indirectly lead to the formation of these stones and possibly exacerbate existing symptoms. Since you are already having this problem you should avoid drinking alcohol or alcohol containing beverages like wine. Besides, alcohol is metabolized (processed)by your liver, and if your gallstones are a result of a liver condition it may further aggravate the condition.So,  better enjoy the wedding party with all the dishes except alcohol and fatty meals.Hope this will solve your problem."},{"Patient":"I have gallstones and bilateral inguinal hernia.

I was walking to a bus stop with a few of my friends at about 7:45pm-it was cold out and the ground had about 6 inches of snow. It must have been 36-40 degrees(not sure, thats a really vague guess...all I know is it was COLD). We decided it would be fun to try and run through a meadow to the highway, well we all began running for about 35 seconds. When we stopped I had a really hard time catching my breath-I couldnt make full breaths and my heart was pumping very fast and very hard. I was in a store buying something (right after meadow-store is next to meadow) and I still didnt have my breath back, for some reason putting pressure on my heart helped somewhat. I was at the checkout counter and suddenly my left arm and the left side of my face got really numb, I got really dizzy and light-headed and my breathing became even harder. I walked to a bench as fast as I could and lied down for a few minutes, I felt okay when I tried to stand back up, and I can breath again-but not big breaths. Whenever I take a big breath my chest stings and I have to cough. My chest is still really sore! Im 17 years old, 5 11 , and about 189 pounds. Im a little overweight but its not bad. I have been going to the gym regularly for a month and a half now and doing rigorous cardio exercises.

I am 5 5 height, and my weight is 115 ibs I have been to 5 different doctors, and 2 different hospitals. My mother and I have paid thousands to dollars to get help for me. For the past two and a half years Iâ€™ve been blacking out, where everything goes black and I canâ€™t see a thing. Sometimes when I black out I canâ€™t see, hear or move anything. Most times itâ€™s only for a couple seconds. A couple times from blacking out, Iâ€™ve fallen down stairs and walked into walls. The first time I blacked out I was with my friends and I couldnâ€™t move or hear, but I didnâ€™t black out completely, it was blurry. It felt like a couple seconds, 30 seconds at the most, but it wasnâ€™t, my friends told me it was 3 or 4 minutes. Last year I went to the doctors, they said it was nothing wrong with me, and that it was all in my head, I was making myself black out. But I donâ€™t believe that. Well at the doctor they found out I had a blood clot in my heart, my brain isnâ€™t normal as it should be and that I have a problem with my blood that is making me always cold. When I run, I barely can breathe, it feels like someone is stabbing me in the heart, and I could pass out right there, I only run when I really need too. The blood clot the doctors found wasnâ€™t that major; they said actually very small, that I donâ€™t have to worry about it. A few months ago I had an EEG (I think thatâ€™s what it was called) and they had me stay up for 24 hours, and I couldnâ€™t eat or drinking anything besides water for 24 hours. The put the hat thing on my head then had me stay up for 30 minutes, they told me it said that my brain was sleeping (they used a larger and more science word, they said that for me to understand). Neither my doctors nor I understand why I am always cold. I have been outside at 80 degrees weather, and it felt like 50 degrees. One winter day it was almost 70 degrees in my house and I thought it was 20 degrees,","Doctor":"It seems that you have more than one problem and they're not so simple. The easiest first. Your perception of temperature may differ from other people for many reasons. The most common is just preference and conditioning but there are some medical reasons. Your description suggests that you will have had testing for these causes leaving perception or how you interpret the sensation as most likely. This is not a disease.Blackouts are just that. You have no memory of the event. If you remember, you didn't blackout. Blood pressure may vary in some people and a low blood pressure may make you feel as though you're blacking out. This may leave you with a memory of the event. The chance that something severe is wrong that is causing episodes of low blood pressure, that has also evaded your doctor's prying eyes, is quite low. You have had all of the typical testing that is done to evaluate your complaints.

As you already have fatty liver/NAFLD for last 10 years, it is likely to progress and can cause liver fibrosis. As the liver enzymes are elevated it looks like you have steatohepatitis.

Are there some tests I should insist on him ordering?","Doctor":"hi.noted history of cholecystectomy, recent episodes of nausea, night sweats and fatigue. may i ask what post-operative medications are you currently taking in? some of these can possibly cause the nausea. but your symptoms may also not be related to your surgery. it can be a systemic viral illness which can resolve spontaneously in a few days time. it is best if you do a follow-up consult with your surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. diagnostics (such as complete blood count, chest xray, etc.) and management will be directed accordingly. low fat diet is also advised.hope this helps.good day!! ~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"Sir ,recently icame to know there are gall stones measuring 1.8 cms .But iam not feeling any pain,but suffering from gastric problem,whether i take food or not.I am a female (44).My question is whether i need to go for surgery immediately or i can wait for some time.","Doctor":"hi.noted history of gallstone disease. if you are not experiencing symptoms right now, observation and regular follow-up may be done, doesn't necessarily mean that surgical treatment is not an option anymore. diet modification to low fat intake is advised. even if you are not experiencing symptoms right now, they may occur in the future. it is still best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. other diagnostics (such as liver function tests, alkaline phosphatase, etc.) and management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. an elective (scheduled) cholecystectomy is always better than an emergent one. better outcome and less post-operative complications are expected in these types of surgeries. surgical removal of the gallbladder can be done laparoscopically (goldstandard) or thru open technique. hope this helps. good day!! ~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"I am in menopause for 4 years now and last June i had a panic attack and around that time i started to have sensation of trembling inside my chest.

I have had this pain in my heart area for a long time now, i cant feel it when i breath half way and then sometimes i can feel it with every beat of my heart. I get dizzy when i stand up from doing gardening or low things. I have an irregular heart beat and my blood pressure is low as it runs in my family.","Doctor":"Hello, You described different symptoms and I will try to go over them one by one. If low blood pressure runs in your family, then nothing to worry about it, it is your normal blood pressure. The only issue with this is that you should be careful when standing up, as standing up abruptly can cause dizziness and blacken in front of your eyes. Just do it slowly and everything will be fine. Concerning the pain in your chest which worsens with breathing; such pain is usually muscle pain, it can come from the spine. It is not dangerous but can cause quite a discomfort. You can take Ibuprofen unless you are allergic to Ibuprofen or have stomach problems. For irregular heart rhythm; if you feel it occasionally, especially as a skipped beat, then there is nothing to worry, it can happen to a healthy adult as well without any consequences. Just limit the intake of caffeine and quit smoking and excessive drinking if you used to. In case the palpitations are frequent and don't decrease after decreasing caffeine, avoiding cigarettes and alcohol, you will need to refer to a doctor and have ECG monitoring, to find out what type of heart rhythm disturbance you have. So your doctor can prescribe treatment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Now I just had some blood work done and my SGOT levels were 54.  A year ago they were 20.

I do not drink other than maybe 4 drinks a year!  What do you think I should do next? Or what could be causing this?  About 40 years ago I had Mono and it went undiagnosed for about 6 months because I had abnormal symptoms.

Many a times it is transient and self limiting.Take care"},{"Patient":"I am taking Udiliv 450mg od for grade 3 Fatty Liver.I do not smoke,Drink or consume any sugar products,as i have type 2 diabetic under control for 2 years.HBic is 5.9.Fasting is 100 and PP is 110.I am not getting much relief as i have put lots of weights.My Renal profile is good.tks.","Doctor":"Hellothanks for asking query on HCM.

There are two factors at play here which may be responsible for the abdominal swelling. First, the kidney function to excrete extra body fluid along with wastes so when the kidneys do not function properly , it cannot excrete the fluid which ultimately accumulates in the body. Secondly, the liver makes proteins which keeps the fluid in the vessels. So when the liver becomes dysfunctional, it does not make the required proteins more specifically albumin so it cannot keep the fluid in the vessels and the fluid extravasates into the peritoneal cavity. Hope that answers your question."},{"Patient":"I am 19 years old and just had a 4 cm tumor including a lymph node removed from my neck near the jaw. there is another tumor higher up and more difficult to remove as it will involve muscle.

Ann","Doctor":"hi.how frequent are the occurrence of your symptoms? high fat/ high cholesterol food intake is a predisposing factor to formation of your gallstones. based from your course of the disease description, you may have a chronic calculous cholecystitis. this means that your gallstones may have been there for a long time already, and the symptoms are intermittent in presentation, usually bouts of colicky attack/pain or feeling of bloatedness occurs after a fatty food intake. this is an not an emergency case, but you have to have a sense of urgency in dealing with this matter, as it may be converted to an acute attack which will be emergent to deal with. low fat diet is encouraged, along with anti-spasmodics, prior to surgery to lessen the occurrence of attacks. if you are over 35 y/o and has other co-morbidities/diseases, a cardio-pulmonary evaluation will be requested first, prior to your operation. a consult with a general surgeon is best for clinical evaluation. diagnostics, such as abdominal ultrasound and liver function tests, will be recommended accordingly. definitive management is cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder), laparoscopically, being the gold standard now. the cost is dependent in the institution you are going to. your surgeon of choice might be of help in that aspect.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"After I peed, I wiped and I had what looked like tiny particles that were on the toilet paper.

Although you haven't mentioned your age and gender, but your history is consistent with SOD (sphincter of oddi dysfunction) until and unless proven otherwise. Despite your gall bladder surgery, you can have such type of abdominal pains in SOD. Sphincter of oddi is a valve present at the end of CBD (common bile duct) that relaxes once you start eating so that bile juice can reach small intestine. In SOD the valve pressure is high and it does not relax and therefore you experience pain.To confirm the diagnosis you have to perform your LFTs and a MRI known as MRCP.If both LFTs and MRCP are abnormal, you should consult a gastroenterologist to undergo a type of endoscopy, ERCP which will be curative as well.If either LFTs or MRCP is abnormal, you have to undergo a confirmatory test that is called monometry. And if it's abnormal you will need ERCP with sphincterotomy, which will be the definite treatment.

CONCLUSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus. 2. Small to moderate hiatal hernia. 3. Unusual contour to the posterior body of the pancreas which is likely a normal variation of pancreatic anatomy. In order to exclude a peripancreatic lymph node or exophytic pancreatic mass, further evaluation would be recommended with either CT or MRI of the abdomen, non-emergently.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The first CT might have been done for the chest and you probably had discomfort and breathing problems.There is no pulmonary embolus shows no blood clot in the lungs.Hiatal hernia is a condition where there is upwards movement of the stomach and this is mild and therefore not a serious problem and you might be aware about it. This can cause acid reflux symptoms.The pancreas is a soft organ and is tadpole in shape. Some people can have a bulky head region of pancreas and probably it is there in your scan. If you are doing well without any problems in digestion and if there is no abdominal pain then your pancreas is a sort of normal variation. This is common and found in many patients. The pancreas is slightly prominent for this reason and it is not a problem. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I m having twinges down my right quadrant, made worse when lying down.

It does not get completely cured but the virus load can be reduced with medicine. The HBsAg test will be reactive in you life long and this shows that the hepatitis B virus is circulating in you.To know the exact status of hepatitis you please do hepatitis B antibodies test and viral load. This will tell the activity of the infection in your body. If it is high then treatment is required.Infectivity and transmission of hepatitis B virus depends on viral load. It is possible that your viral load is low after treatment and does not require any intervention and treatment.Regards,"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a gamma GT of 64. I do drink or I should say I did!

My ultrasound report taken last June 13, 2014 states the following: The gallbladder is partially contracted measuring 3.3 x 0.7 cm. Its wall is 0.4 cm thick. V-shaped reverbarating artiofacts are noted emanating from the wall. A high intensity echo with posterior sonic shadowing measuring 05 x 0.4 cm is also noted intraluminally. The pancreas is partially obscured by bowel gas. The imaged portion of the body measures 2.0 cm. On June 16, 2014 I had a CT Scan and the report states the following: CT images reveal enlargement of the distal pancreatic body and pancreatic tail with haziness, stranding and nodularity of the peripancreatic fat. There is also an irregular, peripherally enhancing fluid collection measuring approximately 4.7x6.9x3.0 cm superior to the pancreatic tail. The walls of the stomach adjacent to the fluid collection are mildly thickened and irregular which may be inflammatory and reactive to the adjacent fluid collection. The pancreatic head is still normal in size and the pancreatic parenchyma is homogeneous. No discrete mass lesion is noted. The pancreatic duct is not dilated. The gallbladder is not dilated and exhibits a tiny 0.3 cm intraluminal calcific density. Its walls are smooth and not thickened. Incidentally, minimal left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe and bibasal subsegmental atelectasis or fibrosis. What does the report mean? Should I undergo surgery?","Doctor":"HiI have gone through your ultrasound & CT scan report.echogenic intensity with posterior  shadowing in ultrasound  and linear hyperdensity in CT abdomen indicates gall bladder calculus.regarding your pancreas nothing revealed in ultrasound as it is obscured by bowel gas.CT scan findings are head & proximal  body of pancreas is normal.distal body & tail are enlarged with peripancreatic fat stranding & fluid collection adjacent to it indicates inflamation of distal pancreas ie ...Acute focal pancreatitis.it is because of this adjacent stomach wall inflammed. Pancreatitis causes minimal left pleaural effusion and sub segmental collapsed consolidated lung.its a medical emergency.now no need of surgery.later you can plan for surgery for gall bladder stoneThank u Best regardsVasundhara"},{"Patient":"i have been having elevated liver enzimes.

Thanks for asking query on HCM. As I understand from your narration that you have been diagnosed with acute hepatitis A ( I assume diagnosis was based on IgM anti HAV levels and other viruses ruled out). Acute hepatitis A is a self limiting illness which requires only supportive measures. As I see your bilirubin level is coming down which is a good sign and indicates recovery phase. I think your SGOT and SGPT levels may also be coming down (probably from 1000s or so). Usually complete recovery takes about 4 to 6 weeks. Alarm features of severe disease are - excessive sleepiness, worsening jaundice, bleeding manifestations and swelling of the abdomen, which are not the case with you.

Should I be concerned about my heart rate?  The last time I was in the office it was 110 just sitting in his office.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your resting heart rate values are a little high,  but they can be related to Adderal IR adverse effects (it is known to increase the heart rate by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system). As your blood pressure values are normal, the situation does not seem to be really concerning. But, I would recommend performing some other tests to be sure that everything is OK: - an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to examine your heart rate values for a prolonged time- complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance. If all these tests result normal, there is nothing to worry about. If your heart rate is persistently high, I would recommend discussing with your doctor on the possibility of reducing the dose of Adderall.
