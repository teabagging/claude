As you are getting erections when you watch porn but are losing during sex this shows that problem is not organic. The issues are more psychological. Confido helps to boost confidence but is not proper treatment. For some times you can try tablet Tadalafil or Sildenafil. Either of these tablets if taken about half to one hour before sexual intercourse help to improve erection.  If problem persists then visit a doctor and get serum Testosterone and Prolactin levels done. If levels of both these hormones come normal then remain relaxed.

You seem to be having vasomotor or allergic rhinitis. We need to diagnose it so that the treatment will address the cause. However, temporarily the symptomatic treatment would entail the use of steroid nasal sprays with antihistaminic and Montelukast. The choice of nasal spray and the antihistaminic can be done based on your work and response. Allergy to dust particles, local flora and pollens can be overcome by finding out the offending agent and avoiding it entirely. Such a diagnosis can be made using blood ELISA testing or skin prick testing. Sometimes the offending agent can be food allergen also. Regarding the choice of antihistaminics, there are second-generation antihistaminics with less sleep as a side effect. Some medicines like Cetirizine can produce sleep and dryness of the mouth. Fexofenadine is slightly better that way. Steroidal nasal sprays are generally safe and can be used for a long term. Fluticasone and Mometasone are popular. For further support do revert back to me.

The decision taken is a great thing in smoking cessation. You may list the situation when you are tempted for smoking. Keep chewing gum with you. Whenever you feel to smoke, use chewing gum. You may also divert your mind by having coffee, tea, fruit juices, etc. In many countries, chewing gum (containing a small amount of nicotine) is available, which gives the same kick what we get by a cigarette. After a few days, gradually, we need to use normal chewing gum. In many countries, the herbal cigarette available, which does not contain nicotine. But, it gives the placebo effect of smoking. You may go for Yoga and meditation which gives the self-control and divert your mind more towards your profession. Body massage (with medicated oil) also helps to remove toxic substances from your body. Panchakarma of Ayurveda is another option to remove toxins from your body.

It could be a combination of Marijuana, codeine, and beer. Also, regular use of Marijuana will cause panic attacks. It is just that the effects of whatever is taken regularly and do not show up immediately. Only chronic use of either smoking, alcohol or other drugs will cause problems later on. I would recommend that you at least try to reduce if not stop the quantity of the drug. Combination of alcohol, weed, and Marijuana. Just get a chest ECG (electrocardiogram) done to be on the safer side. Panic disorder, anxiety disorder due to substance use. Panic disorder or anxiety disorder due to substance use. Try reduce the quantity of alcohol, Marijuana and smoking. Try some deep breathing exercises or other relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation or progressive muscle relaxation exercises.

I am afraid of this and please can you give me an answer that does not scare me more. I have had sensitive nasal passages and mild ETD for about 12 years. I get very dry sinuses when the temperature is low and it can sometimes clog up my ears and nose. I keep it in check by using nasal rinse with Neilmed purified salt and alkalol all natural products. These work great. We live in a small island country where we get water from mountains straight into a commercial cleaning station with filters and laser. I have always used this clean tap water in a netipot and then pour a little bit of boiled water into the netipot to get the temperature perfect. But now, this morning, when my sinus feel dry and just by accident I googled what is the best water is to use in netipot, and all kinds of warnings pop put that you should never use tap water for netipot. A google report says that: Tap water is not safe for use as a nasal rinse because it is not adequately filtered or treated. Some tap water contains low levels of organisms such as bacteria and protozoa, including amoebas that may be safe to swallow because stomach acid kills them. But in your nose, these organisms can stay alive in nasal passages and cause potentially serious infections. They can even be fatal in some rare cases. Very well I can very fast shift to distilled water and sterile water in the future, but I just want to ask you if I make these changes now? Can I be safe that these dangerous bacterias are not living inside my nose already and get problems in the future? Or would I feel sick right away if I get this after using clean tap water for years without problems? Can I be safe that I did not get any of these dangerous bacteria? Will distilled water even improve my nasal rinse?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for the detailed history. First of all, netipot nasal washes are a great way to keep your nose and sinuses clean, this method is used in India from ancient times it is a part of yoga practice. Now you can understand that neti pot washes what was used centuries back were always from tap water and there are no complications written anywhere in the older textbooks and even in yoga literature. It is the duty of health department of the country to warn the citizens regarding the use of regular tap water because in some places it may be impure. It should not be generalized. Our body and nose in particular, have tremendous local defense mechanisms against bacteria and they can very well take care of small amounts of bacteria if at all they are present in normal water. Since you have not developed any significant signs and symptoms of infection there is no need to worry, tap water has not caused any problems. In future, you can use boiled and cooled tap water for nasal washes that could take care of bacteria and any remote chance of infection."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a question about TMJ catching and popping. About ten days ago, my right jaw suddenly began catching and popping with a great deal of pain at the time of the pop. Since then, the pain when the pop occurs has diminished quite a bit, but the right side of the jaw still catches each time I close the mouth. It does not catch when opening. Also, when it catches, or pops, my lower teeth do a quick shift, then return to center. My question is, does the quick shift suggest a cause for the TMD I am experiencing?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your query and understand your concern. This shift in your lower teeth could not be a cause for your TMD. Temporo Mandibular joint is the jaw joint between upper jaw and lower jaw and involves multiple and complex structures like a disc between two jaws, chewing muscles, and the joining bone structure. A complete TMJ and dental evaluation should be done to determine what is causing your jaw popping, swelling and clenching habit. Jaw clenching (Bruxism) is not a condition but one of the main symptoms of a TMJ disorder. TMD could be because of:  1. Tensed chewing muscles. 2. Disparity in the disc. 3.. Changes in jaw bone structure.  Other than TMJ issues,  4. Psycological stress. 5. Misaligned or attrited (worn-out) teeth. 6. Multiple dental treatments or multiple missing teeth. 7. Recent dental injury or infection. 8. Recent hospitalization. General health conditions or systemic diseases affecting bone like arthritis could also cause TMD. Visit a TMJ specialist to identify what has caused your jaw swelling. From your query and the details provided regarding the panaromic x-ray (OPG), the cause should probably be the change in your jaw bone structure due to the advancing age and long term medicines intake. It could also be from the psychological stress (if) from the recent hospitalization and surgery. This psychological stress or an underlying bone disparity could have triggered a subconscious level jaw clenching thereby causing a tension in your chewing muscles leading to a muscle swelling in your jaw.  Initially a muscle relaxant will be prescribed to bring down the tensed jaw muscles and the swelling. After which a complete TMJ evaluation and X-ray study will be done to pinpoint the cause. A splint similar to a night guard (called deprogrammer appliance) will probably be suggested as a diagnostic appliance to identify the cause and to protect the teeth from getting attrited during jaw clenching. Once the cause is determined, the treatment is targeted right at it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old. The medication I take is Bupropion XL 150 mg. I have not wetted the bed since I was 11 years old, because I used to have problems then. For some reason these past few days I have been wetting the bed again. I am not sure what is going on?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I am sorry to hear about your nocturnal enuresis (involuntary urination at night whilst sleeping). Rest assured it is according to evidence most likely not due to a serious cause and should be fleeting:  Bupropion is known to rarely cause bedwetting as a side effect, especially in the first six months. Bupropion works therapeutically with your body's neurotransmitters (chemicals used for signaling and sending of specific nervous system messages) and can sometimes cause some of the minor nervous system signals to get confused for a short period, making your bladder muscle contract and urethra relax (for example causing bedwetting). This rare Bupropion side effect do go away within four to six weeks in most patients without specific treatment.  The following is what you could do: 1. Apply a few general measures to decrease the risk of nocturnal enuresis like not having any fluids two to three hours before bedtime. Avoiding any caffeinated drinks after 5:00 PM. Take your Bupropion in the morning, relax and take your time to empty your bladder completely at bedtime. Take any other supplements and vitamins in the morning. Make sure your room is properly darkened with no luminescent clock-faces insight, quiet room with soothing monotone white noise, for example, the sound of an air-conditioner in the background.  2. Do not think or worry about whether you might wet the bed. It is a silly transient medication side-effect which is out of your control for now.  3. If you are sleeping well at the moment without having much trouble falling asleep again, some evidence does suggest benefit from setting a relatively soft alarm for mid-sleep. 4. As I mentioned before this particular Bupropion side effect should resolve by itself within four to six weeks typically if however, it does not one can consider changing a second line treatment or adding one of the tablets we usually use to treat primary nocturnal enuresis. This is rarely necessary, however, and there is a high probability that your problem will resolve within a short period of time."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have read several studies on the effect of autophagy on aterial fibrilation.

Now if we consider theoretically, then yes fasting may stimulate autophagy and may have a beneficial effects on heart/ atrial fibrillation. It does improve your lipid profile and risk of myocardial ischemia which is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation. It may also reduce obesity/ bodily inflammation, which is again a risk factor for atrial fibrillation.  So, there is no evidence to suggest that it induces afib or remodeling, but such rigorous fasting is not recommended based on current evidence. We are also not sure whether you are meeting the daily requirement of essential nutrients. Dehydration should be strictly avoided. You can share some studies with me so that I can clarify on them. So, fasting for few days say for 1-5 days a month is acceptable."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Several dollar bills were accidentally washed (cold cycle, no disinfectant detergent) along with a pair of pants and a load of underwear. The money was lost in the washing machine with my underwear during the whole cycle. I did not realize this until the next day when I went to do another load of laundry because they were crumpled in a corner, so I had to worn a pair of underwear all day that had been washed in the same water as the money. I know that money is absolutely covered in bacteria, and being that the underwear was washed in cold and dried in low heat. I am wondering how likely it is that a vaginal infection will result from them having been in a wash cycle with several dirty dollar bills. Again, I apologize if this query seems a bit paranoid; I am just very afraid of contracting any further vaginal infections, especially not from an accident like this.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I understand your concern. But to me, the probability of contracting infection is very less. Firstly, you are not immunocompromised. Vagina is home to millions of bacteria and whether one will contract infection or not depends on immunity, which I guess is intact in you. Now, concern remained is of STD organisms, out of those candida and BV you already had. These organisms must already be present in your vagina in a low number, so the risk of acquiring this is low. Also, the probability that those dollars carrying STD organism is less because nobody will frequently touch between note and genitalia. And also these infections will usually occur with sex. Also, most of the viruses are inactivated with drying or sunlight. So overall, risk is very low and I think you should not be worried about it. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have problems with exhaling and inhaling. My exhale is extremely quick with a pause. My inhale is really difficult. I can feel my throat, nasal passage, airways, and throat contract when I breathe in. Also, all throughout my back I feel pressure from my backsides and lower back when I relax to try and let my body take over breathing. But if I just end up rolling my back, my tongue slides back and maybe the uvula clogges the airway as well and breathing becomes laborious and takes all my energy and thinking. Sometimes I can take two breaths before it hurts and becomes laborious. I order to breathe alright I have to hold my lower jaw in a position, move my tongue out of the way and hold it there, try to flex my chest downward and relax my belly. It is a lot of work to breathe. It is causing stress and anxiety. I cannot sleep, I have a pounding frontal and temporal lobe headache all the time and I have weird acid reflux unless I breathe a specific way. If I stop manually breathing, inhaling becomes near impossible and my throat feels like it caves in on itself. Also causing racing thoughts since when I relax it feels like my jaw and tongue are being stressed out and they twitch around too.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I am sorry you seem to be experiencing some trouble with your breathing pattern.  First of all, breathing is an involuntary response, meaning even if you try to hold your breath your brain will override this command and make you breathe. Breathing is an automatic response controlled by the respiratory control center of the brain within the medulla oblongata and pons. The muscles of the tongue are controlled by the hypoglossal nerve. The jaw thrust maneuver you are describing when you lay on your back is designed to open your airway.  Have you ever had any trauma or head injuries? Have you ever sought care for this before? You mentioned that this had been occurring for several years, so I assume you have had it looked at by a medical professional. Did your doctor do any tests, MRI, or CT scan?  It sounds like you have a lot going on. While I believe everyone can benefit from chiropractic care, it is my professional opinion, based on what you are describing that you are not a chiropractic candidate and that you should be evaluated neurologically, at the very least by your primary care physician. I believe he will want to refer you to an ENT or neurologist. Be evaluated by your primary care physician. I believe that he/she will want to refer you to an ENT or neurologist. In the event of an emergency, go to the ER. Respiratory issues can be life threatening and require immediate medical attention."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 16-year-old female and not pregnant.

The symptoms you have described suggestive of simple ARI (acute respiratory tract infection). There is no need to worry as it can be completely cured by timely treatment and chances for the complication is less. I suggest you to consult a general practitioner and do the following things:  1. Simple analgesics like Paracetamol or Ibuprofen for pain.  2. Antihistamines like Cetrizine or Levocetirizine would provide symptomatic relief.  3. Nasal decongestants like Xylometazoline if you have blocked nostrils.  4. A short course of antibiotics like Amoxicillin for five to seven days can be taken.  5.

It looks golden color in sunshine and I have also one or two white hairs in my head. When I was 16, all my hair was dark black. What should I do now to get their natural hair color back?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See the color of hairs and skin is determined by a pigment called melanin. The variation of this pigment varies from person to person due to their genetics or due to some environmental reasons. One to two white hairs are not a problem but you must be aware because your beard starts losing its pigmentation. There might be many reasons for this problem like lack of nutrients, paternal effects as if your father or grandfather had been gone through the same problem, stress, lack of proper sleep, or unhealthy lifestyle. As you are young, you can prevent this problem further by adopting all these simple remedies: 1. The formation of coloring pigment named melanin is based on many nutrients, so start taking a healthy diet. Add fresh fruits, vegetables, pulses, eggs, etc., to your diet. Avoid excessive tea, coffee, cold drinks, junk food, spicy food, etc. 2. Sleep adequately at least for six to eight hours and make sure you go to bed before midnight. 3. Avoid taking excessive stress. 4. Start taking tablet Kesha kuntal (vyas pharma) two tablets two times a day for four weeks with water. It is very effective in premature greying of hair. 5. Take tablet Hairbac two tablets bd for four weeks with water. It will prevent premature greying of hair. 6. Take some curry leaves and put them into coconut oil, boil this oil. After boiling when this oil becomes lukewarm apply this oil on your beard and scalp. You can do this twice or thrice a week. 7. Wash your hairs with mild herbal shampoo. Try all these regularly and it will prevent further greying of your hair and you will soon feel positive results. In case you want to use a dye for your beard or hair or you are facing excessive greying of hairs then do consult a nearby dermatologist, otherwise, try all these regularly. I hope this helps.

Even in the evening, I mean without in sun rays it also looks red. I am a 20-year-old male.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. There might be many reasons for turning your skin red while going outside. Most common reasons may include that your skin is very sensitive and whenever you go outside your skin is not able to tolerate the external heat and produces heat stress to your skin and skin turns red. To avoid this condition drink lots of water and keep your skin hydrated. This will help you to avoid this problem up to some extent. During the daytime, it might be due to UV (ultraviolet) rays of the sun. It does not matter whether it is a sunny day or cloudy day the UV rays reach the earth and have effects on your skin. This might be one of the reasons behind red skin. So apply sunscreen lotion while going outside whether it is sun or clouds. You can choose any sunscreen lotion of any reputed brand. Apply half an hour ago while going outside. If only sensitive skin is the reason behind your redness then you can also apply aloe vera gel twice a day. It is very helpful for sensitive skin and helps a lot with your problem. If it is stress or anxiety induced redness then try to keep calm your mind and body and sleep adequately. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables, it will help to keep hour skin hydrated and healthy. Redness can be mild, moderate or severe. If it is in mild form and does not causing you any other harm then, try all these and you will see very positive results very soon. But sometimes it might be due to some hormonal problem or some other underlying problem. In that case you need to visit a nearby dermatologist for treatment. I hope this helps.

Her hearing levels are only very slightly below normal and it is not impacting her day to day in a noticeable way so, for the moment, the audiology team are just monitoring it. My worry is that I accidentally caused it when she was a baby. There was one time when she was a young baby (maybe 2 months old) and she was in a rear facing car seat in the front of my car, i.e her ears were near the speakers at the front of the car. I turned the engine on and the radio blasted out really loud, I think it was probably on volume 12 or 13. I turned it down straight away and she did not cry but now I feel awful that I may have damaged her hearing. Please could you tell me how likely it is a one-off incident like this would have caused it?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I understand your worry. I would say it is possible to develop such a hearing loss due to what we call acoustic trauma, noise-induced. However, we can never be sure whether the loss is due to that incident or due to some other or if the loss was congenitally present. What you can do to prevent further deterioration is prevent her from listening to loud music, keep her away from loud sounds, try and use noise isolation buds when there is excessive noise outside, eat a healthy diet and meditate. Rather than worrying about what could have caused the loss, I think it will be prudent to prevent any further damage to the ear and guide your daughter on the right path to achieve what she wants to.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having cervical fusion 3 levels 5/17. I am on 8 mg of Suboxone daily. I told the surgeon that I do not want opioids. Can I stay on 8 mg up to the surgery morning? I do not want to stop and have withdrawals or take any opioids before or after the procedure.","Doctor":"Hi..  Suboxone (Buprenorphine) is given to treat opioid dependence. Prozac is an antidepressant. I think because of your disease process, cervical radiculopathy in your case, you have been taking some pain killers mostly opioids for a long time. Doctor might have prescribed Suboxone to take you off opioid dependence. Suboxone can cause a certain amount of drowsiness and has potential to interact with many drugs to cause side effects some of which may be significant. The decision on continuing Suboxone and Prozac until the day of surgery should be taken in discussion with your surgeon and anesthesiologist. It also depends on what anesthesia they are going to use during surgery. It also depends on ur respiratory system, how well it is functioning. Your fear is that if put on opioid again post surgery, you may get addicted again. Be assured that as long as you are under medical supervision and adhere to instructions addiction potential will be less. As far as my knowledge goes they will definitely consider stopping Suboxone before surgery. Because if this is continued further analgesics prescribed post surgery may not work. Do not be scared. Discuss with your surgeon and anesthesiologist and they will suggest what is best for your health."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have horror mornings. After I open my eyes and I get out the bed (only after I stand up) I start sneezing maybe 20 times. I have itchy eyes and years and runny. I feel like I have sand in my eyes. I have done prick tests for allergies and all come back negative. I also have done nasal cornettes turbino reduction and all in vain. My mornings are the same. What is the cause of this?","Doctor":"Hello. Allergic rhinitis is a perrinial manifestation of allergic reactions to unknown triggers. Also you may have coexisting allergic conjunctivitis. Though, Prick test is negative for most of the allergens, we can not neglect the role of unknown allergies in your case. So I advise you to do blood allergy test with All Full Panels including environmental, food, drugs and medicines, vegetarian and non vegetarian foods, fungus, pollens, etc.Definitely we will be able to find out the single cause for your allergy.  About medications, all drugs whatsoever you take, are only helpful symptomatically. So as long as you take medication you feel good. But there is no choice as there is no permanent cure for allergies. So I advise you to start T. Montelukast 10mg one at night, continue Rhinocort Nasal spray, and T. Claritin, it is must to repeat blood allergy test as Prick test can not test all available allergens and and role of unknown allergens can not be neglected. So avoiding the known trigger Allergen and continuing the symptomatic treatment is the best solution for your problem. Continuous scrutiny must be going on to find out exact allergens in your surroundings."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What is this black mark and white spot?

The most common ones being - wax impinging on the ear-drum, sudden, loud noise, moving into a quiet room from a noisy environment and so on. You say it started after a bath. Even water, soap, hair follicles within your ear, when come in contact with the ear-drum can cause such ringing sensation, although for a short duration. This might have even attracted your attention to a symptom which might have been there even before, but was not noticeable. Sometimes, the medications you are on also can cause this ringing sensation. To be honest, there are lots of causes but no sure way of evaluating it. So, my suggestion - try diverting your thoughts away from this and try concentrating on some other work. When your thoughts are deeply immersed in something else, you will realise that you can hear the ringing sensation only if you think about it. You can also listen to music with ear-phones, with the volume of your device between 30-60% to get your mind off it. But please don’t do this all day. Give a gap of atleast an hour after listening for about 30 minutes. Also, it will probably not bother you when you are involved in a conversation with somebody, keeping your mind off it. All said, there are certain rare causes also, which require systematic treatment, but I wouldn’t want you to worry about them right away. This symptom of yours has started all of a sudden and in all probability might disappear spontaneously as well.

Is this harmful to my health?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I understand your concern. Unfortunately yes, this is harmful to your dental and overall health.  Bruxism (teeth grinding or night grinding) is not a condition but one of the main symptoms of TMJ disorder. This could be a temporomandibular joint (TMJ) issue. Temporomandibular joint is the jaw joint between the upper jaw and lower jaw and involves multiple and complex structures like a disc between two jaws, chewing muscles, and the joining bone structure.  A complete TMJ and dental evaluation should be done to determine what is causing your bruxism. It could be because of  1. Tensed chewing muscles  2. Disparity in the disc  3. Changes in jaw bone structure.  Other than TMJ issues psychological stress, malaligned teeth, multiple dental treatments, and recent dental injury or infection could also cause this jaw condition. Visit a TMJ specialist to identify the cause.  Initially, a splint similar to a nightguard (called deprogrammer appliance) will be suggested as a diagnostic appliance to identify the cause. Once the cause is determined, the treatment depends on it. Untreated bruxism may lead to multiple enamel chip outs, weak teeth, and gums and generalized tooth sensitivity. So please visit your dentist as soon as possible and get it treated.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I do have constant headache, sometimes due to toothache (gum disease, no hole) or nothing.

I live a sedentary lifestyle with very little or no exercise. I do not smoke, and I do not diet, I am taking normal oily currys with bread.

It goes back to normal when he walks for a little bit. We run some tests, and I would like a specialist to look at them. We consulted a cardio doctor but I am not sure they know what is wrong. So, I have the lab results and I need a doctor to give me more information on what they mean and what possible directions we could take. I also want to share the list of drugs they gave him so far.","Doctor":"Hi. Gone through the reports you provided (attachment removed to protect patient identity). He is having diabetes. Reports suggest that he is having blockages in leg arteries and also in heart arteries. Doctors have started on anti-platelet drugs and cholesterol lowering drugs. Prescription looks okay. Further I will suggest be on all these medications. If his toes does not improve within 2 to 4 weeks he may need a procedure to open the limb artery blockages. As he is not having any heart related symptoms like chest pain, breathing difficulty can wait and watch for heart issue with continuation of prescribed medications."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 46 years old, on no medication apart from Zinc daily that seems to help with my low testosterone. BP averages about 110/63 mmHg, resting pulse between 58 and 65 bpm. My height is 5' 10\\" and weigh about 75 kg. About five years ago, I noticed odd heart rhythms after playing two hours of badminton. I ignored them for months, but one day after stopping and bending over I had a large clonk in my heart and it took off like a rocket (about 140bpm), after five to ten minutes it clonked back to normal speed. This happened about four times over two to three weeks, and has never happened again for the past four years. I had a stress test, 12 lead ECG and echo and two weeks Holter. All was fine and no more SVT's. I had a repeat ECG and echo a few months ago, and all is well apart from the odd strong ectopic. I do however still have an issue, every now and then (like the past two weeks) for no reason at all my heartbeat becomes very strong (still steady and not fast in the 60's at rest), and I feel it almost all the time to the point I can see my handshake to my heartbeat whilst holding a phone, etc. I feel fine, but it is very hard to relax and sleep as it is banging really hard. I am generally aware of my heartbeat, but this is on a different level. It is not linked to stress or any external influence that I know of, and I have checked my BP whilst it feels strong and it is the usual 110/60. My question is, are there any physical reasons for this (e.g. my dad had angina and triple bypass), and is there anything I can do to help it? Also, if I had blocked arteries would the ECGs, stress test and echo's have picked this up at all? I was offered beta-blockers by my GP which I refused as my heartbeat is not fast.","Doctor":"Hi.  It seems that all the tests you had are reassuring. What you are describing seems to me as ectopics and a small dose of beta blockers could help. But if the resting heart rate is less then 65 bpm then better to avoid them. In this case, if the ectopics burden is very high they can be ablated.  Stress tests (except exercise ECG) will pick up old infarct resulted from blocked arteries. I doubt that this is the case here."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 38-year-old male.

It works when you use it and its effect lasts for few hours to days.  Now coming to the habit to overcome this includes daily exercise or morning walk for at least 40 minutes.

Looking into your problem ,one of the reason you have yourself mention that weight increased and had heel pain . You have said you were having hyperthyroidism and after medication you got recovered. Those patient having hyper also tend to go into hypo too. Since you were hyper and after medication your level decreased might be normal and with meditation it must have gone below the normal . In hypothyroidism, you may be gaining weight.You may fail to lose weight despite ramping up exercise and reducing calories. Neuropathy: Low levels of thyroid hormone can result in nerve damage, called neuropathy\uFEFF characterized by tingling and numbness in the extremities. A painful foot condition known as plantar fasciitis may also develop in your feet, caused by edema (fluid buildup) around the nerves. So i recommend you to do X ray of foot to see any bony spur . Check thyoid level TFT Precursor 1)Use Silicon Heel pad in your shoe to support your heel ,it helps reduces friction . I will follow up and plan treatment after those reports. Thank you"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I went for a regular dental cleaning today and the periodontist is strongly recommending local surgery to remove some muscle between my lower lip and gum. He scheduled it as a frenectomy and insists it needs to be done to prevent further gum loss as he says the muscle is above the gum and not below where it should be and is pulling at the gums. He says its a 30 minutes procedure. I needed some advice on what to expect in terms of what the process will be? What to expect on the day and after? How painful it is likely to be? And whether it is likely to cause any sort of facial deformity? The periodontist insists it will not be painful as I will be on anesthetic measure, but I could really use a second opinion as I am not finding much online regarding this process. Would it be advisable to get it done or should I refuse to go for it? Please also advise on what to expect. The periodontist recommended taking three days off work which has scared me a little about how big procedure this is compared to what he is telling me?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I have gone through your query and understand your concern.  If you pull down your lower lip, you will see a small stretch of muscle connecting your lip to the gums just below your lower front teeth. This small flap of skin and muscle is called the frenulum. Frenectomy is a minor surgery that removes this small bit of tissue. This procedure is advised if the frenum is highly attached to the gums. It constantly pulls our gums down on every lip movement. This leads to premature gum recession and early tooth loss. This process will be much faster especially in the lower tooth because they are the smallest tooth and have little gums surrounding them.  On the day of the procedure, the frenulum and the gums surrounding it will be anesthetized and the highly attached frenulum will be gently snipped and the remaining tissues will be repositioned and sutured. This will be a minor procedure after which you will be put under antibiotics and painkillers for the next three days.  The next three days to a week will be your healing period during which, it is better you avoid or limit talking and lip movements. You can take three days off so to facilitate easy healing. These three days off is not because of the procedure but because of the sensitivity of those small muscles which is in the process of healing. This will not cause any major changes to your facial and lip structure.  If your frenulum is causing lower gum recession, I recommend you to get frenectomy done soon to prevent future gum recession and tooth loss.  I hope this clears all your concerns."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Is this normal? How long does it normally take until it starts getting better? Should I go back to my dentist tomorrow? I take Ibuprofen but it only lasts for two to three hours. I am also using Chlorhexamed forte.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I understand your concern. The loosely attached swollen gums over the wisdom tooth is called as pericoronitis. The age of eruption of wisdom teeth is from 17 to 21 years. Beyond that, if the wisdom tooth has not erupted or half erupted gives out pain or swelling, it is highly likely to be locked inside the jaw.  Since they are the last ones to erupt, most of them do not get enough space to erupt and tries anyways and this causes jaw pain, swelling and sometimes the surrounding structures like same side temple, ear and throat also gives out pain. This wisdom tooth is called an impacted tooth. During the first visit, antibiotics and painkillers will be prescribed. The swelling will come down eventually but if that is impacted, it may not come down. Please visit your dentist and get an x-ray of your wisdom tooth to check whether there is enough space for it to erupt and to check whether it is erupting in the right direction. Taking painkillers and antibiotics will help to control pain and swelling but if the tooth is impacted, this will not be a permanent solution. You may require wisdom tooth removal.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have slight BP and high cholesterol. I am looking to do cardiovascular exercise. I have a concern about the spinning cycle.

I have seen a few pages on the same as well. I am afraid if I could do cycling. What is your advice?","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to icliniq.com.  If you are a beginner then do not start with intense or advance workout. Choose an exercise and then slowly start it and as time passes increase its duration and holding position. Any exercise which intensely starts show harmful effects on the organs of body and overall health.  Always involve a proper healthy diet along with exercise. Just exercise without proper diet has minimal effect on health instead of it sometimes shows harmful side effects. It is better for you to start with light jogging then develop its pace, and after a month go for particular workout. Specific workout also starts slowly and then develop its pace and strength.  If you have already weakness in your body and have other health issues like cardiac, etc., then do not do exercise without proper consultation with your doctor about the present and past history of illness.

After 12 days in the hospital, they took my embryo and sample from my husband and we choose blastocyst for embryo transfer. It was planned after five days of sample collection. Hospital did the sonography before one day of embryo transfer and they told, at this point transfer is not possible due to your ovary size is big. We asked for the report and they told its volume is around 385. Now they are telling, we have to free my sample and need to wait until my ovary size becomes normal. After that we have to start for the next cycle with the new cycle cost. We asked for the reason if we transfer with the present condition then what will be the risk? They explained that it might be dangerous to the mother if I get pregnant. I am a little bit confused now. What should I do? I have done all the precautions which they explained. I took leave for 20 days to complete this cycle with success. But at last the hospital is telling we have to wait and need to start a new cycle. IVF cycle cost is really high.

I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. The loose gummy flap should be caused by any trauma and in my opinion, it is getting injured every time you bite by the lower front teeth. That could be the reason for not healing. Instead of plain Vitamin C, I advise you to take multivitamin tablets available in the store as it helps in better healing.  Also, I advise you to apply ointment Dentogel 20 mg thrice daily on the sore area. Do not rinse it off with water immediately, but leave it in place for 15 minutes at least. Since you said it has been there for four months, I reckon you visit the dentist straight to check if there is any particular sharp tooth that hurts that part of your gums.

I think the doctors do not know what is really wrong and are experimenting on him? Recently he is telling lies, stealing and defiant. He does get agitated at times and shows aggression and has become very impatient. Also, he struggles to sleep. He was much better before he was put on all these medications. What could be wrong?","Doctor":"Hi. The medications seem to be for ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and bipolar disorder with psychotic features. He should be managed only by a psychiatrist. Aggression is a part of ADHD. The Ritalin (Methylphenidate hydrochloride) can cause sleep difficulties. And lithium levels should be monitored very closely. I am not sure if all of these steps are being taken. Please refer to our psychiatrist at icliniq for further recommendations. Do not discontinue any of these medications abruptly. ADHD and bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Hyperthyroidism, liver function test and blood counts (CBC) should be done when on lithium. Lithium levels should be monitored for at least every three months. Continue these medicines for now. Do not abruptly discontinue them.

He has been taking Olanzapine and Depakote for the past eight years, which has stabled him a lot. But, he suffers from panic attack when he stays with a group of people. His key worker and psychiatrist are recommending him to start using Clozapine. I am really concerned as I have been told that Clozapine should be prescribed only when no other drug has worked. My doubt is why cannot he have anxiety tablets? Can I have some information about this drug as we are planning for a family life? I am quite worried about the side effects. I am looking for some advice. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug. It means that it is one of the relatively newer drugs discovered to be helpful in paranoid schizophrenia. Clozapine also has lesser side effects and is considered more effective than the typical or older antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia. Since your partner is still having anxiety in presence of others, Clozapine will be helpful. However, Clozapine still has a few side effects to be watched out for. Some of them are reduction in the number of the white blood cells, cardiac toxicity, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, drooling of saliva when sleeping and weight gain. These side effects last only as long as one is taking Clozapine. Since you are planning for a child, it is important to know that many male patients taking Clozapine have experienced cessation of ejaculation during orgasm. But, it has not been documented in drug guides. Having written all that, your partner may have more or less of the side effects mentioned above. Thus, I would say that he may start taking Clozapine and see how he reacts to it for some time. Please consult with his doctor to know any other alternatives will be very helpful.

I had a few glasses of wine from day 0 to day 20. A total of six maybe and one glass and a half on day 20. I also took corticosteroids (Betamethasone) a single dose of 3 mg due to an allergic reaction on day 20. And as if this was not enough, I was also on antibiotics (Flucloxacillin) which I finished on day 24 of pregnancy. I am so afraid all of this might have had an impact on the baby. Is there a risk my baby might have been affected?","Doctor":"Hello.  As you have not mentioned the date of your last menstrual period, I am assuming by day 0 you mean the starting date of last menstrual cycle. Because we calculate the pregnancy age from that date. So yes, the early pregnancy time is very important because the embryo is developing in that time period. So as per your query, as you mentioned the consumption of wine in the early three weeks, I do not think it is gonna have any effect on the embryo because it is in the preovulatory phase when even the egg is being formed and released. And yes, corticosteroid in high doses when used for chronic medical conditions can have a risk of cleft lip and palate, but a single shot taken for an allergic reaction should not be affecting the baby. Also, the Flucloxacillin is a penicillin group of drug which is usually safe in pregnancy. So be calm and stop worrying about the risks. It will just increase your stress levels. Moreover in early pregnancy, if any embryo is grossly affected by any insult, it either usually aborts early if the exposure has been hazardous, but if the exposure is nonhazardous, it makes through and the baby will be fine. This is called all or none phenomenon in pregnancy. So your exposure to the medications was not that is something very dangerous, so rest assured. And more over your pregnancy has reached until 6 weeks, that is a good sign that the embryo has not been affected by the exposure to the drugs you have been worrying about. Please consult your gynecologist for your antenatal checkup and investigations required to be taken as per your local protocols. USG (ultrasound) for dating and viability.

At the moment, I have only three grinding teeth on my upper. Two on the left and one on the right (numbers 4, 12 and 13). 11 days ago, the dentist reinstalled the crown on number four, but when I left his office there was no contact in number 4. There was only contact (occlusion) on 12 and 13. Of course, it was very difficult eating with only two teeth that had full contact. After a few days, I started to get a lot of pain in my neck and behind my ear and up almost to the top of my head on the side of number 4 (right side) and there was numbness in the area of my jaw joint (in front of my ear). I saw the dentist again four days ago and he added some type of material on top of number 4 to achieve occlusion there. I still have the pain constantly and it is pretty unbearable. 800 mg of Ibuprofen and Aspercreme on the area help me somewhat. I called the dentist and he said that the pain was related to some nerve problems inside the number 4 tooth. I have been thinking maybe there was some damage in my jaw or something because of my jaw having had overwork trying to make on the right side while eating. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi  I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. Firstly, I would like to ask you for what reason was the crown was placed for tooth 4. And usually, when there is no occlusion on one side, you will get pain and soreness on the opposite side. If the occlusion is high i.e. too high crown, the pain and soreness will be on the same side. Repairing the crown with extra material would not be ideal. If the occlusion is not there, the dentist must have given you a new crown in place.  Were there any x-rays taken for the same tooth? In that case, any nerve problem can be easily identified. Please do not worry that you got a jaw problem. It is with the construction of the occlusion which helps you to do normal function.  Ibuprofen 400 mg thrice daily should work well for this kind of pain. Heavy doses are not advisable. I reckon you check with the x-ray for that tooth if you have not had any before and forward it to me. I also request you to send the picture of the teeth so that I could arrive at a better diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been having trouble with my weight recently.

My first workout consists of 70 minutes of brisk walking, and 20 minutes of abdomen exercises afterward.

Your protocol for doing exercise workout is quite satisfactory but you can add 20 more minutes of aerobic exercise and resistance exercise combined.

Even though you work out well but not maintaining the diet then, you may not get the results that you need.  Proper vegetable diet is compulsory. Avoid non-vegetarian diet, bakery items, and outside junk foods which will reduce unwanted calories. Take homemade food whatever and how much ever you want.

My chiropractor found my stomach is pushed up very high, next to my esophagus. He was able to push it back down, but with a lot of painful force and manipulation. Ever since I have been getting sicker and sicker with episodes that are so debilitating that I can no longer work. They happened occasionally at first, but now three to four times each day (always upon weakening) and last for hours at a time. It begins in my mid-abdomen. I feel and see pulsating in my abdomen and get a wet sensation as though the fluid is leaking out of my chest or belly. If I push on that area (or usually all by itself), I get an instant rush of blood to my head and start to feel fuzzy. My face turns bright red and becomes so hot that I get nauseous. The redness sometimes stays, sometimes goes away. But what always follows immediately is intense heat throughout my whole body, like my spine, muscles, and nerves are on fire everywhere from my head to my palms to my mouth to the soles of my feet. Then I start to shake uncontrollably, with the shakes progressing into worse tremors in my left thigh and right biceps. The shaking definitely seems to start from the abdomen or groin area. If I press my thighs or groin or even touch them lightly, my legs increase in spasticity. When these episodes end, I feel completely wiped out (blurry vision and hard, tired muscles), but I never return to normal. I always feel shaky and not myself. I have been at the doctor's twice when these episodes were happening. The first time my BP was a bit high at 130 mmHg (usually I am spot on at 120/80 mmHg) and the other time my vitals did not change at all during the episode. Other information, possibly related: My left thigh and knee are filled with fluid, but my orthopedist attributes that to a popliteal cyst (is that the same as an aneurysm?) he found behind my knee. He gave me a Cortisone injection four days ago, but so far the swelling in the front of my thigh, my knee, and my calf have not gone down. I was also told that I have an umbilical hernia and two inguinal hernias. I also have a history of localized scleroderma, which I understand, can weaken the connective tissues and blood vessels. Recent blood tests for ANA and rheumatoid factor both came back negative. Not sure how that is possible when I was diagnosed with a positive ANA and localized scleroderma (Morphea) 25 years ago. I am very scared. Do you have any idea of what is happening to me? Or what tests I should have done? Not sure if this is GI related, vascular, rheumatology, etc. But I need to find a way to calm these spells so I can go back to work.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  Well, the symptoms do sound a bit different and something we need to look into.  As per the issues, I hope they have looked into any form of venous obstruction i.e. super vein obstruction. Any compression on that vein can cause the face to turn red and a bit of low blood pressure. But it is a very rare thing to happen. A CT (computed tomography) of the chest would be advisable to rule out this compression causing the symptoms.  But yes, it does not explain what is happening in your legs. The symptoms do see to be of hypersensitivity. Do these symptoms happen after a hot water bath as well? Do you feel any shock-like sensation from the neck below?  For the popliteal cyst, it is a bakers cyst. It is totally different from aneurysm, as aneurysm will be pulsating and moreover it is a very unusual site for it to happen. Normally, it does respond to injection Cortisone, but sometimes if the injection does not go in the right place it can persist. You may need to repeat the injection after a month or so incase it is persisting.  As for localized scleroderma, it is a benign form and ANA can go negative at times. We can either call it a lab error or at times the body does act through to make it negative. How much has been the skin extent in your scleroderma though?  To summarize, we need to figure out a cause for your symptoms. Scleroderma does not explain it. We need to see if it is an SVC (superior vena cava) obstruction. Of the rarest cause, with the spasticity happening in your legs on touching I would like to rule out any brain condition as well. These sound like paroxysmal dyskinesia.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a tooth extraction in the past to replace that I had opted for a bridge. As a result, the tooth beside my missing tooth was drilled to some extent. After having that just in a span of one month a part of the bridge is chipped out. I could not chew hard food from that canine and also if I eat some sweet that bridge part gives me sensitivity and there is also one thing which I feel is the side of my face (right profile) where my bridge is present is saggy. There have been so many problems because of the bridge. Now when I look back I wish I had opted for the inbuilt one. So my question is, Is it possible to replace the bridge by an inbuilt? I am wondering how would the side teeth which have been carved be fixed? Please let me know.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I have gone through your query and understand your concern. Yes, it is possible to replace your faulty bridge with an inbuilt type of replacement (Implants). The nearby tooth which was reduced for support needs root canal treatment. During bridge replacement, the nearby tooth is reduced or shaped to some extent for supporting the missing tooth crown. While shaping, most of the tooth enamel goes away and this causes tooth sensitivity.  Ideally, a root canal treatment should be done prior to bridge placement to avoid such sensitivity issues. Underlying bone availability and quality should be studied prior to implant placement to avoid sagging issues. You will require a full mouth x-ray (OPG) for this. Please visit an Implantologist with your x-ray and get to know which implant type best suits your bone quality.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old female.

(attachment removed to protect patient identity).  This is frontal hair loss. It will be of great help if you can send me a picture taking from above.

This began five months ago along with unilateral tinnitus of the left ear. Tinnitus is constant. Eyesight is rapidly deteriorating. I had several new glasses prescriptions that help slightly with the double vision but are not completely resolved. I recently had an MRI of the pituitary without contrast. In the last year, I had to have two colonic polyps removed but I fear that cancer was missed. I believe I have secondary metastases in my brain. I also performed FBC, CRP, and CEA tests.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  There is no need to panic about your brain. The double vision is not related to any neurological disorder. Anyway, I would recommend checking the thyroid hormone levels.   Regarding the tinnitus, it seems to be related to an inner ear infection as there is a presence of inflammation in the left mastoid sinus right next to the left ear. For this reason, I recommend consulting with an ENT specialist.  Regarding the double vision, I would also recommend performing repetitive nerve stimulation in order to investigate for possible Myasthenia gravis syndrome.

Is that combo possibly effective sometimes they say it might be by adding one. I know they have there nasty side effects though. Would you recommend taking it long term or one month until antidepressant takes effect or what, I am so confused.","Doctor":"Hello. I can imagine how hard it is for you to be in this situation. Depression takes a toll on us in the worst ways possible, you should appreciate yourself to be able to reach out to get help, because many people cannot even find the strength or awareness to reach this point. You are correct that only medications will not be able to pull you out from this. However, you need to continue medication atleast for 6-8 months even after you start feeling better because that's the minimum duration required for medication to balance the neurotransmitters involved and to be able to prevent the relapse. Secondly, I would suggest you to start counseling therapy session. What you can do is start therapy online. Most of my patients who are not yet willing to go out every week and travel to a therapist opt for therapy sessions online. Psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy will help you with your thoughts and getting a control over the negative thought patterns which are keeping you in the loop of negativity and Depression. Medications when combined with therapy is going to show good and faster results."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Pain started in my back after 2 months of delivery but now it is all over the body majorly at right side. Currently, having depression medication for the past six months and my doctor adviced me to consult a neurologist as physical pain and muscle weakness is not going away.","Doctor":"Hello.  I read carefully your question and reviewed your X-ray report. Your X-ray shows a normal vertebral column, just muscle spasm (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Coming to this point, I would recommend performing regular physical activity to help reinforce your back muscles and help relieve the muscle spasm. I would also recommend taking a muscle relaxant (Flexeril) to help reduce the muscle spasm. If this does not help, I would suggest considering also fibromyalgia as a possible cause underlying the muscle pain. It is also necessary checking vitamin D plasma levels and magnesium plasma levels for possible deficiency. Another treatment option to consider would be Gabapentine or Doluxetine."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is 17 years old. She had a cold for about four days when she started complaining of bad ear pain. She was seen in urgent care a week ago and was diagnosed with a middle ear infection. The APRN noted her ear was pretty angry and prescribed Amoxicillin 500 mg. She is supposed to take two pills in the morning and two at night, which she has. She also suggested to continue Mucinex D (which is how I was treating the cold). Her severe ear pain did resolve in a day or two, but she still complains of ear pain intermittently. I am worried about taking Mucinex D for so long, but even if she does not take it she complains of ear pain. She is also saying that she cannot hear out of the ear. To be fair, she says the pain is not as bad initially, but I am still worried. I gave her a Claritin last night thinking it may help, but it just made her stuffy. I know we still have three days on the antibiotic, but should it be completely cleared up by now? Should I take her back to the doctor? Or try something else?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  Complete the course of antibiotics. Take Mucinex D (Guaifenesin) once or twice a day, like how you have been taking for another three to four days. If Mucinex D has an antiallergic component then no need for Claritin or Allegra. Otherwise, add either of those to be taken once a day. This will help to clear out ear secretions.  Let water not enter the ear while bathing. Let her take rest and refrain from going to school or playing until she is better. After the course of antibiotics gets over it will be prudent to show the ENT specialist once so that he can look into the ear with an otoscope and check if the problem has resolved or not."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I understand that high levels of anxiety and panic attacks can be debilitating and needs to be properly managed. Your doctor is correct in informing you that Valium and Oxazepam are not appropriate in this situation as they will make the situation worse. If anxiety is persistent, discuss with your doctor about trying SSRIs or SNRIs type of medication. You have mentioned about trying different medication before. There are different options like Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Escitalopram, etc. Based on your assessment and tolerability your doctor can prescribe appropriate medication and dosage. Try Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation exercise atleast once daily to help to manage stress levels. Avoid caffeinated drinks, alcohol and other drugs which can worsen panic symptoms. Finally, consider having CBT therapy/counselling which is known to be effective in managing anxiety and panic attacks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby is 4 weeks old. I fed her a combination of breast milk and formula milk. I changed her formula to enfalac from friscolac slowly, and started solely on enfalac yesterday afternoon. I changed the milk (upon consulting with the pediatric clinic) because she was having constipation and gassy stomach. My baby had watery stool once yesterday and today (only after being completely on enfalac). She also is quite gassy (most days than not) and gets upset with it (cries last about 10 minutes). My worry is that if she is okay and, does the enfalac formula milk agree with her or she struggling with something else. I had to add formula milk due to insufficient supply of breast milk.","Doctor":"Hi. Breast milk is definitely best and first choice but as it is insufficient and you need to supplement with formula feeds, all these formula milk are cow's milk. It is not clear from your query- which Enfalac formula you are giving as there are so many different types and also in the powder form and in ready to feed one. Watch it with the same formula milk for next 24 hours, feed more on breast feeding, and keep a watch on urine output. It may settle down slowly. If not then get, stool test - routine analysis, give Pedialyte - 15- 20 ml after each loose motion (give as small small sips), and better to give a milk formula which is HA (hypoallergic) like Similac or Nan or any other."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am schizophrenic but recovered. I would like to know what next after recovering symptomatically, functionally and cognitively over 2 years now. Do I get to gradually taper off my medications? Do I get back the level of energy I had during my pre-psychotic period before my first relapse?","Doctor":"Hello. Good to know that you have recovered from Schizophrenic episode. You can gradually improve your functioning by following a bio-psycho-social rehabilitation model. If this is first episode psychosis, many guidelines suggest continuing antipsychotics for 1-2 years after remission of symptoms. Discuss with your doctor about gradually reducing Olanzapine. It needs to be done very cautiously under supervision and monitoring to prevent any relapse of psychotic symptoms. If you had already had a relapse, it is advisable to continue on antipsychotic medication for a longer period at the lowest possible effective dose. So there is no straight answer to your question about tapering medication. Apart from medication, try to get some therapy/counselling to help you manage with sustained recovery. Also try to gradually get back into education /training or some job to improve your functioning. Take it easy during the remission period. Also ensure that you follow a healthy diet, sleep adequately and exercise regularly. Hope this helps.

It is commom to have white spots over the enlarged tonsils. Unless the tonsil is inflammed or it is troubling you, it is not required for you to take any antibiotics or painkillers. You can follow the advice given below: 1. Salt water gargles atleast 8 to 10 times a day for 1 month.  2. Avoid oily spicy and cold food/beverages.  3. Keep sipping on boiled warm water every 3 hours. Tonsils have some crevices on it what we call as crypts, food particles can often get lodged in those crypts which often appear to be white spots. If there is excessive accumulation, over time they can get calcified to form stones what we call as tonsilloliths. All precautionary measures have to be followed as much as possible to prevent infection of the tonsils."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Persistent sore throat, that feels deep in the back of my throat along with dry mouth for the past two months.

Do you have history of sneezing, watering of eyes, nasal discharge. Do you have headaches with heaviness of head and thick nasal discharge which is sinusitis. So the infection to throat can be due to spread of infection from either nose or from acid reflux from the stomach, these two things can affect throat even without infections of throat per se.

Chondromalacia patella is just a softening of knee cartilage. It will strengthen with exercises and medication and it will get better. Chondromalacia itself can take three to six months to get better at earliest if the exercises are strictly done and followed. Exercises will make your cartilage stronger and it will cure chondromalacia. You can take Repacoll bioactive collagen peptides till pain reduces and then stop as per your doctor's advice. Best is to do exercises and have an active lifestyle and take medication only when pain is unbearable. Chondromalacia would not cause any problem with pregnancy.

He says he spits out mixture and not to swallow. Is this even possible or safe especially since dental work is so expensive?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I appreciate you for such an interesting question on dental health.  Talking about the two chemical components separately. Baking soda is found to be a great alternative in whitening the teeth as it has mild abrasive quality. It is also found that baking soda has seven on the RDA scale (radioactive dentin abrasion) compared to the regular toothpastes which ranges 200-300. Just a sprinkle of it on the toothpaste in your regular brushing helps in whitening the teeth. But this is not proved on the papers by research.  Coming to Trisodium phosphate, it is one of the ingredients present in less percentage in the toothpastes which is chemically basic and removes stains. But it is a commercial agent used as degreaser and stain remover otherwise.  The problem using these chemicals in dental cleaning is that you will not be sure how much percentage of the active chemical components you expose on the tooth surfaces in the DIY (do it yourself) project. These might see effective but lack of studies and research making it unsuitable for daily usage. No standardization, therefore not used as commonly as a toothpaste. Also, continuous and prolonged exposure of these on the teeth might end up in roughness of the enamel and a hence weaker teeth.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

She suggested going for hysterectomy as there is no other effective cure in allopathy. But I am not interested in undergoing surgery. While searching for an alternative, I stumbled upon a study conducted by an ayurvedic doctor, which claims that uterine fibroids got cured or reduced in size by taking certain ayurvedic medicines. I got excited and contacted the doctor through email and she prescribed certain medicines (the details are at the end of this mail). I took those medicines religiously. The doctor also told me to take two more scans in the subsequent months. I am attaching all the three scan reports, but there was no improvement in my heavy bleeding condition and urination issue. In the meantime, the doctor got transferred to another ayurvedic hospital and now I am unable to reach her. Right now, I am not under any medical treatment except taking Trapic 650 tablet during the periods to arrest the excess bleeding. After seeing your advice to a woman patient with a similar condition, my hope has got rekindled. I would like to ask you the following questions: Are uterine fibroids completely curable under Siddha? I will be consulting only you as I do not want to mix different streams of medicines. I would appreciate it if, after seeing my reports, you could let me know how long it would take to get relief from excessive bleeding and to get completely cured of fibroids? Apart from this chat, is it also possible to talk to you over the phone? Details of Ayurvedic medicines taken: Amycordial Syrup\\t5 ml for two months, Varanadi Kashaya\\t5 ml one and a half months, Shigru Guggulu for two months, Kanchanara Gugulu tablet for 20 days, Nityananda Rasa tablet for 20 days, Hingvashtaka churna one teaspoon for 20 days, Haridra Khand two teaspoons for 15 days.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I have treated many fibroid uterus cases. Most of them became asymptomatic with a reduction in the size of the fibroid, and surgery idea was withdrawn. Smaller the size faster and complete disappearance of the fibroids. Medium to large sizes have reduced in size, but they would become asymptomatic within one month period. They need six months of therapy. In your case, it is the medium size one. Please take the following medicines: Capsule Rasaganthi mezhugu one in the morning one and one at night with buttermilk after food, tablet Chitthira moola kuligai one in the morning and one at night after food, Van kumari legium (buy 200 gm) take 5 gm (one spoon) in the morning and evening before food. These drugs are available in South Indian states. M2 tone tablet two in the morning and two at night after food.  Apart from these drugs, a few home remedies to be done:  1) Vaazhai poo (banana flower) to be fried or any other dishes daily two times. 2) Uthiya mara pattai and naval mara pattai buy these barks one kg. Take 25 grams of each, then add eight tumblers of water. Boil it to reduce to four tumblers. This is the kashayam. Then drink one tumbler kashayam in the morning, one in the afternoon and one at night in an empty stomach. If not possible in afternoon (due to office work), then take that dose in evening. Please buy these drugs and herbals and try them for one month. If you do not feel any improvement, then continue it for the next three months. You may require three to six months of treatment. If you do not find any improvement in one month, then I advise surgery."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to know how bad or serious is type II (Galassi) arachnoid cyst located on the left temporal lobe? Can it be responsible for mood fluctuations, depression and/or panic attacks? There are no clear symptoms, but only mild depression (also had recent changes in life and my father died) and anxiety. No strong pain, only a minor one when my heart pounds fast. But I have to pay attention in order to feel it, it is very subtle. I am currently taking mild anti-stress natural medication and a quarter tablet of Betaloc-ZOK 50 mg in the evening to lower my pulse. I have done my MRI also.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  There are no clear evidence in the literature favoring arachnoid cyst as a primary cause of any psychiatric disturbances. Having said that its size does affect the lobe functions if it is compressing it. So basically if you have symptoms that are not responding to the medical line of treatment then only you should opt for a surgical option."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My probleam is my tooth and the color of my tooth is completly brown, this happen becouse of flouride. Based on this is possible to remove brown colour to white and how much does it cost?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the picture attached along with your complaint (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have severe dental fluorosis along with severe external stains. It is definitely possible to get whiter teeth with the help of dental veneers. Firstly the procedure includes complete thorough cleaning of the stains. Secondly the teeth visible in your smile zone will have to be prepared (ground slightly on the front surfaces) to fix in the dental veneers. Coming to the cost of the procedure,there are two types of veneers. One is composite veneers which has to be done in the clinic manually by the dentist. But this has short life and a major disadvantage of discoloration. Two, ceramic dental veneers which have to be made in the laboratory and then fixed on the prepared teeth. Ceramic ones are much suitable for you as it can long last and hide the brownish colour of your present teeth to a greater extent but this is expensive than composite ones. Ceramic veneers have different price ranges and it depends on your dentist and the laboratory. Discuss with the your dentist about it and choose your best suited range."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 43 years old. I have been experiencing a burning and itching sensation while urinating for about three weeks now. I now have the same sensation when I ejaculate after sex, Also, when I squeeze my penis, there is pain along the lower part which feels like the pain is along the tract where urine and semen pass through. Please comment on what can I do about this? I think it must be due to unprotected sexual intercourse that I had a couple of times some weeks ago after which I stopped.","Doctor":"Hello.  Burning sensation in the urinary tract or urethra can most commonly be due to either infection of bladder or urethra, or any stone problem, which has either passed in the bladder kidney system causing infection thus burning. It can also be due to unprotected sexual intercourse which leads to the infection of the urethra.  The diagnosis of this condition is important before the treatment is started. Urine microscopy and sonography of abdomen and pelvis are initial urine and scanning modalities which are required for diagnosis. Physical examination by a urologist is also of paramount importance as something it is the best modality to detect the diagnosis. So I would advise you, for now, you take plenty of fluids as repeated urination can wash out the infection. But the above-mentioned test and physical examination are mandatory in your case.  As you have pain in passing semen also, it can be a prostate infection which again requires a per rectal examination by a urologist to see for prostate status."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 31 years old, before 16 years underwent anterior discectomy of c3c4&c4c5 with fusion. Even had neck pain and pain got radiated to neck and back while working. Suffering with pain for 16 years but I got used to it. But for past few months neck became very very week am not able to bare my head weight and not able to keep neck in straight position. Now for past 20-25 days having severe neck pain, weakness of full both hands and legs sometimes with numbness. Eye pressure and back head pain. I am not able to keep neck at straight position. Getting breaking sound if I rotate the neck. Neck movement is restricted. I have attached my recent MRI report, can you please tell me what is the actual issue with this.","Doctor":"Hi.  I have gone through your query and medical history along with the attached reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The problem does not seem to be due to the fused C3-4 or C4-5 levels. Infact a disc prolapse at C5-C6 with nerve compression is causing the present symptoms. I would suggest you to go for physiotherapy sessions including cervical traction along with neck strengthening passive and active exercises,SWD/IRT. It would always be better to avoid going through another surgery considering the post-operative complications. Hence, in my personal opinion, you should avoid a re-surgery and go for conservative line of management. Analgesics,anti-inflammatory tablets, hot fomentation and use of cervical soft collar will help. If the symptoms do not improve, you can consult an Orthopedist/Neurosurgeon for further management."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have not brushed my teeth in a while due to being incredibly busy, I am going to start taking my toothbrush with me. But anyways, I have some gaps in between my teeth and when I spit out after brushing my teeth there’s a bit of brown liquid in there. I do not know if that is just food or anything but I have not found anything else unusual.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. Firstly, the brownish colour every time you spit out after brushing could be the food debris along with some bleeding of gums. This is because of the white chalky substance layered on to the tooth surfaces on the gum lines which I had noticed in the picture you sent. These are cleanable and needs professional clean up from the dentist.Just simple brushing will not help get rid of it. Secondly please do not give excuses for not brushing your teeth. It is incredibly as important as you eat food everyday for your little tummy. Mouth is the starting point for digestion and only when you do not have a clean mouth, you automatically flush in all the bacteria into the stomach with every food. Plus any food debris which are not cleaned up stay in between the teeth and cause tooth decays as well. You have mentioned that you had a filling, which confirms that you had a decayed tooth. So kindly follow your brushing habits as a routine every morning and night with a pea sized neutral toothpaste.  Thirdly coming to the gaps between your front teeth, it is just the way your permanent teeth has erupted and nothing to do with the gum bleeding or not brushing, etc. It can be easily corrected with braces when you are much concerned on the looks. Otherwise your teeth looks healthy and you are completely alright (attachment removed to protect patient identity)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, The dentist thought my tooth had a fracture, so he put on a temporary crown. That worsened the pain and throbbing exponentially, so he sent me to an endodontist that said my tissue was extremely inflamed and needed a root canal ASAP. After the root canal, the regular dentist put on the permanent crown. I felt the throbbing again after he put the permanent crown on. I got a second opinion and the dentist #2 did an X-ray and noticed the crown did not cover my tooth fully. I went back to Dentist #1 who had to restart. He took the permanent crown off and put a temporary crown on again. But, he had thrown my original imprint away and waited to take a new imprint until after he removed my permanent crown. The temporary crown is on now and is tiny compared to my other teeth. It looks like a kernel of corn. Should he have taken the impression first before taking the permanent crown off? I worry my new permanent crown that comes in will be tiny.","Doctor":"Hello. Did you have any pain after completion of root canal procedure before permanent crown placement? How is the pain? Is it the same pain which you experienced before root canal? If the pain did not stop after completion of root canal and before crown placement, then it should be from the tooth. You should get back to your endodontist in this case.  Generally, a couple of days will be left as healing period before placement of crown. If the crown is placed immediately without allowing a period of healing, it hurts. If the pain started after placement of permanent crown, then you should visit your general dentist to check the status and fit of the crown. In this case, the crown needs some fine adjustments for a perfect fit and bite."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 40 years old. 20 years back I was diagnosed with Severe Aplastic Anemia (idiopathic), which was treated with ATG (With Prednisone/Cyclosporine). It took a good year to have a complete recovery, but it came back to 100 %. I have always lived a bit in the fear of Myelodysplasia, but 23 years later no issues other than cholesterol and high blood pressure. I am being follow by a family doctor and getting blood counts every 6 month, but my last hematologist consultation was a very long time ago and while my doctor is fantastic, I know that knowledge of hematology is complex. I am tracking by blood counts for the last 12 years. In the last 2 years, I develop my own concerns around some numbers that seems to trend on lower side. First is erythrocyte, which are 4.3 now. 13 years back I was consistently around 4.8, but my last blood count was 4.3. But after 5 years, it has never been above 4.5. I do not know if this is significant or not. But I know that our reference is 4.7 of the lower value. Average (13 bloods test) would be 4.53. My hemoglobin is at 132 now. My average would be 141, so the difference is not high, but I still wonder about if it is significant. Finally, Hematrocrit at 0.4, right under the low-level . It would average out a 0.41. Now a new contender appeared in the outside of normal ranges, and its the Granulocytes # (Immature) at 0.04 (reference is 0 - 0.03 10e9/L). Platelet are doing great with 183, so no challenges here. So in a way, all of these number are very close to the lower normal. I guess I am trying to figure out if I should investigate this further. I will see my doctor in a few weeks for a follow-up, but in our last appointment she did not see any issues there. In a way, I get her point but I am not sure when I should start asking for an hematologist reference. As for current medication, I am on Rosuvastatin (20mg), Ibersartan (300mg) for a few years already. But new to me is Allopurinol (200mg for now; still working on balance). My question is really about if the number above can indicate a trend, or not. I understand the body change as we are getting older, but I would like some opinion on this.","Doctor":"Hi. I reviewed all the documents you attached (attachment removed to protect ptient identity). I can feel your concern as I have closely followed many aplastic patients before. So, the fear or concern you have is genuine but I am happy to say that your CBC is wonderful. I am not bothered at all. The slight decline may be due to other reasons, sometimes diet, nutrition, laboratory variation, etc. I would advise you not to worry and just get a routine laboratory check as per your primary physician like 6 monthy or so. You completely recovered.  The only advice is to make sure when you start any new drug or take OTC drugs/ herbal medications, make sure they do not have side effects of bone marrow suppression. So, just be cautious. Rest you are doing good.Please text me any other concerns if you have."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My lateral incisor #7 fractured at the gumline and will likely require a surgical extraction. Also, while a temporary filling was provided after removal of pulp pending a root canal, the root canal was not done for many months due to an insurance lapse, and the tooth became infected as well as surrounding bone. I have read that some dental surgeons advocate for the removal of the periodontal ligament during extraction to facilitate healing and the proliferation of new bone cells, and that this must be done explicitly with a bone burr. I have read that this is common practice for \\"biologic\\" dentists and biologic dental surgeons, and uncommon otherwise. My Med-Cal / Denti-Cal providers are not \\"biologic\\" dentists. I have four questions. 1) How important do you think the complete removal of the periodontal ligament really is? 2) If the extraction is surgical vs. simple, is it likely that the ligament would be removed anyway? Perhaps because some extra surrounding bone may need to be removed? 3) If removal of the tendon is not standard practice by the dental surgeon, can I request it and would they know what to do and not be offended?, and finally 4) If an implant is contemplated, would the region of the removed tooth and perhaps some surrounding bone immediately be packed with a bone substitute for socket preservation? Or would the infection need to clear first?","Doctor":"Hello. There is nothing like \\"Biological\\" dentists as such, but you might be referring to Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Anyway the removal of root stump of a lateral incisor is a simple procedure and any dentists should do it. There is no separate removal of periodontal ligament, which usually is resorbed by the wound healing itself. In any case, if you are planning implant you should not be removing any surrounding bone at all to get maximum implant attachment and minimal bone graft."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is having severe chest pain and this has been the case every year during this period. She has consulted a lot many doctors and she took all the prescriptions as per them every year then it goes away only to reappear again during the next year. She is also being upset due to this pain. All antibiotics were given for gastric problems as said by various doctors. All the testing reports seem to be normal but the root cause of the problem is not identified (all doctors are just saying this to be some gastric problem). She is currently Pantoprazole DSR, Ferhub XT, and Clonamelt 0.5 mg.","Doctor":"Hi. You need to understand first of all that every chest pain should be taken as heart problems until proved otherwise. So if previously ECG (electrocardiography) has been done, you should get it done again. If the cardiac part is clear, I would say that she probably has perimenopausal symptoms. At her age hormone changes occur so chest heaviness, feeling of nervousness, and hot flushes can happen. I have treated my patients with such symptoms with the help of anxiolytic drugs. Get her cardiac evaluation, if normal discuss with your doctor to prescribe this medicine to her for a few weeks and see the results. I am very hopeful that it would work."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am male 40 years old, 187 cm and 100 kg. I have small wounds in my foreskin and it is red in color (looks irritated).

How can I stop this blood which is coming from my teeth and how can I strengthen them?","Doctor":"Hello.  Gum bleeding and gum recession or weakness is a sign of gum condition called gingivitis. Gingivitis is the inflammation of the gums caused due to constant irritation by tartar/calculus (hardened yellow deposits on the tooth). Food deposits or plaque that settles on tooth gets calcified on the long run and becomes hardened calculus deposit. Constantly irritated gums become weak and starts to bleed when we brush or in the morning time after waking up.  A professional scaling and polishing procedure is done by an ultrasonic scaler instrument to remove that calculus. Once removed, the gums take a day to heal and the gum bleeding will stop the next morning. Please visit your dentist and get this procedure done. This procedure can be done once in 6 months if required. Although we do a proper brushing every day, there are certain spots between teeth where the bristles fail to reach. Hence a professional tooth cleaning is always adviced once in a while. There are certain brushing techniques that can be followed to prevent calculus accumulation. Get to know that from you dentist and please do follow them.  1. Follow a healthy diet and lifestyle. 2. Get a dental checkup once in 6 months. (To diagnose any issues if present at the earliest). 3. Follow proper oral hygiene by brushing twice daily especially before bed and mouth rinsing after every meal.

Reduce caffeinated and fizzy drinks. Drinking alcohol can badly affect your liver and kidney functions. I recommend you to reduce your intake of alcohol to occasionally and better to avoid it. Regular check on blood pressure and sugar on a weekly basis and give your feedback to your following doctor. And you can do a kidney function test to see creatinine level every six months. If you do regular exercise it will add benefit generally and to your kidneys. So far as you are doing well and keep the follow up there should be no issues.

Does male semen create or causes any major or minor disease by its own when it is is contacting male ass. 2. Similar to the first question, what if the cum load (semen) was in the mouth. Does male semen create or causes any major or minor disease by its own when contracting mouth. 3. What if 2 male cum at the same time inside the ass of one person does the difference of DNAs in the two different semen cause/create/make any diseases? 4. Why always doctors talk about transmitted diseases but not generated/created/made diseases. When I ask about sex safety I feel like I am getting unrelated answers because I am surely not considering to have sex with someone who is not tested but people always seem to talk about diseases that are transmitted. So please help me to answer based on the case scenario give.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query. As per your scenario the answer is no. Semen in itself cannot harm rectal mucosa or oral mucosa or make a new disease. Only if your partner/s has a disease that is transmitted via body fluids, only then you can get it. Same scenario with two males, their DNAs will not react together to make a disease. But, that said anal fissures can result from lack of lubrication, improper dilatation and improper penetration. However, you end your query by saying you and your partner are planning on getting tested and want to know tests: For this it is better that you both undergo the full panel of STDs and also get tested for Hep B/C, etc."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband is a complete SCI paraplegic, he is 28.

I have read your query but as you have not mentioned how long ago the injury was sustained, I will presume it was not recent but the gas build is recent. If both are recent, you might want to look into the Bowel Program for SCI.  First, make sure his diet is not very high in sugars, vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, radishes etc to decrease methane production in the gut (the gas). Second, introducing suppositories or carminatives will help with passing wind. Tablet Motillium 10 mg thrice a day before meals promotes gut motility too. If it does not work, there are other drugs like Erythromycin (an antibiotic) available to promote gut motility, that should help with releasing gas. Have a look at his gall bladder too: sludge or sand and not just gallstones causes bloating/indigestion."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I also have a frequent cold with sneezing. Particularly in the morning, severe sneezing occurs. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. The possible causes for loss of smell are 1. Rhinitis. 2. Sinusitis. 3. Ethmoidal polyps. 4. Neurodegenerative diseases. 5. Vitamin B12, and Folic acid deficiency. 6. Tumor of the CNS (central nervous system). 7. Trauma. But in your case possible the cause is sinusitis with or without polyp. Rhinitis and sinusitis may lead to congestion and edema of mucosa, and also nerve endings may give rise to anosmia. 1. So use salt water gargling thrice a day for five days. 2. Use water vapor inhalation thrice a day for five days. 3. Use decongestants like Phenylephrine (tablet Lecope-AD) and anti-histamines to decrease congestion. 4. Avoid cool drinks and ice creams. 5. Use Otrivin nasal spray twice a day for five days. 6. Use tablet Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid 625 mg twice a day for five days. If symptoms are not improved please get done x-ray paranasal sinuses and nasal endoscopy then we come to know the cause.

My orthodontist said that I have to remove my premolars in order to make room, but I feel like you could just push back my molars somewhat where the wisdom teeth used to be. Is it possible? Very similar to the bottom except he wants to remove one front tooth to make room but I feel like you could just push back the molars a little bit to make room.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, you have to understand the fact that not all wisdom teeth are functional. What I mean is most of the wisdom teeth are removed not to create space but it does not serve the purpose to chew well instead of harm the surrounding gums. And in orthodontic treatment, the molars cannot be shifted because that will collapse the whole contacts between the teeth. There is a rule that the molars have to hit each other at certain points only then it helps you in chewing your food efficiently. Hence, there is no harm in pulling out the premolars in order to gain space, because there would not be any gap left behind after the treatment is completed. So, I advise you not to panic because you are losing your premolar tooth but that is definitely going to help the treatment become a success."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 28 year old woman and I am likely to get married by next year.

My glutes were really really sore on Wednesday. Just deep muscle soreness, But I chalked it up to not having played in 9 months. Then I played volleyball Wednesday night too. And things were really sore. Thursday my left glute started hurting around 2 PM and by 10 PM I could not walk at all. So much pain. I have been taking hydromorphone, and oxycodone and Celebrex anti inflammatory pills all night and day Friday and today. Not getting better. It is either a really good strain or a tear. I have iced it, I have got my home tens unit on it right now and often throughout the day/night. This feels like it is the exact same muscle that I hurt at the rehab center three years back and it really hurts. It feels like my Glute Minimus maybe. On Thursday I used my massage chair, hot tub, foam roller, trigger point lacrosse ball and my massage gun on it. I am thinking that digging into the injury that much probably made it worse or aggravated it. Sorry, so here is my question. I have dry needled in the past and it has helped a lot, but is it okay to dry needle if it is a torn glute muscle or even a strain? The tens machine seems to take some of the pain away, but could my tens be making things worse? Also, I have been in bed laid up all day and night yesterday, literally only crawling to the bathroom and back. I was hoping that staying off of it a few days will make it better but I am not sure what else I can do. Since it is the weekend and the clinic is closed, I was gonna look around for a mobile physiotherapist to come to my place and maybe dry needle me or other therapy for some pain relief? I honestly do not think I could climb into a car to drive anywhere. Otherwise I will stay in bed for the weekend and hope that enough of the pain is gone and I can go into the clinic and see someone on Monday.","Doctor":"Hello. From the history it sounds more of a muscle strain or you can say it as DOMS which is sometimes common as one lands or take a flight for taking up the shot but the pain is not reducing, is not making things clear, whether it is a DOMS or muscle strain as both of it should resolve within 3-4 days of time. So what I can advice is continue with TENS and take proper rest. TENS will never make the injury worse. Its a modality for reducing the pain. I will advice to take TENS for almost 30-40 minutes, 3-4 times a day and allow a complete bed rest without doing much mobility. We can expect the pain to come down drastically. In case after a day or two of applying TENS for 30-40 minutes if the pain still persist we need to look for other factors but rest is what is needed without having much mobility in the muscle."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was suffering from hair fall. My hair is very thin. Then I used Mintop 10, Finasteride 1 mg tablet for one month. After starting this prescription for 20 days hair is not falling.

I have gone back several times and every time they open up the tooth and insert medicine. My tooth is in agony right now. I am just wondering if this is a standard procedure during a root canal? Should not the dentist remove the nerves so I am not in so much pain? Or is it the standard procedure to fight the infection first and then remove the nerves?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. The number of sittings in the root canal procedure depends on the amount and extent of infection. If the infection is more, the tooth is opened up and medicated dressing is given to reduce the infection and to kill the nerves. Antibiotics and painkillers will be prescribed for the next three days to control the pain and infection. After three days, the root canal treatment can be done painlessly, once the nerve had died. From your query and the details provided, it seems like you are having a challenging tooth (quite a lot of infection, curved roots, pulp stones, etc.). A clear picture of your tooth x-ray will help to identify the problem. Talk to your dentist and get to know, what is causing this pain and delay in treatment. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just want to confirm with you that fibromyalgia does not cause bulging discs. My workman's company blamed my fibromyalgia for disc bulging because in the past I have had headaches and neck pain with my fibro. The bulging disc pain was within three hours (numb, hurting, tingling arm all the way down) after helping a coworker shovel and then running a big vibrating roller. It was different than bursitis I have ever experienced. I developed a headache after the pain in my arm calmed down. The headache was in the front left of my forehead. Definitely not a tension fibro headache (I also have occipital neuralgia that came with the fibro in the back of my scalp). After hearing that it can happen while doing anything was when I came to the conclusion that that is the only thing I did differently that day. I feel like no matter what happens to me the fibromyalgia will get the blame. After researching degenerative disc disease, almost everyone has it. I do not think this is a well known fact. It happens as you age and can be as early as your teens and 20's. People also want to blame things on that as a pre-existing condition, yet if they had an MRI they would have it too. Otherwise, my spine is beautiful according to my doctor. I am 51 years old and was a heavy equipment operator and a PCA for my aunt at the same time while having three teenagers at home. The fibromyalgia and stress is really getting to me now though and I am having a tough time even working eight hours a week as a PCA. Just so tired and fed up with misconceptions and lack of doctor and public awareness. I hope this post and your answer will help other fibromyalgia patients because I know I am not the only one dealing with this.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. Fibromyalgia is still a less understood illness with pain and discomfort involving muscles and bones and the main feature includes that it is puzzling or difficult to identify. It is elusive and is a diagnosis. The diagnosis is made on the elimination of known conditions which might cause similar symptoms after using standard diagnostic tests and investigations. Therefore, if a patient is known to have bulging discs then it has to differ from fibromyalgia. In other words, you might have had fibromyalgia if there is no particular finding in the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. Therefore it is important to document MRI scan findings and then the diagnosis of fibromyalgia might be set aside and changed to include degenerative disc disease following the proof of bulging discs. The problem is that probably earlier investigations have led your employers to believe that you have fibromyalgia. However, a single incident has changed things for you and they refuse to accept it. The best way out will be to have evidence-based medical diagnosis and take suggested treatment. I agree that there is a lot of miscommunication about fibromyalgia and people with real problems are often labeled wrongly considering an earlier diagnosis which was made months to years back. In conclusion, fibromyalgia is not concerned with bulging discs and if your MRI scan shows bulging discs which might be related to your pain and discomfort symptoms then you have the option of making a point with the workman comp authority. Hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is 62 years old. She is a diabetic on OHA and under good glycemic control. She weighs about 56 kg. She is suffering from a dry cough for four months now. The chest x-ray is normal and ENT consultation also ruled out any local cause. She complaints of tickling sensation and coughs following it. Coughing even wakes her from sleep at night. Blood Investigations done had all findings within normal limits except for high eosinophil count. Spirometry was done with the following results: % values pre-inhalation are: FVC 60.47 FEV1 63.18 FEV1/FVC 113 PEF 68.89 FEF (25-75) 59.25. % values after inhalation: FVC 70.60 FEV1 71.72 FEV1/FVC 110 PEF 70.7 FEF (25-75) 54.43. After this, the treatment was started with a diagnosis of moderate restrictive and obstructive lung disease. She is currently on Budamate 200 trans caps one in the morning through lupihaler. Budate 200 and Triohale transcap one cap each through inhaler at night, tablet AB Phylline one tablet daily at 8 PM. But, her symptoms improve intermittently and again recur spontaneously. Kindly suggest what to do?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the PFT (pulmonary function test) report of your mother. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Let me tell you first that the PFT test is not done properly as post-test is done immediately only after four minutes of the pre-test. Ideally, we do it after 15 minutes. So we cannot rely on this PFT report. Even if we see at the report, it shows moderate obstruction and no bronchodilator reversibility. So it goes more in favor of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The treatment of COPD is mainly bronchodilator drugs by inhaler route. So I suggest to stop Budamate, Budate and Triohale rotacaps. Start Foracort inhaler (400) with Zerostat spacer two puffs twice daily morning and evening, and Duova inhaler with spacer two puffs only in the morning. Continue tablet AB Phyllin 200 one tablet daily. If she feels too breathless after any type of exertion she can take, Duolin inhaler by spacer two puffs as required. Strict sugar control is advised.

I got my ear flushed out with water and got antibiotic drops. Could the oregano oil into my ear have caused permanent damage? Or caused any bacterial infection? The doctor said there was no ear infection. But could the oregano oil spread or seep into my ear and cause bacterial meningitis? Is it dangerous that it went in my ear? I am currently taking Lexapro 20 mg, antibiotic ear drops and doctor prescribed Doxycycline if it gets infected.","Doctor":"Hi. Before I answer your query I would like to give you a brief over view of the anatomy of our ear. Our ear consists of three main parts namely outer ear, middle ear, inner ear. The outer ear is separated from middle ear by our ear drum. That means that there is our ear drum which prevents entry of anything even air from the outer to the middle ear. The middle ear is separated from the inner ear by a hard bone. So there is no question of passage of anything from the middle ear to inner ear apart from the sound. Now coming to your query, so seek to have had eustachian tube dysfunction (eustachian tube is a tube which connects the ear to nose) secondary to the common cold and sinus inflammation. Oregano oil can be an irritant and can cause significant pain when it comes in contact with sensitive structures of the ear such as skin and ear drum. But the ear drum is very resistant and would not allow the passage of air inside the middle ear. Since the doctor has already examined your ear and ruled out any significant injury to the ear drum or any significant infections there is no need for worry. There is no possibility of any bacterial meningitis or any harm to your body due to oregano oil. Probably there is physical injury to the skin of the outer ear and will heal in a few days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 27-year-old female. I had a history of on and off acid reflux for a few years. Last month, I had a bad episode of GERD and was prescribed Pantoprazole for a month. It got better and I stopped taking Pantoprazole, but I still have epigastric pain on and off. I had an upper endoscopy last week where the findings were all normal except for erythema atrophy of antrum. No more obvious acid reflux signs though. But epigastric pain still comes and goes. I was prescribed Hyoscyamine, but not sure why. What does erythema atrophy of antrum mean and why do you think I was prescribed Hyoscyamine? I have not had biopsy results from endoscopy yet, but I am hoping and praying for the best.","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms likely from your stomach. Atrophy and erythema mean there is inflammation, might be from a bacterial infection (helicobacter), which we have to wait for the biopsy result then to be treated with triple therapy. Hyoscyamine drug for intestinal cramps, help alleviating pain from cramps, also decrease the acidity in the stomach. To be honest, we rarely use it for stomach, PPI (proton pump inhibitors) like Pantoprazole usually are better with stomach inflammation, and decreasing its acidity. For now, we have to avoid smoking, drinking, and spicy food the could irritate the stomach more. Avoid eating before sleep at least three to four hours. Wait for the biopsy. Another thing, if pain persists, I recommend to repeat the ultrasound, we need to see what is going on with your gallbladder."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 25 years old. I have a small penis (size about 3.5 inches after erection) and night falls five to seven times in a month. My height is 168 cm and weighs about 59 kg. I am unmarried, doing shift duty. I sleep usually six to eight hours a day. I have not taken any medical treatment for this problem.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. From the mentioned parameters there is nothing normal other than night fall which is five to seven times per month. Regarding night falls, I like to inform you that this is a natural process. Our body keeps on producing sperms irrespective of our sexual activity. If the sperm get the way of outside by either sexual intercourse or masturbation then the problem is less likely to occur. If somebody is not sexually active and not doing masturbation to release these sperm they get discharged automatically. This is a kind of overflow. This is more likely to occur when we have a lot of sexual fantasies and get dreams of sex or some other activity with beautiful girls. The current night fall is may be all these things. Either you are not sexually active or not doing masturbation or getting dreams of sex or a combination of all these. In regard to medical perspective, there is nothing abnormal with this but in my view, you need to get an appropriate partner for you. It happens to almost everybody when they are not sexually active for a couple of days or weeks. Regarding your small size penis, I would like to inform you that the average size of penis across the globe is three to five inches while erect. Presence of 3.5 inch size of penis is also absolutely normal and there is nothing to worry about this. Do not go for porn movies and old stories where a large penis is depicted as manhood capability. Even in the literature the girth of the penis is given more importance than length. I will explain why the size does not matter. The normal size of female vagina is about six to seven inches and out of this only outer one third is sensitive. So I mean to say that a man who is able to stimulate outer one third of vagina is equal in sexual pleasure to the one who is able to stimulate full length. To stimulate one-third of female vagina a man need just three-inch penis and nothing more. Fortunately, you have much bigger than the minimum size of penis and you can satisfy any women who have normal size vagina. Other than this the sexual pleasure depends on the other factors like your age, lust, attraction to the partner, your stress level to name a few. The most important factor in sexual satisfaction is foreplay which takes place before true intercourse. If you can devote sufficient time to it you are a man in true sense. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

As you have told that you have had protected intercourse five months back, so it always decreases the chances of STDs (sexually transmitted disease) in any partner and you also mentioned that all reports of your related to STD are negative so I think no need to worry now as you have crossed the incubation period of almost all sexually transmitted diseases (five months is a big time). For your query about the HSV index, I think it is negative (I could not comment on the specificity of IgG, however even if it is nonspecific no matters, cause your index values are negative). So do not worry, results are conclusive definitely (officially, index value greater than 1.1 is considered positive and index value below 0.9 indicates a negative result). If the IgG test is negative, and at least six months have passed from the time of possible infection, you do not have herpes. Number between 0.9 and 1.1 is equivocal. Antibody to HSV-2 may or may not be present. Do not worry. Eat healthy and stay healthy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,  I am a 34-year-old male with recurring prostate infections with inflammation which is really painful with kidney stones happening all the time. I am 6 feet and about 215 lbs weight. I am currently on Trileptal, Ranitidine, and Omeprazole and I have been on them for a long time like 10 years or so. My symptoms are extreme pain in the lower back and painful urination and ejaculation and it hurts bad when I poop and I have 0% energy, I feel totally drained and I have constant hot and cold sweats. My questions are can this lead to permanent damage or cancer? And also what to do? I am waiting to be scheduled with a urologist. I have been battling these symptoms for over three and a half months with a few days of relief and the pain starts again. Any help you can give me will help out a lot. Also, can this lead to me not being able to have kids?","Doctor":"Hello. The condition you are having could be chronic prostatitis (usually bacterial or any obstructive pathology). Chronic symptoms suggest that you need complete urological evaluation with urine analysis, urine culture, ultrasound of prostate, etc, and treatment accordingly. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Consume a lot of clear fluids. Empirical treatment with Cotrimoxazole or Ofloxacin for two weeks can be tried if the appointment with urologist is getting late. With proper treatment, there should not be any problems with fertility. You can normally have kids. Development of or transformation to cancer is highly unlikely which may occur late after many years (late after 50-60's). You can try Urispas (Flavoxate) 100 mg tablet twice daily after doctor's prescription to get relief from urinary problems."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a condom tear while having sex. Two weeks later, I developed symptoms of pain and slight swelling in my right testicle, lower abdominal pain, and foreskin inflammation. Thinking it to be chlamydia, I took 1g single dose of Azithromycin. It provided me some relief but two weeks later the same symptoms arose. Further, my foreskin and penile glans have now become sticky to touch, like a stick note, although it is not moist. I had also developed rashes on my inner thigh. I consulted a doctor who prescribed me T Bact for my sticky and slightly swollen foreskin, Betnovate N for my rashes in my inner thighs, and put me on a seven-day course of Amoxicillin 500 mg for three days. I am on day 5 of this course and my symptoms seem to have eased up significantly, but I fear a relapse could occur like last time. I have minimal abdominal pain now, and my testicles only feel a little uncomfortable from time to time. Further, the stickiness of my penile glans and foreskin has not subsided much, which worries me a lot. I would like to know what is causing this stickiness of foreskin and penis? The swelling of foreskin seems to have reduced somewhat. I am sending you the latest photos as well. Please advise me on what should be my next step.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your worry about the swelling of the foreskin you covered with antibiotics with a single dose of Azithromycin and later with one week of Amoxicillin. If there is sexually transmitted disease it might come back for mainly two reasons. Firstly, incomplete treatment and insensitive antibiotics as you did not have a culture result, and secondly, not treating the sexual partner. Therefore, after completing the Amoxicillin no need for more antibiotics hopefully the foreskin swelling resolves. You will need STD (sexually transmitted disease) screening for you and your partner needs a vaginal swab. If you got pain like burning sensation while passing urine or swelling or urethral discharge then you will need to do urethral swab culture as well. The swelling of the foreskin and sticky discharge might have been caused by sexually transmitted disease as the condom was torn we do not have culture results as you started antibiotics before a culture of your urethra was sent. It is great that with Amoxicillin you are getting better. My suggestion is to complete the Amoxicillin course. Then to do the sexually transmitted diseases tests (STD screening) which is chlamydia testing by swab taken from urethra, gonorrhea testing, syphilis tests, trichomonas tests, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes test, hepatitis B surface antigen test, hepatitis C test, HIV antibody and HIV antigen blood test for you and your partner. Those investigations will help diagnose and prevent future recurrence. No need for any more medications for now apart from the Amoxicillin you are currently on I would be pleased to follow you after tests result to inform for further treatment if required. Urethral swab for partner and STD screen for both and urethral swab of the patient in case symptomatic. STD (sexually transmitted disease)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had been diagnosed with hypothyroid nearly 10 months ago. My TSH was over 100 during that time. Also, I had uric acid which was high. Doctor prescribed me to take Thyroxine tablet 50 mg daily and to increase it to 100 mg after one month. Also, uric acid medicine was given. I took that for a couple of months but slowly stopped both medicines. Instead, I am now taking 750 mg Ashwagandha and 400 mg Shilajeet daily. I got my TSH and uric acid tested recently and TSH comes to 12.0 and uric acid is 447 (both results are still higher than normal). Can you guide me for a suitable Ayurveda medicine to bring thyroid and uric acid to a normal level?","Doctor":"Hi.

Kanchanar Guggulu one tablet, Gandamala kandan rasa one tablet, Giloy ghanvati one tablet thrice a day after meals with lukewarm water. 2. Punarnavasava 15 ml with equal amount of water after meal twice a day. 3. Amla alovera juice 10 ml daily in the morning. Avoid spicy and fried junk foods. Drink plenty of lukewarm water regularly.

I was treated with intravenous Cortisone injection therapy for a week for having acute demyelinating symptoms for almost two months that appeared together with a new lesion at the cerebellum area of my brain. There had been three other there, supposedly migraine type. Lumbar showed oligoclonal zones both in the blood and spinal cord. My problem is that since then, and even if the cerebellum lesion has disappeared, I still experience symptoms not as acute as it had been during the episode, but quite annoying to disturb my everyday life. I have pain in my left arm and joints, left leg, and joints of both of my legs. I also have back pain and tremor but not always. I get tired very easily. But tired does not mean tired. It means that I start having problems with my balance in the left leg, tingling, eye sight problem, cannot cope with too much noise, argues and fights with family gets me worse. Nobody understands there is something going on. The last neurologist I saw said that it is a matter of stress so he suggested to consult a psychiatrist. My psychiatrist says stress does not cause this sort of pains as I already get a depression treatment for seven years. However, let me say they are gonna get me crazy with all this. Do you have any idea? How I might proceed?","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to chronic lesions of multiple sclerosis MS (sometimes there is no total improvement after steroid therapy). Anyway, I would recommend starting Gabapentin for chronic pain or switch from Zoloft to Duloxetine which is better for chronic pain. I would also recommend performing a new brain and spine MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in order to exclude possible new lesions. It is also necessary to check thyroid hormone levels for possible hormonal imbalance and vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am very itchy. One time my finger itched in the same spot for like two or three days intermittently, then it was my foot. I have also developed skin rashes that come and go. Doctors say it is either eczema or some kind of skin condition or bug bite. These rashes come and go, one doctor even thought I had an STD and so I got tested for every STD out there, everything came back negative. I even got tested for cancers, diabetes, lupus, hepatitis and a whole bunch of other stuff. Again everything was normal.  I am also experiencing dizziness where it feels like the room is spinning off and on and tightness of the skull. First, it was on the right and left side then it migrated to the back and now it is back and the front. Sometimes my scalp feels like burning. I have got chills on my hands and feet. I have abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and nausea. What is going on with me? I am on the paragard IUD, but no one wants to say I am having an allergic reaction and they are telling me everything is fine. I am so scared because I think I am being poisoned. Do you think this is a reaction? Or do you think I am a hypochondriac? I am currently on psychiatric pills and mood stabilizers.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and reviewed the attached photograph. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  It seems to be an eczematous rash. Also, the rest of the symptoms could be a side effect of the IUD (intrauterine device). You can consider removing it. For the rash, I would recommend you to apply topical steroid like Clobetasol propionate cream on the affected areas twice daily along with antihistaminic like tablet Cetrizine 10 mg once or twice daily depending on the intensity of itching for two weeks. This should help in resolving your problem. Steroidal preparations are prescription drugs and you need to see the doctor in person to get them."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, So frustrating, so a geneticist made a statement that I might have a mild form of hypermobility EDS. So I went to a rheumy who told me my Brighton score was 9/9 and that he knows I have hypermobility syndrome and would have to see a geneticist to see about the possibility of a mild form of EDS. It is like I just came from there all I know is I have joint pain, clicking, and back pain. In my white smooth skin, you can see most veins. I have such bad stretch marks he even questions saying you just had one baby? My hair is thin and falls out. I have a sensitive tummy and get on and off chest pain. I have a skin condition with little red dots everywhere as well as hay fever and cat allergies. I know I have not had any dislocation but I have had a couple sprained wrist and ankles. As well as a few times my knees gave out. It would be lovely if I just got somewhere with my DX as my pains get worst with age and I am only 21 this year.","Doctor":"Hi. Joint hypermobility can be due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is characterized by weakness of the connective tissues of the body. It is also seen in Down syndrome and in people with Marfan's syndrome. I do not find a picture of Marfan syndrome seeing your images. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). However, the fact is that it is very rare to get a classical picture of any syndrome. Usually, we get the mixed picture. There is no point in finding your problem this way through photographs and reading about the disease on the internet. I would advise you to get the following investigations: 1. Genetic karyotyping 2. Echo 3. Thyroid Profile 4. X-ray of long bones. These investigations will give an idea of what you actually have. On the basis of available information and attachments, my first diagnosis would be EDS. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 14-year-old male. Last week, I had really bad pain under, which I realized was my tonsils. I went to a doctor to get it checked out. He said they were definitely infected, but they did not give me any medication. He said it would go away by itself. Now, I have a really bad cough. When I cough, it makes my tonsils hurt like crazy. Last night, I had a really bad coughing fit that I could not breathe, so I ran to the bathroom, and ended up coughing up blood. Also, when I sleep, I feel as if someone was pressing on my chest, and it is hard to breathe and it is also hard to swallow. Currently, when I cough it hurts my tonsils, my chest, and now also my head. Only when I cough, I get a sharp pain on my left temple. I feel awful. My mom said I also look really pale, and my teachers have been asking me if I am fine because I do not look well. I do not want to go see a doctor, because it is a waste of time if I do not get any medication. Please tell me what I can do to feel better.","Doctor":"Hi. It is surprising that you were not started on medications despite your tonsillitis and throat complaints. It may be possible that your symptoms or findings were subclinical when you saw the doctor and it may have worsened further since then. It sounds like a throat infection for which you may need a course of antibiotics. On an online portal such as this, it is not recommended for me to prescribe antibiotics without an in-person evaluation. However, I can recommend the use of antiseptic gargles such as dilute Betadine gargling (5 ml of Betadine in 50 ml of lukewarm water. Do not swallow) thrice daily before and after meals for about a week along with over the counter available anti-inflammatories such as Paracetamol 500 mg twice daily for three days. If you develop fever or your symptoms worsen, it is advised that you show yourself to a doctor or at the ER and in such a situation I am certain that you will be treated with medications appropriately."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am facing skin rashes in private spaces for three days and it is very itching and burning situation. Kindly advise me medicine. I am staying abroad for a project.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Itching over the private area has multiple causes.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Need a doctor's prescription for the fertility medication. There are no other issues regarding the period cycle or health.","Doctor":"Hello. Fertility medications cannot be prescribed without a thorough evaluation. This involves finding the exact cause of not being able to conceive whether it is female factors or the male factor. Among the female factor, ovulatory dysfunction is the most common cause. Also, tubal factors like tubal block can also cause difficulty in conceiving and thus need evaluation. I see that your previous cycles have been regular but this time you had a delayed cycle which is the first time you observed this. Delayed cycles indicate ovulatory dysfunction, which could be due to hormonal disturbance of thyroid or Prolactin Hormone, or due to a lifestyle condition like PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). Also, I see you are overweight for your height. I would like to know many more details about your issues, like if you have any acne issues or any unwanted facial hair growth. Was there any recent weight gain? What is the average coital frequency in a week? Do you have any vaginal discharge and frequent lower abdominal pain? Have you had tuberculosis or any other chronic medical conditions in the past? Have your husband got a semen analysis done, what is his age, and what does he do? As it is the third day of your periods today, you can get the below mentioned medical tests done and consult a fertility expert with reports for further evaluation and management. Treatment would depend on the underlying causes. In 10-20% of cases, there may not be any attributable causes. It is called unexplained infertility. In such cases, also your fertility expert may suggest assisted reproductive techniques to increase the chances of pregnancy. I hope this helps. Hemogram. Lipid profile.

I understand you have pain in the knee going downstairs. It is good that your knee MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is normal which means you do not have something major to worry about. Regarding Chondromalacia patella as diagnosed, it is usually due to just softening of the cartilage. I would recommend you not take complete rest in fact you can just do some exercises of the knee to make your muscle strong like quadriceps, Hamstring exercises, static exercises, and knee ROM exercises. Movement of the knee makes cartilage more healthy but avoid running jumping or strenuous activities.

You have not mentioned how many times you masturbate or if it is causing problems other than psychological, and the exact nature of these psychological issues. However, I will address the last part directly where you feel the urge or acting on the urge causes you to lose focus. You can try the following: 1. Divide your day into hours given over to all activities and then try to stay within the allotted time for each (this includes meal times, time allotted for bathroom breaks and masturbation along with different subjects). 2. Do not forget to allot yourself free time to pursue whatever you want even if it 30 minutes per day. 3. If you feel the urge during a time allotted for another activity, it means you have lost focus so shift to another activity and then get back to the remaining time for the former. 4. Try to incorporate exercise in your schedule, endorphins are released in both so that might distract you as well. 5. Last but not least, you do need therapy to figure out which issues bother you anal masturbation, masturbation in any form, excessive masturbation or your inability to concentrate.

I have been taking Tamsulosin .4 mg and Dutasteride .5 mg once a day for the entire three years under the supervision of my GP. For the past three months, my symptoms have gotten progressively worse. My bladder does not empty completely and I have to urinate every hour. The longest I have gone without urinating in the last three months is three hours and it is very rare that I can wait that long. I have done some research and see that there are several surgical options. I am looking for a recommendation for the least invasive but effective procedure. On a side note, the only time I can go for hours without having to urinate is if I am drinking alcohol (beer). After three or four beers, I urinate with a very strong stream and for a long time. I then do not have the urge to go again for almost three hours. I realize that drinking beer is not an effective treatment but thought I would mention it in case it is helpful.","Doctor":"Hi. You will need to see your urologist and get a uroflow test done. If the flow is fair with current medications, and you do not hold much residual urine on sonography, you may consider continuing the same medications and add an anticholinergic to reduce the frequency of urination. If the flow is poor and/or if there is large residual urine or if you are tired of taking medications, you can consider surgery. Prostate surgery is minimally invasive, done through urine tube and usually requires one to two day stay in hospital. The gold standard is TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) or HoLEP (Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate). HoLEP is basically prostate surgery done endoscopically with Holmium laser. This reduces bleeding and gives faster recovery compared to the older TURP method. Thulium laser is equally good. Other less invasive options are green light laser, TUMT (transurethral microwave thermotherapy), prostate lift, etc., which are day care but success rates are lower and generally indicated for smaller prostates or unfit patients. Alcohol increases urine formation and so temporarily you feel better flow but it only puts more strain on your bladder. So avoid binge drinking or holding urine for a long. Consult your doctor for the best decision. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 26 years old.

My symptoms are starting again where I get so tired even to eat while sitting (at rest). What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. From your description, it is clear that you have confirmed Sjogren's syndrome. Unfortunately, it is a chronic autoimmune disorder and treatment options are very limited. The treatment is only symptomatic and supportive in the sense that whatever symptoms you have we intend to alleviate those symptoms. But no definitive treatment is effective in the long run. As you said, you experience shortness of breath on exertion it suggests that your airways and lungs are probably affected by the disease. So it is our first aim to detect up to what extent is the lung involvement by doing various tests. The characteristics of the disease is dryness of various mucous membranes and dryness of airways, which leads to further symptoms like cough, bronchitis or bronchiolitis and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Pulmonary Hypertension can set in in the long run. So keep watch on it by regular 2D echo test of heart for PAH (pulmonary hypertension). Also, keep watch on various complications of the disease. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive treatment have shown some promise but it is not void of side effects. Qvar (Beclomethasone dipropionate) inhaler will alleviate your cough and breathlessness. But it is better if you take Fluticasone plus Formoterol inhaler twice daily along with spacer. Also, taking Levosalbutamol and Ipratropium inhaler for emergency use is also advised. Immunosupressive tablets like Cyclosporine can be taken under your physician observation. Overall total treatment is symptomatic. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have an oily skin type. Recently I am experiencing pimples, white bumps, red dots on my cheeks close to my ears. Sometimes I feel very itchy near the pimples. I have developed one or two new big pimples on my forehead also. When the pimple subsides after a week or two it leaves a reddish brown mark on that area. I feel the need to wash my face very often as it starts feeling very heavy and sticky from all the oil on my face. I used Clear Gel for some time but it is not working on my skin.

Two days ago, it started to drain. I have been applying warm compression and Betadine on it. The swelling and pain decreased however, the wound worries me as it now looks like I have got a hole in my thigh. What will I do?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from a boil in the inner thigh for a week. It was started as a pimple then progressed to a painful bump. According to your picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), your boil may become infected. So for your boil, you can take Cefixime 400 mg (twice daily) with Clindamycin 300 mg (twice daily) and apply locally topical Mupirocin or Bacitracin ointment on your affected area. You can take Vitamin C supplements for quick healing and you should undergo some investigations like CBC (complete blood count), RBS (random blood sugar), etc."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had an ear infection about two weeks ago and just finished the antibiotic. In the past two weeks, I have had a fluid stuck in my middle ear with no relief. There is a lot of uncomfortable pressure in my ear and my hearing is completely blocked on that side. I believe my eustachian tube is blocked. I have tried a number of decongestants and also the Valsalva method, but nothing has worked. I have a few very clear photos of my eardrum. I could show you if that helps. Also, in the past few days, bubbles are present in the fluid behind the eardrum. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the photos. (attachment removed to protect the patient identity).  It appears that after the ear infection there is some fluid accumulation inside the middle ear. We call it otitis media with effusion. This is quite common after an ear infection and usually occurs due to some remnant inflammation inside the eustachian tube that prevents the flow of mucus from the middle ear into the throat through that tube. This can be confirmed clinically by otoscopic or endoscopic examination. Additionally, the hearing loss can be quantified by pure tone audiogram (PTA) and the fluid confirmed by the B curve in impedance audiometry. Do you have any pictures of the drum or the tests? If so please share it with me. Usually, the effusion takes a couple of weeks to resolve and needs a different type of medicine than the one given for infection. You need decongestants oral and local, nasal sprays, antiallergics, and a mild anti-inflammatory agent. Do revert back to me with more details and we shall discuss what has to be done. Do not do Valsalva if there is any nasal block or congestion still as that would push the mucus further into the tubes and increase the block."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I am unsure if it is a bad thing or what is causing it? What would cause something like this? Is this a bad thing? should I go to the doctor?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have gone through your history and I want to explain something about lip twitching. You told that you have muscle spasm on the right side of the lip, this condition is known as lip twitching. It is not a serious symptom. So do not worry. It will happen because of excess stress, fatigue, excessive intake of caffeine, such as cold drinks and coffee. The pathological cause is deficiency of potassium ion in the diet. It is self-limiting. It will not cause any residual problems. If you have this problem per hour or more than that, there will be some underlying pathologies that you have to be investigated. But in 90% population, lip twitching does not cause any problem. It is one type of involuntary contraction of lip muscles. It may also be due to the contraction of the muscle fibers as a result of direct stimulation or irritation or injury of the nerve supplying these muscles. Tics, spasms, tremors, bells palsy, and fasciculations (general muscle twitching) may also cause twitches of the lip. But all these disorders have other major symptoms also. So there is no need for any treatment and other investigation. Idiopathic."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I experienced a rash after an allergic reaction that spans from my chest, neck, and face.

Is this likely to be permanent? Will it likely fade? If it may fade, how long would this likely take? What are my potential treatment options? No major injury to the sites was noticed aside from the generalized rash that was being treated.","Doctor":"Hi. If the patch is secondary to the use of Elidel (Pimecrolimus) fade cream then it is temporary. Within two or three months gradually it will subside. Right now do not use anything else on the face except for sunscreen and moisturizer. If it does not subside even after three months then you can go for the treatment.

I have been following the instructions to try and ensure accuracy. Over the past several days, I have captured readings with extreme isolated spikes in diastolic pressure that coincide with my machine notifying a detectable irregular heartbeat and my diastolic pressure is normally within a very tight range. However, I am consistently getting readings that jump dramatically as high as 135 mmHg. When this occurs my systolic reading is not significantly affected. From there I take a follow-up measurement, a minute later, diastolic reading normally is lower but still greatly elevated to my normal range. The first few times this has happened I ignored it, but it is occurring more frequently over a period of several days. Otherwise, I do not have any noticeable symptoms. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would like to explain that those abnormal diastolic BP value spikes could be due to erroneous readings of automatic Omron BP equipment in the settings of episodic cardiac arrhythmia (probably extrasystolic arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, etc.). Coming to this point, probably it would be more appropriate to use a manual sphygmomanometer device several times and get an average value. I would also recommend discussing with your attending cardiologist on the possibility of investigating your heart rhythm through an ambulatory ECG (electrocardiogram) monitoring test (Holter). In addition, thyroid, renal, and adrenal function tests should be tested to rule out possible organ dysfunction.

Moderate pleural effusion in a diagnosed condition is treated by watching closely and making sure that it is improving by serial chest x-rays.

Please know that until the baby is 6 months of age, there is nothing better than mother’s milk. If you feel mother’s milk is not enough, there are medications to increase mother’s milk. Has it been tried? How frequent are you breastfeeding? What exactly is the mother’s psychological status (I mean willingness to breastfeed, notions about mother’s physique deteriorating by breastfeeding, not actually able to feed because of other medical conditions, mother being tensed about the happenings in the family or anything that she is really concerned with). Also know that the amount of milk secreted depends on: 1. How frequently the baby is offered breastfeed. 2. How well the baby is sucking. The milk secretion increases according to the baby’s demand. More sucking- more milk. 3. Mother’s diet. 4. The medications that the mother and baby are at present. Kindly give me the above details before you decide to stop breastfeeding completely. If you still want to know the best formula milk, there are many in the market like Cerelac, Lactogen, Nan, etc. Any of them will do. You should know the correct dilutions before feeding.

Actually the side effects of every drug depend on age, sex, duration of use, and doses of that drug. However, as all inhalant acts locally it cause very rare or nil affects to the systems.

If you have other symptoms like low mood, decrease in pleasurable activities, appetite and sleep disturbances, loss of energy, irritable behavior, and restlessness then it could be due to depression because of Montelukast.

His doctor put him on Effexor and Elavil. Both the medicine has to be taken daily in addition to Xanax. Lately, the anxiety has developed into full blown panic attacks, two of which resulted in a seizure and passing out briefly. In addition, we just discovered through a DNA test that he has two MTHFR mutated genes. He seems to be rely more on the Xanax now as a safety net or crutch when he feels a spell coming on. I am very concerned that he has become too dependent on the Xanax and now that he is taking a prescribed vitamin supplement to counter the MTHFR. It is likely making all the drugs on board more potent than before. I have read that the cause of anxiety for some people is the MTHFR gene mutation. Therefore, I wonder if he even needs any of the drugs he is on, but I realize that he cannot just quit cold turkey. He needs opinion. He is in a real tough cycle right now where he can hardly function, which is not good as he is in final semester of law school. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concerns. From your description, it seems that your brother might have become dependent on Xanax (Alprazolam). Xanax belongs to Benzodiazepine group of drugs and is quite notorious for causing dependence if used for a longer period. Hence when not taken, it leads to anxiety like symptoms which can mimic a panic attack. These are actually the withdrawal symptoms of Xanax. Hence, I would suggest you to stop your brother from taking Xanax as soon as possible. Substitute Xanax with some other drug with less abusive profile like Clonazepam and then gradually taper and stop it. Besides this, Effexor (Venlafaxine) is an effective drug for anxiety disorder. But, we need to adjust the dosage to increase the efficacy. You need not give him Elavil (Amitriptyline) with Effexor. However, he can continue with the supplements. I would also suggest you to take a neurology opinion in view of seizure like episodes that happened previously.

I also have male Incontinence and bedwetting problem since I was young and I am now 24 years old and a couple of times this year I found it hard to urinate, I felt like my bladder was numbed or something. So I went to a urologist and I had my testicles tested because I had pain there and thought it was the reason for all this. He gave me antibiotics I also did an ultrasound on my testicles and to check my kidney stones but everything was fine and after the antibiotics nothing change but the testicular pain. My urologist said he wants to do a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) but I do not know anything about the operation and he told me I will feel pain and I am scared of that but I also do not know why he wants to do this operation. I searched online and it says mercury retrograde might be from multiple sclerosis, week bladder muscle, problem with the nerves, a previous operation (does not apply to me) or medication side effect (does not apply to me). So I am not sure what to do? I want to check for multiple sclerosis and also look at my bladder muscles? Could it be a problem in the prostate? And is TURP necessary? I want a urologist who really wants to find out what is with me instead of just doing a test and not listening to what I am saying and then tell me to come back a month later. I have more than one problem and I want to know what is causing all this?","Doctor":"Hello. I think that there is an obstruction in your prostate gland. Prostate gland store semen. That is why he wants to do this procedure. TURP stands for transurethral resection of the prostate. You must go for it. If you have further questions, do follow-up."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am looking for advice and maybe a consultation from a neurologist. I have a benign cluster of cysts at the back of my brain that was about 1.2 cm in size when diagnosed after an MRI. I received this info from my family doctor who read the radiologists report that indicated no further action was needed. I was not given a cause and prognosis was all good given the small size and benign appearance. After some unusual headaches, I had a follow up MRI that showed no change and was told nothing further was needed. Before few months, I started having almost daily headaches, tingling in my head, dizzy spells, memory issues and brain fog, occasional nausea and pressure sensations in my head. An MRI was ordered, and my appointment for that takes months in my place. The symptoms seemed to come and go so I and were not interfering with life so I just waited for the appointment which was last week. I had a third MRI and was told the cysts have grown to over 2 cm and the report shows that rather than a cluster of cysts as diagnosed before, it could actually be a slow growing tumor. In addition, there is now and second unusual spot on the front of my brain. Since it is unclear what is going on, my family doctor has requested to have another MRI. As well my doctor is requesting an MRA because my father had a massive brain aneurysm at age 48, so she has suggested looking at the vessels as well. Then my doctor will refer me to a neurologist. However, this process takes time in Canada so I have a long wait time based on the fact that I am stable and the initial tumor is slow growing. I likely would not have the repeat MRI or MRA tests for four to eight weeks with neurology consult in three to four months. I am looking for advice on what to do next. I am an otherwise healthy 49-year-old woman. However, now I am feeling some anxiety over this which has resulted in sleeplessness. I really want to get to the bottom of what is going on sooner than later. I am currently taking Lithium 600 mg and Lamictal 100 mg for bipolar depression.","Doctor":"Hello. I have reviewed your case. It is very much a benign tumor which grew 1.2 cm to 2 cm. So it is not an emergency at all. First thing, I want to know which area of the brain having cystic lesion? So can you send me the radiologist reports of MRI and preferably photos of important MRI images so I can see how many cysts or tumors in which part of the brain is located. As treatment and prognosis of any brain tumor depend on size, number, and location. Second thing, please describe your symptoms in detail so I can correlate that is it related to this or not. Waiting for your response."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a history of skin picking, mainly ingrown hair. I have curly hair, and shaving often leads to ingrown hairs for me, especially in the pubic region. About a week ago, I was popping my ingrown hairs as usual and sometimes I go a little overboard and scratch and pick too hard. In the same time frame, I have had two sexual partners. Both I have slept with before, but one I had not had relations for a while until last week. The same guy also had sex with my best friend the same night (which I was unaware of). I also resumed having sex with my constant partner two days later. A few days had passed and the sores from my skin picking have not gone away, but instead, have ulcerated in some areas. There are probably eight or so ulcers. They scab up sometimes but the scabs do not stay attached. I am concerned now because my best friend has also noticed ulcerated areas in her genital realm and is concerned she has genital herpes. I fear that I might also, but at the same time, I am not sure whether or not it would be an STD or just from where I picked at my own skin. At first, she was concerned she had gonorrhea or chlamydia. I do not have as much concern about those. There are hairs centered on all my ulcers. The only other concerning factor is that my inguinal lymph nodes are swollen and sore. I know I need to go get tested and plan on doing so tomorrow. I just wanted an opinion on what else might be going on.","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concerns. Your details match closely a condition called folliculitis which is an infection of the hair follicles, with or without a hair in the center being visible, and can lead to ulceration and swollen glands in the draining region which is an inguinal area in your case. When you visit your doctor, he or she is likely to assess your signs and physical examination, and order some tests to look for the presence of bacteria in the lesions, and some other venereal diseases. Some of the conditions can only be confirmed by blood tests. It would be advisable to get your friend and contacts too examined and investigated at the same time especially if you are going to have them as partners in the future too whether directly or indirectly. At this stage, the main concern focuses on herpes (blood tests required), chancroid (tests required), and folliculitis. For now, it would be good to clean up the area with mild antiseptic, apply some antibiotic cream, and use a pain killer for relief from pain. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I wanted to ask a question about a bump at the back of my throat. It is like a bone. I went to a Local ENT, and he told me it is normal, sometimes it shows to some people. I just wanted to ask what is it?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the picture. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Do you have symptoms like pain or itching in the throat? It looks like granular lymphoid tissues of the posterior pharyngeal wall or it could be a small cyst of the posterior pharyngeal wall also. Did you take any treatment for the swelling? If not you can just do Chlorhexidine mouth gargles three times daily for a week which will reduce inflammation and you can take an oral antihistamine like Fexofenadine which will take care of the allergy part (sometimes lymph nodes are enlarged secondary to allergy). If you have more queries please revert back."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a very weird experience last night. I woke up suddenly, I am guessing I was in the middle of a dream and felt an electric shock type sensation going through my body, and I could not move. The closest thing I can think of close to it was when I was a kid and touched the metal water hose handle during a storm and felt a current move through me. It is extremely strange and I am not sure what to make of it. It lasted about 5-10 seconds. I am currently on Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once daily, Straterra 40 mg once daily. I just started a B complex supplement yesterday morning before this occurred last night.","Doctor":"Hi. From your history, it looks like a sleep parasomnic event. It mostly happens in the REM (rapid eye movement) phase of sleep, which is a deep sleep phase. In that phase muscle tone of the whole body is reduced and if someone awakens prematurely in this phase will be unable to move body muscles and feels like paralysis of the whole body, and unable to speak but it is transient and benign in most of the cases. Many times it can happen due to Straterra (Atomoxetine) but very rare. B complex cannot produce such symptoms, but still better to stop it if not a genuine deficiency state. In my opinion, no need to evaluate further except recurrence or disturb your sleep. Many times it is physiological so no need to worry. Maintain sleep hygiene. Take seven hours of sleep in 24 hours. Regularize the sleep cycle. Do not take coffee or tea or neuro stimulant before sleep. Do not do exercise three hours before sleep. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had intermittent pain in my lower left abdomen for seven months now. I had a colonoscopy as soon as the pain started in the summer, but there were no abnormalities seen. There might have been something as the doctor muttered \\"there is this sort of a thing here\\" during the colonoscopy, but the doctor who did the colonoscopy would not comment it further because the diagnosis lies in the biopsy samples. The case was dismissed after the biopsies came back normal. However, the pain has continued. I think that it now mostly comes before bowel movements unlike before which was more random, suggesting a colonic cause but I am not sure. I also have soft stools but they could be related to a high-fiber diet. Attached are some PET-CT pictures were taken five and a half months after the symptoms began. The radiologist claimed that there were no nodular findings seen in the colon, but I can see some mildly elevated nodular activity as well as a possible thickening in the lower left abdomen where the symptoms are. The axial view is mirrored. Is the structure highlighted a part of the colon wall or a lymph node? What are the black areas that surround the node? Should I opt for another colonoscopy, a needle biopsy or just forget about this?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. As I read your question, I just remembered how distressed my sister becomes when she gets similar pains, which enables me to realize your anxieties well. However, her pains have been determined to be of uterine origin. Please note that, as a radiologist, I always feel confident when I can view the full set of the scan that I am asked to review. However, as you and the reporting radiologist are well convinced about the rest of the imagery, my opinion about the selected images that you've attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is as follows: The black areas represent the gas in your bowels. About the encircled area: Please note that PET-CT is based on the principle that many pathological lesions accumulated much higher amounts of FDG (fluorodeoxy glucose) than the normal tissue. Because of this basic principle, positive findings on PET are always vividly visible. This is unlike other imaging such as CT, MRI or x-ray where we often have to look for subtle findings. Look at the urinary bladder where the excreted FDG has accumulated (this is excreted FDG, not a lesion in the bladder). If there were any PET positive lesion in your abdomen, it would show up as bright as the bladder. Now, look at the area you have encircled. It has some brightness, and although it looks more prominent than the surroundings, its appearance still does not match what we expect a lesion to look like. Please also note that the main image of these types of studies is the axial image, and the others are reconstructed by software. Also, the PET image is superimposed on the CT image by software. Such manipulations often result in the creation of image artifacts. In my opinion, the brightness in the encircled area and its surroundings is artefactual. The mild elevations that you fell you can see are likely due to the folding of the bowel loops. Yes, there are some lesions that are PET negative. And there are the causes of lower abdominal pain (LAP) that do not create a change in imaging studies. Therefore, your next step should be to discuss with your gastroenterologist about these types of possibilities. Truly, LAP is caused not only by cancers (seen on PET) but also due to vascular, inflammatory, infective and other pathologies, exploring which may lead to the proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have taken Fluoxetine 80 mg for refractory OCD for about six years now, obsessions are 90 percent controlled so I am not currently taking it now.

I read your query and understood your concerns. First of all, why have you stopped Fluoxetine? Who advised that? Were you seeing a psychiatrist? Who has advised Aripiprazole? Do you have any improvement in your mood fluctuations from it? Aripiprazole as such does not cause sedation and excessive sleep. It is usually an activating drug. Are you taking any other drug or Benzodiazepine? To increase alertness, one can take Modafinil but daily intake is not recommended. It can be used on as and when required basis. Nowadays lots of students do this and take for a long time, but as a doctor, I would not recommend that. Instead, you can have activating antidepressant like Bupropion which also increases concentration. Another option is Atomoxetine.

I do have morning erections but not regularly. When I have sex one to two times a week, I do not masturbate. Otherwise, I masturbate two to three times a week. Unlike having sex, I get enormous pleasure when masturbating. When masturbating, I withdraw for a few seconds when I am about to ejaculate so that I get a long session of masturbation and also a good climax. When having sex I do not get the same pleasure when sliding my penis inside her. I guess I have a low sexual drive from the past one and a half years. I do not feel any arousal when I see her naked. But when I watch a porn movie, I get aroused sooner. I consume Himalaya Gokshura capsules for vitality for the past one month. Apart from that no medications. I am a strict non-smoker and non-alcoholic. I do have some stress out of workplace and family issues. I do not get enough sleep. I did my circumcision when I was 7 years old. My penis is dry and I feel less sensitivity. When having sex, I normally ejaculate within five to ten minutes after insertion. No medical conditions like seizure of fits. But I feel tired at times. I had been watching porn for the past several years. Could that be a reason for my low sexual desire? Or is it masturbation? I had consulted a doctor in the icliniq. She prescribed me Bupron XL 150 mg for 15 days. I understand that it is an antidepressant. Will it help to increase my libido? Are there any short term or long term side effects? Can I use this pill on a regular basis? Please help me to overcome this situation.","Doctor":"Hi. At the age of 30, the neurological illness, diabetes, and hypertension are not common. So mostly the cause is anxiety and stress for erectile problems. Stress and worries can make a person distracted even while masturbation. When a person watches a porn movie because of the visual content, a person cannot have much distraction but when a person is doing masturbation or sex, he may have distraction because of stress. In addition to this, stress and anxiety can cause low sexual desire. Financial issues, work load at job, daily hustles, conflict with spouse, repeated worry about failure in bed and partner satisfaction are the main reason for psychological erectile problems. These are the sources of stress. What you have to do is forget about the past failures and make a new beginning, for initial four to five encounters in sex you should not go for penetration and just enjoy the foreplay. Spending more time in foreplay helps in holding erection for longer. It also helps in identifying the sensitive areas for arousal in your partner. The sensitive areas in female are neck, nipple, clitoris and anterior wall of vagina. During foreplay, you have to concentrate on these regions. After four to five sexual encounters without penetration you can start intercourse and with prolonged foreplay, take help from your partner for holding erection longer like oral sex and masturbation by your partner or whatever she is comfortable with. If you are not confirmed about your morning erection then you can perform a bedside test like a paper test. In this test you have to apply a strip of paper [about 1 cm] around your penis base while it is in the flaccid state. It should be tight enough and use gum to stick both the ends of paper around the penis base. When your penis gets an erection during the early morning, the paper will be ruptured and this will be the positive finding that it gets normal morning erection. If you are depressed then take a visit to a psychiatrist and get treated with antidepressants. You can visit a good psychiatrist or sexologist in your city and undergo sexual counseling and therapy. Bupropion can help in increasing your libido. Continue it. Other drugs that can be used for the same are Pramipexole, Cyproheptadine, etc. Pramipexole can be started at a dose of 0.125 mg three times a day. Dose can be increased to 0.25 mg three times a day after one week. I suggest you to continue Bupropion and wait for one month. If you do not find any improvement then change to Pramipexole. There is no need to worry about circumcision, it can cause this abnormality or decrease sensation in penis glans. More you ruminate about having a problem, more will be the actual problems. For anxiety purpose, yoga and meditation will be helpful along with jogging or walking. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

I am concerned about the internal vascular nature of this report. I am attaching my last three ultrasounds. I am looking for your interpretation of the report and want to know if there is anything worrisome. I have attached two of my previous reports for comparison.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. From your attached ultrasound reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I understand that you have a thyroid swelling (goiter) with multiple tiny nodules for which you undergo regular followups. I can also see that these nodules are quite stable and have not undergone any worrisome change, nor have any cervical lymph nodes been found enlarged. But you are presently concerned about the structure with internal vascularity, which is a newer statement. It is quite natural to be worried about such a finding, but give me the pleasure of saying that it is only one of the four parathyroid glands that are attached very close to the thyroid. The internal vascularity is only an identifying point of parathyroids rather than any clue to an abnormality. The size of the parathyroid may raise suspicion as to whether it is enlarged, such as in parathyroid hyperplasia, adenoma, or carcinoma. However, parathyroid hyperplasia is accompanied by a finding of calcification in the gland, while carcinoma (cancer) is characterized by invasion into surrounding organs (your report says “which appears to be separated from …”). As for parathyroid adenoma, please be assured that this disease manifests itself quite clearly in clinical and labaratory features, such as abdominal pain (due to the formation of gallstones, renal stones), bone pain, abnormal calcium and phosphate levels, and altered parathormone. Therefore, considering all points, I would like to assure you that “internal vascularity” is not a cause of worry, and the parathyroid even if it is marginally enlarged should also not create anxiety unless your doctor finds features of hyperparathyroidism in your clinical or lab findings. Since I do not know your clinical or lab findings mentioned above, I suggest that you may clarify the matter further with your respective doctor during your next scheduled visit.

A lot many times, liver dysfunction is due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). So, if you have any evidence of fatty liver in ultrasound and your other tests are negative, this rise is liver enzyme would be attributed to NAFLD. For this, you need to reduce your weight, reduce fat in the diet and if required your doctor may prescribe you Ursodeoxycholic acid for the same. Make sure that you do not take any pain killers without your doctor's advice. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 8 years old and sometimes he has bloodshot eyes. This allergy was started when he was one year old. He has been diagnosed as vernal conjunctivitis.","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed your history. Vernal conjunctivitis is a chronic condition and requires treatment for a long time. It usually decreases in severity by 15 years of age. The treatment mainly involves the use of antiallergic drugs like Olopatadine with steroid eye drops in acute and severe cases. Since the treatment is required for a long time the treatment needs to be done under the supervision of an ophthalmologist. Hence, I advise you to consult your eye doctor for examination and treatment accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was doing crunches (exercise) three years ago, something went wrong near my left side abdomen I mean the left side of belly button portion. I feel a kind of knot sensation. I cannot evacuate properly even if my stool is soft. I cannot pass gas and urine comes slowly unless gas is fully evacuated. I did an ultrasound scan and everything is fine no hernia nothing. While I sleep I do not notice this knot kind of sensation but while I am sitting I can feel it. Doctor said it was a muscle catch and gave some medications but it did not work. Can you help me?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have read your query in detail and it seems as if you might be suffering from a femoral hernia. Though less common in men than an Inguinal hernia, it does cause the kind of symptoms you seem to be facing. Long term solution is obviously surgery, but since we do not have enough information, I will try to alleviate your symptoms rather than diagnose. Wear scrotal support, this will lend strength to muscles in sitting and standing positions. You can try an abdominal binder if pain or strain or knot is more above rather than below the abdomen. Avoid standing for more than five minutes in one go, rest or sit as often as possible. Increase water intake to 10-12 glasses a day. Avoid eating high sugar foods to decrease gas or bloating. Follow up after 14 days with ultrasound abdomen and x-ray abdomen erect."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 23 years old. It has been more than a year my liver function test result remains high. I have been tested for hepatitis A, B, C, E, and autoimmune hepatitis, but the result all came out negative. My doctor told to take blood test regularly. But, it has been almost a year now, the result still remains high. The lowest result so far I get is AST 90. But my latest liver function test result shows my AST, ALP, and GGT all 200+. May I get any advice on this? I did not take any medication, consume any alcohol, but the result still came out high. I am so worried about that. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I can imagine that you must be very concerned about your persistent elevation of the liver enzymes. As you already have viral etiologies excluded this is time to look for other things which could lead to persistent elevation of the liver enzymes. Notably the Wilson, alpha, antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis type II. I want you to upload all your previous investigations, ultrasound reports if done, and any other testing that you have been performed in the past two years. I also suggest you to get following blood tests which would help us excluding the above possibilities. It is possible that you have some testing already and I do not want that you should repeat it but do upload the reports as I can see those. Secondly, despite you had a viral screening that showed nothing abnormal but there are certain other tests like Hb core total which can tell occult or latent infection and cause of your raised enzyme levels. Since the investigation may cause you significant cost it is possible alternative that you can discuss with me in detail, as we can shrink some of those testings by closely inquiring about those causes in history before getting tested. I am sure we would reach a conclusive diagnosis by relevant information you provide and after investigations. Wilson. Hemochromatosis. Autoimmune hepatitis type II. Alpha antitrypsin deficiency. Chronic viral hepatitis. Complete blood count. Liver function test (fresh) and all previous as I can see the trend Hb core total. HbsAb, HbsAg. Serum ceruloplasmin. Serum copper, ferritin, and transferrin saturation. Anti LKM 1 antibody. Serum alpha antitrypsin level. Autoimmune or other metabolic diseases. Follow up after investigations and all previous reports or earlier if want to discuss before getting tested."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My dad is 83 years old. He keeps coughing up phlegm and sleeping all the time. He is cold and his feet are very swollen. His feet are so puffy and he feels difficult to wear shoes or walk. He weighs about 300 lbs. He is suffering from congestive heart failure. Currently, he is on Lisinopril for blood pressure, Potassium supplement and Furosemide for water retention and Cetirizine for allergy symptoms.","Doctor":"Hello. For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am going to mention all of my issues together since I think they may be related to each other. I have been suffering from lower back, glute, hip pain that radiates down my legs sometimes into my heels even, for around five years. This began after a hard fall onto my right buttock, although weirdly now most of the pain is on the left side. I have also had some foot issues metatarsal pain and now pain on the outer edge of the front of my feet (I have not been diagnosed with a bunion but it is on its way there). I have been prescribed insoles that help with the metatarsal pain but not the bunion pain. When I initially presented with metatarsal pain, the podiatrist also diagnosed me with tight hamstrings which I definitely notice also. Since then, I have done all sorts of physiotherapies aimed at lessening the pain in my lower back/hip. As far as I can tell, it is the SI joint causing me issues. The pain gets worse if I am static in any position for too long (sitting, standing, laying down). I recently decided to investigate further and had an MRI scan which revealed no issues in my SI joint, but showed that my back is fairly straight (as in, not a very pronounced curve) which is probably contributing to the pain in my lower back. The orthopedic surgeon also mentioned that my lower three discs are somewhat degenerated, and bulging a little too. Something that could eventually become a hernia, but is not necessarily the cause of my pain right now. So I don't have any straight answers so far. My plan for the moment is to focus on strengthening my back (my core is quite strong but I will continue to work on that too) and working compression exercises for my lower back into my routine. I think this may help to stop or reverse my bulging disc issue. I have been doing more forward folds than backbends (I practice yoga regularly, and am incorporating more strength training into that routine), so I am reversing that trend now, after learning about my bulging discs. I will also try to strengthen my glutes as I heard this can help with the pain. Having read all of this, what can you recommend? Does my regime sound good? I also have an appointment with a physiotherapist who specializes in backs near where I live, but in the meantime, I would like to hear as much as possible from outside sources about what their assessment and advice would be.","Doctor":"Hello. Looking at the discs in the MRI that you sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity) I do not think there is a cause of leg pain there. Degeneration of discs leads to overload and pain in the back with local radiation. Leg pain comes from disc pathology with entrapment of the adjacent nerve roots. The second possibility is the SI (sacroiliac joint) joint that you are saying is normal. Core and back strengthening will help always and I will recommend that you do more isometrics of the spine and reduce forward flexion that causes the disc to bulge backward. Gluteal and hamstrings stretches are crucial. Finally, try Pregabalin 75 mg twice a day for three weeks to see if the pain is relieved. Metatarsal pain is just an incidental issue that have happened together with leg and back pain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother fell on her right arm. A few days later she noticed a wound on the dorsum of the right arm but was not sure if it was from the fall. She did not care for it nor treat it. About a week later she started disinfecting and covering it but decided to visit a dermatologist as she was afraid it might be something else. Upon the looks of it, the doctor wanted a biopsy as she said it could be cancerous too. While waiting for the results the wound closed and decreased in size and signs of inflammation are gone. Today we got the results and it says ” hypodermis and dermis with hyperkeratosis, severe dysplasia of the squamous epithelium, chronic inflammatory changes in the dermis”. Now I started reading to try and understand and what confuses me is the ” severe dysplasia of squamous epithelium” is that carcinoma in situ? In some literature they differentiate the two in others they claim it is the same. I also came upon the fact that when there is an ulcer or inflammation reactive atypia and dysplasia may look the same hence the dysplasia may be from the inflammation. How is that determined? Is it a wound that is in the stages of healing or is it precancerous? What should be done in this case? Can we wait for one or two weeks to see if the crust will fall as in a healing wound and then perhaps have a biopsy on clean skin or should it be removed immediately with a suspicion that it might progress to cancer? If it should be removed what is the time frame? Should it be done immediately? I also talked to a surgeon friend who thinks if it is cut immediately it would cause a bigger wound which might be slow to heal again. I have attached the progression of the wound.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the attachment. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  This could be cancer. However, there is no harm in waiting for a week or 10 days and then perhaps go for an excision if it does not heal by then. Cutaneous SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) is usually not very aggressive and in most cases excision surgery with a margin of normal skin is curative."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son has had chronic constipation issues and this past week he was at the ER three times, two enemas were given and eventually, they hospitalized him and they inserted an EG tube to flush out his bowels. I am trying to figure out the time frame it takes for a four-year-old to become that backed up. He came home Saturday night (had not had a bowel movement on that day nor he drank his normal amounts of fluids), the next day he had a huge piece of stool come out with blood upon wiping, immediately after he pooped his pants with stool that had much softer consistency (not diarrhea), then he passed another hard piece of stool at night. Monday night he passed a larger piece of stool once more and blood was noticed upon wiping, Tuesday morning he passed another large piece of stool and the toilet filled with blood and I took him to ER. I have all the summaries from the visits and x-ray results. I am trying to figure out if constipation started prior to Sunday or if he got constipated from Sunday through Tuesday.

Surgery was done eight months ago, and it is still spreading. He is not diabetic. Will chemo might be fatal?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. It is important to know when the cancer spread was first detected. If it has spread to involve other areas then it is likely to be stage 4 cancer. I have served in a cancer institute for years and have seen many patients like him getting chemotherapy to prolong life. Liver and kidney functions and general condition should be maintained during treatment. Radiation also helps many patients. Usually, the survival of a patient with advanced stage cancer is not more than two years with good care and treatment. This is an average and rarely patients might survive to three to five years. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy might help to extend the life of the patient and slow the disease progression but cannot cure cancer. At the age of 82 years, it is important to give him good nutrition and diet with proteins and vitamins. Pain relief is important for him and this is to be discussed with his doctor. Please see that he is comfortable. Hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a migraine. I have readjusted my eyeglasses prescription for headaches.

If you would have presented to me as an outpatient, I would have told you that your medical history is grossly inadequate to make any clinical impression. Migraine is unlikely to cause sharp ear pains. It may be related to inner ear pressure abnormalities, eustachian tube abnormalities or TMJ (temporomandibular joint inflammation). Stress caused by wearing improper eye glasses can cause stress headache which can cause precipitation of even migraine episodes.

But two weeks before his BP level and sugar level dropped a lot and he started feeling very low with some kind of palpitation. After some prescription his BP level and sugar are normal, but the problem of palpitation is still there. To whom should I consult for him?","Doctor":"Hello. Sorry to hear about your father. When you say heart patient I assume he has had a blockage to the artery supplying the heart (coronary artery disease) or has had a heart attack (myocardial infarction). In diabetes management, the duration of diabetes and the level of control in the past is very important for present management as well. Heart patients will be generally prescribed BP (blood pressure) reduction tablets (Amlodipine, Losartan, Telmisartan), cholesterol lowering tablets (Simvastatin, Atorvastatin), blood thinner tablet (Aspirin, Clopidogrel), and heart rate reduction tablet (Beta-blockers - Atenolol, Nebivolol, Bisoprolol). The cause of your father's symptoms has to be found out. Low BP can be caused by high heart rates and palpitation (arrhythmia). In such a scenario, your father has to be reviewed by his cardiologist, to see if there is a trigger like decreased blood supply (ischemia) or salt imbalance (electrolyte abnormality) and adjust the medications (both BP and heart rate medication). A low sugar will usually raise heart rate and BP, but here the BP had fallen so low sugar (hypoglycemia) may not be the cause of these symptoms. One thing you might like to keep in mind is that if someone is on B-blocker, his heart rate will not go up during hypoglycemia. So the cause of low sugar remains unexplained. A review of his diabetic management viz. timing of diet intake, dosage of insulin, medications, timing of medicines, type of insulin have to be reviewed to find the cause. A simple and common reason would be that he could have reduced his food intake or avoided it altogether due to his heart symptoms on that day, resulting in low blood sugar. Now coming to his present symptom of palpitation, as his sugar level is normal range (as per your information), it seems unlikely that his diabetes could be the cause of his palpitations. So my advice is to recheck his blood sugar both fasting and post-food two to three times to confirm the absence of low sugar, and to review the heart condition and medication with his cardiologist. A point of note is that if your father is quite elderly, has been a long-term diabetic, has other co-existing medical conditions like kidney dysfunction, mobility issues it is better to go for a medium control of diabetes rather than very tight control of blood sugar levels. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Just yesterday I discovered that my front tooth looks a bit black and then I decided to look behind that tooth. I found out that there is a black spot between two teeth behind. And I have not seen it before I was a bit shocked to find that out. I am a student and cannot afford to visit dentist. Can you please consult on how to cure it without pulling out and visiting a dentist?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. The most common cause of black spots on tooth is cavity or tooth decay. Unfortunately, there is not any medicines or home remedy that could stop the progression or cure tooth decay. This can only be done by a dental treatment. Tooth has three layers, outer enamel, dentin and innermost never layer. When decay starts in the enamel layer, it does not show any symptoms other than visible black spot on tooth. At this stage, a simple tooth filling can be done. But if left untreated, it progress through dentin and when reaches nerve layer it starts to give out pain. This is when a simple filling cannot be done. A root canal treatment and crown procedure will be the only option to save the tooth in that stage. I can understand your situation but please visit the dentist and get a simple filling done as soon as possible to save that tooth. Treating at early stage will be a good decision financially. Meanwhile avoid stick and sugary foods and maintain a good oral hygiene to reduce the decay from rapidly progressing. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I used to have constipation issues last year, and recently, in the last two weeks, it gets fixed.

Sometimes, normally erupting teeth can cause pain and swelling. This could probably be your second molar tooth. We will have three molars on each side. The age of eruption of wisdom tooth is 17 to 21 years whereas second molars erupt between 12 to 13 years. This pain and gum swelling could mostly be due to its eruption. This is quite normal. You can do warm saline mouth rinses thrice daily to manage pain or can continue the same numbing cream to relieve the discomfort. The gums over the erupting tooth will generally be loosely attached, hence they attract food. Food particles get trapped between the loose gums and the tooth thereby causing gum swelling. Do rinse your mouth after every meal to remove food deposits. This should settle in a couple of days. But if the swelling and pain are not coming down in two to three days, you should visit the dentist and get the swelling examined. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 23 years old. I am a hypothyroid patient from my 5 years. I was taking medication till I was 17 years old. Then I could not continue with my medications and I stopped it for 5 years. One day suddenly I began to feel faint always. Even, while I was sleeping sometimes I would feel fainting. It would sweat a lot suddenly. My muscles and bones started to pain a lot. I could not go alone out of my house especially in the day time in the hot sun. If I go, then it would sweat a lot, feel as if I was going to faint in some more time. Only if I come home and sit in the fan it will reduce a bit. Even after drinking a lot of water and eating glucose the feeling will not go. I feel like I have only 10 percent energy in my body.

I have discontinued my course due to this condition.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. If you have a history of hypothyroidism and have not taken medicine for five years, then it is important to review your thyroid function tests again. It is possible that you have again become hypothyroid and it is essential to know your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), T3 and T4. You should also get clinically examined and if required then do a thyroid ultrasound scan. Vitamin D should be maintained at the normal level. If it has come back to normal then you should continue eating foods rich in calcium like ragi and milk. Vitamin B 12 should also be taken care of. It will help to know what is your present vitamin B 12 level. This should be in the mid-range. Sometimes it can be at the lower limit of normal and this requires supplements. It is important to know if you have any fear or anxiety concerning your health. Please eat well and also drink an adequate amount of water every day. You are in growing age and should take 2200 kcal food every day. Include eggs, fruits, and green vegetables in your diet. Please spend 30 minutes in the morning sun from 9 AM to 9.30 AM every day and this will generate vitamin D from sunlight. Continue doing yoga and stay physically fit and mentally strong. Sometimes even electrolytes and blood sugar can get low and cause such symptoms. It will help to get your serum calcium, phosphorus sodium, potassium and chloride done and also fasting and post prandial blood sugar test done. These are important to know if your low energy problem is due to low electrolytes or sugar. Getting complete blood count, hemoglobin with peripheral blood smear level is also important to know if you are having anemia. Leaving the course is not a good idea. If you have any mental anxiety and stress then please consult a psychiatrist. Hypothyroidism can cause laziness and low mood and this can be treated with medicines.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which an abnormal response of body’s immune system is directed against the nervous system (brain, spinal cord and optic nerves). The immune system of the body mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath the protective coating around the nerves. The cause of MS is still not known, it is believed that several different factors may be involved. Mainly immune-mediated but genetic and some environmental factors have a role. Although some studies have claimed to have a relation between MS and some substances used in paints, etc. But not as spray substance. Otherwise also these studies are not giving a strong scientific basis. These are simple reports that need to be confirmed further before reaching on conclusion. The long contact with some paints can cause neurological symptoms and numbness. But mostly it is reversible. Coming to your problem, you have written I have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

My height is 5' 2\\" and weighs about 75 kg. What are the yoga I could do to reduce weight? How many days a week and for how many hours shall I practice yoga?","Doctor":"Hello. According to your height and weight, your BMI (body mass index) comes out to 30.24 which is considered to be a clear case of obesity for Asian population according to the latest guidelines. If you are really willing to lose weight, then you just need to understand that weight gain or weight loss is simply due to a balance between calorie intake and calorie requirements. The second most important point is there are no short cuts to weight loss. The ideal recommended weight loss per week can be approximately two kilograms. So, you can expect approximately 6 to 10 kg of weight loss in one month. Weight loss for the first two weeks is always easiest. The main difficulty is in the second and third months. Plan and follow any weight loss strategy for a minimum of six months. Go for yoga a minimum of one hour per day and five days a week. An ideal recommendation will be two hours of workout per day. One hour can be given to yoga and another one hour can be reserved for jogging, running, walking, dancing, exercise or any other physical work out. Some practices which are useful for weight loss are jogging, jumping, spinal twists, back swing, hip twist, forward and backward bending, side bending, Parivrtta trikonasana stretch, dynamic suryanamaskara, chakki chalanasana, bhunamanasana, chapaati making, dhanurasana swing, salabhasana, alternate bhujangasana and parvatasana, navasana, navasana swing, paschimottanasana stretch, halasana, alternate paschimottanasana and halasana, cycling, eka pada uttanasana and dwi pada uttanasana, side leg raising, naukasana, naukasana swing, kapalbhati kriya, jala neti kriya, laghu shankha prakshalana, vamana dhauti, nadi suddhi pranayama, bhramari and surya anuloma viloma. It is not advisable to start with these practices without guidance especially in the beginning. Suryanamaskara is especially beneficial. Start with three rounds per session and keep adding one extra round every third day till you reach ten rounds per session. Dietary modification is a must for success. You can follow different diet plans. For example, one week liquid-only diet, another week fruits only diet. Becoming very strict with one diet plan makes it difficult to follow. Go for food items which are bulky (more volume) but with less calories, for example, fruits and salads instead of an item which are have condensed calories and but less bulk like sweets. All the information is relevant to you as long as you are not suffering from any other ailment. It is worth to check your thyroid status if you have not done it already."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Kindly explain the treatment of periodontitis.","Doctor":"Hello. Any history of previous braces treatment? Smoking history? Any systemic diseases? Under any long term medication usage? I have gone through your OPG (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Looks like you have a moderate form of generalized periodontitis. Periodontitis is the infalmmatory condition of the underlying bone and the associated structures. It could be either because of local factors or due to systemic conditions. A complete oral examination should be done to determine what is causing your generalized bone loss in oral cavity. The most common local factors are calculus (hardened yellow food deposits), habits history and unstable bite. This unstable bite could also be due to your wisdom teeth. Some of the systemic factors include, nutritional deficiencies, systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus, genetic factors, blood disorders, immunocompromised diseases or if under any long term medication. Treatment depends on the cause. Treating the cause, stops the progression of the disease. If it's due to local factors, scaling and polishing followed by LANAP (LASER Assisted New Attachment Procedure) will help. Long term maintanance including review appointments and oral prophylaxis should be done in periodical intervals. Please visit a periodontist/dentist to identify the cause and to start with your treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My brother was diagnosed to have ALK positive before two years.

Just after a couple of months of his birth, a light reddish spot appeared below his nose (please see pictures). Now it has grown as dark brownish, textured spot and appears to be growing with the body. Although it does not make any physical problem to him now he is quite conscious about it and tries to hide from everyone. Even after our counseling, it is a kind of social stigma for him. Hence we want to get it removed. Please answer my queries: Does it has any future health risk? Is it possible to get it removed surgically or by medication? If surgery is the only way, can a child of 3.5 years age will bear the process? Will this removal be permanent? Or any other solution?","Doctor":"Hi. I looked into the pictures of your son (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and can understand your concern. It is a simple nevus (common mole). Regarding future health risk, most of the common mole does not cause any problem except they may grow in size. But very very rarely they may get transformed into melanoma (skin cancer). Treatment: No medicines will clear it but yes, it can be removed surgically. The risk of it getting transformed into melanoma is not the indication to get it removed but it is a cosmetic indication in your son's case. Yes, he can withstand the surgery as it is done under local anesthesia with sedation. It will not recur at that site once it is removed. As mentioned, only surgery can correct it but right now it is not strongly indicated unless he can cope up with it. But as told there is a very small risk of it changing into melanoma. Actually, most doctors would advise to watch for those changes (sudden growth in size or changes in the color) and if these changes are happening then go for the surgery. But for him, it is in the area of mustache so he may try to hide it from the world once he starts growing mustache and hence any changes in color of the mole might not be noticed. So it is better you consider surgery now only. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, We have a baby of 7 months old. I would like to mention the previous history here. My wife does not have breast milk so she cannot feed it. We are offering NanPro-I to the baby. She is very active and smiling all day. Doctor told to start solid to her with cow's milk. Doctor offered a schedule as below, give her mashed rice once a day and cow milk and Nanpro as well. But now we found that her weight is lost by 10 gm compared to the last 15 days weight. Her weight as of now is 6.315 kg which was earlier 6.325 kg (15 days back). My wife has reduced her Nanpro almost all (around 60-90 ml per day is given to the baby) and started feeding her with cow milk for the whole day from the last three days and from the last three days baby is having a very solid stool. She also had pain while doing that. She is also getting irritated for the past three days. Why? We need your guidance. Is it correct to reduce Nanpro while increasing cowmilk? Do we still need to continue Nanpro? How to deal with this solid stool which is giving her pain? She does not have blood or something in the stool but she is having pain while doing it. We are worried about her weight loss as well. Can you please guide us for her food so that it will suit her with weight gain and no pain?","Doctor":"Hello. Your baby is now 7-month-old, now you can give her food other than milk also. But it should be offered in a way your baby will accept. I mean to say you have to give semi-solid food because your baby cannot chew enough to digest solid foods and some time is needed to get adjusted for both baby and mother. This is the time when feeding difficulty starts. So do not worry. You can offer your baby semisolid foods like mashed rice in milk, porridge made of rice, ragi, etc, mashed potato, and banana. Add more milk to make it less thick. You can offer food six to eight times in a day once or twice overnight (milk for three to four times and semisolid foods rest of the schedule). Give in small quantities at each time gradually start introducing more solid food over the next four to five months. About which milk to use: you can use any type of milk usually what the family consumes add one spoon sugar to 10 spoon milk and feed with a spoon. Never use a feeding bottle, if you have a habit of bottle feeding. Please stop it and never use again. You can add ghee or butter to semisolid foods which will increase the calorie content of food and also make it tasty. Once your child starts accepting these things you can slowly come down on the quantity of milk and change the menu accordingly. About formulas Nanpro, there is no harm using it, but you have a lot of other options from homemade foods itself. Do not worry, your baby will gain back the weight. I hope I have addressed all your issues."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 27-year-old male with a sleeping disorder.

And my 3.5-year-old girl sometimes complaints for stomach pain. I consulted the doctor but he gave only pain relief syrup, but she did not have any benefit. Please recommend any test to know the actual problem.","Doctor":"Hi. In case of rectal bleeding, there are two possibilities, one is SRUS (solitary rectal ulcer syndrome), this is an ulcer formation in the rectum due to chronic constipation, this causes bleed. Another one is hemorrhoids. I think you have srus, that can be easily treated by Ispaghula and diet modification. We do not do any investigation for this until constipation gets treated and it will not respond. The problem of hemorrhoids is common in the adult age group. Constipation is among the one of the cause. Other risk factors are alcoholic, liver disease, and rectal carcinoma. For constipation, we give Isabgol (methylcellulose) that is a bulk-forming agent. Along with this, you need to take a high-fibre diet and plenty of water. If u have hemorrhoids then in early stage exercise can benefit you. There are two types of exercise, one is to decrease your weight if it is excess (more than 80 kg), second is to do anal exercise in the form of anal contraction for five minutes every hour. Controlling constipation will also decrease your hemorrhoids. Regarding your daughter, I think she had constipation. You should note the duration of sitting in the toilet and that is more than five minutes in case of constipation, and about straining during defecation or passing hard stool. If she has constipation then she needs treatment, her pain will subside after treatment for this. She also does not require any investigation. You should tell about her height and weight if it is abnormal then she requires investigations. Advice: Follow as per discussion for you. Provide details about your daughter. Give her tablet Albendazole 400 once only. Review with details."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mom is 46 years old.

I cannot bite from my upper front tooth plus after the trauma I could not take care of them properly because I feel too much pain whenever I brush. I need your help. Please guide me on what to do? How can I fix my problem? I am very much tensed.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and have gone through your clinical picture. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Please do not be tensed. This can be treated. White powder substance in your lower front tooth is called calculus. Food deposits or plaque that settles on the tooth gets calcified in the long run and becomes hardened calculus deposit. Although we do a proper brushing every day, there are certain spots between teeth where the bristles fail to reach. Hence, professional tooth cleaning (scaling and polishing) is always advised once in six months. Broken and irregular edges of your upper tooth can be fixed with a simple tooth colored aesthetic filling. Pain during brushing in the lower tooth could be from the impact and damage caused during the accident. Get an x-ray taken to check the status of tooth, gums and its underlying bone and ligament. Blacks spots on the teeth are the initial stages of tooth decay. Get them filled at once before it advances and gives you pain. Visit your nearest dentist and get a dental examination done. You will require: 1. Scaling and polishing procedure to remove calculus. 2. Composite fillings for an upper front tooth and lower left back molar. 3. X-ray for your lower front tooth to check its health and stability. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 35-year-old male and have been experiencing a dull, tight pain on the back of my testicles and in the spermatic cord.

It started on the backside of my right testicle, but now it has spread to the back of both testicles and I have pain going up from the scrotum. I have had an ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, taken antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and antidepressants, and all tests are normal with a varicocele in the left. But I still have pain when walking or sitting, anytime something pushes into my scrotum.

I did have a flu last week but was feeling better until I got this sore throat. I am not sure if this is still from the flu or something else. The first file is a picture from when the sore throat started two days ago and the second was from today.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Your description and the images point to acute granular tonsillopharyngitis, a bacterial throat infection, probably due to streptococcus. With low grade fever, throat pain, difficulty in speaking, swallowing and enlarged tender lymph nodes, you certainly need a course of antibiotics. I personally do not think that you should wait for a week to start any medications. For an antibiotic, you will need a prescription from a doctor who examines you in person. In case, if you must wait then you can try the following conservative management. In the meanwhile, I can advise you to take an anti-inflammatory medication like oral Paracetamol 500 mg twice daily after meals for five days along with antiseptic mouthwashes or gargles with Chlorhexidine or Betadine (dilution of 5 ml in 50 ml water and should not be swallowed) three times a day before and after meals with voice rest and adequate hydration with fluids (drink approximately two liters of water per day). Most throat infections would subside on their own without medications in eight to ten days. You can expect a recovery in two to three days if you take an antibiotic along with the supportive medications that I have recommended to you.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 53-year-old male with no previous medical history. For the past two years, I observed my semen to be slightly pinkish in color (now I realized it was due to traces of blood) but I did not pay much attention. Since the last two to three months, I have been seeing blood in my ejaculate specifically if I have sex or masturbate on consecutive days (the second day the amount of blood and redness is much more). If I give a gap of 15-20 days then on the first day I do not see any blood but on the second day, it is quite distinct. I do not feel any sort of pain during or after sex or while masturbation. I do not pass blood in the urine. I do not feel any burning or itching sensation while ejaculating or urinating. I have had no injury in my pelvic area or to my testicles. I do not suffer from diabetes or hypertension. I have been having sex and masturbation two to three times a month. Recently I took Levofloxin 500 OD for six days thinking if it was due to a urinary infection the antibiotic might help but it has not helped. So far I have not consulted any clinician on the subject.","Doctor":"Hello. The condition you described is known as hematospermia which means blood in semen. Although, it is considered a benign symptom in men but if for any person above 40 years of age the possibility of carcinoma should be ruled out. In two-third of the cases, no cause is found and treatment is not indicated. In many of the cases there is no intervention required but with increasing age chance of prostate tumor are high. I request you to visit a urologist as soon as possible. The purpose of visiting urologist is to rule out the possibility of prostate malignancy. The other common cause of this condition is a sexually transmitted disease. You did not describe anything else in association with blood in semen, so the possibility is very low. In case, if you have any sexual exposure to some unknown or commercial sex worker in the recent past or you are having other symptoms of sexually transmitted disease it is wise to get physician consultation.

I have an appointment to see the dentist but it is not in the recent upcoming days.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. Pain on pressure is a clear sign of an infection deep in the roots of your upper incisors. It could be mostly because of a forgotten trauma or assault you had in your childhood. It is not necessarily because of tooth decay. The vital part of the tooth is suffering pressure and causing the infection. I advise you to visit the dentist on an emergency appointment immediately and you got to check with an x-ray to proceed with a root canal treatment in my opinion. Your appointment would be too late and you cannot be on Paracetamol for so long. There are a lot of chances for a bigger swelling or discoloration of the tooth. It is not related to sinusitis as you think and the pain you get in premolar and molar region is the referred pain that you feel because of the upper incisors.

Rinse your mouth after every meal or do saline mouth rinse thrice daily.  If the ulcer hurts, a topical anesthetic like Dolojel or Hexigel can be applied over the ulcer with a clean finger. Visit your nearest dentist as soon as possible and get a complete oral examination done to identify the cause. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an active 30-year-old female with health and generalized anxiety. For the past 4 days, I have been experiencing heart palpitations. Sometimes it feels like a small flutter, as if my heart misses a beat. Other times, it feels like an intense pounding that lasts for hours. I experienced these approximately 7 years ago when I was first diagnosed, but have not felt them in a long time so I am utterly terrified. For reference, I do not smoke or use drugs, and I also workout 5-6 times a week (cardio, running, and weight training). I went to see a walk-in clinic doctor who listened to my heart and said he thought it was all anxiety and suggested I take medication for my anxiety. I had chest x-ray, EKG and blood tests and everything was normal. Honestly, I am just terrified that I am about to have a heart attack every single time I feel these palpitations. Can these palpitations really be caused by anxiety? And should I be worried or just wait for them to pass? I ran yesterday and today in spite of them and did not feel any palpitations while I was exercising. I only seem to feel them at rest or when lying in bed. Please give me some peace of mind. I am going out of my mind with worry every time I feel these.","Doctor":"Hi. I do not think from your symptoms that what you have said that you have terrified about to have a heart attack. It is not as your symptoms happen at rest, not during exertion. To evaluate for palpitations you do Holter monitoring. I think your symptoms mostly due to anxiety. You maintain a diary and find out what are the things which disturb you or precipitate your anxiety. Advice for stress management:- Note down and try to work out to correct it or ignore it. Walking for 30 minutes daily. Breathing exercises for 10 minutes twice daily. Do yoga for 30 minutes daily. You are young so join any sporting activities you like. You can listen to soft or romantic music. Spend quality time with your relatives and close friends. Share your problem with them. Take the help of a counselor to overcome anxiety you are suffering. All these things will definitely give you relief. Review after two months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby who is exclusively breastfed has just started her fifth month. For the past four days, she passes frothy liquid motion with little white like substance for a minimum seven times a day. The consultant doctor examined her stool and said that she has got lactose intolerance. He told me to stop breastfeeding and go with soya-based milk powder for three months from now on. Should I stop breast feeding? She is active and gaining weight.","Doctor":"Hello. I went through the details you have provided in the query. Lactose intolerance is the absence of lactose enzyme which helps to digest and break down sugars, mainly lactose in the diet. Lactose intolerance is of two types: 1. Primary 2. Secondary. In primary lactose intolerance, there will be deficiency of this enzyme permanently and will have to avoid for life time or needs enzyme replacement for life. In secondary intolerance, deficiency is only transient and will regain the enzyme in a few days, this occurs mostly after episodes of gastroenteritis and needs to avoid lactose diet for a few days or weeks. Your child needs further evaluation to check if it is primary or secondary. The reports you have sent are not clear. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The second one, culture if positive will need treatment with antibiotics. Though breast milk contains lactose and not easily digested by lactose-intolerant babies, it is not advised to stop breast feeding as advantage of continuing breast feeding outweighs problems due to lactose intolerance. Though giving lactose-free feeds reduces symptoms like loose motions and bloating. My advice at this point is to continue breastfeeding but if loose stools are causing dehydration or weight loss in baby then go for lactose-free formula and repeat stool examination and tests for lactose intolerance again. Since it might be transient only and might improve in about one to two weeks and if repeat testing is normal then, normal breastfeeding can be given without any worry. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"​Hi doctor, I have sharp pain in the right eye since yesterday evening. Also, I wore a fresh pair contact lens last evening. And I did not wear a contact lens for almost two months. The pain started two hours after wearing contact lens and I went to a marriage function and there were many people with conjunctivitis. There is mild swelling and redness of the right upper eyelid since today morning after I woke up, but no watering and itching.","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed your history and the photo attached to the question. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  It seems like inflammatory swelling of the upper eyelid, most commonly in the form of hordeolum. I would like to treat this condition by the use of antibiotic eye drops like Moxifloxacin eye drops and oral anti-inflammatory drugs like Aceclofenac. Warm compression applied over the eyelid will help in symptomatic relief. The cornea appears to be clear. However, if you have symptoms like blurred vision you need to consult your eye doctor for examination and treatment under supervision. The use of contact lenses should be stopped until the symptoms resolve and this generally takes three to five days. Hope this information is helpful for you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The question I have is concerning the retina photographs that I have attached to this question. From those can you tell if I suffer from a condition known as \\"disc at risk\\" or \\"crowded optical disc\\"? I understand that it is possible for people with this condition to suffer from non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) when also taking ED medication. I have had an eye test done but the person who did the test could see no problem with my eyes but seemed unaware of crowded disc or NAION. I am 60 years old, not taking any medication and no previous history of eye problems or NAION.","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed your history and the photos of the retina attached to the question. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The fundus picture does not appear like disc at risk and hence no need to worry about it. In the fundus photo, the disc is showing is peripapillary atrophy surrounded by the tesselated background of the retina. These changes are commonly seen in myopia. People with a small disc with crowding of nerve fibers are at the risk of development of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, called NAION. The compression of the small capillaries at the optic disc because of overcrowding will result in ischemia resulting in NAION. In your case, the fundus picture the disc does not appear like a disc at risk. Hence no need to worry. Hope the information is helpful to you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Five weeks ago, I fell down while mountain-biking. I went over the handlebars and hit my head and chest. I was wearing a helmet and a chest protector and both of them had cracked as a result of the impact. The helmet strap had strangulated my neck pretty hard. Ever since I have been continuously having sensation pressure at the place where the strap had impacted. Activities like turning my neck, yawning, laughing cause some pain. Over the past five weeks, the symptoms have not improved. I am very worried because I am afraid I might have to deal with this forever. They did a CT scan and said that it was normal. Should I ask for an MRI? Could this be some kind of hernia?","Doctor":"Hi. Sorry to hear about your injury. Since your CT (computed tomography) scan is normal, it is very unlikely that there is any bony or skeletal injury hence reducing the possibility of something permanent. It appears that there is some soft tissue injury in the laryngopharyngeal region or a cartilaginous injury that is resolving very slowly. This indicates an injury closer to the voice box region because of constant movements during speech, laughter and swallowing delay recovery. This may also explain why it is taking so long to heal completely. In my opinion, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is certainly indicated since there has been no improvement in symptoms for five weeks and to look for cartilaginous injury or soft tissue lesions such as a granuloma or hematoma following trauma. In addition, a video laryngoscopy performed by an ENT will help to evaluate the voice box and supporting apparatus internally for any injury (specifically the inter arytenoid region). A hernia in the neck or a laryngocele may be a possibility following neck injury but seems very unlikely in your case since there is no visible bulge in the neck which worsens on coughing, etc. There may be an internal laryngocele that may be picked up on video laryngoscopy. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 24 years old. I have an external and internal hemorrhoid. I guess but I am not sure. I have a lump near my anus and it hurts a lot when I sit and walk. Sometimes it bleeds as well. There were two external hemorrhoids, but one was gone by itself and one remained and it has been there for more than 15 months and it is still there. I also noticed a color change near my butt area. I have attached a video. I want to know what actually it is and how can it be gone forever? Do I need surgery? (I do not want a surgery) Can it be cured by a home remedy?","Doctor":"Hello. Did you attach any video? Here only pictures are available. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Do you feel difficulty in passing stools? Any blood after stools? Does the area of lump itches or always seems to be wet? It does not seem to be like a typical external hemorrhoid. It needs a physical examination to confirm the diagnosis. Actually these are a collection of engorged small blood vessels and nearby soft tissue which occurs due to the pooling of blood due to prolonged constipation, straining, etc. Hemorrhoids can be avoided by encouraging more oral fluids, avoiding constipation, straining exercises especially abdomen, fiber-rich diet, etc. You most probably need to visit a general surgeon. Also, you might just need a minor surgical procedure. You no need to get worried. You can get discharged in two to three days from the hospital. I believe home remedies would not be helpful at this stage."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, When I wake up every morning, I feel the taste of blood in my mouth. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Please check your mouth by looking into the mirror during brushing your teeth to know any bleeding site in your mouth and throat. Mild bleeding might occur if you have gum disease due to infection or vitamin deficiency. Please consult a dentist to get clinically evaluated. Please change and use a soft toothbrush. Sinus infection also causes symptoms including the taste of blood in the mouth every morning. It will help to know if you are having any sinus infection which might be causing it. If you are a smoker and have chronic cough then causes in the lungs including bronchitis will have to be included. Please get examined by an ENT specialist and if required then consult a dentist. Please feel free to correct any oversight in my interpretation of your problems and discuss them in detail as per your requirements.

I had delayed growth since childhood and I attained puberty at the age of 15. No long term medication was taken. No illnesses since childhood, but crowded teeth and dental complications. I sometimes have headaches also. I just started hanging exercise since two months for 30 seconds twice a day. I want to grow at least 3 inches and most 5 inches. I started the magnetic kit of acupressure three months ago but no difference yet. I will continue for a year at least. I do not have facial growth. I live in Central Africa. Is there any hope for three to four inches of height gain. I would appreciate any advice.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. If the general adult height in your race is lesser than the world average then it is difficult to expect a normal height. Also, your growth is delayed and therefore it might be slightly difficult for you. Anyways, you can still try natural methods. However, you will continue to grow until you attain 21 years of age. The bones stop growing at this age. Please continue taking a healthy and nutritious meal of 1800 kcal daily and also take vitamin supplements. Include rich sources of protein like fruits, vegetables, and boiled eggs to give you required daily vitamins and minerals. Physical exercises help many people and you can extend your hanging exercises to about two to five minutes. You can play basketball and do jumping exercises with skipping rope. If you are still not 21 years then you can consult an endocrinologist and get examined and take medical treatment for increasing growth."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 27 years old. I got married before 1.5 years. I have PCOS since I was young. I remember that I had various types of medication as I did not get my periods regularly in the initial stages. My mother had taken me to many doctors, including ayurveda, homeopathy and allopathy. Before 4 years, my gynecologist prescribed me Ginette 35 and since then, I have been taking this pill. I am now planning for pregnancy and I want to know whether I can just stop taking Ginette 35. Will I be able to conceive naturally? I am also overweight for my height. My height is 5'3\\" and my weight is 75 kg. I want to have a baby now and want to conceive naturally without any medical treatment. Is that possible?","Doctor":"Hello. It is good that you continued Ginette 35 (Cyproterone acetate and Ethinyl estradiol) till date. Your menses would have been regular after being placed on Ginette 35 till date as I presume. If you wish to conceive, then you must stop the pills after completing this pack and wait for the withdrawal bleed or menses. From the next cycle, you may try naturally and also follow up ovulation with ultrasound guided follicular monitoring. Sometimes, initial 1 or 2 cycles remain annular after prolonged usage of Ginette 35 and resumes by third cycle. But, that varies from woman to woman. So, you may try conception from next cycle and do follow ovulation. A fresh hormonal profile would be mandatory after a month along with serum fasting insulin levels to check for the insulin resistance as well and present hormonal status.

Please let me know the medicines I need to be used to cure it permanently.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Unfortunately, there is no medicine to cure tooth decay without dental treatment. Tooth has three layers, outer enamel, dentin, and innermost never layer. When decay starts in the enamel layer, it does not show any symptoms other than a visible black spot on the tooth. At this stage, a simple tooth filling can be done. But if left untreated, it progresses through the dentin and when it reaches nerve layer it starts to give out the pain. This is when a simple filling cannot be done. A root canal treatment and crown procedure will be the only option to save the tooth. Taking painkillers will help control the pain but it does nothing to cure the decay. It can only be manually treated by removing them. Please visit your dentist and start treatment immediately. I hope this helps. For further queries, I would be happy to help.

I commenced on the first medication to manage menopausal symptoms. It has certainly helped with the symptoms, especially the Femosten Conti. I have noticed some spotting on occasion. It is very minimal. I wear panty liners so note any discharge or bleeding. It is what I would describe as infrequent. I am not sure if I should see my GP about this.","Doctor":"Hi. Thank for the query. I can understand your concern. Femoston conti contains Dydrogesterone and Estradiol hemihydrate means combination of progesterone and estrogen to treat the symptoms of menopause. Usually prolonged use of hormone replacement therapy is not recommended. If using for prolonged periods, then regular general checkup is advised to diagnose any problems related to hormonal use. Irregular spotting after menopause should be considered seriously as sometimes it may indicate some problem. Usual causes are atrophic endometrium, cervical erosion, increased endometrial thickness, etc. HRT is not advisable in case of unknown cause of pelvic bleed usually. So, please consult your gynecologist once, get examined and go for pap smear test and ultrasound with this workup the possible cause of your problem can be identified and treated. If symptoms of menopause are minimal, then herbal extracts like Estro G are better with less side-effects. Hope I have answered your question. I will be happy to answer any further follow up questions. Take care. Increased endometrial thickness. Pap smear, and ultrasound. Side effects. Increased endometrial thickness. To be evaluated. Better to avoid prolonged use. If needed."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was diagnosed with dengue towards the end of last month. I was hospitalized for five days. I went through a lot during that period and since coming out of the hospital, I have developed this phobia that I might have dengue again because my area is dengue prone with lots of mosquitoes. Whenever a mosquito bites me, I get filled with this fear that I might have dengue again. When I went to my doctor with this fear, he told me dengue does not happen twice in the same season, it can happen again in the next season, but it cannot happen again this season. I want to ask if this is true? If it is true, then what is the logic behind that? Can you please explain? I am immensely afraid of the disease.","Doctor":"Hello. The fact that dengue cannot happen in the same season is true to some extent but not absolutely. Let me explain. Dengue is a viral infection caused by the bite of infected ades aegypti mosquito. Every mosquito bite will not lead to dengue fever as for infection to happen. First, the mosquito should be infected by the dengue virus (DEV). By infection of the mosquito I mean, the mosquito just serves as a vector or carrier for virus transfer to humans. Also, every mosquito carrying the dengue virus would not lead to dengue fever, shock, etc. Some people just have subclinical, asymptomatic infections too. There are actually four types of dengue viruses numbered from 1 to 4. Infection with one type, followed by recovery confers immunity to that type of infection. Our body produces antibodies against the virus and protects us from further infection, with time these antibodies fade away. So immunity in DEV is present but is short-lived. It can be said that the infection cannot occur in the same season, but if an infection with another type say (DEV type 1 followed by DEV type 2) occurs, the body does not have antibodies which are protective against type 2, as the body was previously infected by DEV type 1. This type of infection is more dangerous. However, in a season only one type of DEV infection occurs usually. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a root canal done three months ago on tooth 19. I have not had a crown done yet due to financial reasons. I went to a new dentist for tooth pain in that area and he said he could not help me because the x-rays showed the root canal was not finished. I called my endodontist back and they basically refused to see me back and said they did complete the root canal and the reason they did not fill one of the roots was for post space. Well, my x-rays have been reviewed by an oral surgeon and another endodontist in the meantime, who have all concluded that the root canal does not look complete, as one of the roots is not filled with the filling material that is used. It was also determined that tooth 18 needed a root canal but was not going to be certain to work and I may end up losing that tooth. For financial reasons, I opted to have tooth 18 pulled five days ago in hopes of helping the severe tooth, jaw and ear pain that I am having. It did not work. I am still having the pain, and to complicate matters, I now have bone exposure on the tongue side of where my tooth was extracted. I saw the surgeon yesterday and he filed it down. My headaches are ridiculous and of course, I worry the infection is spreading to my head. I have had three recent sinus surgeries and this does not feel the same. I have been on Amoxicillin for over a week now but my tooth pain in 19 has increased since the extraction. Do you have any suggestions? I am currently taking Amoxicillin and Norco.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details and also saw the x-ray you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Tooth number 19 seems to have a good apical seal in the root fillings. The first dentist was right in saying that there is a space prepared for the post fixture. There is one cusp missing in the tooth, hence the treatment plan was a post and core followed by a crown. The pain is definitely not because of this root canal treated tooth. The reason behind this is that only poorly cleaned, prepared or poorly filled roots retain the bugs to stay within the roots while deteriorating the tooth and give pain. In your case, the root fillings are excellent. Since you told you are not able to get a crown due to financial reasons at the moment, the treatment plan could have been changed. Maybe at least the post could have been fixed leaving the crown fabrication at the last. In that case, at least the tooth stays stronger for a while and does not break off when you bite hard food. Next regarding the tooth extracted area, you have mentioned that the bone is exposed. Now I doubt if you have got dry socket (not to be mistaken for infection) due to improper healing of the gums over there. This might be the reason for the severe pain. Secondly, tooth number 20 also has decay on the sides which makes me to advise you to get another x-ray for that tooth. The current x-ray does not show the complete tooth. This particular tooth might also be the reason for pain. Please do not worry that the infection spreads to the head. There is no such possibility for that right now. Either 18 dry socket or 20 decay has to be addressed to help you get rid of the pain. Continue taking Amoxicillin as prescribed and for pain relief, you can switch to Ibuprofen 400 mg orally eight hourly for two days provided you do not have asthma or gastritis problems. Else continue Norco tablet for two more days. Hence, I advise you to visit back to the dentist and get done with further checkups as I mentioned above. Periapical x-ray for tooth number 20 to rule out interproximal caries. Pulpitis in 20. Saline irrigation and zinc oxide eugenol dressing for dry socket in 18. Gargle mouth with lukewarm saltwater thrice daily for three days to flush out debris from the gums and in the extracted socket in case it not healed yet. Follow up after three weeks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got blood tested for my thyroid and I need help understanding the results. Do I have hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism? I have cold hands and feet, eczema, psoriasis on my nail, sensitive eyes, constipation, gas, bloating, extreme lethargy, depression, and anxiety. My blood test results: Free triiodothyronine 6.5 3.5 - 6.5 pmol/L. Thyrotropin (sensitive TSH) 7.48 HI 0.30 - 4.00 mIU/L. Free thyroxine (free T4) 18.9 - 23 pmol/L.","Doctor":"Hi. Your results can be interpreted as follows: Your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is surely high and the T3 and T4 levels are in the normal range. There are two possibilities of such a report. 1. Primary hypothyroidism - In this the TSH is high and the others go low. This is the most common type. In this, the thyroid gland is under-functioning. The symptoms are usually as described by you. Now why is your T3, T4 are normal ? It might be the case that you are in a very initial stage of dysfunction and might become frank with time. If we treat it now, the levels will come back to normal and you might not need further treatment. 2. Secondary hyperthyroidism - In this case, all the three readings go up (which I see in your report.) The problem here is with the pituitary gland in the brain which stimulates the thyroid gland to produce more. So the fault is not with thyroid gland at a primary level. For this to confirm, you will need a TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) hormone level, which is the stimulant of the thyroid. I would suggest you meet your endocrinologist and get the secondary aspect evaluated. After that, we can give you the right treatment and everything can be cured easily."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

There was no pain while taking the pills but now they are over, the pain has started again. The doctors said that I do not need to be on them anymore. Is it possible that the pain is related to gastritis?","Doctor":"Hello. Acute gastritis pain usually subsides as the infection subsides. Is there any post-prandial fullness, early satiety, burning or pain? I hope there are no alarm symptoms like difficulty or pain during swallowing, weight loss, excessive vomiting, or any family history of upper GI (gastrointestinal) malignancy. At your age, the above symptoms are highly unlikely. At this stage, according to recommendations you can either continue Omeprazole 20 mg twice daily (or any other PPI) for four to six weeks or get yourself evaluated for H.Pylori antigen (by non-invasive means), or get an initial upper GI endoscopy done to rule out peptic ulcer disease. What I would suggest is to wait for some time and continue Omeprazole 20 mg twice daily (or any other PPI) for four to six weeks. If still continues you might need to get an H.Pylori screen test or upper GI endoscopy done. You can also try some lifestyle modifications like eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoid high fat and capsaicin containing diets. Eat less spicy food, stop smoking and alcohol if you do. Avoid Aspirin or other pain medicines. You can also limit your coffee intake as it may aggravate your symptoms. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 55-year-old male with diabetes. I am in relatively good health, but I do have an infected toe. I need antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. It is great to know that you are generally in good shape, except for the infected toe. It is important to know if the infection started on its own or due to an injury? If there is an ulcer on the sole side of the toe? Duration of the infection? If the toe is swollen, and red? If there is pus, and importantly are you in pain? Scenario 1: Now, if the infection has started on its own, if it had started on the side of the nail bed (paronychia) and of short duration, then it is relatively straightforward. You need antibiotics to cover the most common bacteria causing superficial skin infection (Penicillin family) and anti-inflammatory to reduce swelling and pain (Diclofenac group). Scenario 2: If you had an ulcer on the underside of the toe, and that has lead to an infection of the toe itself, then it is something that needs specialist consultation, for involvement of infection of the toe bone and the extent of the infection has to be assessed. And if in need of powerful antibiotics, oral or IV may have to be considered, apart from the drainage of pus, clearing of dead tissue from infection site and dressing of the wound. If you do not feel pain, then it is ominous, because, the extent of infection can be far greater than you think, and it needs a surgical consultation at your nearby hospital. Finally, if there had been an ulcer, pressure-relieving footwear might have to be considered to prevent the recurrence of ulcers.

Its not 1 week or even 1 month process, it takes lot of time and courage. I usually recommend following steps to my patient who wants to quit smoking. 1. Set a date. Setting a date has a psychological effect and you can choose any memorable date, your birthday, your anniversary, etc.  2. Tell your family, your friends and your colleagues. Discuss with them. They are the one who will help you late on with the process.  3. Prepare yourself for the upcoming problems. You will face Nicotine withdrawal and problems associated with that. It will be cough, constipation, etc. These are not serious but if you do not anticipate these, such problems will discourage you from quitting and start smoking again. Try to find a friend or partner who also wants to quit. 2 people make it easier for each other.  4. Remove smoking related products (Cigerrates, ashtray) from your house, car, workplace.  5. Now in final step, here comes a little role of doctor.  Now you need to understand you have 2 types of addictions, physical i.e. of nicotine and psychological i.e of act of smoking. For physical addiction I would recommend nicotine patches and bubblegum, whatever suits you better. For psychological addiction you have to control yourself, if you think that initially you cannot tolerate that, you can use electronic cigerratte for a month or so and it will help you. This is a workplan I can share with you which will help you in quitting smoking. I would love to see you again and help you step by step in the process wherever you need me."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

There is a hole in the bottom of where the remains of the tooth are and I can see bright pink through it. Gums around the tooth are not swollen, or inflamed. There is no pain when touching them either. How likely is it that I can wait it out till my insurance kicks?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. Do not worry because it is a root canal treated tooth. There is no pain because during the root canal treatment the tooth pulp would have been cleaned thoroughly. The pink color you see is the root filling material used. Since you have mentioned that your insurance starts from the 1st of the coming month, you got to fill the hole where the filling was lost with some inert material. The best choice would be sugarless chewing gum. Just chew one and pack it yourself with a blunt end of some spoon that can be easily grabbed at the kitchen drawers. Make sure you wash your mouth before you do this and also use cleaned spoons preferably disinfected in hot water for 15 minutes. This can stay for a week's time most probably when packed tight. Later on, visit the dentist and get it filled with proper dental material. I also advise you to get a crown for the root canal treated tooth as a next step. Through this, you can get rid of the tooth filling breakage in case of heavy load. The filling material has lost its strength as it stayed for 10 long years. Heavy chewing load. X-ray to check any fractures of the tooth as a precaution. Follow up after three months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from allergy due to cold, strong odor and old dust for the last about 35 years, dependant to Asthalin spray. How to get rid of it?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome back to icliniq.com. It is nice to hear that you want to get rid of the Asthalin spray and surely we can give a try. You have been using the spray for quite a long time and your body is used to it. So, I will strongly suggest you not to discontinue it suddenly. I advice you the following lifestyle modification and food supplements which can be very beneficial to you boosting your immune system.  1. Drink lemon juice daily (squeeze 1 lemon in a glass of water and honey, do not add honey if you are diabetic). It is going to be winter soon and oranges will be available, add one or two oranges daily to you diet. Lemon and oranges contain plenty of vitamin C. Vitamin C is very good for the immune system and it helps you to fight common infection and even cancer. 2. Wear a mask to avoid dust. This is one single measure which will help you to decrease the doses and frequency of Asthalin use. Now a days washable mask in variety of colours are available for Rs. 20-30 (common used by people riding motor bikes). 3. Practice pranayam (especially kapal bhatti and anulom vilom). These two asanas have direct beneficial effects for the respiratory system. 4. Take two teaspoon Chawanprash daily."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a female, 30 years old. Questions: 1) How and why do I have all symptoms of c8 radiculopathy confirmed by EMG but not reflective of MRI- c7/t1 normal? 2) What else if anything could cause c8 radiculopathy in last 2 digits per my imaging that would explain this medically? 3) What is your final assessment and why? To date: Undergone much PT and recieved facet injections at 2 sites: above and below ACDF. Persistent neck pain into scalpula and upper extremity unilateral hand numbness especially D4, D5. Now with new weakness in opposite hand. History/background/ diagnostics: Former ACDF at c5/6 labeled degenerative disk in mid/late 20's. Resulted in great sucess post-surgery. Several years later- accident occurs: results multiple levels damaged, cervical spondylosis. Imaging reports: MRI findings: no cord/ vertebral lesion and multi DDD below above acdf. C4/5 herniation and degeneration and cord encroachment. C5/C6- bony overgrowth causes cord encroachment. C6/C7 herniation degeneration but without any encroachment. C7/T1- unremarkable. Myelo gram- showed small extradural lesion at C5/6 with thecal sac compression. A spur projecting from posterior border of C6, small ventral defect. EMG- (left- UE) Neuro exam: weakness ADM, APB, 1st D1. Decreased sensation digits 3,4,5 clawing in 5th digit. DTR 1+. NCV: left ulnar sensory nerve decreased conduction veloc (wrist-5th digit, 42/s) Polyphasic Volition 1st D1 and ADM. No acute radiculopathy, plexopathy, peripheral neuropathy. Final: Abnormal test concluded Chronic C8 radiculopathy.","Doctor":"Hi. You do have chronic C8 radiculopathy from your detailed description. The reason for mismatch between NCV / EMG findings and MRI can be explained on the basis of a pre-fixed or a post-fixed brachial plexus where in the nerve exiting the C7-T1 inter space is actually carrying nerve fibres from the space below; that will show up normal on MRI. The actual C8 fibres are going out at a space above ie C6-C7 or higher where they are getting compressed. Spur and compression exists at a higher level. The second possibility is that there is arachnoiditis but that should show up on MRI, however, I have not seen the MRI myself and have to rely on the report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The third explanation is possible injuries scarring at the time of ACDF or after less likely as you would have known the temporal sequence of symptoms. By APB you mean adductor and not abductor pollicus brevis - that is median nerve. Appearance of new symptoms and persisting neck pain afert ACDF suggests instability at another level which unfortunately can happen and is a collateral effect of fusion in spine. Get flexion extension X-rays and dynamic contrast MRI."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, About a month ago, I had the worst outbreak of canker sores in my life. I had 10 or 12 at once, horribly painful, and I could barely eat or drink. Over about two weeks they healed, but I still have a few painless bumps on the top of my tongue and in the back of my mouth. I will attach a photo of the bumps in the back of my mouth. There are two on either side. The bumps on my tongue are too far back to get a proper photo. I tested positive for HPV so I am mildly concerned about cancer. Brushing my teeth also causes a lot of pain to my gums. Occasionally they bleed a little. I never had an issue with that before the canker sore outbreak.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your complaint and the relevant details and also saw the picture you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Since you have mentioned that the ulcers healed two weeks ago and still have few fresh ulcers now, it could be recurrent aphthous mouth ulcers. Aphthous ulcers are usually painful but will not lead to cancerous lesions. But there are small bursts in your palate, which makes me think of viral ulcers as well. You also have a history of HPV (human papilloma virus). Hence, I advise you to take a blood test to rule out viral origin ulcers. Only then the treatment could be framed. You have also mentioned that they are painless now. So there is no need for topical ointments to get rid of the pain. You should also know a fact that topical steroids should not be used for viral lesions. So I request you to complete the blood check and then go ahead with the treatment from a nearby dentist accordingly. Regarding bleeding gums, you have to undertake a complete professional cleaning by a dentist to flush out the dental plaque and chunky substances called calculus. After that, maintain good oral hygiene including flossing, tongue cleaning, and toothbrushing twice a day. Blood test. Avoid hot and spicy food. Take nutritious food rich in vitamins such as green veggies because ulcers could be associated with vitamin B deficiencies. Follow up after three weeks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been waking up from a racing heart accompanied by belching at night sometimes two or 3 times a night. At times the HR has been in the 140s after I get up and belch a few times my heart rate returns to normal. I have had my heart completely checked out along with a 30 day monitor and no problems have been found there. I am wondering If GERD could be causing this to happen . It only happens at night while reclined or lying down for bed.","Doctor":"Hi. GERD in itself cannot cause increase in heart rate. However, anxiety associated with GERD can cause increase in heart rate. So in my opinion, you should see, if you have anxiety, there are no issues related to heart. But if you have any anxiety, you would need treatment for that. I would recommend you to get Holter monitoring, thyroid profile done. If done, please share report with me. If all normal my recommendations would be to discuss with your doctor to put you on Propanolol which would keep your anxiety and pulse rate under control."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I flossed by a tooth where a filling almost came out and my tooth and gum have been hurting all night. Also have a tooth that is by this molar that fell or chipped out. I do not know if it is an abscess or an exposed nerve in my molar that is right behind it. Took Tylenol 2 every 6 hours twice. It did not help. Used Benzocaine on the area. Helped 20 %. Do not feel comfortable using it at home.","Doctor":"Hello. Is the pain sharp or dull? Any gum swelling? If the pain is sharp, lancinating and referring to the same side jaw, temple, ear or throat, then this could be from the tooth with the chipped out filling. Most chipped out fillings expose the underlying nerve which causes severe pain. Ideally an X-ray is required to determine the depth of the cavity and to check for nerve involvement. If the nerve is involved, a root canal treatment and crown procedure will be done to save that tooth. If the pain is from the gums and is dull in nature, this could be an accidental gum injury due to flossing or there is a chance of the attempted food deposit to get deeply pushed into the gums causing this pain. If this is the case, a deep localized scaling should be performed under local anaesthesia to relieve any deeply wedged food deposit. A clinical examination and X-ray is required to diagnose the cause of this pain. I see that taking painkillers and topical anaesthetic in this situation were not much of help to you. Please visit your nearby dentist immediately and get the root cause identified. Meanwhile, try warm saline mouth rinses and avoid hot, spicy foods which may aggravate your pain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I recently got a shoulder and neck x-ray for persistent back and neck pain. The pain started a couple of years ago. No medicines were taken so far. My blood work and CT abdomen are fine.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. The cervical spine x-ray AP (anteroposterior) and lateral views show the following. 1) There is straightening of the neck spine. 2) The alignment of the cervical spine is normal. 3) Mild early degenerative changes are noted in the vertebral bodies of the cervical spine. 4) Intervertebral disc spaces are normal in appearance except a minimal suspicious decrease in disc height C 3-C 4 disc level anteriorly. 5) There is a small bridging osteophyte at C3 anterosuperiorly vs limbus vertebra (rare possibility). This is not a serious concern. 6) Pre-vertebral soft tissues are normal. Impression: There is a possibility of neck muscle spasm and early degenerative changes in the neck spine. Left shoulder x-ray AP view shows normal shoulder joint. 1) The bones are aligned normally and left shoulder joint space is maintained. 2) The scapula, lateral end of clavicle and head of humerus on the left side are normal. I hope your query is answered. The possibility of neck muscle spasm exists with early degenerative changes in neck spine. Pinching of nerves due to disc problems (which might be seen only on MRI cervical spine) cannot be commented up on this x-ray. Further clinical neurological examination of neck spine might reveal any suspected causes for your symptoms. Orthopedic clinical examination of the left shoulder is also suggested to know any restriction of movements and whether any soft tissue structures like rotator cuff requires evaluation by an MRI shoulder. Recommended physiotherapy for few weeks and if there is no improvement or if there is worsening then the concerned area is to be evaluated by MRI scan. There is no need of doing MRI scan for both the regions. MRI scan of the cervical spine is more important in the view of muscle spasm and early degenerative changes. Please avoid sudden neck movements."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male. I am 5 feet and 9 inches tall and weigh 255 pounds. When I eat spicy food, I poop blood.

Do you have any associated heart burn, belching, or digestion difficulty? How long you are on OCP (oral contraceptive) medication? Recent stress (work or studies)?

After treating yeast infections for years, I made a lab test for whole bacterial microflora in my vagina. The results are awful. I do not have candida at all. The results are: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas spp.\\t10 6.6 Eubacterium spp.\\t10 6.0 Atopobium vaginae\\t10 5.9 Ureaplasma (urealyticum and parvum) 10 5.3. My doctor prescribed me the following treatment: Azithromycin (first week, first day 1 g, second and third day 500 mg, the second week the same). For Gardnerella Tinidazole ( two pills BD for 3 days, actually 2g for one day). He told me to take Tinidazole on different days from Azithromycin. My husband also took pills for only one week Azithromycin and Tinidazole. Also, we take probiotics and vitamins. I also have Fluomizin vaginal tablets for 12 days. My worries are that after three days of Azithromycin, we took Tinidazole but we felt awful after the second day. We could not take the last 1 g because of vomiting, diarrhea, stomach and low back pain. Now I feel better and it is time for the second week of Azithromycin. Can I take the last 1 g of Tinidazole after Azithromycin or just to let go? I have some pain in the low back but this pain appeared two months ago and now I think I have PID or something really bad. I think I have become infertile without knowing it. This ureaplasma should be in me at least for four to five years. For Gardnerella, I am not sure but I have always had some discharge. So definitely things are old. We want to have a baby and now things are not so good for us. If I succeed in treating these infections can I get pregnant naturally or it is better to find medical help without losing time? I am 32 years old. Doctors say nothing here. Actually my doctor told me if the treatment is successful we can try to conceive naturally. But I think these bacterias have injured my reproductive system because of the long-time untreated problem. I am so sad. I also had urine and blood tests, everything is normal there. My urine sediment is clear and ESR is normal.","Doctor":"Hello. I would like to add a little information here is that PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) mostly is a subsequent result of STD's (sexually transmitted disease) infection (chlamydia and gonorrhea) which actually travel upward along the reproductive tract and may lead to subfertility. These prolonged infections can also cause subfertility but in very severe cases especially recurrent cases and if remain untreated. As you have started treatment, the infection has been cured so you should stop worrying now and start trying to conceive naturally. The chances of getting pregnant spontaneously are quite bright. And as you are 32 years now so you can try spontaneously for at least six months to one year before seeking help. But if it is really concerning for you then there is no harm in seeking help earlier. Secondly, yes you can take Tinidazole after completing Azithromycin course. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My right inner cheek is swollen. This happened for the second time this month. The swollen cheek falls between the teeth while talking or eating. I am having pain too.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. The swelling should be the reason for any tooth infection associated with the right lower back tooth region in the least case. If that is ruled out during a dental consultation, then it could be the infection in the salivary gland. I say this because you have mentioned a history of swelling interferes with eating and talking. Usually, salivary gland swellings affect both the sides of the cheek region and also below the tongue with or without pain. You also got to check if you have dry mouth or dry eyes because salivary gland infections go in hand with these two symptoms in most of the cases. Mouth ulcer ointments might not work for this kind of pain. Hence, I request you to visit your nearby dentist to get a complete oral check up done. During your consultation, if tooth infection is ruled out then the suspicion would be over the salivary glands. Also, if you got any fever history please get that to the dentist's attention. Meanwhile, for pain relief please take tablet Flexon (Ibuprofen and Paracetamol) thrice daily after meals for two days. If you got any gastric irritation with this tablet please take capsule Omez D (Omeprazole delayed-release) 20 mg half an hour before food along with the after food tablet. Bacterial or viral infections. Blood check to rule out viral origin. Ultrasound or Computed tomography (CT) scan to visualize salivary gland stones."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have my MRI pictures for back-pain.

If you have already consulted a doctor who might have prescribed you this scan, please send me his prescription paper so that I can see your exact neurology and other clinical findings. I need all this information because normally we have to correlate the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans with patient's clinical findings so that a diagnosis can be arrived at.

I was just diagnosed with chronic urticaria. I went to an allergic specialist for skin testing because my skin was so sensitive I reacted to everything. They then did the RAST test on me. Everything came out class 0 except for egg white, wheat, and oats being class 2 and milk, and hazelnut being class 1. Can these cause anaphylaxis? How accurate are the RAST test? I was put on an elimination diet but the hives are still there. I occasionally get angioedema with it also. Can angiodema cause anaphylaxis? As you can see I am so scared for my throat to close up that I am scared to eat anything. I have only been eating a couple of things daily and live off that.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. RAST is a highly accurate test. If the test is positive for a specific allergen, it shows that you are sensitized to that particular allergen. This means that you may mount an allergic response when you are exposed to that allergen. However, it does not mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to that substance and, nor does it mean that any reactions will be severe. If the test is negative, it means that one does not have the ability to mount an allergic reaction to that allergen and any symptoms one may be experiencing are probably not due to an allergic reaction to that substance. However, the results of the RAST need to be interpreted in conjunction with your clinical history. e.g the presence of allergy to some or few allergens which may possibly be present either in the environment or food does not necessarily mean that they are responsible for the symptoms because if they are not even present in the environment or food of an individual, then they are irrelevant. In your case, an elimination diet has not helped thus proving the fact that RAST test results should be carefully interpreted along with clinical history and does not necessarily mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to the substance that you tested. Angioedema is frequently associated with urticaria. Pathogenesis is the same for both urticaria as well as angioedema. The presence of angioedema does not always mean that it is a part of anaphylaxis. Angioedema can be a part of anaphylaxis in those individuals who have a severe allergic reaction to an allergen with high levels of antibodies circulating in the blood. Since you have only class 1 and 2 level antibodies therefore it is unlike that these antigens or allergens would cause anaphylaxis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a negative G/C swab. As a treatment, I took two doses of Fluconazole and Metrogyl. What can cause a yellow discharge from the penis? I do excessive masturbation and had sex with two unprotected partners.","Doctor":"Hello. Yellowish discharge from the penis along with a history of unprotected sexual intercourse points towards having contracted STDs (sexually transmitted disease). The most common infection is that of gonorrhea and chlamydia, which presents with complaints of painful micturition, blood in urine, pus discharge per urethra, itching, inflammation of prostate and testicles, low-grade fever, sore throat, body aches and flu-like symptoms as well. Mode of transmission would be unprotected homosexual, heterosexual contact with an infected partner and very close physical contact. It can spread from hand to hand contact as well, and from infected mother to the child as well in-utero. The treatment includes treating both gonorrhea and chlamydia, as they are usually transmitted together. For gonorrhea, Cipro XR (Ciprofloxacin extended-release) 500 mg single dose, or Levaquin (Levofloxacin) 500 mg single dose, or Tequin (Gatifloxacin) 400 mg single dose. For chlamydia, Doxycycline 100 mg two to three times a day for 10–14 days, or Zithromax (Azithromycin) 1.0 g single dose, or Zithromax or Z-pak (Azithromycin) 500mg on day 1, followed by one tablet (250 mg) once a day for four more days. To prevent reinfection, concurrently treat the partner as well. Precautions: Always have protected sex, avoid unprotected and unnatural sexual activities. Once treated successfully, the infection will not come back until contracted the new infection."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 3-year-old boy has eczema in the head with itching. It becomes pinkish sometimes while scratching. Please say some remedies.","Doctor":"Hello. This condition can be treated by Siddha drugs. This is known as kabala kuttam or a type of bala karapan. The allergic symptoms are due to external or internal allergy. For example, cow milk, wheat, health powders (Horlicks, etc), soya powder, shampoo, hair oil, hairpin, cloths touching hair, flowers kept on hair, cool-dry climate, certain allergic foods, etc. If the baby is still feeding by mother's milk, then the mother's milk might contain some allergen. This allergen is produced in milk if the above mentioned allergic products are used by the mother. First thing is to identify the allergen (triggering factor). Avoiding the trigger will give a permanent cure. The second thing is to treat the allergy by Siddha drugs. 1) Dhoorvathi thailam (other name is Arugam pul thailam) or Poduthalai thailam or Mathan thailam. Buy any one oil. Apply on the scalp (head). Wait for one hour, then give a mild hot water bath. Apply daily for 60 days. Once the lesion is cured, then apply this oil weekly two days. In the remaining days, you can use normal routine oils. 2) Vallaarai ghritam, give 10 drops in the morning, 10 drops in the afternoon and 10 drops in the night. Continue for 60 days. This drug cures skin problems in kids. It also improves memory and gives immunity. You may also get advice from nearby Siddha pediatrician."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I barely turned 16 and my penis is only 1\\" when flaccid and about 4\\" when erect. I suffer from hypospadias and I wonder if it will grow?","Doctor":"Hello. It takes a lot of courage to discuss problems related to genital, and it feels good that you have that courage. Regarding your first query about the size of your penis, as you told that in the flaccid state it measures 1\\" and in erect state 4\\", and that you are just 16 years of age. I would like to assure you that you need not worry about the size of your organ as for your age it is appropriate and with age, its size will increase. It is similar to the average size of the penis that adolescent boys usually have. At this age, male sex hormone testosterone level begins to rise hence male secondary sexual characters begin to mature which includes the size of penis, scrotum, development of genital, pubic and axillary hairs, hoarse voice, and masculinity as well. So by your age, your sex hormones have begun to increase, hence your organ size will increase gradually with time along with your libido. Regarding hypospadias, I would suggest you to consult a surgeon especially a urosurgeon as this anomaly requires surgical correction, if you have not get it done till now. With treatment, it has no effect on sexual performance as well. So you should not be too worried about all these conditions and seek an opinion from a surgeon as well."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having chest pains that are dull feeling in random parts of chest at random times throughout the day and night.

I passed carefully through your medical history and would like to explain that your ECG seems to be within normal ranges. Nothing to worry or panic about.

As it was administered my lips felt buzzy, as though an electrical current was passing through them. Is this an allergic reaction? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all you need not get anxious because of this buzzy feeling you went through after you were given Propofol. Buzzy feel or electrical current feel is all part of the any general anaesthetic agent. Propofol is a very good medicine given by your physician for making you sleep during colonoscopy.

Urobilinogen may be seen in early phases of jaundice and bacteria simply me be due to urinary infection. The WBC count are low and which may also signify infection.

Maintaining thorough hygiene and plenty of water. I can advice you for a change in medication but you need to be very vigilant initially for any fluctuations. Your exact blood sugar values might have given a better understanding though. Below I am modifying your medication of Gemer and adding Voglibose. Stop using Jardiance. Be very strict to yourself in having controlled diet with more of fruit and salads. Regular yoga and exercise. Tablet Gemer DS (Glimpiride) 3 mg in the morning 15 minutes before breakfast. Tablet Voglibo (Voglibose) 0.2 mg just before first bite of your breakfast. Rest continue with the same medication at night.

We have been told the following are metastases which we agree with: 1 liver met, 1 aortocaval node, 1 sub pleural nodule. But the oncologist letter says possible peritoneal disease? Why did the CT report not state peritoneal disease and onco has rated this? Mets are under 2 cm, if they are ablated is this better? So far irinotecan not worked, what to do? Prognosis?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your situation at the moment. But you have to accept the facts about your patient. First thing is he has incurable disease, he has undergone a major surgery, in spite of treatment underlying disease is progressive, and most important the disease is wide spread in the body in distant organs. So the treatment options are very limited which have been tried already and beyond that the disease is not responding to the treatment given. Coming to your questions. 1. The aortocaval node is increased in size this is suggestive of peritoneal progression. So oncologist can see it in CT films. It is not necessary that only radiologist findings to be final. Also there are adrenal metastasis. 2. Only ablation of liver mets will not cure the disease as it is stage 4 that means it is spread to other organs already. So treatment of metastatic lesions will not cure primary disease. 3. Irinotecan not worked suggests that it is chemoresistant malignancy. So any palliative treatment will not work in future. 4. Last thing about prognosis---you have already been told by your primary oncophysician about it. It is stage 4 disease now with no response to palliative chemotherapy. So prognosis is very grave. He is so lucky that in spite of such progressive disease he is asymptomatic at present. But we cannot predict exactly when the things will go wrong and the period he will be alright.

Responses are by the question numbers: 1.I have been working as an anesthesiologist for the past 8 years. 2.I would administer anesthesia for around 15-20 caesarean sections per month. 3. In my practice RA is the choice of anesthesia for the pregnant mother under going C section.When RA is contra-indicated we do administer GA; in this scenario we avoid opioids drugs since they cross the placental barrier which is can affect the baby; I use induction drugs like Propofol, muscle relaxation with Succinylcholine and Vecuronium, and maintenance with nitrous oxide and oxygen. Once the baby is delivered I give the opioids for the pain relief. 4.Yes I am aware but I just follow my hospital/team protocols. 5. Opioids drugs like fentanyl, pentazocine etc can affect the fetus/ neonate.I am unaware of the effects of other anesthetic drugs on the fetus/neonate. 6.I do not practice pediatric anesthesia. 7. Not applicable. 8.Thiopentone -Barbiturate; Fentanyl, pentazocine, -Opioids; Vecuronium-Muscle relaxant, Midazolam-Benzodiazepine,Propofol- unclassified. 9. We do use cocktail mixtures. 10. Ketamine can cause severe neurological complications in the fetus/neonate.Others I am not sure. 11.I have a pre-anesthetic clinic in which I assess and choose the appropriate anesthesia. I explain in detail about the anesthetic procedure, complications if any. Finally I answer the client’s queries and explain pre-anesthetic instructions. 12.

Or anything else? Not braces please and the fewer appointments are better.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, I need to know your age. The treatment plan varies according to the age factor. Secondly, the impacted tooth no matter where it is, it should be 100% removed. This is done to reduce the possibility of complications in the future. It cannot even form a cyst, abscess, etc., because it is prone to infections. Only after the removal and depending on the remaining space restoration options are considered. If you are young, then braces option will give you the best result because it does not involve grinding of teeth. Plus it gives you a permanent result. Even though the time frame is more for the treatment, it is worth it. Next is the bridge option. Here, there is grinding of teeth on either side of the gap. Reliable but why do you want to unnecessarily grind the teeth which might make your teeth sensitive when the bridge fails in the long run. Then you got to fix it again. Double expense. Implant is a good option. This depends on how sound is your jaw bone and for canines, it is mostly not considered because of the difficulty in imitating the natural aesthetics. For a detailed and customized treatment plan please visit your dentist and discuss the best option that suits your age and the quality of bone."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For the last two days, I have a ringing sound in my right ear.

What doctor has prescribed you is correct. Audiometry will see if you have any associated hearing loss and tympanometry will see if there is any middle ear infection that is causing hearing loss. (though the prescription is not attached). Wisdom tooth will cause radiating pain or fullness in the ears but not tinnitus. Please do not use hydrogen peroxide drops unless prescribed by an ENT specialist because it is used to remove wax in ears. If your external ear is clear then there is no point in using the drops.

It is true that for a diagnosis of clinical depression the symptoms need to persist for two weeks but with such a prolonged history sub-threshold symptoms may be present. It will help if you can maintain a mood diary to objectively chart your mood. You report feeling normal or hyper on other days, it will be helpful to have more information to ascertain what you mean by 'hyper'? Have you experienced any manic or hypomanic symptoms? It looks like you are having a mood disorder. With more information, we can classify further and you can be supported accordingly. You also report headache and stomach ache but no physical causes were found. These are probably functional somatic symptoms. They are common in people with emotional problems (like depression and anxiety). Good thing is you will get better with appropriate support. Have you discussed with your parents or close family member about your problems? I will suggest having an open chat with them (you can even show them this icliniq query). You can consult your family member who can refer you to a psychiatrist for treatment of your mood problems. You will be benefited from talking therapy or counseling. In severe cases, medication to help your mood can be prescribed. Self-help measures are also beneficial. Start by eating, sleeping and exercising regularly. Try to follow progressive muscle relaxation exercises and deep breathing exercises. I hope this helps. Talking therapy, ?

Females are at a higher risk of autoimmune disorder, and can be present with localized or systemic manifestations.

Rarely recurrent infection due to immune suppression, secondary to CHOP therapy could be present. 2. Investigations necessary are: Stool examination to rule out infections - bacterial or parasitic. Also any presence of blood requires evaluation. Fecal fat estimation can be done and if positive, points towards malnutrition. Colonoscopy to rule out ulcerative colitis or crohns disease (autoimmune disorders). Biopsy is necessary for confirmation. Other causes could be irritable bowel syndrome (if no cause is identified), or malabsorption disorders. Possibility are rare at this age. Get a colonoscopy and endoscopy done. If any ulcerations is seen, biopsy needs to be taken. Based on biopsy further treatment is essential. Biopsy can help in identifying, whether you require medical or surgical line of therapy. Do get a colonoscopy and stool examination done. Due to absence of reports, I cannot comment further. Take a fiber rich diet. Increased risk of malabsorption and malnutrition is going to be present along with decreased body fluid volume. Take good amount of fluids along with a balanced diet. Avoid unnecessary medications and drug interactions can also cause diarrhea (At present, difficult to suspect this long)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 28 year old male. I got a lump in the right side of my neck before two weeks. I am taking capsule Cipmox 500, but it has not yet cured.

If you are doing well with Skizoril (Clozapine) and Nexito forte (Escitalopram), I think you must continue with the same. Schizophrenia is a terrible psychiatric illness.

Last week they ended up doing an angioplasty. They had not given him the results of any of the tests they had done, mostly just an x-ray and a sonogram.

Yesterday, he started to have shortness of breath again and checked himself into the ER at 4 AM; he has been there ever since. They did more x-rays and found nothing in his lungs and another sonogram. For some reason, they are refusing to do a CT scan saying they would rather just do another angioplasty. They said a CT scan would not detect any clots. I find this utterly absurd. I think it is weird that they want to go in and put in another stent without further testing.

If I try to pull it out I am afraid that it will be my permanent tooth. The pain started last week. I do not know what to do. I talked to my dentist and he said that he did not see anything wrong with it but, for some reason, the pain is still going. I cannot sleep at night and it gives me ear pain.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. Firstly, I would like to tell you that ear pain, pain during night, and the looseness you feel in the tooth are all the signs of a deeply infected tooth. Secondly, it is not necessary to be for the same filled molar to give you trouble. The pain might be from the same molar or could be due to a different tooth on the same side. I would not be able to arrive at a correct diagnosis until at least I see a picture of your teeth in that row. It seems you take pain killers for the same and there is nothing more I could prescribe (considering your age). The only way to immediate pain relief would be an active dental treatment for the affected tooth as soon as possible. It cannot be cured just with pain killers or any other medications. I advise you to see the dentist with an emergency appointment and look upon the issue. If you do not address the issue, then there are more chances of the tooth to undergo severe internal pressure and you might get a swelling next to the tooth.

I had an ECG and the doctor said that my ECG showed possible left ventricle enlargement. He then asked me to perform different breathing while he checked me with a stethoscope. He said he could hear no blockages or other problems and that my blood pressure was slightly raised, usually, it is normal. He said that I was suffering from anxiety and had a panic attack. I have suffered from anxiety all my life. When I asked about the enlargement he said my ECG was borderline. I am now worrying excessively about this and whether to have another ECG just to be on the safe side. I am fit, eat a healthy diet and have not drunk since I was in my 20s. I work out regularly since the age of 25 and I am now 40. I had this ECG abroad as I was working away so I am wondering whether to have it checked back home.

Did you ever have chest pain or symptoms of excessive sweating with pain? If your ECG is fine, then there are very fewer chances of you having a cardiac pathology. Left ventricular hypertrophy develops after prolonged hypertension in individuals, but as you have said you have normal blood pressure so I do not think LVH should be there. To relieve your anxiety you can undergo a stress echo or TMT (treadmill test) to rule out inducible angina. Also, you said you do not develop symptoms during exercise so I do not think stress echo or TMT will come out positive."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I have taken i-pill (72 hours) within 18 hours of intercourse but still, I got pregnant.

Could you suggest what the images of my CT film indicate? There are some lesions on my bone. What do they mean? What should be the treatment? I am currently on Amlodipine/Valsartan 2.5/40 mg.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for writing into us and I have gone through the CT scan images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There is a lesion in the right intertrochanteric area and is showing characteristics of an osteoma and is almost always a benign condition. One must look out for any severe pain and any abnormal bone growth in the area. Many osteomas might disappear with time and no active treatment is needed. In cases when the pain is severe then surgery and bone curettage might help. There is a likely area of excess calcium deposition and showing a white spot in the left iliac bone near the left sacroiliac joint area and is called a bone island. A bone island is usually not treated. However to confirm a bone island and to rule out other lesions, a nuclear bone scan can help. The thickening of the left anterior pararenal fascia is likely not significant. The gall bladder is not well visualized."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My regular period comes 24th of every month.

After taking the second I-pill, the withdrawal bleed started on 5th, which again marked the onset of a fresh cycle.

I am quite careful with my teeth and brush or rinse regularly every day so I am confused to what may have caused this. This morning I woke up with a redness on the tip of my tongue too. I wonder if it is because I have poked the bump with it just to feel wether it is still there. I have switched to Peroxyl mouthwash to see if this may solve it. Can you advise me on what this maybe? I am a little worried.","Doctor":"Hello. It could be a common aphthous ulcer (canker sore). It has various causative factors. It could be because of vitamin deficiencies, hormonal changes, psychological stress, allergies, accidental trauma or bacterial infection. A clear clinical picture of the ulcer or bump will help to determine what is it and what caused it. If that is an aphthous ulcer, it may take a couple of weeks for it to resolve. Redness on the tip of the tongue could be due to constant rubbing of the bump or ulcerated area. White tissue over that area could be healing tissues. Please do not disturb them. Meanwhile, 1. Avoid hot and spicy foods. 2. Do warm saline mouth rinses thrice daily. 3. Rinse mouth after every meal. 4. Drink lots of water and keep yourself hydrated at all times. Maintaining good oral hygiene and following the above said instructions will prevent further infection of the ulcer and promotes faster healing. If required, if it hurts, a topical anesthetic like Orajel can be applied over the ulcer with a clean finger. I hope this helps.

Basically from your history, you might be suffering from what is known as serotonin syndrome.

It can also occur with Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) and Bupropion (Wellbutrin) are taken together due to drug interactions but I assume you must have been taking them for a while now so it is not that. The best advise for you is to stop Delsym right away. I would also advice you to consult the doctor who prescribed you the other two drugs to stop or reduce the dosage to rule out serotonin syndrome with them as well. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Every day I feel intense disgust for humanity and people. I struggle with sadism, and my last girlfriend broke up with me because that went too far. It has always been a problem in relationships for me. I hate society so much. Every time I see a person I want to torture them brutally. Every house I walk by I want to just kick the door down. I just hate them all. I do not even value my own life. I am nothing. I feel like I was just born for this. Born wrong. Born to be a problem. I tried to fight it too, and I failed. No matter how much I tried to control it, even when professionals were involved, it overpowered me and ruined what little good was in my life. I am no immediate danger of hurting people, but I think one day I am going to really snap. I have built up an intensive library of bad experiences with people, and I do not think I can take much more. People repulse me now. Is there any hope for people whose brains are as warped as mine? I am 31 and I struggle to even hold down a job, because I find I get emotionally exhausted doing things I do not actually want to do. I also have a destructive temper, so that causes trouble at work too. What do I do? I have been through the emotions. You are only another psychiatrist, so I do not know what I am expecting in reaching out again. How can I break the cycle if therapy or medicines, and psych wards have not helped me? I have already tried taking my own life three times.","Doctor":"Hi. I can imagine how hard it is for you right now, anger, hatred, past traumas and experiences consume us all. In your case, it has gone a little too far. But, the fact that you have reached out even after trying everything is enough for me to see hope and tell you that yes, there is still something that can be done. Change is hard, and it takes huge amounts of strength and struggle but if you have decided that you need to get out of this situation and you are willing to do anything for it, then no one can stop you. I would suggest you to first ask yourself how determined are you for a change. If this is just another call to check if things can work and you yourself have doubts then surely you will fail and everything you try will fail as well. If you decide that you will find a way out, then no one can stop you. I would suggest starting therapy sessions regularly with a psychotherapy expert. If you cannot find one then you can opt for online therapy sessions with me. First, you need to vent out and learn to let go of past traumas. It will be hard and will take time but until and unless you do that, you cannot move forward. Once you are there, that is when we can focus on building new perspective and living a good life. Again telling you, it will be really hard, but it is possible. So find a local therapist or opt for a video consultation and we can talk. I hope this helps. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

As winters are very cold in my area, I cought cold as I was riding my bike with no proper protection from winter. I started coughing that night but I did not care it how ever increased I ate curd and smoked cigarette. This made my cough worse. So I took medication for it and my cough was gone in three days but not totally. I started coughing thrice a day. But as due to my business I had to travel. I have not taken proper rest and given up smoking. I smoked for 5 years (3rd and 4th, 5th year i smoked 5 cigarettes a day.) Average. Now I have given up totally. My weight is stable. I feel hungry a lot. Never smoked weed or reverse smoked. I am non-alcoholic. No shortness of breath. Only cough is my issue and its dry and no mucus. My cough is increased from day before yesterday as I was in AC couch of train and every single person near me was coughing very badly. So I am taking Montec LC twice a day and Ascoril D thrice 10 ml started from last night. And it made it worse without medicine I was coughing twice or thrice aday but now it is increased. Is it lung or throat cancer cause if I check on internet it makes me really sad and I really regret smoking. So, please help me and suggest me something. What should I do. I am in tears right now do not know what to do I just do not want to die now.","Doctor":"Hello. I would like to change the medicines you are on slightly. First, instead of Montek LC take Allergra M in the morning. Take it once a day only. Take Alex lozenges whenever you feel cough sensation. The lozenges have to be sucked and not swallowed. Take Cherikoff LS syrup thrice daily, 1 TSP. Drink plenty of warm water. Abstain from smoking. Take tablet Pantacid 40 mg 1 tablet twice daily before meals. Avoid dust and smoke. If going in dust areas wear a mask. Most probably it will not be cancer. Take the above treatment and write to us after 2 or 3 days. You will make good progress. If within 2 or 3 days you do not find any progress then I suggest you take a course of Clarithromycin 250 mg 1 tablet twice daily for 5 days. When you write to us next, please take a picture of open throat and send us so that we can see the posterior pharyngeal wall for any nodule or congestion or hypertrophy.

Are you personally familiar with any such case? If so, was the surgery successful? Did the surgery cause penile curvature? If so, how many degrees did it had? What was the stricture length? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi. I am a Urologist and I have performed urethroplasties. But, excision and primary anastomosis is the procedure of choice only in short segment urethral strictures and they occur in the majority of traumatic urethral strictures that occur in the proximal urethra. Such a stricture in distal urethra is rare. However, I had to do excision and primary anastomosis in an iatrogenic distal penile urethral injury, wherein the surgeon had badly damaged distal penile urethra during an attempt to dilate the distal urethra. I was called intraoperative. The urethral plate was badly damaged in that case for only 1 cm. I did excise that part and anastomosed end to end and the result was excellent and there was no postoperative chordee (bending). Other than this case, I have not done any EPA in distal urethra."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,It usually pains in joints and happened for some years now. I have shown to various doctors and was told that it is due to a low level of Vit D3 and cured by taking regular Vit D3 medicines. Recently I have noticed pains in my joints in leg, hand, elbow, and foot. The affected area becomes a little red with swelling and pain. I had tested for uric acid and the level is under range. Though after the uric acid test, my doctor suggested avoiding rich protein diet and also drink a lot of water. Currently, I drink 2 liters of water per day.Since with all this, the pain has not completely settled and therefore I have done some more tests - CRP [result-33.6 (normal: under 6)], and other reports RA-quantitative (serum), and ASO are normal. With the increase of CRP, my doctor has suggested consulting Rheumatologist for further advice. Hence, I am requesting your advice.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. Your symptoms typically match palindromic rheumatism. It is an intermittent form of arthritis that can keep throwing joint pains and swelling intermittently initially. CRP done during an episode may have been high. There is a 50 percent chance that it may become persistent and 50 percent it may remain this way. Only one test is missing which is an anti-CCP antibody. Kindly do that and let me know what it says. As for the treatment, I would suggest you maintain a diary of attacks. If joint swelling is persisting for more than seven days, then we need to start treatment or else if it goes off. If you do not get another episode for a month, then we shall wait. Hope the information was useful. ESR anti CCP antibody and ANA(IFA)"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 49-year-old woman and last month I was hospitalized with a necrotizing soft tissue infection on my thigh. I had two debridement surgeries and was discharged after 5 days. I was treated with about 4 IV antibiotics. I do not remember them all, I recall seeing Vancomycin and Penicillin. I was told that the infection was not MRSA, but a \\"slower moving bacteria\\" they did not tell me what it was. I was swabbed for MRSA in my nose and butt before both surgeries and was told I did not have it. For the last day of my stay, I had a roommate who had a bad MRSA infection on her butt and sometimes had diarrhea incontinence during dressing changes. I had no physical contact with her, but we had the same nurse. I was discharged with a five day course of Augmentin. The wound has been healing very well and has not gotten infected, but three weeks after discharge I got an abscess under my arm. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed Clindamycin and told to return in three days for drainage. The abscess did not improve or get worse over the three days. I got it drained and was prescribed Augmentin and told to also continue the clindamycin. That was a week ago and the wound is healing well. They called today and said cultures show it was MRSA and they prescribed Bactrim and told me to stop the other antibiotics. I am feeling devastated by this and wanting to understand why it happened. Could I have gotten it in the hospital? I am concerned that it will not go away. Are those swabs at the hospital conclusive and mean for sure I did not have MRSA a month ago? I have never had any medical problems before and these experiences have been very frightening. Is there anything else I can do to prevent recurrence? I have read about everything from bleach baths and hibiclens to antibiotics in the nose.","Doctor":"Hi, I am sorry for what you have had to go through. As you previously did not have MRSA strains, it is possible that now you have hospital-acquired strains in your blood. It is a superbug and superdifficult to treat as it is resistant to drugs of choice so you have get culture and sensitivity test to find out which one is it sensitive to. As you were told to stop other antibiotics and start Bactrim, this means the strain you have got is sensitive to Bactrim. If there is anything else you want to ask, please feel free to contact me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have recently relocated to my workplace. Due to relocation, I had to consume outside food for two months. I had started growing skin rashes. It was diagnosed as an allergy. Two medicines have been recommended by the doctor. Allegra 180 mg and Azithromycin 500 mg. I ate drumsticks today and I got the allergies back. Let me know please what all food should not be consumed? What foods should I consume for regaining proper health that would not be allergic? Also, whenever I keep my body heated, the itching fades away, but when it is becoming cold the allergy is back. Are there any tests to be carried out?","Doctor":"Hello doctor, Certain cities are known for allergies. Some people who are genetically probing for allergy atopy and hypersensitivity start showing symptoms in certain cities. It is difficult to say what foods to avoid. But I can give you some ideas about it. There could be a food allergy or aeroallergy. Your place has a lot of ethnic trees and pollen-related allergy. The tests you must do are serum IgE (immunoglobulin E). If the levels are elevated that shows atopy and thereafter you will have to do a skin prick testing or blood immunoCAP testing. The latter two tests will clearly show us which substances can cause allergy in you. If you desire you may get serum IgE and one of the tests (either skin prick or blood immunoCAP) done together. Meanwhile, keep away from plants and dust. Avoid smoke. Avoid air-conditioner at home or workplace. Try to keep the temperature at an optimum level and not very cold. Drink plenty of water. Take a diary and note down whenever you eat or drink something different and if you get rashes or allergy. Keep your bed and beddings very clean. Change sheets frequently. Dust the sheets in the balcony or outside the house. Vacuum clean all crevices and corners in the house. Wash curtains frequently. Beddings, curtains, etc., be washed in warm water, soak them for two hours in warm water, about 60 degrees. These are known to harbor house dust mites. Please let us know the symptoms of your allergy-like nasal or skin. Also, let us know if the tablets recommended relieve you of the lesions. If possible take a few pictures of the skin rashes and send to me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Ulcers are formed after getting a tooth extraction and have gotten worse and not gone away. They have been there for a month. I am worried it is oral cancer. Also, my tongue is sensitive and my tongue is slightly white, I also got white spots on the inside of my cheek and irritated red spot on my tongue and the roof of the mouth. I was taking Amoxicillin.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details and also saw the pictures you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The oral ulcer at the corner of your mouth seems to be formed by some external irritating factors like a toothbrush hurt. If that is the same area where tooth extraction was done, it looks perfectly healed. So the ulcer close by can also heal equally. The red and white spots are nothing but oral ulcers that have recurred every now and then. Maybe that is why you say that it is there for more than a month. Also, I find that you have done tongue piercing. I suspect that is the reason for the red spot ulcers over the roof of your mouth. This also is an indicator of difficulty in maintaining tongue hygiene which resulted in a white tongue. Oral ulcers can be treated by applying a small amount of Dentogel 15 gm on the affected area with clean fingers three to five times daily. Make sure you maintain good oral hygiene too. Recurrent mouth ulcers also refer to vitamin B deficiencies for which please eat nutritious whole fruits and veggies instead of fried and fast food. Please do not relate it to cancer and get panicked. Once the rooting cause for oral ulcers are removed, then it will heal normally and might not come back. You will be fine. Blood check for vitamin deficiencies. Tongue cleanliness: Scraping tongue with blunt plastic tongue cleaner or with the back of the toothbrush head."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been watching porn since my 18 years and now I am 31 and got married. Recently, I am getting an erection but after ejaculation, I am unable to regain my erection and sometimes it goes down without even ejaculation. Please suggest so that I can have two to three times in the night. And also suggest to me on the usage of Tadafil 10 mg and can this be used for a prolonged period as the effect of this medicine stay for 48 hours? Can this be used for a lifetime every alternative day? What are the future problems with this medication?","Doctor":"Hi. Good and satisfactory sex is never related to the frequency of intercourses in a day or duration of intercourse. Although these factors play an important role in sexual satisfaction but not the only factors. It is the quality of sexual encounters that matter. One can have a wonderful sexual life while having sex once a week. On the other hand, those having sex three times a day may not be happy with their sexual life. So stop worrying about how to have sex two to three times a night. It is not a competition. In the fourth decade of life (30-39 years) the level of testosterone hormone begins to decline progressively while it is most abundant in the late teenage and early adulthood. As you cannot expect to have the libido of a 20-year-old male. If you think your sexual desire is gratified by having sex once a day then it is fine. You need to improve the quality of sexual relationship by having lots of foreplay and imagination. Tadalafil can be used if you feel your erection is not persistent during sex but I think you are fine without it. It is usually not advisable to take Tadalafil more than twice a week."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 43 years old. From my 25 years of age I am suffering from burning epigastrium i.e. erosive antral gastritis. The endoscopy report shows erosion ++, congestion +. My Physician has suggested any of PPI like Pantroprazole 40 mg OD or Rabeprazole 40 mg OD. I Simply wish to know is there any way out to cure it? I am taking PPIs for 22 years. I am negative for H.Pylori.","Doctor":"Hi. Along with chronic gastritis, you seem to be having hypertension and might also have diabetes. You must get your HbA1C (glycated hemoglobin) levels done. The chronic gastritis is basically of 3 types, environmental, autoimmune and least common diffuse antral gastritis. As you have reported above yours is an antral type. The problem with antral type gastritis is that it is associated with increased acid output from the gastric glands and might lead to duodenal ulcers. PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitors) are H+ion (proton) inhibitors, they block acid secretion and hence are helpful in this type. Now the catch here is H.Pylori. Usually, H.Pylori is harmful and causes destruction of gastric glands, but in case of antral Gastritis where the gastric glands are hypersecreting, the destruction of these glands provides symptomatic relief. In your case H.Pylori is negative and hence you are having these symptoms. Your symptoms will remain suppressed while you take PPI and whenever you will stop PPI there would be an exacerbation of these symptoms. You should get yourself thoroughly investigated and other organic causes should be ruled out. Some lifestyle modifications you can try, which I have already answered in this link. Here was a study performed in China, where it was found that \\"green tea\\" reduced the risk of gastritis by 50%. I hope your treating physician would have tried giving you Sucralfate or Gefarnate. If not you can try the above either of the two. Also, you should keep a check on your blood sugar levels and exercise regularly. An hour of a brisk walk for five out of seven days in a week will definitely help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26-year-old female. I experience pain during intercourse.

Please help. Also, I have genital herpes. And I fear sex because I do not want to trigger the symptoms or eruptions again. I take Acivir for this.","Doctor":"Hello. You probably are suffering from a condition known as vaginismus. It is characterized by involuntary spasm of pelvic muscles around the vagina making it almost impossible to penetrate. The condition is usually related to conscious or unconscious anxieties about having sex. Sexual abuse during childhood, sexual harassment, and feelings of dislike and disgust towards sex and sexual partner are the issues commonly associated with it but it can occur in the absence of any such history. Another common cause of painful sex is PID (pelvic inflammatory disease), a condition caused by infection of internal reproductive organs. Signs and symptoms include painful sex, abnormal vaginal discharge, and chronic lower backache. In case of vaginismus, the patients are symptom-free while not having sex. i.e. pain occurs only during sex. The treatment includes relaxation techniques like systematic desensitization and progressive muscular relaxation. The goal is to get comfortable with penetration. Here is what you can do: First, do Kegel exercises by squeezing the same muscles you use to stop the flow of urine when urinating. Squeeze the muscles. Hold for two to ten seconds then relax the muscles. Do about 20 Kegels at a time. You can do them as many times a day as you want to. After a few days, insert one finger, up to about the first knuckle joint, inside the vagina while doing the exercises. Use any lubricant while doing it. Start with one finger and work your way up to three. You will feel the muscles of vagina contracting around your finger, and you can always take your finger out if you are not comfortable. This way you can teach your nervous system not to contract vaginal muscles while penetration."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My cholesterol and triglyceride levels are elevated.

Your urine and blood report are normal except for the presence of ketone bodies in urine which is usually absent in urine. The reason for that usually are diabetes ketoacidosis, starvation ketoacidosis, etc. Check your random blood sugar level to rule out diabetes. The increased metabolic activity also can also lead to the appearance of ketone bodies in urine. So check hyperthyroidism also by serum TSH (thyroid-stimulation hormone) estimation which also can lead to weakness. For weakness, anemia and liver doses has been ruled out here through reports. Check for serum urea and creatinine to rule out kidney disease. If you are drinking alcohol then provide history about that. And finally, you can check serum sodium, potassium and calcium levels as well. If all these are normal then over exertion due to the relocation can be the possibility for your tiredness. For amoebiasis, get treated by Metronidazole. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would really like to try LSD just as a matter of curiosity, I am aware of all the risks and side effects as well as having no known history of mental illness in my family and I am a happy person with no depression or anything like that. While I believe the risk for me personally to be very low I would still like to be safe hence my question. Do you think if I went to my GP and told them what I wanted to do, do you think there is a chance of even getting 1 pill of an antipsychotic to kill the effects in case things go downhill. Obviously I know the best thing is to not do it at all but if you had a patient come to you and ask you what would you say?","Doctor":"Hello. You have raised a very interesting query. Well done for seeking information on safety. I see that you are keen on experimenting with LSD and knowing the risks involved you want to make an informed decision. LSD trips/psychdelic experiences by using street drugs are unpredictable and difficult to speculate the outcome. Hence it is not advisable to try it. It is highly unlikely your GP or any other doctor will prescribe an antipsychotic prophylactically just incase you have a bad trip.  Antipsychotics are powerful medication and can cause side effects on their own, so needs to be used with caution when necessary after appropriate examination. Moreover, if you develop any altered mental state that persists after using LSD you will need a proper medical evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had braces and got them off and two tooth (upper left, last two) had a gap. My dentist said my filling also chipped from the removal and decided to redo the filling. Afterwards I experienced pain. Like sharp pain from eating hard things like chips, grainy things that went into the grooves. I went back and they fixed my bite by shaving some off. That did not work, so I went back and they redid the filling on the last back tooth because that is where I experienced the most pain. I went home waited two weeks or so and had same pain when eating hard grainy things. So I went back and they fixed the bite. Went back again after a few weeks because same issue came up, they found natural tooth was an issue and said maybe I was getting down to the dentin. They refilled those small spots. I went home and had to go back in after a few weeks because I felt a few minor sensitive areas. They fixed my bite by shaving some off again. And of course that did not help so I went in again and this time they found two areas of the natural tooth and the filling was sensitive, they think the filling was sensitive was maybe due to the shaving from previous appointment. This time the following day it was way worse in terms of eating. Maybe it was the day after but running my fingernail on the tooth was sensitive. My dentist said I may need an onlay or crown if this keeps happening. I went to another dentist for second opinion, and took X-rays as attached. She said the filling looks good, and it was done well and it is all smooth. I wanted her to give me a second opinion and if I should get an onlay or crown. She said part of my filling is close to the nerve. I was surprised to hear that because the first time they did the filling it was far from the nerve, so I don not know what happened (maybe they redid it and drilled more). She said even if I do an onlay or crown that with the temporary might not work and I can still be sensitive, in which I would need a root canal. I called my friend who is a dentist and she told me I should wait it out. It is also possible the pulp horn can shrink and not be so close to the filling as it is pretty close. She also does not suggest a crown because it is taking away healthy tooth structure and that if that did not work I would have to pay double as I would need a root canal. When air goes on it, it’s sensitive, and sometimes when cold water goes on it it is sensitive, it was not like that before. Just seemed like it all got worse, but then again I just got it done two days ago.","Doctor":"Hello. If only that particular tooth is being sensitive and no other, then the best for you may be going through the root canal treatment. The teeth may have been grinded down due to successive refilling and may now be very close to nerve. Sometimes using a strong toothpaste like GC Toothmousse helps in relieving this sensitivity completely by blocking all tubules, so try it first.Apply some directly around and between those two teeth. Wait for five minutes then brush it off. Crown can be delayed till you can, but just crown or inlay will not work without root canal treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My wife is 45 years old.

I took my first dose (1 whole pill) today and my skin got this red tint and felt hot and I had some hot flashes. Is this something that I should adjust to and can continue taking? I have tried Allegra, Zyrtec and Claritin and Benedryl. None have done much for me. The allergies I am having due to the pollen are causing sinus pressure and mucus that is traveling to my lungs. The Xyzal, along with Mucinex and Sudafed, seems to help with these symptoms. Is the Xyzal safe for me?","Doctor":"Hello. Xyzal is nothing but Levocetrizine. It is the levo isomer of Cetirizine (Zyrtec). The advantage of Xyzal over Zyrtec is that Xyzal is effective over half the dosage of Zyrtec and that the former produces less sleep. The relief you find is more due to Mucinex and Sudafed. Mucinex acts to bring the tenacious mucous out by liquefying it and Sudafed acts to decongest and reduce the vascularity of the area. The main problem allergy which leads to sinus congestion and all these symptoms has to be addressed. First we should do an allergy testing to find out what exactly is causing the allergy, whether it is dust mite, pollen or fungus. Subsequently you can take some avoidance precautions. If that does not work then medicines like what you are taking and eventually if nothing works, immunotherapy can be tried."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Two weeks ago I had a scrotoplasty. Accompanied with this was liposuction (around lower stomach and inside of thighs towards the groin) to thicken the penis. Operation went well. Had general swelling and edema of the penis and scrotum with pain. I have been taking anti-inlfammatory tables, antibacterial antibiotics and pain killers. One of the symptoms I have had is pain in my penis when I stand. It is like the blood rushes to that area and cause discomfort. I then lie back down and the pain subsides. Based on this I have just been resting. I noticed yesterday when feeling the scrotum that my left testicle has swollen. I am guessing it is about two inches long by 1.5 inches wide in the shape of an egg. It is not soar to touch, but feels hard. The scrotum or stiches do not show any signs or reddness and the scrotum appears to be okay in color. I have not had a fever or vomiting. I have read different reports on line as to why this could be like fluids draining from liposuction into scrotum, severe edema, orchitis, etc. And advice would be appreciated?","Doctor":"Hi.  First of all I would like to inform you that size mentioned by you is within normal range and it should not be called swelling unless there is gross difference from other side. The average testis size is 3 to 5 cm in length and 3 to 4 cm in width. Now, regarding feeling hard, this is completely normal after scrotoplasty as there is mild deem of testicular skin along with testis itself. This may take almost 4-6 weeks to completely disappear. I feel this is normal complication of surgery as there is no fever, no tenderness, no redness (sighs of inflammation). I would like to inform you that keeping scrotal support and proper rest may help you. In case this continues to remain in same stage sort aggravates with time it will be ideal to see your doctor and get examined. Regarding other symptoms related to pain at the tip of penis I feel this is due to clogging of secretions in urethra which creates problem. In my opinion excess intake of water and fluids may help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am going to be under general anesthesia in coming days for surgery. I did let my pre-op nurse know and wrote down all current medicines and supplements but have a question about 2 supplements. As I am not going to take them the night before anyways but just wanted insight. The first is Kratom. I wanted her to know so the anesthesiologist could dose my pain medicines right during surgery. Second is Phenibut F.A.A. (Free Amino Acid) would this would this have any effect on tolerance to the Benzodiazepine they choose to administer?","Doctor":"Hi. You are taking 2 drugs one of which is Psychoactive compound (Kratom) while other one is mind calming magnet (Phenibut). If you are taking those drugs since long time then you may have some tolerance to Opioids/Benzodiazepines/other sedative anesthetic medicines. So I would suggest you personally inform the anaesthesiologist regarding them so that he can make necessary adjustments in dose of anesthetic agents. I just have added effects of these medicines on body. Kratom contains psychoactive compounds Mitragynine (C23H30N2O4, molecular weight 398.49) and 7-hydoxymitragynine (7-HMG). It is used to treat chronic pain or opioid withdrawal, although no scientific evidence supports this use. The leaves are used for recreation and for self-medicated opioid withdrawal treatment.Kratom's toxic effects include dry mouth, changes in urination, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Serious complications, such as seizures and coma, have been reported. The effects of Kratom are dose dependent. Small doses produce cocaine-like effects; larger doses cause morphine-like sedative effects. Kratom users report increased work capacity, alertness, sociability, and sometimes increased sexual desire. Phenibut is a modified version of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which is one of the inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain. It exhibits a relaxing effect and is also describe as producing a euphoriant, dis-inhibiting and calming state of mind."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to tell you that I have sensineural hearing loss and tinnitus according to my reports.

Will my tinnitus cure of its own? Do I need any further testing like MRI? Please check.","Doctor":"Hi. Since how many days are you having hearing loss and tinnitus? If it is since a few days you should try taking oral steroids. Your hearing loss can revert back. MRI or any other scan is not needed. But you do let me know if your tinnitus and hearing loss is sudden in onset or not."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Just wondering what type of impression I will need to get if I have to get crowns on last teeth. Like will it be a full top impression or can they do it off just those two teeth?","Doctor":"Hi. Regarding the impression making, the material is chosen depending on what it is being used for. As you have already mentioned that the purpose is to fabricate crowns, the best material to opt for is the rubber impression material (elastomeric silicone impression materials). The advantage of the material is the high accuracy of the details and it allows sufficient time for duplicating the teeth model. Talking about the number of teeth involved during an impression making, usually, it is the whole arch involving all the teeth. That is the routine way of doing it. But there are disposable sectional double impression trays available which help the dentist to make an impression in a particular region along with the opposing teeth. The biggest plus with these trays are firstly preventing contamination because it is used only once and for a single patient. Secondly, upper and lower teeth with the bite are registered in one impression hence time-saving. The maximum number of teeth involved in these kinds of impressions would be four to five but definitely not just two teeth. I personally make double tray impressions on a routine basis for crown fabrications. But,it totally depends on the dentist's well and wish to choose the technique according to his/her skills and economic reasons."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The PET scan report says that the metabolic activity brain appears metastatic.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Foul smelling and dark urine is indicative of cystitis with highly concentrated urine. If there is no blood or hematuria then renal pathology is unlikely or calculus.

I get super nervous and I need to go to the dentist my teeth are getting worse but I am too scared because I know my heart rate will get high. Just wondering if you know what they will do?","Doctor":"Hi. You need not panic at all for a dental visit. All that happens in your first consultation is that the dentist checks your oral status with a mouth mirror and a hook-shaped instrument called explorer. This is the point that most of the young people get scared of. The instruments are not going to hurt you but used to check the tooth on its various surfaces as it is a hard tissue. Once you are thoroughly checked, then if needed x-rays might be taken with complete protection. These days x-ray techniques have gone digital for saving time and to comfort patients. You just need to open your mouth, the x-ray sensor captures the tooth and the pictures will be seen on the computer screen in seconds. The treatment options will be explained to you in detail and the procedures are done only with your consent. No dentist is going to prick you straight away with the needles. So please do not worry about it. In case where you have to get a filling done, there is a rotary machine that sprays water that is used to drill the tooth and again this is super fast when you co-operate. If you are not liking that sound, feel free to put on your favorite music with the headphones during the treatment. Also, feel free with the dental team and ask all your doubts at once because the patient's comfort comes in front of all exquisite treatments. You will be fine."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a cracked tooth which I believe needs a root canal and a crown that I think went bad. I am in excruciating pain. I have been to emergency rooms they have given me Clindamycin and Vicodin for pain but it barely touches the pain. I have been on antibiotics for two days. I thought I would see some improvement but the swelling and pain are getting worse. I have had a staphylococcus infection before is it possible that this could be one? The infection was on the right side of my face. I have been waiting for two months to get into my dentist.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your complaint and relevant details. You have mentioned you got a swelling. I just want to make sure if the swelling is confined close to the tooth or is it spreading? The severe pain along with fever and swelling confirms that the infection has gone bad. Clindamycin is the only antibiotic that you are taking. I recommend you to take Metronidazole 400 mg orally twice daily along with Clindamycin for five days. This will fight against another group of bacteria and reduce the swelling to an extent. Also, continue with your pain killers as well. Tramadol works well for moderate to severe pain. But in your case, it does not sound so. For immediate relief, crush one tablet of Ketorol DT (ketorolac tromethamine) in half a glass of water and drink it straight away. You will feel better in 15 minutes. Otherwise, complete relief will be got only after the necessary dental treatment. Antibiotics are just add ons. Do not totally rely upon them."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 17 years old. I had sex with my partner on the 24th day of the menustruation cycle. I used Today vaginal pill before intercourse. On the next day i.e. 25th day, within 30 hours, I also took i-pill to be sure not to be pregnant. Now my period which was on due is still missing. What are the chances of my pregnancy? What should I do to terminate it, if I am pregnant? Kindly help me out.","Doctor":"Hello. I have reviewed your query thoroughly. I-pill or emergency contraceptive pills have very minimal chance of failure if taken immediately after intercourse within 24 hours and chances of failure gradually increase after that even if taken within 72 hours. There is about one to two percent chance of failure of an emergency pill or i-pill in your case. But we can be quite sure of its success if withdrawal bleeding occurred within four to five days after taking the pill, confirming the shedding of layer of the endometrium. Based on the dates given by you, today must be 8 days following the date of the intercourse. In that case, to find out if you are pregnant, you can get a serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) testing done. For the urine pregnancy tests to show the result if pregnant, it must be at least 10 to 14 days following intercourse. If you want to know urgently whether you are pregnant, you can get serum beta hCG testing. If you can wait another week, you can get a urine pregnancy testing, which if positive must be followed up by ultrasound imaging. Only after then and after consulting an obstetrician, should the abortion be planned under guidance. Furthermore, if you are sexually active regularly, it is better to choose other regular contraceptive methods after consulting an obstetrician and gynecologist instead of i-pill. I-pills are meant to be taken only in case of unexpected accidental unprotected sex, but not on a regular basis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am struggling with pinworm infection. I took one dose of Mebendazole (100 mg) and it helped. Two weeks later, I took the recommended second dose and about three days after I started exhibiting symptoms again. It is now a week after taking the second dose, symptoms are not improving.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your problem. Reinfection with pinworm is quite frequent. Mebendazole two doses are the standard way of treatment. But in your case, reinfection may have occurred because of remnant eggs. 1) Please change your sheets on the bed and wash them thoroughly. 2) Thoroughly wash the undergarments as they are the major source of remnant eggs of pinworm. 3) Wash your hands properly. 4) Avoid scratching in the anal region which you may be doing because of itching. 5) If there is a school going kid at your home, please do inform the class teacher regarding this as other untreated kids may be another source. Another major thing to consider is whether you are definitely having pinworm infection or not? In pinworm infection usually, the eggs which are laid in the perinatal region and worms are not commonly released in stools. The presence of eggs can be diagnosed with a simple tape test at your physician's office. If this is due to any other worm infection, the required dose of Mebendazole is different and what is taken by you will not be sufficient. I suggest you get this clarified because what requires is a simple tape test and a stool examination for other ova or cysts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with IBS-D five years ago.

There is no acceptable or approved method to have a natural abortion. If it happens on its own that would be a different issue, but you doing something on your own to have an abortion is not at all recommended.

Having an abortion on your own at home has hazardous complications including heavy bleeding, leftover fetus parts in the uterus, resultant infection, sepsis and sometimes even may result in death. There would be nothing anybody can do if things go out of hand. You have mentioned that you have no other choice. I politely disagree with you, and whatever the reason maybe it is not worth putting your life at risk. Please go to a doctor personally get medical attention personally. If you cannot go on your own due to legal age or personal reasons, open up to your parents or trusted guardian adults even if it may bring upon their anger or saddens them.

When I touch the spots on the downside of my penis it feels like some kind of tight hard mass inside, but it pains when I try to squeeze them out all in vain. Two-three spots get bigger in size sometimes and remain so for quite a long time and some new spots also arise intermittently.

Unfortunately, this condition has limited treatment options and cure is difficult to assure. Co2 (carbon dioxide) laser is one option, it removes the spot but there can be potential for scarring. Another option is oral Isotretinoin capsule. Isotretinoin is vitamin A derivative, it is used in acne and it shrinks the sebaceous glands.

Can I get the invaslign or just braces will be good and do I have to extract teeth from my upper jaw?","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your query and the attached image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have two lower second premolars extracted with no third molars in the lower jaw. Little bit crowding is seen in both upper lateral incisors that might be the reason for you opting for braces. Well, as a specialist upper tooths have a little bit of space in between the central incisors. Upper front teeth need proximal slicing to facilitate space that space will be enough to realign your both upper lateral to the arch. Although it is just a front profile if possible upload a side profile of your face to evaluate the overjet but I can say just marginal and proximal slicing of the upper front teeth will be enough, and no further extraction needed. Meanwhile, you have missing both lower second premolars. Get a fixed bridge to cover the gaps or else they will shift and get malaligned. Upper third molar are also fine and does not need extraction in the near future. Go for normal braces instead of Invisalign. Normal braces work much better in these cases.

The main issue is with wrist flexion. My problem is that while doing the flexing motion of the wrist with a decent load on it, it cracks in some positions and I lose all my power. In my right wrist, I feel the crack around the ulnar styloid region and in my left wrist, I can feel it around the scaphoid area. The thing is that the thicker the handle of the weight is the better it feels on the wrist, once it is past a certain thickness the cracking stops and I can train properly. Another thing that I notice is that if I try to flex my wrist with squeezed gripper (it is like a plier that you squeeze) then the motion is not smooth at all. I can feel all sorts of cracks and it hurts. The cracks are mainly around the scaphoid area in both wrists, and it is less on the right. Do you believe that a chiropractor could fix this? Do you have any idea of what the problem might be? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your concern. In my opinion, the issue is with an excessive sheer force that you create when you flex your wrist is causing bone on bone rubbing and leading to those crack sounds. Depends on the concentration and loading of weight you feel it at different areas between the right and left wrist. You can get a chiropractor consultation to mobilize the wrist and relieve muscle tension. And then do stability exercises and load your forearm, that should be safe.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

I lost my period and I went to the hospital and they asked me to gain weight. Now I am 42 kg and still, I did not get my period back.","Doctor":"Hi. Now you have two factors that do not allow your periods. As you said, any sudden reduction of weight or even a sudden increase in weight can affect the control of the brain on these hormones which in turn control your ovulation. You are still a young lady in early adolescence. Maybe you had your first periods few years ago. It is only about the age of 19-21 years that your hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis in short, the circuit between your brain hormones and ovarian hormones, becomes mature enough to have normal ovulation and hence normal periods. You gave sudden stress on this circuit with sudden weight reduction, which would have shifted the balance. You need a minimum fat in the body to have normal hormones and normal cycles as ovaries breakdown fat deposits in the body to form hormones. Your target should be height in cm - 100 = weight in kg, I mean your weight should be 158 cm - 100 = around 58 kgs. You were never overweight. Advice: Do not go on binge eating. No fasting. Have a regular controlled diet thrice a day. Reduce the high-calorie diet, junk food, and red meat. Have a lot of proteins. Have regular exercise, aerobics, dance, brisk walk and so on. Have a thyroid profile and serum prolactin done in the early morning in an empty stomach, just to confirm any other hormone problems. Wait for a month or two. I bet your periods will come back. If you still do not get the periods on your own, you will need to evaluate you and start on a cycle of hormones for a month or two to artificially get the hormone train back on track, which has got derailed now. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My wife is currently 6 weeks pregnant. On USG the following have been found: Uterus is bulky. Well formed gestational sac with a living embryo is there. Yolk sac is seen. CRL=.500 cm Heart rate of embryo 121 bpm Ovaries are normal in size. As prescribed by the doctor, she is taking Duphaston thrice a day, Folic acid tablet once a day and Normozyme syrup twice daily. She is weighing 61 kg, and her age is 27 years. I want to know whether everything is alright? And what does bulky uterus mean? Will it harmful for the embryo? She had an anembryonic pregnancy eight months ago and had undergone D and C. We are very much tensed as well as excited. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I see everything is absolutely fine, nothing to worry about. When the baby comes into the uterus, the mother's body has a lot of changes, most important is the excessive blood flow throughout the body. This is required as the baby is a fast growing life. It needs a lot of energy to grow. When blood flow to the uterus increases, the size increases. This is just the beginning. The non-pregnant uterus is only 7 cm long (length of your finger), which has to reach the level of her heart almost. Blood flow everywhere increases face blushes, redness of skin all over, excessive discharge from nose, mouth, stomach and so on as blood flow to these glands increases. Six weeks is the earliest baby heartbeat is seen, so you do see a good sign. Yolk sac (energy store for baby is seen) is a good sign. Well formed sac means no bleeding and the attachment to the uterus is healthy. All the signs are good. She is on supportive medicines. Her age is perfect for pregnancy (19-35 years is a good time). About the anembryonic previous pregnancy, it is due to a genetic abnormality. The best sperm meets the best egg at the right time and sits in the best place in the uterus to form the best baby. Any step wrong in this leads to a bad baby. When you see baby's heartbeat, it means baby is genetically normal. So do not worry about the past. Such abnormal pregnancies are accidents, but accidents do not occur every time. The journey of pregnancy 40 weeks is a long one. There may be problems (every pregnancy can have) but have faith in God, follow doctor's orders and hope for a healthy baby and mother, at the end should be your expectation. Do not think anything that happens is a bad sign. Positive thinking will allay your anxiety."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 32 years old. I am currently facing ED and PE, and reduced muscles and increase waist. Doctor advised for a total testosterone test and the result was 220 and he said it is really low for this age. He advised for injections but is there any natural way to treat it?","Doctor":"Hello. Androgen (testosterone) injection for the purpose of treating ED (erectile dysfunction) is acceptable. But, how long one can take the injection is the question. If someone use it for years together, then there will be some side effects. But, this is the definite therapy. In Siddha, you can take Agasthyar kuzhampu 100 mg in the morning at 6 AM mixed with three Arasam tree tender leaves ground with buttermilk. This will cause diarrhea in some patients. This is to be taken for continuous three days. This drug can be taken every month for three months. Within the third month, this Siddha drug should give the result. If not, the drug to be changed. But, the Agasthyar kuzhampu should be taken strictly from under a Siddha doctor's supervision. For the remaining days, Oorithal thaamarai chooranam, lotus pollen (thamarai magarantham), Poonaikkaali seed powder, drumstick seed, cashew nut are the best herbals to improve ED. All these drugs together come in a single capsule as \\"Rathina purush\\". So, you can try Agasthyar kuzhampu and Rathina purush. Please continue for three months.

Took antibiotics with ENT doctor consultation, I could see improvement in sinus pain, cold but one ear still remains clogged, finding difficulty in hearing.

I have been prescribed Prednisolone 5 mg for 15 days with 6 tablets per day for first five days, then 4 for another 5 days and two for remaining 5 days.

My daughter at the age of 21 started showing signs of depression. She had to drop from university. After six years of struggle and treatment, she is on her way to recovery. But even now she gets panic attacks and feels depressed and is unable to handle stress. My son at exactly the same age (21 years) started showing signs of depression. My kids had a very normal childhood without any issues. We are a normal healthy family. My husband's family has a history of mental health issues. I have heard that at least one member from all our extended family branches had mental health problems. My father-in-law was a patient of chronic depression all his life. Please let me know if depression is genetic and is it possible that my children's problem is because of the genetic predisposition.","Doctor":"Hello. You have asked a very pertinent question. As a parent, I can understand your quest for answers for your children's illness and treatment. Depression is usually caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. If there is a positive family history, a person is more vulnerable to develop depression, especially when faced with environmental stressors (epigenetics). So to answer your question, yes, genetic predisposition could have played a part in your children developing depression, but it may not be the only responsible factor. It is positive that they have a normal childhood. But any factors like academic pressure, or peer relationships, or social interactions or demands of growing up, etc., could have contributed to them feeling stressful which can then trigger depressive episodes. With effective treatment, depression can be very well managed and your children can live productive lives. Treatment involves a combination of medication, psychological therapy like CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) and lifestyle changes. Regular exercise, yoga, and mindfulness meditation will be helpful. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 22-year-old female. I have been having some symptoms for two years. It started with noticing some blood on the toilet paper, went to my GP and he said probably hemorrhoids nothing to worry about and then, I started having diarrhea with blood on the toilet paper again. Then I had constipation with blood in stool. I went to see a specialist that said I had a fissure. Then four months ago, I started having too much diarrhea (at least once a week) and gas and borborygmi after every single meal, no matter what I ate. I went to the specialist, I did celiac test negative and my blood tests all look fine. All my doctors said that I have nothing that it is probably stress but I am too worried. How can I convince them to give me a colonoscopy?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your query in detail. A few details which could be helpful are, have you lost weight? Do you have anemia or any abdominal pain? Have you had a fecal calprotectin done? Apparently, your symptoms have been going on for close two years and specifically since you have had diarrhea with blood on toilet paper, it is unlikely to be due to anal fissures. Anal fissures usually are precipitated by constipation and quite unlikely with diarrhea. Persisting diarrhea and bloating is more in keeping with symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) especially since the celiac markets are negative (anyways celiac disease is unlikely to cause blood with diarrhea). On these grounds, you can certainly insist on a colonoscopy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My grandmother is 65 years old. She has a problem with eye flashes for four years.

Firstly, I want to tell you that (at present) my mother has a uterus tumor and kidney calculus. Last year her triglyceride was 402, cholesterol was 260, ECG was normal and TMT was showing negative. But the doctor said that she has a minor blockage that the machine is not showing. After that, she was taking Starpress XL 100, Rabiros 20 and Ecospirin AV 150/20 for one year. Now for the past two months, she is taking Starpress XL 100, Rabiros 20 and Ecospirin AV 150. But she is facing some problems. During this time period (approximately 18 months) she often feels severe hurtburn and sometimes severe headache. For this problem, we consulted many times, but the doctor does not do anything. Why does she this problem? Her TMT was going to be done this year but that time her Hb was 10 g/dL. Doctor asked her to consume juice and jaggery, but nothing happened. After that, he gave Biofer XT and also consumed juice but her Hb is still the same 10 g/dL. If she consumes pomegranate juice and Biofer XT daily she gets loose motion that is why she left some dose of Biofer XT. Now, she is not feeling any chest pain and because of these problems, she wants to reduce Ecosprin dose every three days. She wants to quit it and wants to take Ayurvedic treatment but the doctor is not allowing her to miss even a single dose. And I also read from the internet that if we leave Aspirin dose it may cause heart attack. Please suggest what to do?","Doctor":"Hello. I want to see the lipid profile, ECG (electrocardiogram), TMT (treadmill stress test) and echocardiography report of your mother to guide you better but still, I recommend you the following: Your mother is taking a high dose of Aspirin i.e. 150 mg (a component of Ecosprin). It may cause heartburn. Reduce it to 75 mg. Another component is Atorvastatin 20 mg. That is fine. Rabiros 20 mg (Rabeprazole) used for heartburn is fine. Reduce the intake of tea and coffee, avoid spices in food. For Hb (hemoglobin), eat healthily. She is taking iron supplements that may also cause heartburn. Take iron supplement after two hours of Rabiros 20 mg to decrease heartburn. Take iron for three months and repeat CBC (complete blood count). Take all the medicines daily, without interruption. Repeat the lipid profile after three months. Reduce weight, adopt active lifestyle, and do exercise. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 13 years old.

Well, you have multiple problems. I want to ask you a few things. Since how much time you are suffering from pain in the stomach? What is the exact location of the pain? Above umbilicus, or around the umbilicus, or below that? Is there any association of meals with pain? Does pain associate with vomiting or loose stools? Is this pain occur during your periods (menses) or all the time? What is your body weight? I suggest taking capsule Omeprazole 20 mg empty stomach once daily in the morning, tablet Dicyclomine and Paracetamol (SOS) when required during pain. If you do not get relieved then get an endoscopy and ultrasonography of abdomen done. For the pain in hip and knee, get an x-ray done first only then we can reach to any conclusion. Take some Calcium preparation available in your country along with some multivitamins. For pain in the neck, get an x-ray cervical spine done AP (anteroposterior) and lateral view. Get following hormonal test done: 1. FSH (follicle stimulating hormone). 2. LH (luteinizing hormone). 3. Prolactin. Advice: Do morning walk and meditation. Take plenty of vegetables and fruits.

What is it? I do not know how long I had it. I do not drink or smoke. Is it cancer like throat cancer or mouth cancer? I am a 27-year-old female. I have white sack looking things behind my tonsil as well with which look like blood vessels. But anyway I am sending the picture. I am scared. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the picture. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The red bumps with white little things on them at the back of the throat (behind the palatopharyngeal arch) are called lymphoid granules. These are lymphoid tissues that are normally present. However, in you, they seem to be slightly enlarged. When enlarged and infected they are very congested, red and may exude pus. In your picture I cannot make out pus. The enlargement without redness or pus may indicate chronic throat infection. In case of chronic pharyngitis or tonsillitis, you may be having these bumps for a long time. However, you may have suffered throat pain, fever, soreness, difficulty in swallowing and painful swallowing intermittently. They are not cancer. The tonsils appear normal to me. They do not have a smooth surface. They have pits called crypts through which tonsillar secretions come out into the mouth. When the pits are clogged then you may develop tonsilloliths or stones which may be painful and give globus feeling. Otherwise, the tonsils look normal. If you suffer from the intermittent symptoms I mentioned then perhaps this is a case of chronic tonsillopharyngitis where we can explore the option of surgically removing the tonsils from both sides to give you relief from the symptoms. Otherwise, we need not bother."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 33 years old. I am a typical introvert person.

Maybe I need to awaken my willpower but do not know how. I know there are many others like me and maybe it is normal for us. But I really want to change myself. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Procrastination is a common trait present in almost all humans. You are insightful about your problem and its commendable that you are trying to address it and change yourself. Many people do not even recognize procrastination as a problem. As you know, people who are able to avoid procrastination are more productive. What sort of career you are in? How much is procrastination affecting your daily life? Is procrastination affecting both your personal and professional life? Sometimes when there are more routine and strict deadlines in office, we tend to perform better and avoid procrastination. I will suggest you write down and make a list of things you could have achieved in your life if procrastination was not an issue. Be objective and just make small points. It should serve as a reminder and motivate you further to avoid procrastinating further. Break all work or goals into small multiple tasks. Do not aim too big, even if you take just a few steps, your mind will get a sense of achievement and you can gradually build up the momentum. Do not worry if you have bad days when you are not able to achieve much. Humans cannot be perfect all the time.  Make sure your general lifestyle is good. Eat healthily, sleep well and exercise regularly. You mention some anxiety, so try progressive muscle relaxation exercise and deep breathing exercises. Discuss with a trusted family member, spouse, or friend about your struggles and plan to overcome them. They can help you stay motivated. If there are any other problems like low mood, excessive anxiety you can consult your family doctor locally. You are welcome to contact us again if further advice is needed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is a 73-year-old male with the following diagnoses: Essential tremor, congestive heart failure (he has a pacemaker), hypertension, borderline diabetes, arthritis in the hips, depression (moderate to severe) and cognitive issues. He received an epidural yesterday for pain in his hips and buttocks, and my mother found his medication list and shared it with me. I am somewhat alarmed about the anti-depressants and opioid combinations in particular after doing some research on serotonin syndrome. Kindly evaluate his prescription.","Doctor":"Hi. Looking at the age and co-morbid conditions, the polypharmacy (multiple drugs) is a must. At the same time, the clinician will assess (monitor) the patient for any serious side effects or drug incompatibility. Since your father has many geriatric complaints, I feel all these drugs are required. Due to old age, he may be having some trouble with kidney or liver functions. Most of the drug gets metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys. Hence, continuous monitoring is required as per the clinician's advice. I hope you are following the clinician's advice. Regarding depression and pain in the hip, the antidepressant drugs and analgesics are unavoidable. Please do not worry about its side effects like serotonin syndrome. This is not seen in all the patients. The symptoms of serotonin syndrome will be taken care of by other antihypertensive or cardiac drugs. Sometimes, he develops diarrhea. As I told earlier, do not worry about the side effects. These are not seen in all patients, and these drugs are mandatory for your father. He can avoid tyramine rich foods (example: beer, chocolate, alcoholic beverages, fermented foods, cheese, sore cream, yogurt, shrimp paste, soy sauce, soybean condiments, teriyaki sauce, tempeh, miso soup, sauerkraut, kimchi, etc.). The antidepressant drugs cause side effects only if more tyramine rich food is consumed while under the medication.

I did an unprotected vaginal and oral sex with a prostitute and have feet and leg burning pain, prickling, tingling in feet and hand fingers. Is there any test that tells I am 100% HIV free? My doctor told me it can take up to five years to detect HIV but on the internet it says three months. Please clear my doubt. When can I do the final test and what I do for my symptoms? Is there any other test for that? Is this neuropathy of HIV?","Doctor":"Hello. Generally, the HIV infection takes few days to years to produce the symptoms (it is called as incubation period). The incubation period is not fixed in HIV infection. It is the time taken for the organism to establish itself within the human body. As all of us know that HIV establishes when one's immunity comes down. So, if someone's immunity is good enough, he may not develop any symptoms even after HIV infection. If the immunity had come down, then the HIV infections will be expressed. Thus, the clinical symptoms appear based on patients immunity. Similarly, the few tests show positive only after the immunity has come down. But, there are some confirmation tests that tell about HIV even in the early stages. The fourth generation HIV test is one among such tests. Thus, we can come to the conclusion that you are HIV negative. The peripheral neuropathy may be due to other causes. Definitely, it is not due to HIV. The first symptoms of HIV infections are continuous fever, body weight loss and chronic diarrhea. In advanced cases, there will be white coating in tongue, continuous sputum expulsion by cough and peripheral neuropathy. I feel you no need to repeat the HIV test again. If you still want, do it after one year. Be prepare your mind that HIV is negative for you. It is the confirmation test."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I think I might have glaucoma.

I am currently taking medicines for depression.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen your attachments. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  It seems like you have posterior uveitis. There is a reaction in vitreous and also inflammation in the retina. However, vomiting and blackouts can be due to neurological deficits. Please get an MRI brain and also followup with a neurologist.

I worked with suppositories, fleet, laxative, magnesium supplements, senna docusate for temporary results. My symptoms are straining excessively, feeling of rectal blockage, digital retrieval to relieve pressure, feeling of incomplete evacuation, intermittent pressure rectal area and dyschezia feel. This can be the case even with soft stool. I used Miralax for eight days. Shortly thereafter, I took 500 mg Magnesium capsules and Benefiber. The next day the stool was bulky, good diameter and easy to pass. I took the same supplements but for the next day, the stool is fairly bulky with some strain. I used the restroom four times to empty the rectum with straining. Later pressure cannot be moved, so used suppository. I am concerned about impaction but no blood or leakage. I had a history of constipation but never like this before. I am taking Dilantin and Levothyroxine for several years.","Doctor":"Hello. From what I could make out from your description is that you have history of constipation but have a recent worsening possibly due to the 'cleanse'. You have a background of hypothyroidism. You have used a plethora of laxatives with some partial relief. For your immediate relief, I would recommend using safer laxatives like PEG (Polyethylene glycol) and Stool Softener under the guidance of a physician or a gastroenterologist. You should also get your thyroid profile checked as uncontrolled hypothyroidism is a known cause of constipation. Do not strain excessively and use enema or suppositories if you feel impaction. You may require a colonoscopy in case you have not had one recently. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 30 years old. I have BRCA1 genetic mutation that is still undergoing more research as they are not sure of the exact risk yet. My mom had breast cancer at the age of 56 and her cousin had the same at the age of 46. They were both positive to hormonal therapy. Another cousin had ovarian cancer at the age of 49. They are all cancer-free now. I have a fibrocystic breast and one fibroadenoma confirmed with a biopsy three years ago. I had an ultrasound scan three months ago and found more cysts and nothing major to worry about. I had another ultrasound a week ago as I felt a new little lump. That lump turned out to be another cyst, but the doctor found another lump she had not seen three months before. It has regular borders and it is moveable but it has some vascularities. She says it cannot be a cyst and could be a fibroadenoma but it has to be confirmed by a biopsy which I will have next week. I know that sometimes triple-negative breast cancer lumps can be mistaken for fibroadenoma but how likely is that chance? I am feeling quite anxious and worried. With a fibrocystic breast is it possible to have a fibroadenoma appear this fast? Or is it possible that an ultrasound would have missed it last time?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Since you have BRCA1 (breast cancer type 1) positive with a strong family history of breast cancer, there is always a risk of developing cancer. You need to have a regular followup. Ultrasound sometime may miss early changes. Since you have a high tendency of developing cancer you can undergo a complete mastectomy. It is a tough decision for you, but it is worth."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I think I have a problem with premature ejaculation for the past five to six months because of stress. It lasts for only three to four minutes after almost 15 minutes of foreplay. What is an ayurvedic medicine you can suggest for immediate results? Will it cause any side effects? Also, how long I need to take such medicines?","Doctor":"Hi. For immediate result, PDE5 (phosphodiesterase type 5) inhibitor is the only option, but it has its own side effects. Kindly share more details so we can find the cause of your issue. There are many reasons for premature ejaculation. 1.\\tStressful work, night duties, 24-hour jobs. 2.\\tDiabetes, hypertension, thyroid issue has an effect on premature ejaculation.

Long term antihypertensive and antipsychiatric medications. 4.\\tFrequent masturbation. 5.\\tExcess porn. 6.\\tReceiving less foreplay from partner or lack of knowledge regarding foreplay and female masturbation. 7.\\tHaving an affair giving you a guilty feeling. 8.\\tLack of exercise and obesity.

The pain was so severe that I was unable to open mouth and also ulcer over that area was not visible to the doctor (GP). He advised me to take Becosules, Rubifol, and Zocon DT for five days. I started taking those medicines, but I started feeling pain in the full left side teeth and jaw that extends towards the ear. After searching over the net I came to know that it is a swelling of gum and something called gingivitis which may be the cause of my pain. After I have gone to the dentist, she advised me the following medicines: Augmentin 625 mg TDS for five days, Metrogyl 400 mg TDS for five days, Chymoral forte bd for five days, Zerodol P BD for five days, Rantac 150 mg od for five days. I asked the dentist to reduce so much of medicine but she told me that you cannot modulate the antibiotics as it is a course. Plus she told me that your affected teeth i.e beneath the swollen gum needs to be surgically removed once you get back to normal. I started taking these medicines leaving the above medicine advised by GP except Becosules. Now my queries are: After one day, I started vomiting. And minor flecks of blood were also visible in the vomit. Now I want to know whether I am taking the right medicines and the right dosage? Whether any of the above medicines can be removed? Since I had gone to the dentist after full five days of ulcer medicines my jaw was not opening that time, but from the next day I started reliving pain and gradually my jaw also started working and helps in chewing foods. So can I reduce the dosage of the above medicines and leave Zerodol as I think it is a pain killer and I do not have so much pain now? I am scared of hearing surgical removal of my teeth, so whether it is necessary to get it removed? Will I get back to normalcy after medicine? Whether removal is actually required in case of gingivitis? Any other suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello. I am sorry to hear about your problems. The symptoms and line of treatment you have described points to be normal. Though you can take painkillers as per your requirement, I advise you to not to stop the antacid (Rabeprazole and Domperidone in many cases) as they may help you prevent conditions like nausea and vomiting. The blood appearing is alarming, and the source of bleeding should be figured out. Notice if the blood is coming out along with pus of the tooth or not. You may consult or call me in this regard. It would be better if you send me a picture of the tooth and gums in questions to pinpoint the condition.

I have had two implants fitted and currently have to wear a denture until I get the crown and bridge fitted. I have been advised by one dentist to avoid playing rugby again as an impact could break my jaw bone. However, another dentist has said that the implants are meant to be resistant and with a professional gumshield the risk is not much higher than with normal teeth. I would like to get some other opinions on my situation? Whether I should wait for a certain amount of time before playing again? Or if it is reasonable to consider playing immediately with a gumshield? Or if I should be very careful and consider playing altogether?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. The normal healing time of bone is six to eight weeks. However, complete healing may take anywhere between three to six months. In the case of implants, it will take a minimum of three months for it to closely adapt to the surrounding bone and gain stability. This is the most crucial phase in the entire treatment. The amount of stability gained in this healing period determines the success rate and longevity of the implants. Temporary dentures made of acrylic may not create and actively transfer the chewing and other forces to the implant and hence suggested during this healing period. Any disturbances or accidental injuries to that area during this period can lead to failure of implants which is the most advanced option for replacement. In this worst scenario, we will have no other option other than giving a removable denture. I understand your dedication and involvement towards your profession. But please do consider the safety of your implants in which you have invested your time and money. Although you would be wearing a professional gum shield over the implants, any accidental injuries could deliver the impact across your jaw bone thereby delaying or disturbing the healing process. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is 8 years old and got a stroke for the first time that lasted for 25 minutes. After EEG, we came to know that she had a partial seizure.

I am upset severely by that and I am 26 years now, all are asking marriage questions. Believe me my ambition is to get into the politics or to do social service, the relatives laugh if I tell this. And I do not want to get into relationship. I hate marriage and commitments. Because of all this I feel like dying and stressed out so much. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hi. I can see that you are under a lot of stress. To start with the debt, I do not know the financial details and your social economic position so cannot comment on how you can come out of it but to start with you have to understand that this is your reality. Instead of getting upset about it try to sit and practically think of what you can possibly do to start with to help your father in this situation. Getting married does not mean that you cannot help your father or you have to abandon the responsibilities you feel you have regarding your family. As a female I can understand your feelings, it does happen in many cases that after marriage the in-laws expect the female to just look after their family and not have involvement in her own family, but times have changed now. Even I am a female and I do support my family even after marriage as much as I want. The good things to do would be to communicate with your potential partner about how you expect your life to be. Be clear with your partner that after marriage you will be taking care of your own family and not abandon them. The relatives and society are just chatter. Do not get bothered with that. Getting married is not a bad thing, everybody needs someone in their life as a partner. Make sure you find the right partner and you will realise that it is a good thing. Regarding social service, I can see that you are altruist tech and you strive for higher good, it is a very good thing, but remember whenever you will try to do something which is not normal for the people around you, they are going to laugh. It is your choice whether you listen to it and get stressed or you ignore it and do what you want. To work in politics or to do social work you do not need to postpone or ignore marriage. You can start small, do as much as you can in your position and then increase with time. If you are not able to handle the stress I would suggest you to talk to a counselor."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 17-year-old female. I am not getting my periods regularly and they occur once every three months and sometimes even six months. I did not have sex ever still I am not getting my periods. I started getting my periods in my eighth grade, since then they have not been regular. Please do tell me the reason why am I not getting my periods regularly? I consulted with two of the gynecologist. They prescribed me some medicines which were having very bad side effects on me. So I stopped taking them. I still had to know that will I be able to get my periods regularly like every month? And will it affect my future in any manner?","Doctor":"Hi. Do not worry, this is all normal. Now you are in a period of adolescence. Your hormonal levels are not fully mature. By around 20-21 years of age, you will have regular periods. In a normal cycle, you should ovulate around the 14-15th day of periods. Always 14 days after ovulation you will get periods. In the initial few years, the hormones controlling this ovulation are not fully normal or mature, so you do not ovulate. So the bleeding which occurs every three to six months is not real periods. It may be light bleeding or heavy clots with pain or no pain at all. I hope you have got thyroid profile and serum prolactin done (both in empty stomach, early morning sample). These hormones can affect ovulation. Even if not overweight try to reduce any mid-body obesity around waist, thighs, and breast. These fats can convert into hormones and affect ovulation. Do not bother for a scan at this age. To control weight have regular aerobic exercise and brisk walking. Have regular dieting and high protein food. No fasting, no junk foods. Your weight should be height in cm -100 (for example: 156 cm - 100 = 56 kg). Do not worry about future problems. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I and my partner had unprotected sex. She is a virgin. We tried intercourse three times and each time it was not even more than 15 seconds. As she is a virgin she is getting huge pain when I insert into her vagina. Moreover, as it is hurting her, I not even inserted my organ completely into her vagina. I have inserted only half of my penis and not more than that. I have not even rubbed to and fro in her vagina and there is no chance of ejaculating inside her vagina. I do not know exactly whether my precum existed or not, because I thought that it will not cause any pregnancy. But while going through on the internet the next day, I found that precum may also contain a small amount of sperm which also cause pregnancy if they are alive. Moreover, I washed my bud and shaft with soap before intercourse. After reading the article the next day I was so scared that she may become pregnant. So I asked her to take an i-pill in less than 24 hours. She took the pill between 22-23 hours after our intercourse. She does not have a regular cycle of periods. It varies each time and it was a 22 day usually. Now I am afraid that her ovulation took place exactly on the same date of our intercourse. I am also afraid that she may become pregnant. Will the pill work or will she become pregnant if it was exactly her ovulation date even if she took an emergency contraceptive pill? Can she become pregnant even with my precum without ejaculating inside her? Will the pill work for all cases? She is experiencing vaginal dryness from the date of intercourse until today. Is that any symptom for anything or is it just the pills side effect? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I do not think you have to worry about this. Let me explain each one by one. If periods are irregular you can never predict when ovulation is. It is always 14 days before the periods. So even if it is 22-day cycle, ovulation will be on the third or fourth day. Life of egg is only 24 hours, then it dies. Emergency contraceptive is very effective if taken early. Earlier the better. So even if the ovulation has occurred, pills will not allow the pregnancy to settle. Dryness in the vagina could be due to lack of lubrication caused by any infection, anxiety, or due to hormones in the pills. Even if you did not have good foreplay, her vagina will be dry. Being a virgin, she is prone to have abarations, or scratches in the vagina in the first act of sex. It will resolve on its own. Seminal fluid is the clear white fluid before semen ejaculation. It contains a high concentration of sperms. It need not enter the vagina. Even if semen falls on the thighs, it can swim up because of chemical attraction. This fluid is formed only when you have the sexual arousal or touch sensation from the partner. It is always better to have safe sex with a condom, to avoid all these moments of anxiety. If still, you are anxious you have to wait until the date of periods and check urine for pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, For the past seven months, I have been getting these reddish pink non-itchy bumps on my skin.

Usually long-term low dose treatment is required in the form of antihistamines. Example Levocetirizine-Montelukast combination. It consists of Levocetirizine 5 mg and Montelukast 10 mg. This can be taken twice daily in the morning and evening. 2. In severe cases, your doctor may prescribe you a short course of oral corticosteroids. 3. Use a medicated gentle cleansing lotion on your skin for bath like Cetaphil cleansing lotion. 4. Wear cotton clothes. Avoid allergens like pets, dust, etc. 1. If you find any causative factors such as any dietary substance, dust, exertion, etc., try to avoid it. 2. Apply calamine lotion over affected areas.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I have been to a few ophthalmologists about this and they seem to think it is benign. But I want to get some other input on this. If I widen my eyes and move my head around, I can see shadows in my far peripheral vision moving as my head does. And it seems that the shadows change and become different sizes as time goes on. Now I do have astigmatism in my right eye and from time to time I get aching, almost gnawing pains that are with the movement of the eye. And has happened in both at the same time before. I find that it happens mostly when I am in a place with very weird or bright lighting or when I am looking at a bright screen in a weirdly lit room. I suffer from anxiety and depression which is why I guess I am coming out to ask some more questions. And I also have Asperger’s syndrome. The aches radiate to my temple as well. But as I have said I have been to doctors and they have dilated my pupils and looked at my retina and ocular nerves and told me they looked good. So I honestly do not know what could be causing these weird shadows. I have had them for quite a while. And they also get bigger and more noticeable with head tilt like when I exercise or go running or do something very physical. I currently take Prozac 20 mg and Pantoprazole 10 mg.","Doctor":"Hello. What you are describing is most probably breaks in the gel shaped part of the eye and is called floaters. It is a normal and physiological condition that we see in patients that have refractive errors and have no significant consequences. If these symptoms persist and are causing you discomfort look for an ophthalmologist that does a procedure called laser vitreolysis who could break them down into smaller bits so that you do not notice them that much and that is pretty much the only method of treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a metal taste in the mouth, hoarse voice, and scratchy throat. I am not on any medicines or vitamin supplements. I have not changed my diet in any way, and my dental hygiene is very good. I am allergic to Aspirin and have no health issues at all.I also have two inner ear conditions. Both are somewhat rare. In the right, semicircular canal dehiscence and in the left patulous eustachian tube dysfunction. What I want to know is whether I can fly, take an airplane without getting ill and sustain further inner ear damage?","Doctor":"Hello. Though the history you have given is insufficient to come to any conclusion about the possible causes, I will give information about the common conditions which can have such symptoms. The most common cause for scratchy throat with hoarse voice is routine throat infections such as acute pharyngotonsillitis or acute laryngitis which usually resolves with simple antibiotics and mouth gargles. The next common cause which can present similarly is reflux laryngopharyngitis which is a type of acidity related disorder. In this condition, constant reflux of digestive acid into the throat causes injury to taste buds, vocal cords, and throat which leads to symptoms such as change of voice, and change in taste. In general people with reflux, laryngopharyngitis will have symptoms such as burning sensation in chest, repeated burping, chest tightness, dryness of throat, etc. Regarding your inner ear conditions, super semicircular canal dehiscence is a rare inner ear condition. In this condition, there will be giddiness and imbalance when exposed to loud noise and echoing of once own voice, etc. This condition usually does not get worsened by the change in environmental pressure. So air travel would not be an issue in this condition. In any case, keep anti-vertigo medications such as Stemetil handy when you fly. Patulous eustachian tube is a condition involving the middle ear and nose. My guess is because of the similarity in symptoms you have given in both the diagnoses, I can say that if there is vertigo then it is superior canal dehiscence. If there is no vertigo chances of patulous eustachian tube are high. In any case, people with patulous eustachian tube will have a certain degree of pressure symptoms in ear when they fly, but most of the time it would not be very severe. You can use simple saline nasal spray before boarding the flight and every two hours in the air to reduce symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 32-year-old female. I had my second baby via c section. A couple of months after, I started getting pelvic pain. The pain is across my whole pelvic area and lower back and some times in my thighs too, very similar to menstrual cramps. Occasionally, I would get a sharp pain on either side of my pelvic area, especially on the right side. I also get pelvic cramps every time after sexual intercourse and occasional pain when I go to the toilet. The pain is bearable and when it gets a little worse I can manage it by taking pain killers. I get the pain almost every single day as well, not just when I am on my period. My periods have always been very heavy and painful from the beginning but have been able to keep it under control by taking the combined contraceptive pill Gedarel 30/150 mg and Mefenamic acid which I have been taking for many years. I have also been getting headaches and I am always very tired due to the lack of sleep I get from these pains during the night. Half the time I feel very stressed out because of the way I am feeling and it is not easy being a mom of two young children as well and having to manage with the pains, etc. I eventually visited the GP and had some tests done such as smear tests, infection swabs, blood tests and an ultrasound scan. Everything was normal but the transvaginal ultrasound showed I have endometriosis and adenomyosis. I was referred to a specialist gynecologist and although he has given me a course of action to follow for the next six months I felt that the appointment was a bit rushed and I had a lot of questions to ask regarding the two conditions. I would really like to ask a few questions regarding the conditions as soon as possible because my next appointment is not for another six months and there are a few things I would like to know about how these two conditions will affect me in the long run. I just need some answers for peace of mind. Nothing specific to me but more about the disease itself. The doctor has advised to take the combined contraceptive pill for another six months without a break and to take pain killers as and when required. The consultant also mentioned progesterone based methods but we had to rule that out as it causes hair loss and I have been through years of a form of alopecia and have just managed to get my hair back. I have tried asking doctors online and have been conned by them because they have taken money from me and just copied and pasted answers from other places online which made me quite upset and furious. Hopefully, someone from here can give me proper and professional answers. These are the following questions I would like to ask: What causes these two conditions? I am aware that these two conditions cannot be 100% diagnosed via imaging methods and laparoscopy is the only method that provides a definitive diagnosis, so how can a clinician be sure that they are treating me for the right condition and it is not something worse? How will these conditions affect me in the long run if they begin the progress? Which out of the two, endometriosis or adenomyosis is more severe and serious? How will they affect my fertility and what would happen if I wanted to have another baby in the future? Will it be hard to get pregnant? Will it cause problems to either me or the baby? Is there an increased risk of miscarriages and preterm labor and if so how likely is this? What if I were to come off the pill for whatever reason? How can I manage these conditions? Are there any other methods or a form of lifestyle I can follow to help such as certain dietary intakes, etc? How can I prevent getting pain when I go to the toilet (mainly passing stool) and help with sleep? Any other information will be greatly appreciated. Also, are there any online groups or support websites for these conditions?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iclniq.com. I have read your query. Both problems, more or less will have the same effect. In the long run, it might affect you getting pregnant. But if you get pregnant then symptoms of endometriosis subsided. May be for ever. It does not have any effects on pregnancy and baby. No risk of preterm delivery or anything. The permanent solution for this condition is the removal of uterus and ovary. But not recommended if you have plans for further pregnancy. OC (oral contraceptive) pills can help you in disease suppression. Some GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) injection are also available but they have side effects so not recommend for long-term. OC pills can be taken for years. If you miss OC pills for two to three months or so then endometriosis should not return back immediately. So any time if you want to stop it for a few months definitely you can do that. Talking about the sharp pelvic pain, it could be because of fibrosis after cesarean section. You can do some moderate exercise on a daily basis which can help you. There are no specific dietary things which can help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a headache, back and right chest pain, nausea, vision blur, and dizzy.

It is near the gum line but causes no pain. Do I need a dentist checkup?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, you need to visit your dentist as early as possible. Those green lines are basically a form of \\"calcified plaque or calculus\\" in medical term and the reason behind their green color can be chromogenic bacteria. These plaques are needed to be removed at the earliest otherwise they will become much more heavy in bulk and will degrade the underlying bone which is supporting your tooth and in advanced stages it may lead to tooth mobility, gum recession and in severe cases it can even lead to loss of tooth. But, you do not have to worry about that cause your disease is already diagnosed. What you need is oral prophylaxis and dental scaling from your dentist to get rid of those greenish lines. Post prophylaxis polishing is required. I generally prescribe Chlorhexidine 0.2% oral rinse or mouthwash twice daily for seven days. Nothing per mouth for 15 minutes after your rinse using this solution. Never swallow the solution. In case of an allergic reaction to this drug avoid or stop the medication and visit your nearby dentist. However, allergic reactions to this medication are very rare as per my experience. You also need to brush your tooth daily with a soft toothbrush and toothpaste and you must brush your tooth twice a day after breakfast and after dinner to maintain your oral hygiene. Calculus deposit. Clinical examination is required to asses probing depths around the teeth. Greenish to yellowish streak of calculus deposit over upper front teeth and lower teeth also. Oral prophylaxis and Chlorhexidine 0.2% mouth rinse twice daily for seven days initially. Brush twice daily following meals. Follow up required after three weeks after completion of oral prophylaxis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 27 year old female. I am getting acne since the age of 13. I have asthma.

My symptoms are breathlessness on exertion, neck constriction while walking, as well as on and off chest pain in the mornings that are unconnected with exertion. I am also suffering from severe sleep apnea. I had TMT positive 8 METs, 6.3 minutes and ST depression of 2.5 to 3 mm in inferolateral leads. I underwent coronary angiography last week. Fortunately, no significant blocks were found. Doctor said many small blocks are there, which do not restrict the flow of blood. The diagnoses are minor coronary atherosclerotic disease and systemic hypertension. The report says only minor plaques in LDA and LCX. Does this mean angiogram is negative, I mean normal? If so, are my symptoms non-cardiac in nature? Can I ignore further chest pains? Or where should I go to treat them? Am I right in thinking that this report means I am unlikely to have a heart attack at least in near future? What are the chances that these minor plaques may progress and become bigger or serious? How will I know if and when the blocks become bigger; since my stress test was already positive, false positive? Is systemic hypertension the same as high BP? My BP was only 130/80 at the hospital. My home BP machine often gives 150-160/90. How did they diagnose systemic hypertension? Being a wonderful doctor I need your help again today.","Doctor":"Hi. I am really thankful for your kind comments. You have always been so nice and a health conscious person. I want to assure you do not worry as everything is going to be fine soon. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. Thanks for attaching the supporting documents (attachments removed to protect patient identity) for a thorough insight on the issue. You had an unremarkable angiography. It was a very good and a bold decision to go for a timely angiography. I appreciate that you did as advised. Now at least we have got a direction to move on. Now I will reply every part of your query in the order.  The report actually means that we do not need to go for angioplasty or stent placement or CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting - bypass operation) today. But it does not give any guarantee for future. You need to adapt a good lifestyle. Keep the hypertension in control. Take a good healthy diet. Do proper physical activity on a regular basis. You have to keep your lipids and cholesterol in limits too. This is the meaning of all what is written in your angiography report. If not controlled right now and not taken good care of, it may lead to enhanced and widespread coronary artery disease and may lead to blockage of vessels in the years to come.  Yes, ignore the chest pains. They are nothing and will not pose any harm right away. You need to act upon my advice rather to remain healthy forever. There are least chances for a heart attack right now, but I have explained about the future consequences of the issue if not handled with care. These minor plaques may get definitely big problems if not dealt with care. Let me explain a little more about arteriosclerosis so that you may get better insight. Hypertension makes the arteries stiff and they cannot expand in case there is a need for some increased blood flow through them.  No definite answer for future events as it will all depend on medical and personal care. Your blood pressure, lifestyle and diet will all be the main determinants. But if you feel unexplained weakness, tiredness, sleepiness even with a good sleep, restlessness, difficulty on exertion first and with passage of time difficulty in breathing even without exertion; it all means that, you have a bigger issue with the coronary arteries. Your stress test was not 100% false positive. It had some relevance and clinical significance. It is called early stage of coronary arteriosclerosis manifestations.  Systemic hypertension is a word to differentiate it from other hypertension like portal hypertension. And, yes it means the same as you said the high blood pressure. Hypertension is one of the main causes of the coronary artery disease especially when there is no other major contributing factor. Also they have had monitored the blood pressures during the angiography and also during indoor stay in hospital. Mainstay of treatment is lifestyle modification as aforementioned. Keep away from smoking and alcohol.

It only happens when I either open my bowel or while urinating. I put in a tampon to confirm that the bleeding is coming from my vagina and not from rectum. When I am not using the bathroom there is no bleeding and no blood on underwear. But, as soon as I urinate and have a bowel movement I start to bleed. It is not just spotting. It is a heavy bright blood to sometimes dark heavy blood. It reminds me of my heavy days on my periods. I am nowhere close to my periods now. I am taking birth control and have been getting my periods correctly each month. This bleeding is not a consistent flow. It only happens when I use the bathroom. It is like I have blood pool above my vagina and the minute I push a little to pee or have a bowel movement it spills out. I do not have period cramping. But, the pain will be like a dull, achy to sometimes sharp pain, especially when the blood comes out. It radiates all over my pelvis, ovaries, stomach and back sometimes to my kidneys. I did consult a gynaecologist earlier today. He pressed on my stomach in which I had some discomfort. He also did a vaginal exam and said there was a lot of mucus with blood. When pressed inside, I felt little discomfort. He did a swab and sent it out to be checked for infection and prescribed me some antibiotics just in case it was an infection. He also scheduled me an ultrasound for next week and wants me back in two weeks. He told me to come back sooner if it gets worse. He seemed quite concerned.

He is a construction worker and about two years ago he accidentally fell down from the first floor. He reassures me that his left leg limping is not due to the fall. He had about 20 sessions of physical therapy. He went to a pain specialist who injected him with steroid injections, but that did not help. The pain specialist also performed an electro test to see the response reaction in both feet. The right one jumped and the left one did not. He said he barely felt any sensation in his left leg. His left leg is not responsive, and he cannot carry it around. We had an MRI and consulted a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon said that he is not to be operated on. The result of his MRI is as follows. 47 years old with radiculopathy. Correlation is made with prior MRI of the thoracic spine. Findings are, mild spondylotic changes are seen within the cervical spine with disc desiccation multiple levels. C2-C3: There is a shallow central disc herniation impression on the thecal sac. C3-C4: No focal disc herniation or neurocompressive changes are seen. C4-C5: Shallow central disc herniation impresses on the thecal sac. C5-C6: There is central disc herniation with effacement of the ventral CSF. C6-C7: Shallow central disc herniation impresses on the thecal sac. C7-T1: No focal disc herniation or neurocompressive changes are seen. Vertebrae: The vertebral bodies demonstrate normal height and marrow signal characteristics. Spinal cord: There are multiple foci of abnormal T2 signal within the substance of the spinal cord, one at the C2 level and one at C4. It is unclear whether this reflects myelomalacia versus the possibility of a demyelinating process. Clinical correlation as well as evaluation of the intracranial compartment with MRI of the brain is recommended. Craniovertebral junction: The craniovertebral junction is unremarkable. Mild prominence of the nasopharyngeal soft tissues is incidentally noted. Please correlate with direct clinical examination. Impression is multiple foci of abnormal T2 signal within the substance of the spinal cord as described. These may be on the basis of myelomalacia however given the patient's age the possibility of a demyelinating process is not excluded. Clinical correlation as well as evaluation of the brain with MRI scanning is recommended. Mild spondylotic changes within the cervical spine with shallow central disc herniations at C2/C3, C3/C4, C4/C5 and C6/C7 levels. Slightly larger central disc herniation C5/C6 with effacement of the ventral CSF. Mild prominence of the nasopharyngeal soft tissue.

Any of these findings are suggestive of only some infection in the cervix creating some changes in the lining of the cervical canal. This only warrants follow up and repeated PAP smear evaluation. These infections on the cervix can cause small ulcerations, which would appear like a raw wound. Once the raw surface if formed, the secretions from the underlying cervix increases. Just like in common cold secretion from the nostrils increase, cervical secretions also increase. The sudden appearance of excessive brown discharge can follow any local insult like recent sex, or recent periods or local trauma by a tampon or even urinary infection. But it is not to be worried about. If it is been a year since last PAP smear or at least six months have a repeated smear. You may need local antibiotic treatment. If the cervical erosion is significant and the abnormality you are experiencing in PAP is more than what I mentioned, then you may need excision of the ulcer with cryotherapy or electrotherapy or chemical. But at this young age of 29 years and as the doctor has put you follow up for four years, I bet you belong to low-risk stage. Nothing to worry about. Just simple treatment of local medication will do."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My father had a surgery for cancer and subsequent chemoradiation on cheeks.

This is because; previously when Asperger was introduced in 1994, it was distinguished from autistic disorders as there was no delay in language and general cognition. But now it is put under autism spectrum disorders because there is no evidence of different response to treatment or of a distinct cause in Asperger syndrome versus high functioning autism.

With the details you gave I understand that you are an 18-year-old girl who is slim and unable to increase weight. Also, I see that your Body Mass Index is 15.43. Where as the weight that is desirable to you would be about 50 to 53 kg (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are in your puberty and hence there will be growth spurt because of which the body energy would be used fast to put height and other bodily developments. Also, this is the time your body sexually matures. These might be the reasons why you are unable to put weight. However, I give you the following suggestions to help increase weight and bring it in normal range: 1. Eat plenty of proteins : soyabeans, fish, chicken. 2. Take ghee in appropriate amounts: You may use ghee as a cooking medium if you are not susceptible to pimples and acne, ghee has great deal of energy in it and helps put weight. 3. Eat adequate green leafy vegetables and minerals: take spinach, gooseberry, fenugreek leaves, palak leaves. 4. Drink 3 to 4 litres of water daily. 5. Drink 500 mL of milk daily: make sure the milk is not condensed (skimmed). Skimmed milk is devoid of the fat. You require the fat. 6. Increase the amount of food you eat, if you are eating 3 meals make it 4 spread out through the day. 7. Keep your body in shape by exercising so that weight gain is healthy and not in appropriate places. 8. Practice yoga and a daily workout regime concentrating more on weight gain exercises than cardio. Cardio exercises help lose weight than gain. 9. If still not satisfied, take protein powders, soy or milk protein powders with good energy content. Search for protein powders for ladies for putting weight. Next, do not worry unnecessarily about your weight. This age one grows tremendously and so it might be difficult to put weight. However, within a few years your growth spurt will stop and you body metabolism will stabilize. Take the above measures and follow my advice. It is important to keep oneself healthy and appreciate ones own body."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can I put Lidocaine viscous 2 % oral topical solution qualitest in ear for pain?","Doctor":"Hello. Please do not put Lidocaine 2 % viscous into ear for pain. First of all, ear pain can be due to multiple reasons. The causes of ear pain are as follows: 1. Localized causes: External ear: pinna, ear canal, Middle ear cleft: eustachian tube, facial nerve, mastoid cavity, inner ear: eighth nerve, petrositis. 2. Referred causes: Throat : tonsillitis, pharyngitis, Neck : cervical spine disorders, spondylosis, Oral cavity : glossitis, tootache, tooth infection, Larynx : laryngitis, epiglottitis. Under each infections, inflammations, tumors, malignancies, non-malignant growths, hypersensitivities, etc can result in ear ache. Referred earache is due to sharing of same nerve supply by the ear as well as the above said organs. Hence, please do not treat earache on your own. I will strongly suggest you consult an ENT specialist doctor and follow his advise. Please provide us with details with regards to the following : Onset of ear ache, duration, nature of pain : pricking, dull aching, throbbing, any associated giddiness, ear discharge, headache, nausea, any throat pain, nose block, change of voice, difficulty in swallowing, any previous relevant history with regards to the ear or nose and throat, which ear? both ears? You have fever? Any neck problems, tooth ache, artificial dentures. Next, Lidocaine 2 % viscous is for use on oro-mucosal surfaces. It is not for use inside the ear, it will not get absorbed from intact skin surfaces like what you find in the outer ear where you are planning to apply the viscous top solution. To relieve pain I suggest you try Paracetamol 650 mg tablet, one tab SOS (not more than 3 tablets per day). However, it is prudent to ascertain the exact cause for the earache and treat accordingly. Do contact us for any more queries on the subject."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My symptoms include a chest cold for approximately one month, 12 pound weight loss, nausea, dry heaves. Excessive bowel movements. Shortness of breath. Muscle aches. Left side rib pain. Fatigue. I had normal labs except mildly elevated alkaline phosphate. My doctor is now running a ALP isoenzyme test. Do I have multiple myeloma? Am I too young? What are my chances? What else besides my liver could make that test elevated?","Doctor":"Hi. After reviewing your complaints and your blood investigation (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can draw the following conclusions: 1. It is highly unlikely that you have multiple myeloma, as your globulins (in blood report) are normal. Though it is a rare scenario before 40 years, it can happen to people. Your case seems something else. 2. There is however abnormally low carbon dioxide level in your report. This occurs because of hyperventilation, anxiety, some lung pathology. 3 . More importantly your medication are the most likely reason for your anxiety. Sometimes these can cause diarrhea as well. 4. Raised ALP can be from many causes. Liver (uncommon if you do not have jaundice), bone, intestine and placenta being most common. Isoenzyme assay that your doctor is doing will help isolate the source to some extent. 5. Given your age and your month old respiratory problem I would suspect a lung infection including Tuberculosis (TB). TB can also cause the left sided chest, fatigue and weight loss. Pain itself can lead to hyperventilation. 6. Moreover your your ALP is only mildly raised which is against the diagnosis of multiple myeloma (where it can be in thousands). Mildly raised ALP can be due to vitamin D deficiency as well, given you live in Montana (low sunlight). Please discuss with your doctor regarding need for a chest X-ray and possibility of TB and Vitamin D supplementation. Do not worry. The reason you might feel anxious is most probably your medications. Take a healthy balanced diet. Try some meditation as well."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

From your description, you could be suffering from a pilonidal sinus or cyst. Color of pus, yellow or white is not of great concern. What can be concerning is a large amount of pus.

Your complaint of left-sided pain in the abdomen and its running to the back can be suggestive of one of the following: 1) Gastritis is the swelling or inflammation of the stomach. The acid problems may be due to your obesity as your weight and BMI are high 32.89. It may be due to high spicy food, alcohol, smoking especially in the empty stomach.

It can be accompanied by vomiting. 3) The type of arthritis that you have described can also be associated with some other organ problems but it is less likely.

Blood investigations hemoglobin, hematocrit (HCT), total leukocyte count (TLC), platelet count test (Plt), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), serum sodium, potassium, creatinine, urea, AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), ALP (alkaline phosphatase), bilirubin, albumin, amylase. 3. You may require an endoscopy later. Get back with these questions and investigations or follow up with your doctor. In case of severe pain go to a good hospital rather than to stay home and take painkillers."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had intercourse (he did not ejaculate) and took an i-pill the next day. I am suffering from PCOD and by doctor's prescription, I took Meprate for seven days twice daily. But still no sign of periods. What can be the causes? Also, after taking the i-pill there is no withdrawal bleeding. My last period was before two months and it is causing stress and I am overthinking. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Do not worry, you have nothing to worry about.  As you have PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease) your ovulation will not be on time. As you mentioned that he did not ejaculate and you took i-pill within 24 hours, chances of pregnancy are very low. Meprate is a hormone pill that increases the inner lining of the uterus and when you suddenly stop, it cause withdrawal bleeding. Usually, you can wait up to 10 days after stopping. Because you had I-pill and Meprate your period would have got postponed. So I would advise you to wait for periods till 10 days after the last day of Meprate. If still no periods, just for confirmation get urine pregnancy tested. I bet it will be negative. Then take any of the oral contraceptive pills like Novelone, or Ovrel G, or Dear 21 or Diane 35 or Intimacy plus 3 twice a day for 10 days, throw that extra last tab. You will surely get periods within the next 10 days. If you get periods in between just stop the pills. In PCOD the inner lining of the uterus may not be thick enough, so your periods will be light sometimes with pink discharge only, so no withdrawal bleeding with Meprate. These pills will increase the thickness. Next time onwards never have unprotected sex, to avoid these anxious moments. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I see a lump at the opening of the anus. It is been there for over a week. It is not much painful but it is uncomfortable while sitting. I am a 25-year-old male. It never happened before and no current medications.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have seen the picture you have uploaded. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  It appears to be thrombosed piles. It takes a few days for it to settle down well, but it is not anything sinister. A few things would help to give relief. Take Sitz bath (a large basin to be filled with warm water and a couple of spoons of common salt to be added and sit in it for 10 minutes) twice a day. Take analgesics Ibuprofen or Paracetamol twice a day for five days, laxatives Fybogel for three days, and Laxido before bedtime for a week. These would sort out the pain and discomfort. You have higher chances of developing hemorrhoids (piles) in the long term. Do exercise regularly,eat high fiber diet (no restrictions in having nonvegetarian) and reduce straining while opening bowels."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 23 year old male.

They have gotten progressively worse, until the point where it is severely affecting my quality of life to where it is hard to function in a normal lifestyle. I have this really irritated, inflamed, and damaged area of tissue on the right side of my throat. The area is white, and it is covering the bottom half of my vocal cords. I taste blood and pus. I have an earache in one ear, the same side that the throat irritation is on. I feel weak, faint, and dizzy. My nostrils are blocked. I do not have a runny nose. I do not have a regular stopped up nose either when I blow my nose nothing comes out. It just feels like the back of my nostrils are blocked. I have a lot of trouble breathing, which causes my heart to beat very fast. I breathe through my mouth, but it is not the same. I have no heart condition, and my pulse never raced before this started happening. My blood pressure is fine. I have tried nose sprays to open up my nose, sinus congestion medications, allergy medications. I do not have any allergies. When the symptoms first started they were not bad, but only got progressively worse. I went to my primary care physician. I was put on antibiotics. While I was on the antibiotics and for about a week after my symptoms disappeared, but then they came back. I went back to my primary care physician. He said that since the antibiotics helped the first time maybe another weeks worth would make the symptoms go away permanently. The same thing happened. While I was on antibiotics and about a week after my symptoms disappeared, but only to reappear again. I went back to my primary care physician. He said that he could not put me on any more antibiotics. He did a blood test to see if I have an infection, the blood test came back negative for infection. He sent me to an ear nose and throat doctor. The ear nose and throat doctor did a fiberoptic laryngoscope. He found the severely irritated spot in my throat. He said it was probably acid reflux. He sent me to a gastroenterologist. The gastroenterologist performed an upper endoscopy. He did not see any signs of acid reflux, except for the severely irritated spot in my throat. I do not have any of the symptoms of acid reflux, even before I started taking Protonix. He put me on Protonix. I have been on Protonix for two months now. The symptoms have only gotten worse. All of the symptoms are hard to deal with, but I could learn to live with most of them if I had to. The main symptom that concerns me is that not being able to breathe good, and my pulse racing as a result of that. I have a lot of questions, but my biggest question is what I can do about my nor being able to breathe well and my pulse racing? I have a picture I can send you of my throat when the fiberoptic laryngoscope was done. I can send you if you think it would help?","Doctor":"Hi. I went through your symptoms and pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Your fiber optic picture indeed shows some amount of changes of laryngopharyngeal reflux. So even though you do not have acidity and reflux you still have some laryngeal reflux for which you will have to take a proton pump inhibitor tablet Pantoprazole 20 mg twice a day for one month. The white area in your throat needs to be investigated by a throat swab for culture and sensitivity to know if it is actually a bacterial infection. Regarding nose block, have the ENT surgeon done a nasal endoscopy in your nose. If yes, what did he say? If not done I will suggest go for a CT (computed tomography) scan PNS (paranasal sinus), axial and coronal view to be done to rule out sinusitis, as if sinusitis is too much even then you have these symptoms. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 25 years old. I have a 7-year-old and a 2-year-old kid. After my son's birth, I have gained quite a bit of weight just a little over the obese range. I say this because I do not know if it has anything to do with my problem. I am writing because I am having trouble finding online information about my lower back pain (behind the backbone). It does not hurt all the time. Mainly there is constant pain while walking, laying flat, or when leaning forward without support. Also, there is a real sharp pinch when my kids or spouse push on it either side. I am not sure if this matters, but once in a while when I stand from the couch there is a pinching pain in my lower front abdomen that goes away after a minute or two. Is there any idea you may have as to what is going on? I have been dealing with my back for a year now and my spouse is starting to tell me to get it checked out. I used to take only Ibubrufen when I get headaches.","Doctor":"Hi. I am sorry to hear about your pain, but I will try my best to help you. From history, the lower back pain may be related to mechanical or disc protrusion (PIVD) or some rare conditions like a kidney stone, or pelvic inflammatory disease. Mechanical and PIVD (prolapsed, herniated, or extruded intervertebral disc) can be differentiated by a dragging pain to one of your legs. In PIVD dragging pain is common. You may need an x-ray of your lower back. This pain is not related to an epidural, but as there is a pinching pain in front of the abdomen other causes should be ruled which is addressed with an ultrasound. As per your age, PIVD is a common symptom that is addressed initially with conservative management. The diagnosis is confirmed with an MRI. If it is PIVD need not take bed rest, you can do your daily activities. If pain reduces completely then start physiotherapy (back strengthening exercises)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have some scars on my legs from when I was a younger kid. So when I was younger I fell and bruised and got scars. Sometimes, I would scratch my scars and over time the scars become dark and they look ugly. And since then I do not wear shorts or clothes that show my legs. Is there anything I could try to fade the scars or lighten them?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. First of all, your scratching induced issues over the skin are not scars, rather they are marks that too over a background of another mild skin condition that you seem to have. Scars are aberrations in the skin texture, irrespective of the color change. What you have is: Background of a mild skin condition called macular amyloidosis (MA), you may see light brown colored speckled pigmentation in coalescing patches over your leg shins. These arise spontaneously, mostly without any cause, although friction contributes to it in terms of making it worsen and darker. So, do not scratch any further. Few marks, these are the smaller spot-like darker brown colored discrete and are a few in number, a result of the healing of the skin over your pointed scratched areas. Now MA does not have a permanent treatment and also often does not need it. It may also affect the upper back and upper arms, just have a look. Sometimes, it tends to run in families. Moisturization with Cetaphil dam lotion after bath and before sleeping tends to reduce the associated dryness, itching as well as roughness of those areas. But many times, especially in girls and women, MA is associated with thyroid dysfunction. So, please get your serum TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) blood test done. For the brown marks that are bothering you, you will require a depigmenting cream to be applied in the night just over the spots and a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 50+ (sun protection factor) in the day time on the entire legs daily. I believe Cetaphil UVA/UVB sunscreen or Anthelios-XL (SPF-60) or Avene sunscreens may be available to you over the counter. Use them daily over the entire legs and first coat to be applied at least half an hour before going out. Now, I would not be able to tell you which depigmenting (skin lightening creams) are available in your place. But, you can check with your local pharmacist. You could select from a range of combination creams that often contain varying proportions of Hydroquinone, Kojic acid, Glycolic acid, Arbutin, Azelaic acid, mild steroid, Tretinoin, Vitamin C or E, etc. Although it would be ideal that you get a prescription cream from your dermatologist, till then you may (for the short time 15-30 days only) use one of these creams, to be used as spot therapy only over the dark spots, in minuscule quantities, that too strictly at night and discontinue using it if it causes excessive redness, peeling, irritation, etc. Additionally, take some good oral anti-oxidant capsule daily for two to three months. For best management, please revert back with the answers to my following queries: Do you have similar pigmentation over the back? Please send pictures in your response. Does your mother or other family members have a similar problem? Get your serum TSH levels checked and let us know the value. Contact the pharmacist and try to procure and use the sunscreen and night cream. In your response, please tell us the brand that you procured and the contents of the skin whitening cream so that we could further advise you about its use and safety. I hope this helps. Serum TSH levels. Blood test to be given in a fasting state."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, One week ago, I had intercourse on my third day of the period and after approximately 30 hours of that, I have taken an i-pill.

I suffer from bruxism and have a custom dental night guard. But for the last month, I am feeling pain as if I am grinding at night. The dental guard split in half but it still fits perfectly. The infrequent systems started before this split. What could be happening? I try to be conscious not to clench or grind during the day, but two weeks ago the dull pain in my molars required me to take Advil. What could be happening? I hope it is not wearing my teeth further. I am more concerned with this than the pain.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. This could be a temporomandibular joint (TMJ) issue. Temporo Mandibular joint is the jaw joint between the upper jaw and the lower jaw and involves multiple and complex structures like a disc between two jaws, chewing muscles, and the joining bone structure. A complete TMJ and dental evaluation should be done to determine what is causing your jaw pain and bruxism. Bruxism is not a condition, but one of the main symptoms of a TMJ disorder. It could be because of:  1. Tensed chewing muscles  2. Disparity in the disc  3. Changes in jaw bone structure.  Other than TMJ issues it could be due to:  4. Psychological stress 5. Misaligned teeth 6. Multiple dental treatments 7. Recent dental injury or infection. Visit a TMJ specialist to identify the cause. Initially, a splint similar to your night guard (called deprogrammer appliance) will be suggested as a diagnostic appliance to identify the cause. Once the cause is determined, the treatment depends on it. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have extreme fear of leukemia after hearing about it through my friend.

I was sure that I had leukemia, however, I waited for two and a half months and repeated the CBC. It is 10400. Why is my WBC not getting low? The only symptom I have is my gingivitis. I do not understand what is wrong with me? I also read that cancer causes gingivitis. I am attaching my two CBC reports. Please help to get rid of this tension.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Can you tell a few things like do you have any fever or night sweats? Any bleeding from anywhere else? Yes, leukemias cause gum bleeds, but it is not the most common cause. Usually, the cause of gum bleeds is gingivitis, or poor dental hygiene, or vigorous brushing. As the reports are generated by an automatic counter, there is a chance of variation in CBC (complete blood count). If it is not abnormal there is no need to worry. I would advise you to repeat CBC along with peripheral smear. If it is normal no need worry. Usually, in leukemias, you will have low platelets and very high WBC count. As per the above reports, it is not suggesting any serious problem. I would be happy to help if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For the past week I have been experiencing a “scratchy” feeling on just the left side of my throat right below my Adam’s Apple region.

Can you send me a picture of your throat (clear one). I want to see if your posterior pharyngeal wall or tonsils are infected. Are you a diabetic? What problem do you have in your nose? Is it like a nose block? Shortness of breath can be due to nose block as well. Do you have any posterior nasal drip? Any hoarseness of voice or cough while eating or drinking?

Also, I have an imaginary friend whom I talk to many times during the day and share my problems with him. I do not feel fine. I experience extreme mood changes from happy to sad.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. What are your symptoms exactly? If they are of depression, then the treatment with an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) is ideally given for six months or so. Basically, if you are depressed, you will feel irritable, low, feel like crying, sad, do not wish to eat, have difficulty sleep, there can be anxiety, tiredness, headaches, etc. In bipolar illness, there will be a period of these depressive symptoms and then after a period of normalcy, the reverse happens. That is, you feel unusually happy for no reason, there are episodes of spending money excessively on things which you do not need, or maybe excessive use of alcohol, other illicit drugs, sex, irritable behavior, decreased need for sleep and still feeling fresh, grandiose talks and ideas, many non-goal directed activities, etc. So if you have not had the manic/hypomanic phase, then you probably suffered from major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. You will need to consult with a psychiatrist and take medicines for the same. It will surely help with your symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 64-year-old female, operated cancer breast and cancer rectum. I completed the treatment for breast cancer.

CT (computed tomography) shows retroperitoneal lymph nodes and multiple hypodense lesions. Chances for breast cancer recurring after 10 years are usually unlikely. What can you tell about your baseline stage of cancer breast and cancer rectum? As serum CEA levels are normal, there is discordant radiology and serological picture. I would like to view CT films and if previous CT films are available. The CT is definitely abnormal. Liver lesions can be simple cysts too. If that is the case I would not give much importance to retroperitoneal nodes and just advise you to be in close follow up. May be repeat CEA and CT after three months. There are no definite guidelines for this type of situation. And the plan of action depends on experience and clinical judgment regards how likely is the recurrence. If symptomatic I would advise you to follow up. Most likely the picture looks like recurrence of cancer rectum.

His list of medications does not seem to make sense and although he loves his cardiologist. I do not think he is paying enough attention. I am in the medical field and although I am not a pharmacist or an M.D. I know a little bit about adverse drug reactions. Tell me if this makes sense to you. Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg half pill twice a day, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq once daily, Losartan potassium 25 mg once daily, Warfarin sodium 5 mg once daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg, Digozin 25 mcg once daily and Furosemide 40 mg once daily. I need to know if these medications are fine to take all in one day and if so, I would like to split them into two times a day according to the reactions. I feel that so many medications doing the same thing is redundant and unnecessary and causing problems. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Let us evaluate all medications your father is receiving. Diagnosis: Valvotomy, CAD with MI (coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction) and CVA (cerebrovascular accident) (recovered). Tablet Metoprolol is essential in patients with heart attacks as it slows the heart and keeps it healthy. So we cannot omit that. The dose is already very low and so we cannot reduce it further. Tablet Losartan, again essential in people with heart attacks. It is a disease-modifying drug. The dose is already less and cannot be reduced. But yes, the timing can be changed to alternate with Metoprolol (one in the morning and one in the evening). The danger is giving Potassium tablet Losartan and Digoxin and can cause increased potassium levels and giving more potassium is highly dangerous. The doctor might have given for some time but it has to be stopped now. Warfarin is given for stroke prevention. 5 mg is a minimal dose. It cannot be removed as stroke prevention is essential. Timing can be made flexible. Atorvastatin is for heart attack prevention. Ideally can be taken at bedtime. Frusemide is a diuretic. There is no specific reason to give this in your case. The only issue I can think of is because of the valve surgeries they want to keep blood volume low. This can be discussed and removed. Ideally can be given in the morning.

But I have no discharges for the last three years. As a routine checkup, I am asked for a CT scan and the findings are as follows: 1) Right -sided mastoid air cells are partially sclerosed with reduction pneumatization, however, no collection is seen at present in mastoid air cell or middle ear cavity. 2) Right maxillary small retention cyst. 3) Mild DNS with nasal septal spur. I have no problem in the ear except a tension (pull) in nerves (veins) around the right ear while moving my head to and fro. I am currently taking antibiotics and Montelukast. My lab report shows WBC 9600 / cu mm, Neutrophils 74%, lymphocytes 18%, monocytes 01%, eosinophils 07%, basophils 00%, ESR first hour 06 mm.","Doctor":"Hi. You have right-sided chronic otitis media which is a common type of chronic middle ear infection. It is common to have recurrent ear discharge in this condition because of the perforated eardrum. Since your ear is dry for three years you need not worry much.  As far as CT (computed tomography) findings are concerned,  1. Sclerosis of the mastoid is common in patients with perforation of eardrum with earlier infections. It is absolutely normal in you to have these findings, there is nothing to worry about.  2. Maxillary retention cyst is a common incidental finding in routine CT scan and not a problem to worry about if you do not have nose related problems.  3. DNS with spur if asymptomatic (like nose block) is also a common incidental finding and can be present in many normal individuals. So your CT scan report can be considered normal for all practical purposes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My pubic area is white, flaky and dry. I was prescribed a lotion last month for folliculitis bumps and it went away. Now this problem persists. I got tested for STD two months ago, everything was fine.","Doctor":"Hi. It is not clear about your age, the exact morphology, duration, symptoms, treatment taken, etc. Can you please send the photos and details so that we can get the real picture of the rash? It is good that you have been tested negative for STDs (sexually transmitted diseases). It is not clear what lotion was prescribed? I consider it may be for scabies or Calamine lotion. Both can cause dryness and flaky. Use gentle soaps or cleansers like Cetaphil to wash the area. If the area is already shaven you can apply moisturizer cream or lotion. Stop applying the lotion given which might be causing you this or maybe due to other conditions. It is unlikely to be any STD, so you can relax and be free of any anxiety. Take antihistamine tablets like Cetirizine if any itching or allergy. Please get back to me with details and photos for a more correct assessment of the situation and management."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A 56-year-old patient went to his physician for evaluation of recurrent episodes of lightheadedness, chest pain, and shortness of breath with exertion.

The blood in stools can be due to chronic constipation. As it does not pain while you pass stool it confirms constipation. To prevent constipation you should drink more water, considering summer season 3 to 4 liters should be good. Include fiber rich food like oats, corn flakes, and fruits like banana, apple, and watermelon. Try having some of these food for dinner.

And would you consider it risky to shift her to a bigger city? That will involve 2.5 hours of road travel (after which we can wait ) followed by a 1.5 hour long flight?","Doctor":"Hello. I am sorry to hear about your mother's poor health condition.  1. There is a very good chance that angioplasty can help with the 100 % blockage alongside a stent. She is still young. If she can adhere to lifestyle modifications and medications it will help.  2. Rotablator or IVUS can definitely help with clearing the clogged arteries. Although they also will require stenting because the site of the clogged arteries have become weak and will require stenting as support.  3. In situations like this I advise angiography for my patient. The recovery period is shorter and patients are able to live a quality life with modification of lifestyle and medication. It is not safe for her to undergo the stress of traveling at this time."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 17 years old. I was born with polycystic kidney disease. When I was 14, I was diagnosed as I was having severe chest pain and dizzy spells. I am currently four months postpartum. Since my son was born I have not been able to use the bathroom as frequently as most. It never caused me pain or anything up until about a week ago. For the past one week, I pee once a day. I feel the urge to pee all the time, but I cannot. No matter how hard I try. The pain is entirely unbearable at this point. I drink plenty of water a day. I have even tried cranberry juice, but nothing has helped. I have put off going to the hospital for the fear of being admitted, but I cannot any longer. I want a professional's opinion, do you think I need to suck it up and go to the ER? Or is there anything I am not doing that you think might help? Please guide.","Doctor":"Hello. Since you are a patient of polycystic kidney disease, you will be more prone for urinary tract infections, urinary stones or cysts, which could burst and form clots, which can result in obstruction. One cannot be sure unless you get a sonography done. Since you say you get urges for urinating and you cannot pass, I think you should go to emergency room (ER) and get yourself checked. I would advise you to get a complete blood count, serum creatinine, urine routine and sonography. Try to keep a chart of the amount of urine you pass and fluids you drink daily and a daily weight chart. Let me know the laboratory reports. For pain, use safe painkillers like Paracetamol and Tramadol.

Should I go for extraction? Or is there any way to save my tooth?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and I have studied your x-ray. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The tooth is divided into the crown part and the root part. The tooth structure till the bone level from top is called the crown and beyond that is root. More than one half of the crown part is decayed and the decay had started penetrating the root part too. If you notice the x-ray, you could see the infection penetrated the root and weakened the adjacent bone too (the gap between the root and bone on the left side of x-ray). The infection has engulfed one of the roots completely. The ideal treatment for this tooth is removal i.e. extraction. If the same scenario occurred in a tooth other than the wisdom tooth i.e. the third molar, I would have definitely advised you to save the tooth. The reasons for advising extraction: The wisdom tooth is highly unstable and there are more chances of secondary infection even after a good root canal treatment. It carries out less than 5% of chewing. Extracting it will not make much difference to your chewing efficiency. Oral hygiene maintanance in the wisdom tooth area is highly challenging which caused your decay in the first place (our brush does not reach that far). Any treatment like fillings and root canal treatment in wisdom tooth may lead to jaw issues in the future because of its unstable nature. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, 1. What causes acne scarring? 2. What ingredients should people be looking for to diminish them (In the products they use)? 3. Is scarring more difficult to get rid of on darker skin tones? If so, please explain why. 4. Is it possible to achieve complete removal of this without getting something like a chemical peel? 5. How effective are peels and other cosmetic procedures for this issue? Which procedures would you say are the most effective? 6. For people who do not want to undergo a cosmetic procedure, what are some things they can do on their own to help? Sunscreen? 7. Is there any way to prevent scarring from occurring? If so, please explain.","Doctor":"Hello. 1. During severe active acne, inflammatory process leads to scarring if it is not properly treated or treated late during course of acne. So treatment of acne is very important both early and according to recommendations. Because inflammation leads to destruction of collagen fires in skin, resulting in scar formation. 2. People should use products that contain collagen, hyaluronic acid, elastin (the natural ingredients present in our skin and maintain its contour and give it even surface). 3. Scarring can be more difficult to treat in darker skin type because of heavy melanin pigmentation present naturally in their skin which also take part in inflammatory process occurring during acne. 4. Once scarring occur, it is not possible that it get improved on its own or without any treatment. Different options available for scars are topical gels and chemical peeling. Apart from that Co2 fractional laser is also available to get rid of it. 5. Chemical peeling is a method by which skin is stimulated to produce more collagen and making the skin scar free and improving its texture. The more effective treatment is fractional laser that helps in stimulating fibroblasts, increasing collagen production and improving acne scars. 6. People can use topical gels containing collagen if they do not want to undergo procedures. Sunscreen do not have much role to play. 7. For prevention of scarring, early and proper treatment of acne is needed. Oral Retinoids are recommended to prevent scarring."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 24 years old, student.

We admitted him to the hospital and according to the doctor he had a mild heart attack. We want a second opinion about his health condition and further treatment. I will attach the reports.","Doctor":"Hello.  Heart attack in your grandfather's case is diagnosed on the basis of CKMB, and Qualitative Troponin T tests (attachment removed to protect patient identity). CKMB is not specific test to diagnose heart attack and it may come positive in many other conditions. Same is the case with \\"qualitative\\" troponin t test. Yes, but if there is no kidney problem, no severe infection in body and patient has chest discomfort, then we can say its heart attack. ECG may help in making diagnosis as well. Echocardiography is overall normal. To diagnose heart attack best tests are ECG and \\"Quantitative\\" Troponin I test. If your grandfather still has chest pain, I would advise go directly for angiography and then angioplasty if indicated on angiography. If your father has no chest pain, then go for a test called Stress Echocardiography or Myocardial Perfusion Imaging. And if positive for changes consistent with heart attack then angioplasty. Please note, in some cases angioplasty is preferred and in some cases bypass is preferred, that is decided on many factors including angiography report, patient's overall condition, and patients wish. In some cases of very frail old peoples, only medical treatment is preferred and no angioplasty or bypass is attempted. This also depends upon overall condition of the patient and angiography report. In any case whether angioplasty, bypass, or only medical treatment, medicines are continued throughout life keeping in view contraindications and side-effects of medicines. Please tell about overall health of your grandfather, any other diseases he is suffering from such as kidney diseases, lung problems, walking issues, etc. Also, show me his ECG and other reports if already done.

And the next day most symptoms eased or gone except gastritis and diarrhea and since yesterday all symptoms are gone.

Keep the environment clean. These measures will prevent germs from your environment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 42 years old, single parent with two kids aged 15 and 10. The last 19 years, I have had several stress related (in my view) ailments. History: Erratic bowel syndrome 19 years back, corrected now. Polycystic ovaries, corrected now (was on Metformin for one year.). Severe migraines twice a week that lasted 2-3 days. Corrected now. Hyperthyroidism which got over-corrected to hypothyroidism and therefore medication was stopped (was on Eltroxin 0.25 mcg). I was diagnosed with BP issues and chest pain 7 years back. I was on Lonzaep for anxiety and Prothiaden 50 mg a day. ATEN 25 mg for BP. Had a D&C for continuous periods- Biopsy was clear. ATEN was stopped and Nebistar 5 mg once a day was initiated by my cardiologist along with 20 mg Telmisartan. I was also diagnosed with arterial stiffness (Persiscope Cardiovascular Analysis report enclosed). I experienced alopecia and lost almost all my hair. I got it back after treatment. The Cardiologist increased Telma to twice daily (20 mg) along with Nebistar 5 mg, recently. My concerns and questions: 1) The BP continues to fluctuate going as high as 170/110 and then dropping very suddenly to very low. BP rises typically in the evenings, while it is very low at night (I understand that this is the case naturally). While I understand the concept of BP fluctuating all day, and looking at the average, I am worried that when it is very low, I am probably aggravating the situation by taking a medicine to low it further. ABP reports taken all these years are enclosed. 2) When the BP is high (mostly) I have chest discomfort and pain in the chest for 3-4 days and then subsides on its own. I am concerned that my arteries are inflamed. Please see reports on High Sensitivity C Reactive protein. 3) When I had continuous migraine and chest pain I went in for a coronary angio and a brain MRI- reports enclosed (Acute ischemic foci- Is there a correlation)? 4) My cardiologist was concerned about my echo tests and the BP shooting up very quickly during the stress test. Can you explain what the test implies and the connection between the inflammation and these tests results? 5) My stress levels overall are definitely better, I am consulting a Psychotherapist for the last 3 years, practising yoga, however the BP seems to have shot up again the last few weeks. Is it because of the extreme winters? I am undergoing a stressful situation at the moment. 6) On the whole, I would like to know: If I am at risk of a stroke? If yes, what is the probability? Is there inflammation? If so how bad is it? How can I control/reverse it? Why does the chest pain persist? The pain is usually followed along with high BP when I particularly have a heavy session in Psychotherapy or overthink some issues. -What do I do when the BP reaches dangerous levels like 170/110? Are there any drugs that I should avoid? What are the safe supplements that I can have for magnesium? I am taking Omega 3 supplements. Are there any follow on tests and medications that you recommend? I got a full health check done four months back and kidney tumors, etc., have been ruled out. Happy to share additional reports in case needed.","Doctor":"Hello. I would largely comment from cardiac point of view. So overall, other than BP, your cardiac status is normal. Your heart function is normal and no RWMA, your blood vessels were clean on CT coronary angiography (attachment removed to protect patient identity). So, I do not think there is anything to worry from cardiac perspective. Regarding chest pain, if BP is elevated then it can cause some strain over the heart and cause chest pain. But it would be limited to time during which BP is elevated. Now considering that you did not have any chest pain during stress test and BP was elevated during stress test, pain is probably unrelated to BP or heart. If you are having any ventricular ectopics or extra beats then it can cause some dull ache in chest. Now other aspect is BP. You have tendency for BP elevation due to your genetic make up which is part of PCOS, etc. How much do you weigh? Also, your psychological issues tend to worsen BP. BP may rise during exercising and considering your high BP tendency, it may excessively rise during exercising. Other factors which can worsen BP is stress, high salt intake like pickles, NSAIDS like Brufen or other pain killers, migraine medicines or even any pain can worsen BP. So, avoid pain killers other than Paracetamol or Tramadol, plenty of fruits, have low salt diet, regular exercises, try to keep weight under control. If BP elevates then you may have an additional dose of Telmisartan. Maximum you may up-to 80 mg in a day. Also, while taking BP readings, you should keep your arm relaxed, take 2-3 readings at a time and take BP after rest of 5-10 min. If BP is rising persistently in the evening then additional dose of Telmisartan may be added in the afternoon 2 hours before the expected BP rise. Your average in last abpm was fine and occasional high readings are not worrisome. Regarding inflammation, best way to settle inflammation is healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily and high calorie diet. Having regular exercises like brisk walking or running according to capacity. Also, you should get your lipid profile done and statins like Rosuvastatin prescribed to settle this inflammation. Dinner should be light. Now, regarding your stroke risk, it is better to get a neurologist opinion. The changes may be related to inadequate BP in the past, but you should also obtain carotid artery Doppler for source of emboli. Also, transesophageal echo should be obtained to rule out possibility of patent formanen ovale as a source of emboli."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 23-year-old male.

I do not think a lot. I try to calm myself, but somehow I am not able to calm myself no matter what I try. The main problem now is my anger. I suddenlt feel so much angry, on very stupid things like I am walking on a road and a car blows horn continuously I feel very irritated and angry, if my girlfriend does not pick my call I get so much angry and it is not normal.If I try to control my anger I feel numbness, and hand shakes, I even have palpitations.

In fact one of the common differential diagnosis for panic attack is cardiac arrest. If it is happening often it is advisable to get an ECG (electrocardiogram) done. Please tell me from last how many days are you taking anti-anxiety medications? Secondly, I would advise you to start cognitive behavior therapy. Anxiety is caused by negative thoughts called cognitive distortions these can be improved with various techniques used in the therapy. Once you learn how to cope up with these negative thoughts you will be able to control your anxiety. Find a local therapist or you can opt for online therapy via video consultation. The relaxation techniques such as box breathing and progressive muscle relaxation help in long-term efficacy. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

I went to a clinic and had a temporary filling. I switched jobs within a few months, acquired actual dental insurance and went to a clinic. I got my teeth cleaned, a couple of fillings and set up for a root canal on my broken tooth. During and after the root canal, I was out of it. I have severe TMJ and had to be medicated. It was not until a few days later when I received the bill, that I even realized the procedure did not include the cost of a crown. So I have not had my crown as it was expensive. There is not an excuse that is acceptable, but the fact remains that I have not done anything about this for a decade. Between that time and now, I have switched jobs and no longer have any provided insurance. I stopped chewing on one side of my mouth a few years ago. My broken tooth has died and fallen out a piece at a time. There is about a quarter left. The teeth next to it are in bad shape. My gums are swollen and surely infected. I am aware of the likeliness of deeper infection. I have zero dental insurance and minimal health insurance. I am highly anxious in general and suffer from irrational fears. For reasons I cannot explain, I am terrified of visiting doctors, and especially dentists (no offense). I also have very little in the way of expendable income and I cannot afford to hop from doctor to doctor paying each along the way. I have no clue where to start. But I know I need to. I just have no one to ask. I am scared. What do I do? Can I get to see my general physician about this? I know they will have to refer me, but going straight to a dentist will surely cost a great deal more. I need step one and I do not know what it is?","Doctor":"Hello. You need to show to a dentist itself as the teeth is broken and only a quarter of actual size should be removed. The tooth next to this which has cavity should also be filled or maybe would require root canal treatment. You can delay the crown placement if you do not have money for. Otherwise just extracting or pulling out those infected teeth will give you much relief and it would be cheaper also, than trying to restore it. 1. Use Saline or Betadine gargle for at least twice a day after food for a month to reduce the gum infection. I can prescribe you antibiotics but I do not know whether you will be able to buy them there without a prescription. 2. Amoxicillin 500 mg thrice for five days would reduce the underlying infection and give you relief for a month or so. (stop if you have any allergic reaction). 3. You can take some painkillers and antacids if required. As a last resort if you do not have any money for the treatment and also do not have insurance, just use Betadine gargle and try to buy the above antibiotic and use it for five days. Then when you have money show to a dentist and get those teeth pulled out or restored. Maintain proper hygiene so that at least other teeth do not get infected. Use warm saline gargling as much as possible and for as long as possible.

I saw the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is very common because of the allergy secondary to shaving. Also happens after waxing. Anyways, try to avoid shaving as much as possible. If it is troubling you a lot, then you can go for laser permanent hair removal. For now I am prescribing you few creams. Start using it. Within a month it will decrease. We will take a follow up after a month and according to the response we will decide the further treatment plan. Shaving, waxing. Acneiform eruption/keratosis pilaris. RETINO A 0.025 cream apply in the morning after bath.  Deriva BPO gel apply at night and wash after 1 hour.  Tablet Azithromycin 500 mg one tablet once a day after meal for 3 consecutive days in a week for 4 weeks.  Aquasoft cream: Apply twice a day."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism five years ago and currently taking 100 mg of Synthroid. My most recent lab work showed that I am now at hyperthyroid levels. In the past, I tried reduced levels of Synthroid but felt terrible. I was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy about 15 years ago with tingling and burning in the face and limbs. My Neurologist looked for MS due to my sister having the disease. The Neurologist said only to contact him if it got worse. I used to get two or three episodes per year, mostly during stress or period of fatigue. In the last six months or so, I have almost constant tingling in my face, feet, and arms, and numbness on the sole of my foot. Burning is off and on, some days worse than others. I mentioned it to my GP at an appointment about one month ago, but he said it was nothing to worry about. Researched that thyroid problems can cause tingling, burning, and numbness. Could this be from thyroid? Usually, I would push my GP, but my husband was recently diagnosed with late-onset MS (five months ago), and I feel doctors will think I am a hypochondriac. I am planning to visit my doctor after the holidays but my husband had his attack recently, and I am focused on his issues. I am just curious if I should be worried. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. There are two issues involved, thyroid problem and the other one is if you ​have MS. About thyroid, you are taking 100 mcg (not 100mg) Synthroid since long. My suggestion is to look for thyroid levels and consider tapering slowly over six months. You can discuss with your doctor for the same. Next are your tingling and numbness. It could be because of diabetes. I am not sure if you have diabetes. If yes, reasonable control of sugar is required. If you are not tested for diabetes, then get tested for the same. As you have hypothyroidism, there is a good chance that you may also have diabetes. Tingling and numbness can also be because of vitamin B12 deficiency. Check for levels of the same as it can be easily corrected with supplements. Multiple sclerosis can be diagnosed clinically and by specific laboratory tests. If your doctor has already done it, and assured that you do not have it, then no need to worry. You have fear and anxiety about getting the same as you have a family history, and your husband is also diagnosed with it recently. If you have any weakness in legs or hands, blurring of vision, and paresthesia in extremities, then consult your doctor. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,Can fluctuate blood pressure cause elevated WBC? I got sick with chronic idiopathic urticaria and started MTX. My Rheumatologist diagnosed me with seronegative RA and stopped MTX. Did Vectra DA test, and scored 42/moderate for RA disease. I was supposed to start Remicade this Thursday, but my blood pressure started fluctuating as high as 189/108 mmHg to 138/83 mmHg with low HR as low as 43 at rest. In ER, they checked heart, lungs, and kidneys. They referred me to a Cardiologist, and she added a new medicine Edarbi 40 mg, but said WBC is 20.11, with polys 93.1 and lymph 3.5.I was referred to a Hematologist. He said that it looks to be some bone marrow abnormalities and suggested more extensive blood tests to see if reactive effect to inflammation or blood disease or cancer. The other symptoms are weakness, fatigue, and intermittent slight shortness of breath, but I suspected all was due to pressure or heart rate issue. Fever, chills and body ache lasted for one day. I was fine after I took 500 mg Naproxen. There is no cold symptom with fever. I saw my Rheumatologist, and she said it is not RA related based on high polys. CRP ranged from 7.2 to 17.6 earlier that is before two years, and now almost at its lowest at 8. Does this look like a body reacting to inflammation or pressure or heart rate? Also, I have intermittent pain in lower left abdominal area. I do not see my Hematologist for follow up until next month and cannot start Remicade until I get it figured out.","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for providing a detailed history. To answer your first query, there is no direct correlation between fluctuating BP and the increase in cell counts. CRP is usually elevated in RA (rheumatoid arthritis) disease, which is a common finding reflecting the body's reaction to inflammatory or autoimmune disorders like RA. Though your BP is now controlled to some extent, the low pulse rate could be because of Bystolic 5 mg (Nebivolol). You need a review with your Cardiologist for the same. Also, looking at your non-specific symptoms like weakness, fatigue, intermittent shortness of breath, fever, chills along with elevated differential white cell counts, it is advisable to have bone marrow examination done to rule out hematological malignancy. I am not convinced with your RR of 98. Have you checked it correctly? Please update. Thank you. Bone marrow aspiration. Review with Cardiologist and Hematologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am a 22-year-old male. Is there any treatment in ayurveda for pancreatitis? I had six recurrent pancreatic attacks in the last three years. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. As you are aware, there are many reasons for repeated pancreatitis - that including alcohol consumption, some viral infections, autoimmune, etc. You can discuss the following drugs with an ayurvedic physician nearby and use with consent. 1. Karisalai karpam tablet or Heptowin tablets, 2 morning - 2 noon - 2 evening after food. This is pure herbal. 2. Kaasukatti tablets, 2 pills morning - 2 noon - 2 evening after food. This tablet is chewable or can swallow with water. This is also pure herbal. 3. Kantha chendooram 100 mg mix with honey and drink twice a day (morning and evening) after food. This is prepared from magnet and herbals. All these drugs should be consumed for six months. You feel the difference within 20 days of the first dose. Continue for six months and can stop it. If your pancreatitis is due to autoimmune cause, then you need to take the following additional two tablets. 1. Rasaganthi Mezhugu capsule - one capsule morning and one evening after food. 2. Poorna chandrodayam tablet - one tablet morning and one at evening after food. These two drugs help reduce the autoimmunity in your body and improve your immunity at high. We follow these drugs in our practice. These drugs also should be continued for three months and then can leave a gap of one month. Again one month therapy. Then one month gap. Once you start, you will get the improvement within a week. While taking these drugs, if you have any doubt, please feel free to contact me. Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My 18-year-old daughter has cutaneous vasculitis, mainly covers her lower legs, according to the ER doctor and family doctor as of 3 weeks ago. She is so miserable. I have had to keep her home from school and let her put her feet up. When she goes to school or is on her feet for any length of time, she ends up in pain. She cries and tells me her legs hurt and burn poorly. She feels nauseated and complains of stomach pain regularly and tired. Today, she became weak as she could harldly go from one room to the next. She seemed as if she was going to drop or pass out. As usual, I brought her to the ER (again) where she was told it was not an emergency and there is nothing they can do; she needs to wait until a Rheumatologist can see her which is still a week away. Is there anything I can do to make her more comfortable? Or is this normal for her to feel this way with vasculitis?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your history. It seems a bit weird that no one is starting the treatment yet. Firstly, with vasculitis, one needs to see if it is limited only to the skin or the internal organs as well. We need to see her blood routine, urine routine, and a chest x-ray before concluding it is only limited to the skin. Secondly, if you can, then please get her tested for ANA (antinuclear antibody) and ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody). These are the mandatory test for vasculitis. Vasculitis will only respond to steroids. I am not sure if you can get your hands on it unless your GP suggests, but meanwhile, give her some anti-inflammatory like Naprosyn (Naproxen), only after making sure that her renal function tests are normal. I hope the information is useful. Do let me know for more queries."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am having a mild, tender bump or a lump or a kind of knot deep under the skin on the deltoid muscle. It is very hard to tell if it is moving under the skin. It has been there for three years. I have not noticed any significant growth in the last three years. I am quite scared after reading about sarcomas. I am 20 years old. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand the anxiety you would be suffering from after suspecting that it is a sarcoma. Here is what I can suggest to you: Sarcoma is an uncommon cause of such lumps, and much more common are some harmless cysts and lipomas. Malignant tumors like sarcoma generally do not stay the same size for three years. Most malignant sarcomas in limbs are not associated with pain. However, there is only one way to find out for sure and that is doing some tests on this lump. You have not mentioned the size of the lump. If it is small for about 1-2 cm in diameter, then it may be possible to take it out and test for malignant cells thoroughly. If it is larger, then an MRI scan and a needle core biopsy can be done to decide the treatment. Whether it can directly be taken out or not will be decided by the size and exact location of the lump. Please send a picture with a scale measure by the side of the lump if you want to follow up. Much more commonly, however, it is a cyst that can be easily taken out without any ill effects. To know if it is a cyst or not, your doctor needs to examine you and maybe, do an x-ray of the limb and an ultrasound examination of the site, but only if required. For now, do not worry. Just see a good surgeon. Most likely, it is a lipoma or a cyst and not a tumor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 29-year-old female. I suffered from abscess when I was eight and a half months pregnant. After three months, it was diagnosed as fistula and gone under fistulotomy operation. Since the past few months, I feel some wetness in the perianal area. And today, I saw a blood spot on the tissue. Also, I feel itchy and I am not sure if the anus is completely cured after surgery. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. After reviewing the information shared and your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), a few things come to mind. Wetness in the perianal area and itching are because of the small amount of seepage of stools around the anus. This stool causes irritation to the skin around the anus which causes the itch. Also, the irritation can erode the skin and cause a blood drop to appear. I would like to know a bit more regarding your problem. Did you have any pain along with the blood spot or any pain after stools? How frequent is this problem of itching? Did you ever feel a small amount of stool or gas passed without your control while coughing or laughing hard? When did it start happening? Did it start happening any time soon or was it there all along after surgery? Has it changed over time? Was it a normal delivery? Was anything done to assist the delivery? Was there any complication at the time of delivery of baby? From the picture, I can think of two possibilities. 1. There is a defect in your anal sphincter, the contracting muscle. Although to be sure, a thorough examination is required along with an ultrasound called TRUS (transanal ultrasound), a special type done from inside the anus. In this case, the trouble would be there all along after surgery. So, you may be right that it did not heal properly. 2. There might be a new fistula-in-ano developing, just in front of the anal opening and behind the vaginal opening. In this case, it would have started troubling for a couple of months. 3. If it was painful for you to pass stools or associated with pain after passing stools, then it could be an anal fissure. My advice as follows: Do sitz bath - take lukewarm water in a tub and put a half teaspoon of ordinary salt in it. Now sit in this water and try to make the water clean and sooth your anal region. Sit for around 15 minutes three to four times every day. Try to do it at least twice per day. It will decrease itching. Avoid constipation with a large platter of salad, sprouts or Sat Isabgol 2 spoonful three times per day. Take 3 to 4 liters of water, measured by a bottle, every day. Do exercises for building pelvic muscles and improving the tone or control of anal sphincter. It is best to discuss all the above with your local doctor, who can examine you in person, as a definite diagnosis is unlikely without examination. If there is a defect seen on TRUS and weakness of sphincter, some surgical repair may be possible. Otherwise, exercises can help. Kindly get back with the queries and follow up on icliniq. Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My husband was just diagnosed with congestive heart failure with 25% ejection fraction. They also found an artery 100% blocked, but his own body made another vein and they discovered it is viable, so no bypass surgery is needed. They also discovered his mitral valve is stiffened, and not working. He has some kidney damage also. We are going to have a scope done, and I guess that will determine how to fix the mitral valve. Will they do another test to determine the cause? He has told them he used some steroids during his bodybuilding days, and he drinks occasionally. But, he drinks every night and has used mild steroids up until this happened. They are going to do a test that would determine how it was caused. Could it be due to a virus or abuse? I am just trying to be educated before we go to the next visit. My husband is not always honest with the doctors.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for the query madam. Good to know you are worried about your husband. Yes, alcohol and steroids do cause harm to the heart. Make sure your husband never uses these suicidal drugs again, as now he has an ejection fraction of only 25%. Coming to the mitral valve, it depends upon how much it has narrowed. If severe narrow, then options are either surgery to change the valve or percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV), in which the mitral valve is widened by inflating balloon in the valve. If not severely narrowed, then only medicines of heart failure are sufficient for your husband. Comply with the doctor's advice and medicines. Have vaccination against influenza done yearly, and also pneumonia five-yearly. If EF is 25% and not improving, then have a device installed in the heart called ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), to save from sudden cardiac arrest."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, This query is regarding my 4 and a half-year-old son. He was born at 36.1 weeks and progressed normally. At around 2 years of age, he used to get frequent bouts of running nose and cough. He was hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infection at 2.7 years, and had febrile convulsions at 2.9 due to stomach infection. He still continued getting bouts of cold, cough, and fever approximately every month. He began going to school, and his frequency of falling ill increased. Now, he is on a nebulizer, taking Budecort 0.5 mg respule twice a day along with Lazine M dry syrup, as suggested by his pediatrician. He weighs 15 kg. Pls advise if these respules are safe for him. We could not take him out if it is cold or rainy and even the AC does not suit him. He has been advised not to have milk and milk products like cheese, paneer, etc., as a result, he is not putting on weight. What is the permanent solution for his health problem? Will he improve? Is there any other treatment? Is homeopathy safe? How do I increase his immunity as he falls quickly to changing weather conditions? I would be extremely grateful to you as this is causing me a lot of worries. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing your query to me. I can understand that you are very much concerned about the health of your son. From your history description, it seems that your son has bronchial asthma. Asthma usually occurs from exposure to the allergens in our surrounding environment. The main treatment of asthma is inhaler medicines like Budecort Inhaler 200. Instead of giving him daily twice nebulizer, I will recommend you to start him on Budecort Inhaler via Zerostat-VT Spacer two puffs twice daily followed by gargling with water. And Levolin inhaler two puffs as required in an emergency. On a long term basis, inhaler medicines are not as harmful as they are having fewer side effects than tablets and syrups. Also, as they act at the site of action, a very minimal dose of medicine is required. Try to find out the allergens in his surroundings and avoid them as much as possible. There is no need to deprive him of dairy products such as milk, cheese, or paneer unless he cannot tolerate them. He needs to give it as it is the most important source of calcium and required for weight gain. Nebulization with Budecort is only to be given when he is unable to take inhaler by mouth. Do not forget to rinse the mouth with water after taking inhaler or nebulizer. No other therapy is better for optimal control of asthma as there is no cure for it. Homeotherapy also cannot cure asthma in the long run as there is no scientific evidence for it. I hope everything is clear to you now."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Also if we have sex and he touches that hand in my vagina, will the Diclofenac solution spread into my body? Should I be worried? Please give me some advice as I am scared.","Doctor":"Hi.  You are in the last trimester (7-9 month) of pregnancy. Most of the organs in the fetus might have developed and now it is growing. Thus, care should be taken in food and lifestyle. The rate of absorption of Diclofenac solution into blood from skin is very very less. Even if you apply the solution on your own body skin for long hours, the absorption will be less. If it is absorbed, it stays in the blood for 2 hours. At the end of 2 hours, 50 % of the drug from the blood gets excreted through urine. Remaining 25 % will get excreted in fourth hour. Remaining 12.5 % gets excreted in sixth hour. It means, if the solution reaches blood at 8 AM, it gets completely excreted at 4 PM. Note the point that the external solution does not get absorbed through skin into blood. Thus, need not to worry.  Be careful with your vagina or oral. Because the vagina or oral is made by mucus membrane containing rich minute blood vessels. Vagina is different from skin. In vaigna, the absorption rate is higher and the Diclofenac drug may reaches the blood. Better to avoid, direct applying of Diclofenac solution to vagina or nearby vagina or touching (hands) solution to vagina. This carries some (less) risk to fetus. If the solution is less, no issues. If the solution applied is more, then little amount enters into your blood. If more drug reaches fetus, it inhibits prostaglandins in fetus heart, which lead to unwanted problems in the heart. You can involve in sexual activity, then your husband can apply the drug. Or wash the hands with soap thoroughly before involving in sex. I hope you could understand what I want to say."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am married, 41 years old. I have 2 kids. For the last six months I am having erection problems. I cannot even penetrate. Due to this I fear of nights. I cannot face my partner. Kindly give a solution to my problem.","Doctor":"Hi.  I am not sure whether you have diabetes or hypertension or any other diseases. Whether you are taking drugs (allopathy or herbal) for any other diseases. If so, we need to look the side effects of those drugs. Diabetes patients gets diabetic neuropathy, thus there might be a chance for reduction in erection. There are many other possible reasons as follows: 1. After 40, if the male hormone is reduced. 2. More sathwik (pure vegetarian diets) reduce the sexual hormones. 3. Atherosclerosis to penile artery - this is due to cholesterol sedimentation to the artery which supplies blood to penis 4. Arterial thickening of penile artery 5. Psychological depression - related to work, career, economy, family, etc. This has very strong influence on the erection. 6. Any trauma (hitting) on the penis or back side of hip. this will affect the neurons. To rue out the cause and further treatment you need to consult a doctor in personally (directly). Any psychiatrist or Urologist or andrologist are the better choice to consult. You may also try the following advice; Drink badham milk or eat 2 badham nuts every day (there is a risk of increasing cholesterol at this age), eat Cashew nuts one daily (here is a risk of increasing cholesterol at this age), do pranayama or mediation to keep the mind free. Go to picnic with family. The new environments can remove the psychological depression. Try to solve other psychological problems, if any. Rathina purush capsules. One capsule morning and one at evening before food. This can be continued for one month. Within one month, if you get some effect, then continue it for a total of 3 months and stop it. If there is no improvement within one month, then no need to continue this drug. After evaluating the cause, then only we can take further drug therapy. To evaluate the cause, approach nearby clinicians (I mentioned earlier), They do Doppler or USG to find the cause. The above said physicians deal such cases daily.

After reviewing the information shared and your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it appears you are suffering from Fistula -in Ano (tubular interconnection between anal canal and outside skin near the anal opening). The swelling you are talking about is called perianal abscess. It is a swelling because of infection of some anal glands.Around 30-40 % perinal abscesses are associated with a fistula. In your case having a couple of good quality pictures of the anal region can help in suggesting further treatment. Your MRI report reported presence of around 2 cm size fistula, with no abscess at the time of imaging and no higher up extension. This is a good prognosis type. It will need either of two things: (There are many treatments possible but for you I would suggest these).  1. Thread insertion in the fistula a tightening it every week. This treatment is called \\"Cutting Seton\\". You can use Shar-sutra or Silk thread. 2. Surgery to take the fistula out and let the area heal by itself over time (4 - 6 weeks). This can lead to loss of incontinence as well (control on stool holding) What to do now: You need to followup with a surgeon to do any one of the above two suggested treatments. Do sitz bath - take lukewarm water in a tub put a half a teaspoon of ordinary salt in it. Now sit in this water and try to make the water clean and sooth your anal region. Sit for around 15 min, 3 to 4 times everyday. Try to do at least twice per day. It will decrease itching and help to heal the fissure (as reported by you in your info provided). Avoid constipation with a large platter of salad, sprouts or Sat-Isabgol 2 teaspoon three times per day. Take 3 to 4 litres of water, measured by a bottle, measuring cup everyday.

After reviewing your information provided and the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There are two concerning things: 1. Are you trying not to move the leg at all? (Could be a cause of one sided cold foot). 2. Are you getting this bruise after resting the ankle on the side of bruising? In that case it could be a pressure sore developing. Here also physiotherapy will help. I think you should continue with physiotherapy as advised by your doctor. Physiotherapy can help in the following manner:  1. Reducing pain of movement and strengthening muscles for weight bearing. 2. Maintaining full movement of the joint. 3. Improving the circulation and helping with this kind of pressure sore development and also cold foot.  Regarding other causes of pain, discuss it with the surgeon who did the arthroscopy (depends on the findings). Definitely see your surgeon till you are able to bear weight and do your daily life activities well. If you have cold and painful sensation in both feet or arms. or a family history of such problems, discuss with your GP, the possibility of vasculitis.

I had a breast check up and mammogram 6 months ago which was clear. Is this normal? What is it?","Doctor":"Hello. This does not appear worrisome to me (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This appears like erythematous lesion due to inflammation. This has probably occurred due to some trauma like due to pressure of folds in clothing or bed sheet or lying over the chest. Also, rule out possibility of some bite or nail scratching. If this is generalized and also present on the other body parts then may be related to some infection.  So, usually such single visible vein is not significant. It should settle in a day or two. But if continues to persist or increase in number or any other symptoms like swelling, pain, fever appears then will need examination or investigations. At present, does not appear significant or serious issue. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a very personal and sensitive issue. I have horrible breath. I do have gum disease but my cleaning which consists of flossing several times a day, using a miniature brush to brush between teeth, and using tongue scrapper several times a day (I occasionally oil pull as well). Can part of my issue be due to a deficiency of some sort? Any kind of advice would sincerely be appreciated (this issue is significantly affecting my life).","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query.

Migraine headaches are usually unilateral, associated with throbbing, vomiting sensations, photophobia, and phonophobia. Chronic tension headaches usually present with heaviness in head, band-like sensation over the head with sleeping difficulties. Important here is to differentiate between the two. A clinical examination especially neurological examination, fundus examination are must to rule out any other neurological problem which might also require neuroimaging. You should see your doctor. He will classify the headache and if it is migrainous, treatment would be with drugs like Flunarizine, Propanolol, Amitryptyline. Tension Headaches are treated with Amitryptilline, Escitalopram with behavioral modification treatment.

But on the third night I put it on and my skin began to burn terribly and it was unbearable. It blocked me from breathing and I nearly passed out. I did not wash it off because I found when I did that on the second night it made it worse and when I woke up today I had terrible chemical burns all over my face. My hyperpigmentation and acne had become worse and it is causing immense pain and discomfort and it really does look terrible it is similar to the worst kind of sunburn ever and the skin is plastered and dry too.

I have a history of UTI's as well. My creatinine was up to 1.67 in all of my kidney infections. Few months back, I had a partial hysterectomy in which my left ureter was cut and not noticed and I was closed back up. I returned to the ER six days after my hysterectomy and was taken to emergency surgery because my left kidney was enlarged and not draining. I had a stent placed which remained for six weeks. My creatinine was 1.7. I had bloodwork done after my stent was removed and my creatinine was .9. I had another kidney infection in four months. My blood pressure has been increasing since then and I had to go to the ER because my blood pressure was about 146/121 mmHg. I am now on blood pressure medication and my blood work shows my creatinine at 1.2. I had a renal scan done that came back normal. Is it possible that I had CKD?

This may lead to progress to chronic kidney disease. Your urine examination report also showing plenty of RBC (red blood corpuscles). But not mentioned what is RBC morphology in microscopy? In case of renal problems, morphology is changed. But if morphology is intact means it is lower urinary tract infection. Also, check for UTI (urinary tract infection) for your husband. There is a chance of repeated urinary tract infection. Please review with urine culture report if unnecessary raising of serum creatinine may a need kidney biopsy.

Also, there is polyp formation in the right maxillary sinus. When I inhale to get relief from nasal congestion and it starts irritating with inflammation. Any advice?","Doctor":"Hi. We have to first ascertain as to why sinusitis has occurred in the first place. Usually, in most cases, the primary cause is a seasonal or year around allergic problem that is there. Just to make you understand I have tried to explain things in a simple way below. Exposure to dust (or any irritative substance that your body is hypersensitive to) will initially initiate reflexes such as sneezing to remove the offending agent out but if this fails, mucosal cells in you nose start to hyperfunction producing loads of mucus to trap dust (owing to its sticky nature), this mucus has no where to go other than either being blown out of due to mucociliary activity gets pushed into the throat, thereby entering into a new zone. The throat initially reacts by activating cough impulses to push out the mucus, but if that fails, a local inflammation around the throat starts which often leads to symptoms such as feeling of a lump in the throat and repeated feeling to clear the throat. As far as your nose is concerned, due to long standing inflammation, the mucosa starts to get edematous and ends up forming a polyp. I know the problem is there since a long five years, but I am not sure if you have followed any specific treatment chart which is usually recommended before we consider any patient for surgery. This treatment chart is custom made according to your symptoms and does follow the guidelines to treat both allergy with sinusitis. The following things can be considered. 1. Wear an n95 mask at all times, do not allow any dust or irritative substance from entering into your nose. This is the most important thing you should be following failing which, no treatment will bring any relief. 2. Tablet Sinarest (Paracetamol + Phenylephrine hydrochloride + Chlorpheniramine maleate) one tablet twice daily after food 12 hours apart for 15 days. 3. Tablet Allegra M (Fexofenadine and Montelukast) one tablet twice daily after food 12 hours apart for 15 days. 4. Tablet Zerodol TH (Aceclofenac and Thiocolchicoside) 4mg (or its equivalent) one tablet twice daily after food for five days. 5. Tablet Clarithromycin 500 mg one tablet twice daily after food. 6. Duonase nasal spray (or its equivalent) two puffs two times a day in both nostrils for three months (do not inhale while you spray the drug). 7. Tablet Mucomix 600 mg (Acetylcysteine) one tablet twice daily for 1 week. 8. Tablet Wysolone (Prednisolone) 10 mg one tablet after breakfast for 10 days. 9. Steam inhalations 3 to 4 times a day. 10. Saltwater gargles at 8 to 10 times a day for one month. 11. Do not smoke or consume alcohol as it slows down mucociliary clearance mechanisms. All precautionary measures have to be followed strictly for maximum relief, otherwise, medications would not be useful on the long term. Surgery can be considered (if above medications and precautionary measures do not give any relief), but there is a catch to it. The symptoms might come back sometimes even on a higher scale after a brief relief following surgery if the precautionary measures post surgery are not followed. Ideally speaking in a nutshell, I again emphasis on preventing any irritative substance from entering the nose and throat, thereby triggering an allergic cascade of events and reproducing the symptoms you have mentioned above. As far as the polyp is concerned, in very few cases the polyp resolves on its own with medications and often the patient requires a surgery called functional endoscopic sinus surgery where the sinus openings are widened and the polyps are removed. You will have to get a CT scan done to see the extent of the polyp, current condition of the other sinuses and anatomical variations in the nose which could have been contributing to the polyp. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am an 18-year-old female who has for the past months been experiencing that my memory is degrading badly.

I sleep around, 6-7 hours on school week. And 9+ hours on a holiday. I do take some medications for my ADHD and I am aware there are some side effects to that medicine.

I had a heart attack 12 years ago and now have three stents. By the way, I have no family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, cholesterol and anything of that nature. I am a disabled military veteran and am 40% disabled as a result of being exposed to lead and asbestos during my time in service. I am drawing disability for chronic or acute sinusitis and migraine headaches. It is my contention that my heart complications are a result of being under those same conditions while in the service. I had not had any health issues nor any family history of heart issues leading up to these complications. This is a battle I have been fighting for nearly ten years. I have provided case studies, online articles and most recently, feedback from a cardiologist that stated that there has been findings that there is a correlation between lead and asbestos exposure and heart disease. Even when I was able to obtain that particular feedback, they are now requiring additional documentation. I am reaching out to you in an effort to get an open and honest opinion. The veterans administration is asking the following. Is there a greater than 50% chance that my exposure to lead and asbestos during my service time could have lead to my heart disease and heart attack? I have also included some articles below that back up the correlation between the two.","Doctor":"Hello. It saddens me to hear of the whole difficulties you have gone through in the past years. I must recommend you for staying strong in the face of all these difficulties. I have thoroughly gone through all your detailed explanation and here is my view. Although I have not had clinical experience of a patient with such complications, I have thoroughly researched to find enough evidence to bring me to the conclusion that lead poisoning can lead to heart diseases and stroke, but no much evidence of asbestos causing cardiovascular diseases. These below are my findings. 1. In a study that involved 60,000 participants, it was concluded that lead poisoning was associated with cardiovascular events. Most commonly but not limited to hypertension, especially in lead blood levels below 5 μg/dL. 2. Another article also detailed the complications of lead poisoning to the cardiovascular system, although the mechanism is unknown. 3. A study by the Harvard school of public health (HSPH) also detailed the effects of bone lead to increase cardiovascular complications. In my conclusion, there is more than 50% chance of a cardiovascular complication due to lead poisoning. Although they might argue the fact that only a few cases have been reported. I feel strongly that more than 50% of it caused your heart complications. Your level of lead exposure will help your case."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am feeling very stressed for some issues. I am having a feeling of guilt and fear. How to cope with it?","Doctor":"Hello. You have reported feeling stressed for the past 5 days due to some issues. Were you completely normal before 5 days? It is common to feel stressed when faced with difficult life circumstances. You can follow these strategies to manage stress till you get better. 1. It is very important not to isolate yourself during this period. Try to open up and talk to a trusted family member or friend so that they can support you. If you are feeling low, you will want to avoid meeting other people. But try to make an effort to go out and see others. 2. Exercise regularly. Go for walks, play sports. These will release natural endorphins in your body and help to improve your mood. 3. Eat regularly and sleep well. Avoid using alcohol or any other drugs. These will just numb you temporarily and will not help in the long-term. 4. Try meditation to calm yourself. 5. Try to keep yourself occupied by continuing with your regular work. Distract yourself. During leisure time by listening to nice music, watching movies, etc. 6. Follow sleep hygiene measures. Try to sleep for atleast 7-8 hours daily. 7. Try progressive muscle relaxation exercises and deep breathing exercises. 8. Try not to worry about things beyond your control. Is there anything in particular which makes you feel guilty and fearful? Is it related to any recent stressor? If you are continuing to feel stressed and not able to cope, visit your doctor locally for an assessment. Remember it takes some days to feel back in control."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I would like to get a second opinion on my dentist's plan to fix my missing teeth. I am missing my upper lateral incisors since birth and have had a temporary resign bonded bridge since I was 17. I am now ready to take the step to a more permanent solution. My two options are a bridge or implants. After my X-rays and MRI scan, it became apparent that I do not have enough bone for implants and I would need a bone graft. Since I would need at least 3 mm for each side, my dentist told me that there was a chance it might not take and I would need another surgery. The position of the roots of the adjacent teeth are not a problem, there is enough space to place the implants, just not enough bone. Initially, he did say he would prefer to do the implants, since it is a better solution for long-term. When my dentist asked the opinion of another dentist in the office, he said that the bridge would be a better solution so I would not have to go through multiple surgeries and it would be done sooner. The bridge is indeed a quicker solution, but I am not very keen on having parts of my teeth removed for the bridge. It will also need replacing at some point, and if the underlying teeth have a problem, the whole bridge needs to be replaced. Both my sister and mother have a bridge (they are also missing their upper lateral incisors) and I am not impressed with either results (these were placed by different dentists). I am fine with the process taking a little longer (and being more expensive) if it means it will give me a more natural smile, but I am also afraid that I will be going through surgery for something that might not even take. My dentist now does not want to express his opinion anymore, and just keeps giving me the pros and cons. Any insights would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. In my view, even though I do not have any pictures or X-ray, I believe it is better for you to get bridges. You can get costly Zirconium bridges which are highly aesthetic and looks exactly like natural teeth. Get those side teeth root canal treated to prevent future sensitivity or pain. This will give you a highly satisfactory result in my view. Implants need much bone support and as your lateral incisors are congenitally missing, the bone at the region will be very thin and any bone graft is bound to fail in > 50 % cases. For more details, send pictures if possible."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been suffering lately from pain in my big toe joint. It is very severe that I could not sleep two nights when I ran out of painkillers. I thought it might be a gout attack. Because I do have gout. Though my uric acid levels are mostly high, I do not really watch what I eat. My triggers for gouty attacks happen to be rapid weight loss. It was actually the cause I had gout in the first place, I lost 40 kg in a few months when I was 18. So, if I count the attacks I had since the first time (8 years ago) perhaps only six times, three times my right big toe and three times my left ankle. All when I was not eating well and lost a lot of weight. The last attack was a year ago. But, it has never been too severe and the most painful period will last for hours in one single night. I cannot step on it and eventually it will go away gradually. But, this time it is too intense. Especially if I try to sleep, I will sleep in minutes and the moment I move my toe while asleep, I wake up with an extreme pain like someone stabbing my foot with a knife and cut it through from the big toe joint through the upper foot. I even cried as I felt helpless with extreme pain that will not let me rest. And, it has been a week now and the pain is not going down with medication. The moment I finished my Voltaren 50 mg in four days I thought it is much better now, but it came back like a demon. The problem is that I am confused and cannot run into all options of diagnoses due to financial situation. I went today to a hospital. The orthopedic was full, could not get an appointment urgently. So, it was a general doctor, he did not know for sure what is going on. He suspected gout, so he made blood test and uric acid was 326 umol/L, which is the best I have ever had. As he still not sure, he advised to do an x-ray and the result he said as normal. So, he gave me strong painkillers and Allopurinol, which I did not use as my uric acid is fine and told me to see how it goes for two weeks. In my x-ray see I noticed there is a slight difference in distance between the bones of the toes and the foot. The big toe is a bit closer to the bone comparing with the other toes. I do not know if this has anything to do, but I want you to double check. I have attached the photo taken. To give you more information, the pain is so intense if I am out of medication. The big toe flexes up or down, but up is more difficult than down and also upon stepping on it. So, I have to walk, stepping half side of my foot, avoiding landing on the big toe base. Of course, I apply ice water almost every three hours to feel ease and also pain upon touch from the outer side of the joint to the left. Also, you can see clear swelling and color change of the skin in the photo. I am totally confused because I happen to make many mistakes that might cause different problems to my joint. I am not sure which one triggered it or the cause of it. I lost a lot of weight in a short period of time. I was recently (last month) on a ketogenic diet low carbohydrate high fat in which there is a debate that it might be problem for gout sufferers. I have also increased my volume and intensity of the workout due to the extra energy felt when I was keto adapted. I usually stop exercising when I feel I spent a lot of hours, not because I was tired, so perhaps that caused a lot of stress on my body. My daily workout was something like 90 minutes weight lifting in the gym and 45 minutes running and maybe 30 minutes walking to the gym if we count this as well. I remember running in barefoot too. I changed my shoes just a week before the pain and I chose a good quality running shoe. I chose a fit one, not painful or even uncomfortable, but I thought because it is filled with cushioning and felt light and good. I have not even known that there could be a problem until last night I read some articles against tight fit shoes, especially for those with gout. So, I am really confused about the problem. Am I suffering from gout or sesamoiditis or tendonitis or turf toe? I need you to guide me. What should I do? Will I need to do an MRI or CT or bone scan? Which one will confirm everything?","Doctor":"Hello. For further information consult an orthopaedician and traumatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have jaundice.

Definitely never drinking again and totally not worth the risk of developing some kind of liver disease.","Doctor":"Hello. Do not worry. You may have anxiety more than disease itself. For raised total cholesterol you may take low cholesterol diet with regular exercise. Quitting of alcohol may be useful. Get it done ultrasound abdomen and liver scan. Avoid alcohol intake. Use tablet Pantoprazole before breakfast for one week. Eat green leafy vegetables, do yoga and meditation. Be happy and do not worry. If cholesterol is still high, then you may take antihyperlipidemic drugs. Please consult your physician, he will examine and treat you accordingly. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 26-year-old female with no significant health history. I have anxiety, and I had hyperthyroidism in the past. I have had an itchy rash for over three months. It started as a small patch behind my left knee. It happened after having a ring shaped rash on my left thigh. I was treated for that with antifungal cream and it went away. This new rash is completely different. I am extremely itchy to the point. It is interfering with my life. There is no obvious rash unless I have already scratched that area. I then get a bunch of small skin-colored bumps. Also, after scratching, I often get petechiae and bruising. The itch is everywhere but my face. I have been waking up wet from sweating even though my bedroom is fairly cold at night. A few times I have checked, I had a small fever of around 99.1. My doctor puts me on antihistamines (Benadryl at night, Claritin during the day) and steroid cream. It has not worked. She recently wrote me a prescription for Prednisone, but I am worried that a skin allergy just is not what I have. I am currently taking Effexor 75 mg, Klonopin 0.5 mg when needed.","Doctor":"Hi. You do have a bright red colored rash over the legs. Such rashes occur mostly as a response to allergies. Now allergies can be because of food (artificial colors) or even at times because of insect bites. The petechial patch on the shin is nothing but a result of excessive scratching of the skin. You must use a good preservative-free hydrating moisturizer (Cetaphil Restoraderm) in the morning. If the itching is severe enough, there is no harm in taking a short course of Prednisolone. Most importantly, get your blood workup (complete blood count) done. You can get back to me after the blood work is done."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 39 years old. I have a very bad red, itchy, weeping, scaly butterfly rash on my face which my doctor says is Rosacea. But it has responded to no treatments except steroid cream so far. I also have excessive watering, itching, and swelling of my eyes (ocular rosacea). Not sure if there is a connection but my periods have become unusually light during the last year. Could I have something more than just Rosacea do you think? I am currently being tested for lupus but would there be other possibilities for what could be causing this?","Doctor":"Hi. From the photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity) it looks like rosacea. However, the possibility of lupus and allergies to sun exposure can not be ruled out. You should check out for lupus. Steroids are not given in rosacea, as initially, it may give a good improvement, but as the times goes by you will be completely dependent on them. Topical steroids cause skin atrophy and hoards of other problems which is more or less permanent. So I will suggest you stay away from them. Topical Metronidazole gel at night with a good sunscreen (as rosacea worsens with sun exposure) will give results. Rosacea is a chronic condition and will stay for a long time. You will have to manage it well. It some times shows signs of flare-ups and downs, generally as a response to anxiety, stress, excitement, and prolonged sun exposure. Minimize sun exposure. Use sunscreen meticulously, daily. No cosmetics on the face. Follow up after the use of said medications in 15 days time."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Loose stools that are yellowish in color.

Loose stools are said when stool volume is more than 200 ml in a day, semisolid to liquid in consistency.

For some reason, at times like standing, walking or in the shower, my heart feels like it is beating harder than normal, and faster at times. I am not sure if a tight chest makes heart beats feel more intense or if there is a problem. I have had EKG, chest x-rays, and blood work to rule out serious heart conditions. Everything was fine except blood pressure. I have been really stressed, scared and constantly on edge. So they think my blood pressure is due to stress as I was having a panic attack when it was taken, and when I was relaxed it started going down. I am extremely scared to do anything because my chest, neck, and back is so tight and when I feel my heart beat fast things get tighter, spasm and lock up. What is going on? What is the remedy to this? Is this really anxiety? Can the muscle tension make my heartbeat feel stronger than normal?","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms seem to be due to anxiety. If all your workup is normal, there is nothing to worry about. I advise you to eat healthily, avoid fast foods, alcohol, etc. Do regular exercise, flush all the worries out of your life. There is nothing to worry about, always chill, you have your life and you have to make full of it. Always care for life as it is precious so you are too. Take part in healthy activities.

I do no substance abuse, alcohol, and smoking. I have a painful post auricular lymph node swelling for four days. Yesterday evening one more post auricular lymph node was noticed which is swollen, sudden in onset and painless. I am taking antibiotics Augmentin duo (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) and painkillers for three days. I am worried because one more lymph node started swelling and I even worried about cancer. Please help. Blood test was done lymphocytes - 55% and neutrophils - 30%, rest all values are normal.","Doctor":"Hi. Your complaint is suggestive of some ear or scalp infection, as it is painful. Please send a picture of the lesion, as it is possible that what you think is the painful lymph node is actually folliculitis and the painless thing is actually the real lymph node. In that case, the antibiotics that you are currently taking are appropriate. The dose should be Augmentin Duo 625 (Amoxicillin 500mg and Clavulanic acid 125 mg) twice a day for five days. Do not stop before five days. Take tablet Combiflam (Ibrufen 400mg and Paracetamol 325mg) twice a day for two to three days. Regarding the risk of cancer, size of the painless lymph node is a very important parameter in deciding further investigation. If the size is more than 1.5 cm then FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) of the lymph node is usually recommended. This test needs to be done if after taking the above-mentioned treatment for five days the swellings continue to persist. Gram stain and culture of any discharge. Acute lymphadenitis. Lymphoma. Folliculitis. Continue antibiotics to complete total of five days. Painkillers as required. Hot and cold fomentation. Maintain scalp hygiene. Followup is must if the swelling persists more than a week. Follow up with pictures both before medicines and after a week."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Why do men get wrinkles in their foreheads with age? Is it more lifestyle or genetic? Is it possible to tell if it is more than the other? Are men more or less likely to get forehead wrinkles compared to women? Why or why not? What can men do to prevent forehead wrinkles? Is there anything they can do to reverse them once they show up that does not require surgery? Do facial muscle exercises (i.e. face yoga) work? What surgical options to men have and when might they consider it? Are forehead wrinkles a sign of an underlying health problem or cause for concern?","Doctor":"Hello. Forehead Wrinkles are signs of aging process. Men get wrinkles due to decrease formation of new collagen and destruction of already existing collagen and elastin proteins in our skin. Wrinkles can be inherited if one gets it early but in majority people, they become prominent with aging and ultraviolet radiation has the major role to play in this. UV (ultraviolet) radiation boosts the process of collagen degradation through the formation of reactive oxygen species. Men get more forehead wrinkles because in females estrogen has a somewhat protective role. Men are more exposed to sunlight and women have more fat layer beneath the skin that gives good contouring to the skin. Prevention of forehead wrinkles is partially possible because they are part of the normal age process. Protection from sunlight is very important in this regard. Treatment of forehead wrinkles can be invasive or noninvasive. In non-invasive procedures HIFU, (high intensity focused ultrasound) is very famous nowadays. In this high intensity focused ultrasound waves are given to wrinkle area and it stimulates collagen formation. Invasive methods are botox injection. Surgical correction requires fillers to be inserted."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I think I have tonsil stones. I have little white things in my tonsil pockets. When I cough them up or manage to get them out, they are whitish or yellowish hard clumps. I have mild sore throats all the time, bad breath (I brush my teeth constantly and I make sure I do not eat food that makes breath smell bad), and I get earaches. It constantly feels like food or something is stuck in my throat and it is really annoying. Should I go see a doctor about this? Or is there any way I can get rid of them at home?","Doctor":"Hello. You suffer from tonsilloliths. Tonsils which are lymphoid organs in the throat produce secretions through the crypts in them. In a few people, these secretions calcify and become stones (called tonsilloliths). In a vast majority of people it stays asymptomatic, however, in a few like you, they produce symptoms such as food stuck in the throat and mild ache. The presence of these stones causes stasis of secretions in the crypts which otherwise freely flow into the mouth. The stasis causes the development of bacterial colonies which result in halitosis (bad breath) and associated throat ache. The tonsils act as a source of infection to the ears, as the bacteria rises up along the eustachian tube that connects back of the nose to the ears on each side. Sometimes a remnant of adenoids could also be causing the ear issue. If this problem has been there for more than three to four months I suggest you go ahead and get your tonsils removed. The procedure is called a tonsillectomy. Before that, we would like to take a radiograph of your nasopharynx (to rule out adenoid enlargement). Adenoids usually regress by 10 years of age but in some, it remains longer and causes problems of mouth breathing, ear block, snoring, and ear infections. If adenoids are enlarged they also can be removed along with tonsils in the same setting, adenotonsillectomy. If you ask me the merits and demerits of the procedure, in your case the merits clearly outweigh the demerits. These lymphoid organs in you have turned more harmful than protective. The tonsils are causing you bad breath, foreign body feeling in the throat along with tonsillar stones. The tonsils or the adenoids are causing you the ear ache as well. Post-operatively you may face mild pain for two days and you can resume your work or college in three to four days time. In my set up we do this operation on day care basis. We use radio-frequency ablation for removing the tonsils which is one of the most recent advances in the field of ent surgery. Medically the problem can be managed but recurrences are the norm. You may gargle the throat using chlorhexidine dilutions or betadine dilutions multiple times a day. Drink plenty of fluids, treat an acute infection on a case by case basis using appropriate antibiotics and avoid cold spicy food items that may irritate the mucosa. However, a permanent solution for the problem will be evasive unless and until you rid yourself of the tonsils. I hope this helps. X-ray of nasopharynx soft tissue lateral view for adenoids, serum IgE. Throat swab for culture and sensitivity."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 45 years now and still not blessed with a child due to late marriage. This is my third year after marriage. I get my periods regularly but this month I got my period as usual on the correct date. And after one week, again I got my period with lot of clots. Is this sign of menopause? Or all the cysts are coming out? Please advise how to become a mother in my case.","Doctor":"Hello doctor,  Welcome to Icliniq.com. Age is an important factor in getting conception of an embryo. The best healthy ovum are usually released during the early years of life. Thus, during a late age, we might have an unhealthy ovum. So, if you are trying to conceive, you approach a gynecologist to check the status of your uterus, endometrium, ovary, ovum and hormonal levels. If there is something wrong, we can specifically give the treatments. Mostly, in this age, menopause is possible. Other things such as fibroid uterus should be ruled out through an ultrasonogram. If menopausal attained, then the estrogen, progesterone level in the blood will be in the lower level. I suggest you go for a lab investigation to rule out the cause. In allopathy system, you may try for in-vitro fertilization techniques for conceiving. In Ayurveda, take tablet Aloes compounds two in the morning, two in the afternoon and two in the evening after food. Continue this tablet for three months. If you do not have fibroid uterus and menopause, you will get conceived. If a fibroid is there, we can treat with other drugs or do surgery to remove the fibroid. If menopause attained, then no hope for natural conception. Invitro fertilization may be helpful. Simultaneously, the semen analysis to your husband to be done. If a couple gets their kid at the age of 47, by the time they reach 70 years, their child enters college. This is how late marriages affects the care of the next generation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had septoplasty and turbinoplasty 16 days ago. After the surgery, they asked me to come back after two days for packs removal. Then after two days, I went to the hospital, other doctor look after me and he just removed one pack, even I asked him to remove the packs on both sides but he refused it. I then came back home, after two days, I cannot able to eat or even drink anything as my mouth smells very foul and the whole nose got swelled. Then, after seven days I revisit a doctor, then the doctor who did the surgery on me looked inside my nose and pulled out the pack hardly. Then after this, my nose shape changed badly and I cannot breathe normally now, what I can do now?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand you underwent septoplasty and turbinoplasty and you have not completely recovered. After septoplasty post-operatively it takes about two to three months for complete healing and recovery. You must put Solspre nasal spray two puffs four times daily for about a month in either nostril. If there is excessive dryness you must also instill 0.5% menthol paraffin nasal drops three drops in each nostril thrice daily. The room where you stay must be adequately humidified and should have moisture. You must drink plenty of water and take healthy foods. You must go for weekly reviews with the ENT surgeon who can look into the nose and see if the healing is good. If not you may require suction clearance of the nasal cavities. Any clots or crusts may be causing the nasal blockage for you. If after two months also you are not feeling any improvement, kindly contact us. We can reassess the problem and get you the best treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I went to an optometrist and diagnosed with something like below. Retinal exam showed OD temporal area of pigmentation (old chrpe vs atropical hole) with area of retinal elevation. I have attached the optomaps. Can you please tell me how serious is this? Does it need surgery?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your optomap. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The first (left eye) one seems fine. The second one (right eye) on your left-hand side has a few changes. It is a bit tricky to make assumptions based on images, but are you referring to the retinal elevation and hole and chrpe on to the left-hand side? There are a multitude of options to treat such a disease. Some doctors, with such a finding, might say that it is a small hole and localized elevation and especially if you yourself have no symptoms like flashing light or floating objects, might ask you to simply follow up with them and recommend observation. Others may recommend that you get laser or surgery done more so in case you have symptoms as mentioned above and if you have had any such incidents in your other eye, or have risk factors like a high power. So in summary, I can say that it mainly depends on the progress, your symptoms and the risk factors. I can assure you that observation for a retinal problem like yours can be done because it is not involving the center part (macula). But the doctor may opt to treat with a laser depending on the progress of the condition. Once again it depends on your progress, risk factors and symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have hypothyroid and PCOD. I am taking Eltroxin 100 mcg. I have been put on Deviry tablets a few times to regularize periods. I am looking for a permanent cure for PCOD. I read from your posts that kalarchi choornam is effective. Can I take them along with thyroid Eltroxin tablets? Or will there be any interaction? What is your suggested treatment for my PCOD?","Doctor":"Hello. You have hypothyroidism and PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease). You are not trying to get pregnant now. So, it is time to take strict Siddha medications to get a complete cure from PCOD. I advise you to continue Eltroxin tablet. During your regular visit, the physician will regulate its dose based on hormonal values. So, you no need to worry about that. In many people, Siddha drug renders the possibility of reducing Eltroxin dose. For PCOD, please follow the following medical advice. a) Kumari legium (Van kumari legium), take 2 gm (one spoon) in the morning and evening before food or Aloes compounds two tablets in the morning and two in the evening after food. b) Tablet Chithira moola kuligai one tablet in the morning and one in the night after food. c) Kalarchi chooranam 1.5 gm in the morning and evening after food with hot water or milk. If you do not get this drug in the market, you can prepare as follows:  Kalarchi (Bonduc nut) seed (remove outer shell and use only the inner kernel) - 100 gm Black pepper - 10 gm Asafoetida (fried) - 10 gm, Keep these in a mixie jar and make a powder. The drug is ready. Store in a container. d) Malai vembathi thailam or Kalingaathi thailam (both or same) 5 ml daily during the night before bed. After some days, you can increase its dose a few drops. Continue all these drugs. Within three months, you will get periods. Then also during menstrual bleeding days, stop all drugs. Again, start from day fifth of the bleeding day. Continue for six months. Your uterus and ovary will become normal. Suppose, if you do not get bleeding, but only few spots, then consider it as the bleeding. If you do not get even a spot, then do not worry, you continue these drugs for six months. Tender arasam leaf (peepal tree), collect the tender leaves. Grind three leaves and mix with milk (like milkshake). Consume this in the morning. Continue this daily morning until you become normal. If you get more tender leaves at a time, dry them and powder it. Then take 1 gm and mix in milk. If you do not like milk, then use buttermilk or water. This is another important home remedy for PCOD."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had many years of health problems including severe joint pain, inability to lose weight, chronic fatigue, transient pains, and abdominal pains that seem to come and go in cycles sometimes lasting for days or even months. I have a medical phobia, so have not been to the doctor unless it was an emergency. But over 20 years ago I ended up going to the ER and had several tests. I was told I had lupus, osteoarthritis, PCOS, and thyroid issues. I have tried to treat myself and pain naturally over the years with a healthy lifestyle and natural aids, but the pain finally became so bad over the last couple of years that I have gone to some appointments. I was referred to a rhuematologist that did blood work and said I was fine except low vitamin D. I told the new doctor about the early diagnosis and she said it was probably wrong but she would run blood test anyway. When the test results came back, she said I did not have an autoimmune problem and I was fine except that I had low Vitamin D. I have a copy of the test results that look like there are some problems to me and based on her reviews and my personal experience with my health, I would very much like a second opinion. I am taking Xanax when needed. Some tests are attached. I have also had an MRI that showed osteitis pubis, fatty liver, and mild bladder inflammation.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your history and blood reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I found a few abnormalities which I would like to ask a few more details on and also some more questions pertaining to your problem which would help us reach a conclusive diagnosis. Do you experience any dry eyes or dry mouth? When the pain comes, is it more in the nights or day? Do you experience fatigue in the morning hours as well? Any recent mood changes with irritability? Any history of forgetfulness? As for the blood test, major abnormalities I found were low vitamin D, positive ANA (but the titer is very low and further ENA is negative) which excludes an autoimmune cause. But your CRP (C-reactive protein) is a bit high at the last report. So there was an infection going on that time or any other symptom as your last CRP was mostly normal. As of now I do not think you have lupus. My diagnosis is going towards fibromyalgia but would like to confirm after knowing these further queries only."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a single gallstone. I am not facing any symptoms but about last week I felt a severe and intense pain in stomach and immediately to back which continues until I had an Decloyran injection. This pain did not spread over the abdomen. When we met the doctor he checked very carefully and said that it was not the pain of gall stone. The doctor asked for an ultrasound and in ultrasound the stone was in its place. No inflammation or fluid accumulation. Gall bladder size was normal. The doctor said that the pain was due to twist of certain veins and is not due to gallstone. I want to ask that whether twisting of vein can cause pain? Is it necessary to do operation? Is there any way to remove single gallstone?","Doctor":"Hello. So starting from answering your first question. The pain of twisting of veins is an strange term in itself. Why would veins twist around in a healthy young lady with no previous significant medical history. So I do not believe this. Second, the gall bladder is not removed in asymptomatic gall stones. Asymptomatic gall stones are those which do not cause symptoms, and the symptoms of gall stones occur usually when the stone size is 10 mm, if smaller than this, it is unlikely that your pain was gall stone related. Since you did not mention size of gall stones, otherwise it would have been easy to tell you whether it was cause of your pain or not. Other, the pain of gall stones has to be typical in nature; the pain which occur in right upper quadrant of the abdomen (at site of your liver), pain starts suddenly mostly after half hour of meals, peaks within 1 hours, and then starts settling in next 4 to 6 hours. Vomiting and nausea can frequently accompany with this pain. If you have that typical type of pain, then it may be from gall bladder. Your third question. The answer is no. No drug therapy can prevent from formation of stones or dissolution of stone. There are some therapies which are used as in experience, but they are not recommended at all. If gall bladders stones are symptomatic then they has to be removed by doing gall bladder resection via laparoscopy. If not symptomatic, then no need of any drug or surgical therapy. Having said that, elective gall bladder resection is indicated among patients who could not bear the risk of cholecystitis, such as pregnant ladies with size of stones more than 10 mm, or patients with smaller gallbladder stones but having pancreatitis. Stone but without symptoms and presence of gall bladder polyps. These three types of patients can have surgery despite no symptoms. Gall bladder stones Gall bladder stones Follow up to discuss plan of action in your case from now onwards. Ruling out other causes of your abdominal pain, on history and some preliminary investigations."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I saw an ophthalmologist for what I thought was a pink eye infection. The following issues were addressed: Acute (sudden onset) inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane that covers the white part of the eye) causing the white part of the eye to become red and irritated with the formation of little bumps inside of the inner eyelid and misalignment of the eyelashes which rub against the eyeball causing irritation. His diagnosis was some type of scleritis. He wrote a prescription for drops with an antibiotic and told me to give it a few weeks to clear up and nothing serious. Within a month there was little marked improvement so I went to see him again. He was amazed that there was no improvement and laughed. He said all of my patients get better with this medicine except you. You should probably check with the pharmacy and see if this was a bad batch. Maybe it got too hot on the truck. I was literally taken back. He took me off of that medicine and told me to get over the counter drops similar to No More Tears, I did and used for one more week with no improvement. I called his nurse at his office and he prescribed Prednisolone acetate drops which did seem to eliminate the white blisters on the white of my eye. However, my eye started to hurt as if someone was stabbing it with a needle over and over at random times. By the next day morning, I lost a part of my vision in my left eye. It was as if someone smeared my lens with vaseline, blurry and looked like I was looking through frosted glass, and also painful. I called his office and he was on vacation so they referred me to the physician on call at another facility. The doctor was shocked that this had gone on for so long. He was afraid my vision was in danger because of nontreatment. He diagnosed me with dendritic keratitis and shingles of the eye (cornea). He did not want me going back to the previous doctor. I have been with him since trying to get this fixed. He prescribed me the shingles medicine Valtrex. The shingles in the eye are getting better now but the damage which could have been prevented has taken its toll. My left eye is left with a smear, haziness, fog or frost vision which makes it impossible to focus especially with both eyes open. I asked him about a possible cornea transplant and he said the damage was likely too deep in the eye to make a difference. In fact, that could even make it worse. Is this true? I now see two blurry red light traffic signals covered in frost or haze. He said the haze would be permanent. My wife and I are almost retired and wanted to travel before this happened. Please let me know what I can do in this matter or any surgical recommendations? The prognosis for full recovery was bleak when talking to another doctor.","Doctor":"Hello. After going through your history, I understand that you have two concerns. Firstly, what has gone wrong and the second is how to fix it? From what you have mentioned in your query, I can tell that you have at least two problems interfering with your vision. 1. Corneal scarring due to the viral infection of the cornea. This is an end-stage and can be corrected using a corneal transplant. Although the information you have provided is quite detailed, it would be useful to have a photo of your cornea (the round black part of your eye). This is to check for corneal ulcers or scarring. 2. Optic disc damage or glaucoma, I think this may be present as well, it is a common side effect of long term Prednisone and probably why your second doctor said that a corneal transplant will make this worse as the problem is too deep in the eye. Once again, although your description is detailed, glaucoma cannot be ruled out by this limited information. Please send a photo of your doctors reports or at least the intraocular pressure readings. Coming to the cure, corneal scarring can be cured with a corneal transplant. But I am afraid if you have glaucoma, there is no way to get back the vision you lost. All we can hope to achieve is not to let further damage to the disc happen. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

I was having photosensitivity (not too bad), went to a dermatologist, had a blood test and tested positive for ANA 1:160. I was getting eczema on my hands and feet with the sun at the beach (tiny tiny little itchy blisters), but my forearms and calves start to itch with a very slight rash. I was told I essentially had very dry skin. He was not even going to order a blood test but did it just to make sure of blood count. I showed him a picture of a slight rash. The ANA then tested positive. I have to go see a rheumatologist now. I do not have any other symptoms of joint pain, etc. I am pretty healthy. I work out five times a week. I take Atorvastatin for cholesterol, Baby Asprin, Ezetimibe, and Vitamin D. I also have a vitamin D deficiency. I also had a physical four months ago and everything else was fine with the blood work. Everyone told me not to worry, that there are a lot of false positives. I can have an early stage of something and it needs to be monitored. But what am I most likely realistically looking at? How quickly does this get assigned?","Doctor":"Hello. According to history it looks more like the skin is the only one troubling you. I would like to ask you a few more queries. Did your rash resolve after the sun exposure was removed? Do you experience it on a daily basis when exposed to the sun or was it just due to prolonged exposure? How about your other blood test like complete blood count, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and liver function test.  Yes, it is true that ANA (antinuclear antibody) can be a false positive in a lot of people. But we need to be sure that it is not the start of a disease. So only ANA does not give us answers. We need to see if it is causing inflammation in the blood which will be clear from other tests. As per history, it sounds more like a polymorphous light eruption which usually should improve itself. But yes, if your skin is sensitive you should avoid getting prolonged exposures like tat as they can be harmful to the skin."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What do parents need to know about keeping their children safe around water this summer? How to stay safe at a pool (in the water and around the pool area)? How to stay safe at a beach (in the water and on the shore)? What are possible signs of distress or danger parents should look for (extreme exhaustion, coughing, heavy breathing)? What is dry drowning and what to look for? Most important points parents should teach their kids about water safety.","Doctor":"Hello. 1. Staying safe in and around the pool: Avoid taking children between the age of 6 months to 4 years near pools as they may go unnoticed into the pool and may drown. If at all you do take children to the pools make sure they have their floats and other safety equipment on at all times even when out of the pool. Make sure children do not drink the water of the pool.  2. Staying safe in and around a beach: All of the above tips plus be careful of children eating sand. Watch out for sea urchins, crabs and insects that may bite the children. Carry enough water with you and advice the children to drink plenty of water so as to prevent dehydration on a hot sunny day at the beach. 3. Warning signs: Breathlessness, fainting, drowsiness, convulsion.  4. Dry drowning is when water enters the child's nose and upper respiratory airway but does not enter the lungs due to spasm of the upper respiratory tract. Watch out for breathlessness, chest pain and irritability in this case."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What are the benefits of natural remedies for chapped lips? Can almond oil, cucumber, lemon juice, coconut oil, a humidifier, sugar and honey, green tea bags and olive oil be used as natural remedies for chapped lips?

From the last few days, I am suffering from GERD. I feel something is stuck in my throat and even if I take water this feeling never goes. Also, I feel a loud sound in my stomach before and after lunch and formations of gas. I took Reblet D, Eristozyme tables and Sucral O antacids, but did not work. Please suggest me remedy so that I can get received from GERD and the feeling in esophagus.","Doctor":"Hi. Not sure whether the diagnosis of GERD (gastric esophageal reflux disease) is made by you or your physician. By looking at the symptoms it looks like there is increased gastric acid secretion which is giving you the sensation of bloating. Diagnosis of GERD is made if you feel that the gastric acid is regurgitating back and you feel soreness in your mouth especially when lying down. This is because of the relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter pressure. As a result, acid is regurgitating into the esophagus. I suggest you to modify your lifestyle as mentioned below. 1. Avoid spicy and acidic foods. 2. Avoid going to bed immediately after food. A gap of at least one to one and a half hours is recommended. 3. Elevate the head end of the bed to about 30 degrees while sleeping. 4. Avoid smoking and alcohol if you do so. 5. Take small feeds or meals and avoid fatty foods and large meals. 6. Avoid coffee, tea, cold beverages like cola, etc., for a few days. Continue tablet Lansoprazole or Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily for a month. No need to take Domperidone along with these. You can take antacids as and when required but not more than 20 ml per day. If symptoms do not resolve after 30 days give a try for H.Pylori kit (Lansoprazole, Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin) for 14 days. It is readily available with chemists. If the problem still persists, you need to undergo endoscopy to find out the reasons for persistent symptoms and may require surgical intervention. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My husband is a 38-year-old male who smokes and has degenerative disc disease from several car accidents. No real treatment has been given to him aside from chiropractic visits to reveal tension in his lower back. He does have many stresses with work and home life and is seeing a counsellor due to depression. About a month now, he has experienced daily headaches that would not go away. Often his headaches are accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He has light sensitivity. And I am sure also working on a computer adds to it. Often he feels the headache and it is manageable.

Please rate the severity from 0 to 10 where 0 is no headache and 10 is worst headache. Once headache starts it remains for how long? Is there one eye pain, tearing, redness, nasal discharge during headache? Yes, MRI is needed as it is daily headache since 1 month with some odd features.

Still, I would like to get opinion from you as well. My son is 3.5 years old. He has been diagnosed with benign childhood epilepsy. His MRI and CT were normal. There are epileptic form of discharge 8 Hz spikes from right occipital lobe. Usually, he will be conscious and feel involuntary movements in left leg. In severe case, he will lose balance and fall down. This will happen once in a week. We consulted a neurologist and epileptologist here in my place. They prescribed him Topamac 50 mg twice a day and Lobazam 10 mg for three months. I am concerned about the long-term usage of Lobazam. Will it cause any serious side effect? Now with medication he is fine and attends kindergarten school. Please do reply about my concern.","Doctor":"Hi. I went through your query. I can understand your concern about long-term effects of antiepileptic medications. So, in reply to your query, I would like to make suggestions for your son as follows: Treatment of many types of childhood epilepsy requires long-term antiepileptic medications, sometimes for years together. Hence, your doctor (a neurologist) always has to judge the minimum dose that is adequate to prevent seizures and also to take care that the dose does not cause side effects. Dose of most of the drugs in children is decided by weight and not by age. At present, I assume that your son's weight is around 14-15 kg. And the second is please make sure that your son is taking plenty of liquids during the day to avoid a remote risk of developing renal stone. Renal stone is not common, but a possible side effect with Topiramate. Please take all possible measures to avoid factors that may precipitate seizures. Such as avoidance of physical or mental strain, avoidance of excessive hunger, control of fever with proper medications and tepid sponging, etc. Please make sure that all the antiepileptic medications have side effects. So, it is usually the best option to choose proper medications that control seizures as well as do not cause side effects. At present, I would agree with your neurologist's opinion. However, a neurologist is usually the best expert to manage childhood epilepsy. For further information consult a paediatrician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Does MRA show arterioles?

How our skin changes in our 20s, 30s, 40s, and beyond? Also, looking for tips on how to care for our skin. What products we should be used for certain problems? When should we start acid-toning? How about retinol products?","Doctor":"Hi. Our skin undergoes aging process continuously. There are two types of aging going on in an individual. Intrinsic aging that is inherited (in our genes) and the other is extrinsic aging (that is due to environmental factors most importantly the sunlight). With aging, the following things happen across the decades: 1. Collagen in our skin becomes less resulting in wrinkles. The process of degeneration of collagen gets aggravated by the exposure to sunlight due to the formation of reactive oxygen species. 2. Natural moisturizing factor and hydration of skin get low and skin becomes more dry and scaly. 3. Hair follicles in our skin and sebaceous glands also become less with time resulting in few hairs on the body. 4. Elastic tissue becomes less in the skin resulting in crows feet, fine lines, and sagging of skin. 5. Sunlight exposure and extrinsic aging lead to melanin synthesis and freckles, lentigines formation on exposed areas. Skincare: Protection from sunlight is advised. A good sunblock of SPF 60 (sun protection factor) should be used. Vitamin C cream can be used. Plenty of water should be taken. Consuming fresh fruits and vegetables with antioxidant properties are very important. Acid toning can be started around 30 years of age when skin requires rejuvenation. Topical retinoids are very important in skin rejuvenation. They decrease wrinkles, they increase collagen synthesis and give glow and decrease fine lines from the skin."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to know about going off birth control.

As I have to take Metyrapone for Cushing's my doctor recommended stopping Yasmin. But if I stop it, I do not have period for months and I get acne all over my body. What can I use instead of Yasmin in order to control PCOS? Can I get it cured by removing ovaries?","Doctor":"Hello. Metyrapone (Metopirone) is an orphan medication that holds the FDA approval (Food and Drug Administration) for the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome and is occasionally used off-label for short-term treatment of Cushing’s syndrome prior to surgery. Metyrapone prevents cortisol synthesis by inhibiting 11 β-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of deoxycortisol to cortisol. The restricted access and adverse reactions of Metyrapone are associated with increased androgen and mineralocorticoid production, which limits the use of this medication for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome. It can cause a negative feedback increase of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) leading to acne, hirsutism excessive male pattern hair growth, hyperkalemia. However, Yasmin (Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol) is a low dose sequential pill which has been given to regularize your cycles. They really do not actually affect the cortisol levels due to Cushing's and not really interact with Metyrapone either. It is often associated with weight gain. So, for that you may opt for Ginette 35 (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Cyproterone acetate) tablet monthly for next 6 months to regularize cycles and balance hormones. There is no need at all for oophorectomy for PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). It is never indicated. It can be controlled by medication as advised and revised now.

I appreciate your efforts of going into the details about puberty and its effects on the body. You have done quite a bit of research. You only need to understand a few more things. First, not everybody’s body responds the same way to puberty. The genetic makeup has a big influence on it. Your final height depends on your parents’ height, lifestyle diet, physical exercise, and also mildly influenced by the mindset and environmental factors. Generally, boys grow up to 18-20 years of age unless the growth is arrested by early puberty. By your description, your puberty is just setting in, which is normal for the age. Now, your final height will depend on your diet and physical activity.

Why do some people have it? What are some signs someone may have an inferiority complex?","Doctor":"Hello. Inferiority or superiority complex is a term derived from a psychoanalytic perspective in psychology. It is an underlying feeling in a person that one is inferior to others and is inadequate to flourish in life areas. Inferiority complex is developed in people who have negative past experiences such as those who faced criticisms during their childhood from immediate family members, from peers, friends, or other people around in their social circle. Another factor could be the negative thinking style such as those having a personality trait of neuroticism may extract negativity from their environment which may lead to an inferiority complex. There are some signs that indicate someone might have an inferiority complex which includes extremely submissive behavior, lack of self-confidence, people-pleasing behaviors, arrogant attitude, show off regarding their possessions, authoritative behavior at inappropriate places where an individual is not expected to behave in such a way. Such individuals communication and behavior let you feel that they think negatively about people around them for instance other people always try to make one inferior."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My wife has done a PAPP-A screen test and results are 1.9 and hCG level 65.6.

Please explain why this is? And, why bisexuality among men has been so stigmatized in the past? And why it has not seemed to improve, even as people become more accepting of homosexuality?","Doctor":"Hello. Bisexuality is common and a lot of men and women have bisexual orientations at some point in their lives. This does not mean that a person will have homosexual relationship with same sex partner. A person who is happily married might have likings for same sex too. But this has been stigmatized in the past and because of cultural beliefs people never thought of accepting this in public. Since birth an individual is conditioned to behave in a particular manner like boys are supposed to be more active in competitive sports, they are encouraged to be masculine while girls are supposed to be delicate, sophisticated in most countries and most cultures. If a boy behaves like girls he faces many issues like other peers make fun of him. This conditioning is the basis of sexual orientations too. Boys are supposed to have girlfriends and girls have boyfriends. Homosexuality was considered as sin and even a lot of countries still consider homosexuality a crime and is stigmatized. Even these days media and the internet are working to reduce the stigma but in society, people make fun of homosexuals (especially of men). This is the reason things are improving but still, people do not look at bisexuality with good intentions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can I swim while wearing a contact lens? I am looking to connect with an eye doctor who can give advice or insight on this.","Doctor":"Hello. Contact lenses should never be used while swimming. Contact lenses should never come in contact with water and patients are educated to never use water to clean or store lenses. Some people feel that wearing lenses underwater can help them see better, this thought could perhaps have come in the mind of a professional swimmer or coach. But unfortunately wearing contact lenses will not improve vision underwater. The reason for this being that the eye is designed to work on the basis of a difference in the refractive index. To put it in a simple way, the difference in the refractive index between the eye and air is large, hence vision is clear, whereas the difference in refractive index is very small between our eye and water, thus leading to blurred vision. The only way to see clearly underwater is by using watertight swimming goggles, which have a layer of air in front of the eye, thus bringing back the difference in the refractive index. Swimmers with the refractive error may use contact lenses with their swimming goggles. Coming to the harmful effects of contact lens usage in water, the most important being bacterial infections of the cornea, called keratitis. The commonest organism being pseudomonas. Pseudomonas is a very prolific bacteria, this organism is the bane of every ophthalmologist thanks to a special trait it exhibits of boring through an intact and healthy cornea setting up deep-seated hard to cure diseases. The most characteristic organism seen would be acanthamoeba, this organism is ubiquitous and infects untreated swimming pools and many natural water sources like rivers, tanks, lakes, etc., in which people swim in during hiking and outdoor activities. All causes of such a corneal ulcer will need emergency hospital admission and treatment with intensive monitoring for signs of recovery. If at all you are interested in wearing lenses while swimming, the best option would be to use daily disposable lenses which can be disposed after swimming. Rigid lenses mostly will slip off the eye while swimming. Soft lenses usually are retained in the eye but will absorb most of the bacteria, chemicals like chlorine, etc., used for treating the water. This can set up a lot of inflammation and cause redness, irritation and blurred vision. To conclude, I would say that wearing lenses underwater will not help you see well. This blurring underwater can be overcome by wearing swimming goggles, but not by contact lenses. Contact lens use while swimming will only cause serious eye problems and is to be best avoided."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would like to know the benefits of using mineral sunscreen. What is a mineral sunscreen? How does mineral sunscreen differ from the chemical kind? What are the biggest benefits of using mineral sunscreen? What should you look for in a mineral sunscreen if you want to ensure you are getting a formula that is going to be both protective and cosmetically elegant?","Doctor":"Hello. Sunscreen are agents that give protection to the skin against harmful ultraviolet radiation. Of the sun especially UVB (ultraviolet B) radiation that is more harmful. Sunscreen are of two types. Physical sunscreen and chemical sunscreen or sunblocks. Mineral sunscreen is another name for physical sunscreen. Physical sunscreen physically blocks sun ultraviolet radiations and chemical sunscreen absorbs UV radiations and chemically disperse them. Physical sunscreen are zinc oxide, titanium oxide and iron oxide. They are cosmetically unfavorable because they have to be applied thickly and evenly so they are visible on the applied skin whereas chemical sunscreen like octocrylene, etc., are not visible. Mineral sunscreen gives better protection than chemical ones. They reflect the UV light whereas chemical sunscreen absorbs light and has more chance of photoallergy and contact dermatitis. Mineral sunscreen are better in this regard. Various cosmetics are using these mineral sunblock ingredients."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am worried, that I may have come in contact with herpes. I woke up this morning with a small cut like marking on the corner of my mouth. My top lip has a red patchy spot on the inside of the lip. Last night, I drank a ton of alcohol, smoked multiple cigarettes and took ecstasy. Is the symptom possible from that?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Drugs like alcohol, ecstasy, and cigarettes reduce saliva secretion and blood flow to our mouth, lips, and gums. A dehydrated oral cavity is prone to mouth ulcer, cancer sores and the lips tend to get chapped and cracked. This could be a simple mouth ulcer from dry mouth caused by heat due to multiple cigarette smoking or could also be an HSV (herpes simplex virus) infection. Herpes simplex infection of lips spreads through saliva by personal or intimate contact, sharing cigarettes or drinks with the infected person. A clear picture of the ulcer and lip sore will help to diagnose it. Please visit a dentist immediately and get the ulcers examined. Watch for signs of fever, stinging or burning of the ulcer, mucosa, and gums. Treatment is symptomatic if it is a simple mouth ulcer. A topical anesthetic will help control the pain and burning sensation, if present. After an initial examination, if the doctor suspects HSV infection, he will advise you to get a series of lab tests for confirmation. Meanwhile, keep yourself hydrated at all times and maintain good oral hygiene to prevent further infection of the mouth ulcer. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old male.

It looks like a false positive value, mainly cause ANA is negative and ESR and CRP are normal. You are on too high dose of Prednisolone which is not good for bones and psoriasis as well.

I was having three months gap between periods and sometimes was regular before treatment. Now I am 25 years old, married and trying to conceive. So I had stopped Diane 35 last month. Since then we tried naturally for a few months. But it did not work out. So we started with treatments. The doctor initially put me on Ovacare myo and other vitamin E tablets using which I got my periods on time. This continued for a month. Next she put me on Ovacare and Endothik and post 15 days, I was put on Duphaston. This too did not help to conceive. Next, my follicle study was done. I was checked on the 12th day where my follicle was not that matured and ET was just 7. I was called on 15th day which showed my follicle in the left ovary was 19 mm and ET was 10.2 mm. The doctor gave me an HCG trigger injection. I was asked to try in this period. So I and my husband had contact from 14th, 15th, 17th day and also 18th day. I was called on the 18th day which revealed that my follicle had ruptured and it was a fresh one since it has some fluid around it. So since it is confirmed ovulation, I expected my temperature to rise. I had not checked my BBT before but when I did it on 20th day, it showed a temperature of 36.1 celcius. This is way too less right? With HCG shot and ovulation confirmation, I taught it would rise. Is there some issue here? I am given Duphaston and Mbryo safe sachets to be taken. Please advise if this cycle too I do not have any chance?","Doctor":"Hello. The chance of pregnancy in the ovulatory cycle is around 25-30%. As ovulation was confirmed, you have some chance. Rise in basal body temperature is an unreliable predictor of ovulation, and once you had confirmed ovulation by a more reliable test (ultrasound), there was no need to check BBT. Your body temperature does not give any information regarding the quality of ovulation and there is no need to assign any significance to body temperature in your case. As I already told, you have around 25-30% chance in each ovulatory cycle and there is no reason to lose hope. Just get your husband's semen analysis done if not already done, as normal semen is equally important for pregnancy to happen."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 48 years old.

But anyways when he is depressed he tends to have no energy at all to do anything at all and he is always tired and he becomes suicidal. What in your opinion he has? Please tell me the cause. I know he is depressed but why does he tend to be high?","Doctor":"Hi. As per your history, I find that the patient sometimes is high and sometimes depressed. Though some more details about the symptoms are required, however, I may say that the patient is suffering from bipolar affective disorder. As the name suggests it has two poles. The first pole is depression which is very common where the patient feels sad, has decreased energy and pleasure and can have suicidal ideas. The second pole being mania where the patient appears high, they talk continuously, talk high things about themselves, highly energetic. Sometimes they have psychosis associated when they hear some unusual voices in their ears called hallucinations. This condition requires urgent psychiatric intervention."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

ED (erectile dysfunction) is the most common problem nowadays. It is curable. Your PSA (prostate-specific antigen) is absolutely normal. ED can be psychological or organic. Psychological causes are stress, anxiety, and other life problems. Since you had good erections before, I think you have a psychological cause of ED. You should try behavioral therapy (yoga and exercise) to reduce stress. Strictly avoid smoking and alcohol. I am giving pain killers for pain. If things do not improve then, contact a urologist.

Lately, I have been experiencing severe mood swings and have not been myself. One minute I am dancing around the room and could not be happier, the next I am either crying or very angry. Normally, I do not cry and I am usually pretty laid back. I have also been getting dizzy mostly when I stand up or walk up the stairs. I have trouble sleeping and or sleeping too much. I am hungry all the time, however, when I do eat I feel nausea. I have done some research and have found that these symptoms are both common with the injection and also with pregnancy. How do I tell, if these are pregnancy symptoms or if it is because of the Depo shot? I did miss my last shot three months ago. Last month I took a home pregnancy test it came back negative. Will a home test be enough to tell if I am pregnant or not?","Doctor":"Hi. The home pregnancy test is fairly sensitive and very unlikely to miss pregnancy (except in very early pregnancy). If you suspect pregnancy strongly, you can repeat a home pregnancy test again after a week if period does not start. Most of your symptoms can be either due to indigestion or hormonal imbalance (hypothyroidism or estrogen deficiency). You can take antacids Pantoprazole for three to four days and see if symptoms resolve. If your symptoms do not resolve and pregnancy test comes negative, you can do TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) test to rule out hypothyroidism. As you have taken depot for a long time, estrogen deficiency is likely, which can cause all of your symptoms. If possible shift to oral pills for contraception for a few months to avoid the same.

When patients present to me in the hospital with a similar presentation considering your age, family history, I commence them on Statins initially. You should use Statins for atleast a month or two before trying out the option of diet or other natural methods. At your age it is slower to loose weight. So, yes, it is necessary that you use Statins for atleast the first 1 to 2 months till your total cholesterol has dropped to atleast 200 mg/dl before continuing with diet and supplement. Perhaps, Statins rarely have side effects. You do not need stress test now. It is mostly indicated when you are having symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, etc. For now it is not necessary. I advise you take the Statin for a couple of weeks first. You can switch to diet and supplement once your total cholesterol is below 200 mg/dl. Also, countinue with all other medications as prescribed. Hopefully, you will be fine.

He is not getting much issues in walking, in long-distance reading and in anything, but in the eye test report he got -4 and -2.5 spherical numbers in the eyes. Is it a very serious number? I am very tensed as I thought - 4 is a very big number for a child? Will the number increase if he wears glasses constantly? How this much number came as we did his eye checkup at the time of birth as well as at the age of 2. Please assist as we are very tensed for his glasses and number.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your attached photo. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  There are both spherical and cylindrical powers in both of his eyes. This power is large for a 4-year-old boy and I understand your concern. Regarding the cause, the given age, I will say that this power, probably has to do with the pattern of his eye growth. It is a bit longer than normal. Usually, the most intelligent people who are bit more mature than the rest have to develop such a thing. Another important cause is seeing things by holding them very close (for example: phone, books, etc.), near work increases myopia. But nobody can exactly predict what the cause could be. Regarding progression, even if he wears the glasses regularly, there could be variations in his power. As I said, this power is due to the lengthening of the eyeball and the eyeballs keep growing as he grows. This is the reason why your doctor would have called you back for a follow up every six months or every year. Wearing glasses constantly helps in preventing complications like cross eyes (squint) and amblyopia (lazy eye). Amblyopia is a condition where, due to weakness of the visual nerve and brain vision centers, the patient can no longer see the smallest letters even with the maximum power, this can hamper his chances of getting into a few jobs like armed forces, etc. So, the best course of action would be: 1. Stop seeing things from close by(avoid mobile phones, computers and read books from as far away as possible). 2. Do not rub the eyes (this can increase the cylinder power). 3. Wear glasses constantly to prevent complications like squint and amblyopia. 4. Do not miss follow-ups and consult your ophthalmologists in case of a sudden dip in vision. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 38 years old and my wife is 36 years old. We are married for the last two years and trying for a baby for the last one year almost. By our gynecologist advise we underwent an IUI cycle which resulted in missed abortion at seven weeks due to no growth of fetus after five weeks. D & C done and karyotype of abortion showed a chromosomal abnormality. Remarks as below: Aborted fetus karyotype, 69, XXX G-banded metaphase shows triploidy. Wife's condition: a) Age: 36 years no issue yet. b) Has a subserous uterus fibroid of size 68 x 62 mm and bulky uterus. c) Had thyroid and she takes Thyroxin 50 mg every day. Last TSH is 1.48. d) Sugar is under control and TBC is normal. e) In childhood she had one occurrence of epilepsy. Husband's condition: a) Age: 38 years. b) Nonsmoker and non-drinker. c) semen analysis result is normal (normal fertile specimen). d) Shaving a bit high uric acid in the last one year (under medicine). Karyotyping results of partners: Husband: 46, XY G banded metaphase shows normal karyotype. Wife: 46, XX high frequency of G-banded metaphase shows telomeric association of chromosomes 1, 3, 16 & X. My questions are is it possible that after fibroid removal she can conceive a baby in a normal way? Can there be any bad effect on baby's health (physical and mental) due to the DNA abnormality found in her report?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. 1. As far as the subserous nature of the fibroid is concerned which is around 7cm x 6 cm, it per se is not going to have an effect or cause hindrance in conception but it is likely that it can cause problems during the pregnancy and in the late third trimester due to abdominal pain. So, it is advisable that it should be removed anyways as the size is a concern here and can cause incoordinate uterine contractions during labor later and also chances are that it would further grow under estrogen effect. Hence better get it removed. 2. As the fetus showed triploidy XXX G banded metaphase, which as per the mother's report, she has high chances of replication of similar results in future pregnancies as well which may not be compatible with life and likely missed abortions may occur in future. Hence, it is suggested that both of you should try for an IVF (in vitro fertilization) with ovum and sperm harvesting and in vitro fertilization of the egg by your sperm and subjecting the embryos to preimplantation genetic screening with FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) technique or PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), before selecting the embryo for transplanting into the uterus. Though the frequency of G banded metaphase telomeric association is high for 1, 3, 16 and X chromosome, the chances of the fetus getting triploidy are very high. Another best option for you as a couple would be to opt for a donor egg from another woman which can be fertilized in vitro by your sperm and then the embryo after pre implantation genetic screening can be implanted in your wife's womb to improve the chances of having a healthy conception. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from a disease called uveitis and I visit a doctor every six to seven months for injecting Kenacort 40 mg on each eye when needed or when the inflammation starts again.

I want to know that if I travel to some countries the vision loss occurs sometimes or the effect of injection comes to an end. Can this injection be injected anywhere around the world? Please guide what would be the procedure for that? I am currently taking Deltacortril and Cellcept.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that you are suffering from uveitis and are on antiglaucoma drops and previously were on immune suppressive tablets. I feel that you may be suffering from an underlying disease that is hampering your immune system, we call these as autoimmune disorders. The ideal solution to these problems, in general, would be to find out the cause for this immune disorder and treat it. This can be done using blood tests for substances called antibodies (Ab), following which specific treatment can be instituted. Injection Kenocort (Triamcinolone) is an emergency measure employed in case of severe cases not responding to treatment. These injections cannot be given on a regular basis as they cause complications like cataract and worsening of glaucoma. Kenocort injection is available in most places around the world, but the guidelines for doctors in different countries may vary and some may not choose to perform this procedure in view of the side effects.

Anyway, over two of the teeth the dentist said there was an infection. I did not get any antibiotics, but she cleaned the area after. There is a lot of swelling in that area, and the gums are real red and like an ulcer. But not much pain. Is this normal? How do I know if it is infected or dry socket? Or anything else it could be?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the photos. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Nothing to worry about. For the swelling give cold pack from the outside of the extraction area. Do not spit or rinse the mouth for a day. Drink lots of water to keep yourself hydrated. Do not suck anything such as ice cubes, using a straw to have liquid, etc., because it will lead to dislodgement of the blood clot. Do not see the extraction site every time, it will heal in seven to ten days. After 24 hours of extraction rinse your mouth with lukewarm saline water three to four times a day, it will help in healing. Do not smoke or chew tobacco. Do not drink alcohol or sodas. Have semi-solid food for two to three days. Dry socket is caused by the dislodgement of the blood clot from the extraction socket. In your case, white color flim is there that clot is covering the socket. Wait for one more day, if the swelling does not reduce consult your dentist.

OD +0.75 -0.50 x070 OS +0.75 -0.50 x010. These are computer reading glasses. Is it normal, if things are blurry at a distance (even three feet starts to look weird)? On reading online, I read this as slightly farsighted with slight nearsighted astigmatism in both eyes. How is that possible?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. In the prescription you have mentioned, there are two components, the spherical (+0.75) and the cylindrical (-0.5 at axes 70 & 10 respectively). The important thing to note here is that reading glasses per se are given to people above 40 years of age. In your case, I feel that this power is probably your distance correction. The doctor might have felt that they may be a bit cumbersome to wear all the time, and would have given a small magnitude of power and probably have told you only to put them on during intense visual activities like watching computers, reading books, etc. An accurate way to say whether these were meant for distance or for reading is to recall how you were tested at the doctor's office in the first place. Suppose they made you sit at a distance and asked you to read out the letters on a screen then these are distance vision glasses. If they had tested the power by giving you a book in your hand and asked you to read it, then these would be reading glasses. So, coming back to your question, firstly, reading glasses are meant only for distances around 33 cm from you for the books and around 100 cm for the computers and you would not be able to see beyond this. Second, the far-sighted power of +0.75 is determined by the length of your eyeball. In case of far sightedness, the eyeballs are shorter compared to normal and in near sightedness, they are longer. The astigmatic power is determined by the curvature of your cornea. In your case (myopic astigmatism) the corneas are steeper at axes of 70 and 10 degrees respectively compared to the rest of the cornea. In Hypermetropic astigmatism, they are flatter in that particular meridian compared to the rest of the cornea. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Currently I take Eutirox 75 mg and have for about a year, before that I took 50 mg. Ever since 6-8 months (I am not sure about the timeframe) I have had issues with extreme sweating under armpits, for example I am in a 22ºC room and start sweating insanely, I go outside lay on the hot sun and I stop sweating. 2 minutes after putting on a shirt there are considerable sweat marks on my armpits, 10 minutes after it is a huge sweat mark. It is also irregular, some days it is crazy other days not so much. I have never had issues with sweat, ever. On the right side of my head I now have ~8 white hair that definitely were not there a year ago, even 6 months ago it was just ~2 hairs. Attached are my lab results, the doctor said it was normal, However, during the conversation I said my breakfast was a couple eggs, sometimes pancakes, and fresh juice, he replied it should be milk and bread, so I have began looking for another doctor for that reason. What can I do to find the best doctor and would it be ok for me to go back to Eutirox 50 mg while I look for a new doctor or can this cause a serious issue? X-ray resume says the following (translated by me): Thyroid with normal dimensions, right lobe measuring 14 x 50x13mm, and the left lobe 13 x 53 x 12mm, with lobutlated shape. Its ecostructure is diffusely heterogeneous with multiple areas hipoecogenic poorly defined, aspects to which is associated the increase of vascularisation on the Doppler color study, changes compatible with thyroiditis. Near the inferior pole of the left Lobe some reactive ganglionic can be observed, the biggest measuring about 11 x 5 mm.","Doctor":"Hi. You are sweating due to the increased dose of Eutirox and that is perfectly normal and expected in a person with thyroiditis being treated with medication. This only means that you are being correctly treated with respect to your thyroid function. The few white hair that you noted could be due to stress that you have in your day to day life or simply without any reason they can occur. They have nothing to do with your thyroid function. Your breakfast is good but maybe the doctor meant to decrease the calories. I do not see anything that should make you search another doctor but ofcourse it is your right to do so if you wish.

On bed rest, analgesics, got Depomedrol 80 mg shot, Pregabalin, Methycobalamine and oral Medrol. Have not got any muscular weakness or UMN signs. Mild parasthesia in thumb and index finger of right hand. Pain has decreased by around 30-40 percent since it started 10 days back and I am not taking any NSAIDS for last 2 days. I have got a few concerns. Do these changes occur at this age (43 years)? How bad are the degenerative changes? Any need of surgical intervention? How much time usually it takes for complete resolution of acute episode? Is it going to be a trouble in future as well? I mean repeat episodes or further complications. What should be the life style changes after resolution of acute episode (you know the nature of a pediatrician’s job)? If at all surgery is required in future (further canal stenosis causing cord compression), how risky is the surgery and how are the results?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your medical history and the attached reports in detail (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It does not seem to be a serious matter at present. Yes neuropathies are common at this age. Usually, it takes around 3 to 4 weeks for an acute episode to resolve depending on the symptoms. If proper care is taken (avoiding use of pillow, avoiding lifting heavy weights, neck exercises) usually symptoms do not recur. At present there is no need of surgery. You are doing pretty well and recovering fast. Use cervical soft collar and take analgesics for atleast 10 days. Get a repeat MRI after 3 months. Well, decompression surgery is risky and has side-effects and should better be avoided."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Recently been concerned about a carbon monoxide leak in my pick-up. Recently after a 3-hour interstate drive, I stopped and did a carboxyhemoglobin blood test, the results came back at 2.3 %. I felt that was on the high side of normal, so I took it to another exhaust place, he claimed it had a small leak, and repaired it. so this past week we took it on another 3 hour drive. This time my wife and I both tested again, mine came back at 2.2 and the wifes at 2.8 %. Is this normal after driving this distance or should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  Carboxyhemoglobin level is raised by various reasons, and the inhalation of carbon monoxide is one of the reason. Our body has many mechanism to increase carboxyhemoglobin level. For you and your wife, the level is normal, and nothing to worry. Lab to lab variation, intra-instrumental variation human physiological variations are the reason for different values at different time points. In case of carbon monoxide poisoning, breathing difficulties, bluish discoloration of body (blood) are commonly seen. In such case just inhalation of fresh air can be helpful. In such cases the carboxyhemoglobin level is higher (than your levels). So I suggest to leave the worry. Go for brisk walking in fresh air daily and practice pranayama to balance the carboxyhemoglobin levels. If you want to repeat the blood test, can be done after some days. If the value is not doubled (below the doubled level), then it is normal. If values are doubled or more, only then it is the toxic influence."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Since I came off the pill 14 months ago, I have had lots of issues: black, brown, smelly spotting, irregular periods, severe pain, severe fatigue, been to the emergency department many times with different issues (stomach bleeding, severe stomach pains, lightheadedness, back and neck ache, etc.). I developed a headache about 6 months ago, MRI showed a pituitary microadenoma, have been to endocrinologist but he has ruled out hormonal reasons and sent me away saying another MRI will be done in 6 months and have referred me to a fertility specialist. I cannot live like this, severe stomach issues, cannot eat properly, diarrhea, severe headaches 2 weeks leading up to periods, have lost 5 kg within 5 months, severe fatigue, no energy for anything, palpitations, any exercise makes me very lightheaded.

Microadenoma and hormonal imbalance are two separate issues actually those can cause different symptoms, need different investigations, precautions and treatments. It would be better if you could send me your detailed reports. Adenoma related issues need to be consulted with endocrinologist on regular basis. For rest of the medical issues need to be consult with consultant general physician to sort out for every symptom. Have some counseling sessions with pshychaitrist to help feel emotionally balanced. For irregular periods have transvaginal scan and blood tests on day 2 of periods (testosterone, progesterone, prolactin, insulin, FSH and LH , thyroid function tests), high vaginal swab, cervical smear.

I have tested it at in daylight and also during night time numerous times, I just see the same. I tried to look for the cause myself, but it came to a dead end. Thanks for taking the time. I have put the prescription changes down below for some more details. Right eye Left eye: Sph -3.50 Sph -3.50 Cyl x Cyl -0.50 Axis x Axis 175 Vis. 0.85 Vis. 0.85. After eight months: Right eye Left eye: Sph. -4,00 Sph. -4,25 Cyl. -0.50 Cyl. -0.75 Axis 175 Axis 175 Vis. 0.80 Vis. 0.78.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to icilniq.com. From your attached prescription, I can tell you that there is a very definite change in the power of your glasses and also in the amount of how much you can see. The best to make that difference stand out, that you can do yourself is to cover each eye and look through the other, ideally at an object or letter just visible to normal people around six meters or 20 feet away. You can also try this in different levels of light just as you have compared before. The impression I get from your prescription is that while your myopia has increased in both the eyes, there has been some decrease in the amount of vision in both your eyes. That is to say that the power has increased and the amount you see has come down. As always, testing of glasses is a subjective assessment and varies depending on your suggestion and the optometrist performing the test. In case you are not happy with your current glasses you can always return to the same place for a re-check. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30-year-old male.

Doctor said I cannot take laser or ICL surgery but can have ReLex Smile for that power. But it also needs some cornea tissues which is a risk factor for glaucoma. I do not know what to do now? Which treatment is better for me and the doctor just gave normal lubricant drops? Is there any treatment for me for refractive surgery by controlling eye pressure?","Doctor":"Hi. How much is your eye pressure? Did the doctor measure it with an instrument that puffs out air at you or was it a blue light instrument that he used to touch your eye with? From what you have told me, I understand that you are interested in refractive surgery. But the doctor refused to operate on you saying your pressures are high and that your power is too high for lasik. It is true that your power is on the higher end of the patients we usually consider for surgery so doing lasik and PRK (photorefractive keratectomy) is not possible on the eye with -9D but can be done on the eye with -2 and -1.5D. Putting an ICL (implantable contact lens) in your eye might increase your eye pressure. So I will not recommend that. ReLex SMILE can be tried in both your eyes if the surgeon is confident. I am guessing that he would have asked you to come for a follow up to re-check pressures. If the pressures were too high, he would have asked for visual fields and a few other tests for glaucoma. In either case, it all depends on the surgeon's experience and your eye pressures. If you can tell me about your eye pressure and your vision in each eye with -9D and -2/-1.5D, I could help you better."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

How often does re-admission occur? How to prevent this?","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding the care of non-cardiac surgeries in cardiac patients, If you are suffering from cardiac problems such as previous heart attack, heart failure, any cardiac valve problem you have to take cardiac fitness before surgery. If fit, then go for surgery. After the surgery you can take rest as advised by your surgeon. If the cardiac issue is stable, there is no need to reassess the cardiac problem. If cardiac problems, such as heart failure, worsens then you may need echocardiography and other related investigations. Regarding medicines, ask your surgeon not to prescribe you medicines that have a high amount of sodium, which may worsen your cardiac or hypertensive problems. You may take a low sodium diet and may start light exercise according to your surgeon. Regarding cardiac surgery: 1. For pain relief, you may take a pain killer for wound-related pain. 2. Gradually increase level of activity upto six to eight weeks. You may drive then also. 3. Eat a low sodium diet. Do not eat up to full stomach. Eat small amounts mutiple times per day. Readmission depends upon complications that may develop such as wound infection, heart failure, heart attack due to blockage of the grafted vessels after bypass surgery. If a heart valve is implanted, it may get stuck and it causes sudden worsening of symptoms. Some times bleeding may occur due to unmonitored blood thinners. To avoid: 1. Do not stop medicines on your own. 2. Keep monitoring clotting profile, in case blood thinner such as Warfarin is prescribed. 3. Take a low sodium diet. 4. Avoid excessive exertion just after surgery. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 30 years old. I have always been a bit clumsy and a slow learner. I easily get lost in details given to me and go completely blank. I had a hard time understanding maths but I do alright in languages. As time passes, I have become increasingly clumsy and have poor eye-muscle coordination. This is making me frustrated at myself. What could be the reason?","Doctor":"Hi. I can only answer in broad terms as there so many things that could lead to the symptoms you are describing. Then I can put you in the direction medically you should follow going forward. 1) The fact that you note you have always been a clumsy person and it worsening now indicates that your problem has been a chronic long term one that seems to be progressively with time.  2)You mention you were a slow learner and that you are still having cognitive (thinking, learning, memory) up unto this day shows me you that there is definitely something wrong and needs to be medically investigated. Some unknown, uninvestigated cognitive problem since early childhood has been missed and caused serious harm to your life. And it is not your fault, you were a child, and it is the clear responsibility of the adults in your life to note the problems and take them further. 3) There is an entire range of things that could be causing your symptoms from undetected, poor hearing, vision or a specific learning disability or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but also including a huge range of psychiatric, neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms. 4) Then the fact that your neurological motor or sensory functioning (poor eye muscle coordination) has been affected and your feeling clumsy has also been since childhood. That difficulty (been chronically clumsy) from childhood to adulthood and was never investigated further, should be not an acceptable way of schooling or raising children. 5)So, the bottom line is that now you need to take control and investigate these symptoms. Kindest rest further to at least know the cause of serious problems. The doctor I would send you to first is a neurologist or a neuropsychiatrist. They can examine you for the right medical investigations like blood tests of x-rays and CT scans, etc. They should be able to put a possible diagnosis together and all of these symptoms can be explained and understood. Consult a neurologist as soon as possible. Follow up according to neurologist advise."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 26 years old. For the last 10 years, I am suffering from very weak hand grip strength. At the age of 16 it started and grip strength was negligible for like four years. Then I started working out with hand grippers and the condition has improved a lot. There is no pain or numbness but still, at times, I feel my gripping strength is very weak and when I perform exercise it improves for the time being as I can feel the blood rushing inside the hands. My query is that does masturbation has any link with this because I have noticed often that after performing the act the situation starts getting worse as in there is very less blood flow in hands and I feel very low gripping strength. I have no issue in lifting weights eg. bench press and there is no pain while doing any kind of lifts. Please guide me on my condition.","Doctor":"Hello. There is no link between masturbation and handgrip weakness. The cause of your hand grip weakness needs to evaluate further. You need an in-person neurologist consultation face to face because we need to examine your strength, reflexes, sensations of your hands. Is the weakness is more on the right or left? Do legs are involved or not? After a thorough physical examination only we can advise MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) cervical spine or nerve conduction study.

The labor was a very traumatic experience with having to be induced and trying natural labor which failed due to her turning on her back at the last minute so we had to go to the theatre to have a forceps delivery which also failed and we ended up having an emergency C section. We know due to the birth trauma she has suffered damage to her neck muscles and can only look to her right and finds it very difficult and painful to turn her head. We are currently visiting the physiotherapist to help her neck, which we have been told it can take a long time to repair. But the other things we are concerned about are the way she looks at objects i.e. curtains and light fittings and bursts out screaming also. She will be sleeping peacefully and all of a sudden jump out of her arms and legs in the air and screams and cries until she is blue in the face.

Due to abnormal neck position and pain, she may find it difficult to see around. Please continue physiotherapy and follow her and if the pain is more you can give Paracetamol for pain relief.

As a precautionary measure, a contralateral orchidopexy was also done. This involving a part so intimately connected to me shattered me a lot and I am recovering slowly from that mental trauma. Besides, the fear of a retorsion in the left one and its subsequent loss keeps lingering. I am also concerned about orchidectomy's impacts on my fertility and hormonal levels. Can you please allay my fears? Also, my surgeon's report says, \\"The left scrotum was exposed, left testis exposed, very mild hydrocele, eversion of sac done using 4.0 monofilament suture, left lateral wall of testis fixed with 4.0 monofilament suture at two points, skin closed\\". Is this fine? Why was the sac everted? And what about the hydrocele? I have heard the 4.0 monofilament used was absorbable. If so, then how can those two sutures on the left testis prevent it from further torsion? Will there be some tissue formation eventually that will hold the testis in place? Or is it because by then the testis will get naturally attached to gubernaculum? As I presume the sutures were made into tunica albuginea. However, I read somewhere that this might have impact on sperm production. Is it true? Lastly, can I by any means, ascertain whether my left buddy is fine at home? By physical examination? Does the presence cremasteric reflex always rule out a possibility of necrosed testis?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. First of all, relax and do not worry at all. We had done orchidectomy due to torsion in many patients. They are absolutely fine and doing well physically as well as mentally. Having one testis remaining is perfectly fine. You will have no problem regarding sperm production or testosterone levels. Your left testis can produce enough sperms for fertilization (only one sperm is required for fertilization). The surgeon has done a perfectly good job in the right testis. Eversion of the sac was done for hydrocele so that in future you do not develop hydrocele. Also, fixation with 4.0 monocryl is perfect. It just requires fixation at two points so that is cannot twist in the future. If suture are absorbable also no problem as it will cause fibrosis at the suture site so your testis remains fixed in the correct position. So do not worry, everything is fine."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 24-year-old female. I am married for about 11 months. My weight is 77 kg and height is 5.4\\".

I started on Entocort, three days later I have severe swelling in feet and ankles. I am fatigued the next day. On the seventh day, I had swelling of lips and a strange feeling in the throat. I called the doctor and he stopped the medication. My blood report shows: Hemoglobin - 3.6 g/dL, RBC - 1.38 million/mm3, Iron - 11, Saturation - 3. Fecal stool sample postive. I went to the ER, I was given two units of blood. My hemoglobin raised to 7.5 the next day. I was discharged. Endoscopy was performed and my biopsy report is negative. I had minor stomach inflammation. My next bloodwork shows Hemoglobin - 8.1 g/dL, RBC - 3.05 million/mm3, Iron - 51, Saturation 12. Vitamin B12 - 648. Immunoglobulins A and G are pretty low. Gastroenterologist says need to do small cap endoscopy to see if there is bleeding in the small intestine. My new stool sample results are not back yet, but stools have not been dark. What other tests need to be done to determine the cause of anemia? List the possible that medication caused anemia since I had such a severe reaction. Current medications: No prescription, only supplements. Vitamin D3, CoQ 10, Methyl B12, and Curcumin.","Doctor":"Hi. Entocort (Budesonide) is a corticosteroid. It is very unlikely to cause anemia, especially to the extent that you had. What was your hemoglobin prior to the colonoscopy? If it was near normal and then dropped to 3.6, that would be a huge drop. If you had gastrointestinal bleeding leading to such a huge drop in hemoglobin in a short span of time, I would expect that you would have noticed the blood in your stool. Minor bleeding over longer periods can lead to anemia, and in those cases, serum ferritin (a storage form of iron) would be low. Acute blood loss anemia usually does not cause serum ferritin to drop. Did you have a serum ferritin level done along with your other iron studies? If the serum ferritin is less than 15, it is almost definitely iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is either due to dietary reasons or blood loss. Dietary iron deficiency is rare in developed countries. So, blood loss has to be ruled out. If no obvious reason is identified on upper GI endoscopy or colonoscopy, then small bowel pathology has to be ruled out by capsule endoscopy. Other reasons for a rapid drop in hemoglobin would be hemolysis (where the red blood cells are destroyed for various reasons). This would be diagnosed by tests like: 1. Peripheral blood smear 2. Serum haptoglobin 3. Direct and indirect bilirubin 4. Direct Coomb's test 5. LDH (lactic acid dehydrogenase). Please attach any reports you have with you. That may help me give you a better answer."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I tested negative for ANA but positive for anti-dsDNA.

You are right. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are specific for SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), especially if the titers are high. Ankylosing spondylitis does not give you any kind of antibodies. Anti-smith antibodies are the most highly specific antibodies for lupus, but only a small percentage of people with lupus have them. Did you get that test? But it is strange that your ANA (antinuclear antibody) was negative. Anti-dsDNA is a type of ANA. I believe it is a false positive. A normal sedimentation rate essentially rules out inflammatory pathology. Lupus is an inflammatory disease. To begin with, we need to know more about your symptoms. SLE is diagnosed based on the symptoms and signs along with laboratory tests. It is not diagnosed just on the basis of an antibody test. You can get false positive tests (positive test in the absence of disease). So please get back to me with details of your symptoms. Based on the information you gave, I do not think you have lupus. There are no blood tests that can diagnose ankylosing spondylitis (AS). HLA-B27 is more common in people with AS, but it is not diagnostic. AS diagnosis needs clinical and radiological criteria. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

He is currently a freshman at a University and was doing well for the first two months. Last month he went back home and was returning back to the University and that is when he started feeling homesick. During the journey, he felt for a moment that he going back to an unsafe place. This feeling was because of a crime movie that was shot in the city his university is in. That made him feel uncomfortable and at the same time the results of his mid term were told to him and he misinterpreted them and thought he scored less, but the real scores were very good and he did the best among his class. But he was affected by all these thoughts throughout the journey and right now he fights homesickness and is scared about the place he lives in and also checks continuously if he is able to understand what he is being taught in the class rather than listening to the class. I am scared for him and his future.","Doctor":"Hi. His current symptoms are also probably due to OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder). He has fear due to a crime scene of a movie and is feeling very homesick. This is happening because of severe anxiety due to OCD. If he has never consulted a psychiatrist then he should visit for evaluation. Fluoxetine or Fluvoxamine which are SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) drugs are the drug of choice for severe OCD. The drugs help to control OCD symptoms in about four to six weeks. For very severe symptoms low dose antipsychotics can also be used. Visit a psychiatrist for help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 24 years old. I had my kidney stone removed a year ago for causing mild hydronephrosis at my right kidney. During the treatment, I was exposed to full of radiation, abdominal CT scan, lithotripsy, fluoroscopy, and another fluoroscopy during stent insertion. I am not sure how the doctor manages the radiation. I did my treatment abroad and it is not really a well-developed country. He might not even care bout it. I studied some about radiation when I was in dental school so I am very scared of the side effects. So if I am to have another case of hydronephrosis, should I just remove the kidney rather than undergoing such radiation which may cause me high risk of future cancer? Because as you can see, I am still so young and I just started my career. What do you suggest? Do the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa? Is there another less risky treatment in terms of radiation? How about invasive treatment? Is the risk higher aside from the slow healing? And I am serious about the removal if indeed it has lower radiation risk, even though I know kidney is very important. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. There are enough studies and literature which prove that though there is radiation exposure during CT (computed tomography) scan in the removal of kidney stone it is in low dose and chances of cancer do not increase. So do not worry about that. I do not think removing kidney to escape from radiation exposure is a good option. You should not think of that. If there is again stone formation then there is a treatment called ultrasound-guided lithotripsy (ESWL) which can break your stone from outside without any radiation exposure. So you can do ESWL (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy) if required later but no need to remove the kidney."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been having off and on ear pressure in my right ear and have some cold symptoms the last 1.5 weeks (chillish), runny nose, body aches, etc. My kids have battled the cold as I have my office. I noticed my right submandinbular lymph node was slightly swollen. I went to my GP and he prescribed antibiotics which has not helped. I have had sinus issues in the past. I noticed that my right tonsil is bigger than the other, which is the side of the pressure and lymph node. Can a viral illness cause one-sided swelling? Could this be tonsil cancer? I go to the dentist every six months whom I assume checks out my tonsils. I am concerned it is one sided. My throat has not really been that sore.","Doctor":"Hello. I went through the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It seems you have inflamed tonsils. One side does appear to be larger and more red than the other. It does not mean you got tonsil cancer. It is a routine infection that needs strong antibiotics. The symptoms with regards ear, swollen node, etc., all signify infection. How many days Amoxicillin course has been completed? What dosage did you take? Did you take any gargles along with the antibiotics? Any nasal or oral decongestants? Any nasal sprays? Did the GP check the insides of the ear using an otoscope? Usually, when one has tonsillitis or pharyngitis the pain gets radiated to the ear and sometimes the infection also passes into the ear through the eustachian tube causing fullness and swelling inside the ear. The nearest nodes also get swollen when the infection is severe. I would suggest you take a course of Clarithromycin appropriate for your weight for 5 days and take Betadine or Benzydamine gargles. Take Otrivin nasal spray for five days and steam inhalation. If the infection is not subsiding and the nodes are increasing in size you may need some blood tests and possibly intravenous antibiotics. Do you smoke or drink? What sort of a diet do you consume? Is there any fever or weakness alongside?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Would dry eyes cause cloudy vision with little nonmoving black dots? This is my normal vision and every once in a while I can see perfectly. The eye doctor said everything in the eye looks perfect. I have noticed when I sleep one eyelid does not close all the way but this is the vision in both eyes. I did have a vitrectomy in one eye and the other is still in need of cataract surgery.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, dry eyes can cause blurring of vision. As you said you feel your one eye is not closed properly while sleeping, so there is a greater chance of getting cornea dry and can lead to exposure keratopathy. But you have not mentioned any history of stroke or Bell's palsy? Did you have any? Did your doctor notice that you are unable to close one eye properly? Your BMI (body mass index) is also high so with obesity, there is a condition related to floppy eyelid in which eyelids are more elastic and get everted while sleeping that can also cause dry eyes. You said you had vitrectomy in one eye. Please explain why was that advised? Are you having diabetic retinopathy or you had a vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment? Or you had similar black spots in that eye too? These black spots in vision may also be due to vitreous liquefaction and condensation, which is age related problem. Jelly in the back of your eye starts becoming liquid after 50 years of age. So you can use artificial tear drops or dry eye and the eye you feel does not close properly. You can also patch your eye while sleeping with simple tape. So that your cornea does not get dry out. Your eye doctor is doing a great job. He has examined your eyes so he knows better and he will do the best. You can discuss with him if anything missed like if you have not told him about incomplete closure of the eye during sleep."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have an 18-month-old daughter. My daughter has had trouble with her bowels since she was 8 months old, she finds it impossible to do a normal stool. She strains and screams to the point, she falls asleep from exhaustion and still does not pass stool. She does have a regular bowel movement but she is in constant pain while doing it. Her stool has got to the point of having blood in it. I have taken her to numerous doctors and tried just about everything possible to help her. Her current specialist has given her the same medicine which I have stated does not work. It does not matter what the dosage is. I have contacted him to tell him it does not work and he has just said to change her to another type of laxative. Laxatives do not work for her. I feel it is something more serious. So I was just wondering if you could take the time out to give me some advice on what I could do or what might be wrong with my daughter. I cannot handle watching her be in pain anymore.","Doctor":"Hi. She has chronic constipation. As you have noticed blood she also may have fissure in anus due to which she has extreme pain. Give her lots of water and a high fiber diet. Dry fig milkshake, dates, and prunes in any form help a lot. Give either one of them every day along with fruits and vegetables. You can try lactulose suppository for a few days which may prove more effective than syrup. Secondly, make her sit in a tub of lukewarm water with few drops of Savlon put on it. This is called a sitz bath which will help if there is fissure (wound due to peeling of skin in the anal area). Do this three times a day. Also, encourage her to pass stools immediately after every meal as it is the ideal time to try when bowels are in action for the digestion of food. If you do not find any improvement in five to seven days, please consult a pediatric surgeon to check the fissure and investigate further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30-year-old female. I do not have any medical issues that could associate with my problem. About a month ago I woke up to pain and stiffness in my neck and shoulders. I figured I just slept wrong or something little like that. But every single night since then, I have been woken up by the pain during nights. I cannot lay in any position where I put pressure on them and it only happens at night or while resting or laying down for more than an hour. It started with just my neck and shoulders. But gradually it has turned into pain and stiffness in my neck, shoulders, elbows, hands (which includes swelling in my fingers), hips and now my knees. It only happens when I lay down for long periods and gradually disappears during the day with movement and activities. It is also disrupting my sleep every night in which I barely get for three to four hours altogether. I have tried taking Naproxen before laying down for the night and using a heating pad at night to avoid these issues, but it is not helping. My question is, what is wrong with me and how can I reduce or stop the pain and stiffness?","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms you have explained points towards arthritis. It can be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis depending on the joints involved and the duration of morning stiffness. Usually, in rheumatoid arthritis, morning stiffness remains for more than 45 minutes and joints of the hands involved are middle joint and the joint which connects your finger with hand. Osteoarthritis morning stiffness relieves in less than 30 minutes in the morning and the joint involved are the distal joints of your fingers. The tests which you can go for to confirm are a rheumatoid factor, CRP (C-reactive protein), x-ray of the joints. The medications which can be used to relieve the symptoms are NSAIDs (non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs), steroids to relieve the inflammation and DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) like Methotrexate, Sulphasalazine, etc. Surgery is another option here which you can talk to your doctor after confirmation of the diagnosis. I hope this helps. X-ray of the joints, CRP, Rheumatoid factor. Osteoarthritis, gout."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 34 years old. I have had pain in both of my legs when sitting for about 12 years. The pain starts 15 minutes after sitting and it is pretty bad. There are itchy and burning pain between my calves and ankles and it feels like my legs are squeezed in this area. At the same time, there is dull and a kind of bursting pain in the feet and dull and itchy pain in the back and the middle of upper legs (nothing in the buttocks). Sometimes there are tingling sensation starting in the middle of upper downwards. It feels like I need to raise my feet a little bit from the floor and move them all the time. There was minor varicose vein removed on my right leg (no more visible veins there since then) and you can see the vein on my left leg but they are not varicose. When I stand up it feels like 70-90% of the pain is gone. There is no pain when I walk. Also, there is a tingling sensation when I lay down and bend my knees, so I feel these sensations from knees downwards. It feels like there is a problem with circulation but why it starts straight away after sitting? I know some people who have pretty bad veins on legs but they do not have that bad pain like me. It drives me crazy. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Leg pain can have so many causes but from your history of aching after sitting suggest a possibility of DVT (deep vein thrombosis). DVT is the formation of a blood clot in a deep leg vein (blood vessel). The pain is typically a burning or cramping sensation. Immobility is one of the cause of this. Immobility results in slow blood flow from the leg to the heart. Slow blood are more likely to clot than normal. Now you have to consult a surgeon immediately and do a doppler study of both legs to check the blood flow. They will provide you with medicines."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For a while now I have had a terrible odor that comes out my mouth and nose. The odor is somewhat subtle whenever I am not around a fan, AC, etc. But whenever I am around one of those, the smell seems to spread all around me. I am positive the smell is coming from inside my stomach. I have realized a lot about leaky gut and candida but neither one mentions a smell. My diet before has been poor, lots of packaged sugary foods, but I have always been a healthy weight. I feel terrible riding in a vehicle with others. I will sometimes hold my breath to try and stop the smell but it does not work most of the time. My symptoms started when I was a working nightshift job. Stress might have been a factor although I did not feel like I was. I have not worked there for almost six months and my condition has worsened. Could the amount of sugar I consumed destroyed my stomach lining? I also heard when Candida is starved it digs into the lining and essentially makes holes which can cause food to leak. Could this be the source of the smell? I am currently taking probiotics.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  There is nothing like leaking gut in the medical dictionary. The bad breath you are experiencing, in medical terms is called halitosis. It is majorly because of poorly kept oral hygiene. It could be an indicator of gum infection, tooth decay, smoking, alcohol, etc. Sometimes it is because of organized infection of tonsils. My suggestion is to consult a dentist first to find out the cause as in the majority of patients it is related to the oral cavity. The remedy is simple. Maintain good oral hygiene by brushing twice daily, in your case after every feed. Do regular flossing. Avoid smoking and alcohol if you do so. You can use flavored mouthwashes regularly which are easily available with chemists."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 34 years old.

Can I use the cholesterol medicine for triglycerides?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from back pain and hypertriglyceridemia with low HDL (high density lipoprotein) level. You have a high VLDL (very level density lipoprotein) level too. For your abnormal lipid profile level, you should avoid fatty foods and dairy products. You can take Fenofibrate for your high triglycerides level along with Omega-3 fatty acid for your low HDL level. Continue these medications for abnormal lipid profile and do repeat your lipid profile after three months later. For your back pain, you can take Naproxen with Baclofen, Calcium with vitamin D supplements. So you can continue the medications as follows. Capsule Lofibra (Fenofibrate) 200 mg 0+0+1 (after meal), tablet Naprosyn 500 mg 1+0+1 (after meal) for 10 days, tablet Lioresal (Baclofen) 10 mg 1+0+1 for one month, tablet Carbocal D 400 0+1+0 for two months, capsule Bio Marine, Omega-3, and Fish oil 0+1+0 (continue), tablet Prevacid (Lansoprazole) 30 mg 1+0+0 (before meal) for one month."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and was given Trintellix 10 mg.

Which was causing me nervousness? I could not even judge if the drug was working. My doctor switched me to Cipralex but I am afraid to take it and the same thing happens to me. I also have intrusive thoughts sometimes and I feel stuck. Not sure what to do or what medication would be my best bet? I am also on Clonazepam 0.5 at night to help me sleep.","Doctor":"Hello. It looks like you are experiencing significant anxiety. I note that you are weaning off Trintellix 10 mg and are you are in a dilemma about starting Cipralex (Escitalopram) due to concerns about side effects like developing mania. Since your anxiety appears quite significant it is best managed by a combination of medication and psychological therapy like CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy). Cipralex is an effective medication in this situation. Remember that it will take at least two weeks for your body to get used to the medication and in this period some may experience nervousness, agitation, etc. It generally settles down and you will see full therapeutic benefit from around four to six weeks. So medication is worth a try and have regular follow up reviews with your psychiatrist as advised. You can take Cipralex long term till anxiety is better. Clonazepam 0.5 mg is meant to be taken for the short term only, ideally less than four weeks to prevent developing dependence. In addition to medication, consider CBT to develop psychological strategies to manage anxiety. Regular exercise also helps. Maintain a good sleep schedule. Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Encourage him to take lots of fruits and vegetables along with dry fruits like dates, prunes, dry figs, etc., which will help to make the stool soft. He has to drink lots of water. Avoid junk foods, wheat, and maida products. He is already taking Duphalac which will take about a weeks time to act. Also to clear the fecaliths, please show him to a pediatric surgeon. Once those are cleared and constipation is treated, he may feel comfortable."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis and I felt like a lump in my lower throat. The doctor did a physical examination and noticed two nodules and sent me for an ultrasound. The result came back that the thyroid as a whole was hyperemic and heterotrophic in the background appearance. The left lobe contained two nodules for which he then sent me to an ENT to do an FNB. Right now, usual symptoms of hypothyroidism are present like extreme fatigue, dry hair. But in the last couple of weeks, I have not been able to sleep on my back or side or put my chin down as it feels like the air is restricted. My question is, what does this sound typical of thyroid cancer or a goiter? I am not an over reactor, I just wish I had more information or know the prognosis of cases that were similar to mine. Does this sound at a higher risk of cancer or more like a goiter? and if I am already on thyroid medication, what can they do to treat it?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I had gone through all the data posted. From the details posted it appears as autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimotos). Kindly tell us the thyroid blood reports to know the control. Do you hear any sound while breathing (stridor) which indicates pressure on trachea? Breathlessness on lying back or on the side is unlikely due to thyroid unless it has retrosternal extension significantly which needs to be decided by clinical examination.  Do you get breathlessness while taking the stairs? Since how long do you have Hashimotos? Since how long you have noticed the increase in the size of swelling? Do you have a family history of thyroid cancer? For definitive distinction of benign vs malignant FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) is important. If we have any doubt on FNAC we go ahead and do thyroidectomy and send thyroid tissue for histopathology examination which is the most confirmatory test. Ultrasound is not so sensitive to differentiate benign vs malignant. So kindly wait for the FNAC report. Kindly get a complete physical examination in view of symptoms of shortness of breath before attributing those to thyroid problems. Kindly review with further details so that I can help you better."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been experiencing some very unusual problems at the moment and I am getting a bit concerned about them. I have not gone to my doctor about it yet. It is hard to explain but I will try. It is as if the connections between my hands and my brain become muddled and I have trouble telling which part of my fingers or hands is being stimulated. It all kind of blurs into one numb sensation. My hands feel heavy and become harder to move as if I am trying to move them through a viscous fluid. This weird experience has been happening mainly when I am at work and when I am stressed but I am noticing it now slightly as well while typing this. It is a really bizarre feeling and it can extend through my arms and my legs when it gets really bad. I also have a constant tinnitus but I only notice it at night when trying to sleep or if I am in silence. I also feel that my heartbeat has started to become irregular and I always feel tired and dizzy at the moment. I went to my doctor about the dizziness about 6 months ago and got a blood test done and that was fine but he said my blood pressure was slightly high for my age. Two years ago I very stupidly took a legal high BK-2cb and I had a full blown visual and auditory trip that lasted about 18 hours. Once it wore off I was fine but then about 6 weeks later I started to have visual problems. I had really bad after images and reality just looked very strange to me especially when looking at other people. These visual symptoms seemed to have faded now but I still have brain fog and after images. I am just messaging because I am concerned about the problems I am having with my sense of my hands in particular and I am wondering if it has anything to do with the stupid mistake I made 2 years ago when taking that drug?","Doctor":"Hello. The sensation in your hand can be because of: 1. Compression of the nerve at elbow while typing (but it is unlikely to spread to your legs). 2. Stress/anxiety can cause such symptoms.  Tinnitus at night when it is very quiet outside is common and normal phenomenon. But when it is present when you are in a noisy environment that is abnormal. Dizziness and tiredness may be a part of your stress. Slightly high blood pressure will require regular blood pressure checks and there is nothing to worry about on that front. Drug effect does not last for 2 years. If you have taken it for a very long time the it can cause psychiatric problems but I do not think your problems are related to that. I would suggest you take a psychiatric consultation because I do not feel it is a neurological problem and there is nothing to worry about."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What will my doctor exactly do while examination, when I tell him I am having erection problems?","Doctor":"Hi. It depends on what all positive findings you give while giving history. For example, the doctor will ask you for diabetes, high blood pressure, any regular medicine intake, psychiatric medicines, low hemoglobin symptoms, etc. These diseases usually cause ED (erection dysfunction) as a secondary cause. Then depending on what comes out of the conversation, the check-up will consist of general body workup. For the ED part, the doctor will surely look for a local problem, the size, and consistency of testis, the shape and size of the penis. He will then try to check for erection as a reflex on touching and will also check for skin retraction. The next step can be a stamp test or a penile Doppler, where the blood supply of the organ will be checked. There can also be a nerve conduction test done if the doctor thinks that the nerve supply is deficient. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 19-year-old male. I am active and never had any serious condition of unhealthiness. As a part of the ongoing project, I had to work for almost 14 days in burning hot sun. When I returned home, I identified white spots on my face and quickly searched the internet for a narrow down of the condition. Thanks to this site. I have identified it as tinea versicolor and used an OTC Clotrimazole ointment and it faded away in less than a week. Just after that, my friends pointed out a rash on my neck and I thought it was probably the same as my previous infection. It was white in color and looked like a fungal infection with four small patches. And so I applied the same cream. Unfortunately, I could observe no change and kept trying home remedies like turmeric and honey paste, etc. It has now come to look black and dry as in the attached image. There is no sensation whatsoever at all. I only know it is there when I place my hand over it. Please, can you help me identify what it is? I have already looked at a lot of conditions and was unable to match it with mine. It is been almost six months and it looks like one has faded and the other three have mated.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The condition in the picture is not tinea versicolor at the moment. This is skin thickening as a result of allergy to sun exposure. This is quiet common in the neck area. You must use a good quality sunscreen till the allergy resolves completely. As such it is not something you should get scared for as most of the sun allergies resolve on their own. Sun allergies. Mild topical steroid cream like Desonide cream application at night only over the patch (for not more that 14 days). SPF 50+ suncreen every three to four hours (throughout the day time). Eat lots of carrots and papaya as they have beta carotene which will protect you from sun allergies internally. Follow up after seven days for assessing the improvement of the treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My friend gets frequent fever and weak bone problems. She is not able to gain weight and strong bones. She belongs to a poor family though she has been visiting many ayurvedic, homeopathic MD's no one is able to figure out the exact reason. There might be chances of bone cancer? She had already spent lots of money and now she is losing hope. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems from what you have mentioned that your friend is a 30-year-old lady with frequent episodes of fever and bone pain (assuming that the bone problems you mentioned are bone pains at multiple locations). If she is indeed only 70 lbs, then it is likely that she is cachexic. This along with the frequent fevers gives us a major red flag for two serious conditions that she might have tuberculosis (TB), or tumor anywhere in the body. Let us discuss these two possibilities. Tuberculosis is endemic and is more common than we think. Most individuals already have the bacteria in them, and the disease occurs when their immunity reduces. Long-standing low grade fevers, loss of appetite and weight, history of contact with someone who had active TB, and low socioeconomic living conditions are quite likely to cause TB. While TB most commonly involves the lungs causing a chronic cough. TB can affect almost any system in the body. One may have musculoskeletal TB involving the spine, joints and any of the bones. If your friend's bone pains are related to TB, she should have pain at only a few locations in her body, unless she is immunocompromised. Tumors or cancer anywhere in the body can cause loss of appetite and weight. Low-grade fevers may occur in some tumors, while the spread of tumor tissue to bones will lead to bone pains and pathological fractures. Tumors arising from the bones are a definite possibility. Finally, besides TB and tumors, there are other rarer causes cachexia and bone pains. These include nutritional deficiency disorders like osteomalacia, HIV infection, certain medications that reduce immunity, etc. It might be a good idea for her to take pictures of all the tests that she has undergone, and also any x-rays or imaging that she may have got done till now. You may upload these on this platform and we could discuss her issues further. I understand she may be losing hope from any medical intervention, and such disease-related depression is quite common. If she has consulted only ayurvedic doctors till now, it may be prudent to take opinions from allopathic doctors. It is quite possible that her diagnosis may have been missed. Lastly, I would sincerely suggest that you take at least verbal consent from her before discussing the specifics of her case on this platform. I hope this helps.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My friend is having a gall bladder stone. We consulted few doctors, some are saying the immediate operation is needed otherwise it will be cancerous and some are saying no immediate action is required. She is having pain in her right side of the upper abdomen and also in the middle. I am attaching her ultrasound report. Please tell me about her condition. During this pandemic, we are not able to go outside and consult the doctor.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern about symptoms complex and ultrasound findings and whether surgery is the answer to your problem. Well, first of all, I want to clear that you do not have stones in the gallbladder. They are concretions. It is a medical term and they are called microlithiasis (gall bladder stones less than 3 mm in size). So the possibility of developing cholecystitis (gall bladder inflammation) is very low. However, this microlithiasis can cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas which is a gland sitting over the back of the abdomen). Thirdly, the pain can be secondary to the functional gall bladder problem, where the gall bladder is naturally slow resulting in damping of bile (yellow secretion produced by the liver and stored within gallbladder) and production of small concretions such as in y our case. So I would ask you to get a few blood tests to confirm whether you have pain due to pancreatitis. I also want that you should discuss to me in more detail about your pain, as only proper history can give me a clue towards your problem whether gall bladder inflammation, pancreatitis, or functional gall bladder disorder even before any further testing. Since the ultrasound findings and your symptoms are not correlated very well, there is no point in discussing the role of surgery. But I just want to assure you that you probably need no surgery, so do not worry about it. I suggest you some tests, please get it done, then I would recommend you some lifestyle changes and a medical treatment that can help you resolve your minor stones within the gallbladder. I hope this helps. Pancreatitis. Cholecystitis. Peptic ulcer disease. Functional gallbladder disorder (gallbladder dyskinesia). Complete blood count. Serum amylase and lipase. Liver function tests. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). Start capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg half an hour before meals once daily for now.

Before two months back, I got into a very fearful situation and I felt panicked at that time. I consulted a psychiatrist and he gave me Clonezopam, Propranolol and anti-depressants. After using it for seven to ten days I stopped them by knowing that they are addictive. And after stopping I felt new kind of problems such as heart palpitations whenever I try to sleep in the day time and I get irregular sleep at night, feeling anxious. For many days I kept tolerating them, after many days now the symptoms have diminished but still, I get palpitations whenever I try to sleep, then I took Medhavati for 12-14 days. My sleeping time at night somewhat increased but I did not use to get a refreshed sleep. I consulted a general doctor, he told me it is just a phobia and gave me Stalopam (Clonezepam and Escitalopram) for 15 days and multivitamins tablets. Then I consulted an ayurvedic specialist, he gave Manasamitra vatakam, Stresswin and Saraswatiristam. Please help me whether I should take these ayurvedic medicines or take antidepressants for 15 days? Are Manasamitra and Saraswatiristam safe for me and do not have side effects? And what time does it take to show effects and for much duration should I take them? Now I am almost fine but unable to sleep at daytime due to palpitations and getting some negative fearful thoughts at some times. Does Manasamitra increase serotonin in the brain and give enthusiasm. I am thinkng of going for allopathy for 15 days or will ayurveda medicines show early results? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I could understand how much confusion you experience and your mental pain. So far, fewer studies have been done if we combine allopathy drugs with Ayurveda or Siddha drugs. In your case, I feel you should continue the allopathy drugs for 15 days (or above as per physicians instruction). I feel you can also have Propranolol to reduce the palpitation. You can continue the allopathy drugs for particular days. In order to avoid the addiction, the gradual (stepwise dose reduction) reduction of tablets should be followed. For example: from day 16th onwards, half tablet to be continued for next one week, then every alternate days half tablet for next one week, then every 4th day half a tablet for next week, then stop it. This can be done with the advice of the physician. Few research in animals has proved that Manasamitra tablet could increase serotonin levels, but not 100% guarantee given. Many clinical sharing concludes that these three ayurvedic drugs are useful if the patient starts the therapy in the early stage of the disease. And also good for long term treatment. Hence, in your case adding these drugs will surely have some beneficial role. You do not stop these Ayurvedic drugs, continue it for the next six months. You join for a regular yoga class or training class (daily continuously) for the next six months. In my experience, after six months, you can stop all medications including ayurveda and can run the best life only with yoga practice. Yoga practice at home is free of cost. Many people got miracle relief from anxiety, depression and can focus on the studies or business or particular work, with good sleep and good diet. You find out your interested hobby. Be it plants, pets, color fishes, walking, playing, picnic, temples, etc. Focus on these. You will come out of the stressful anxiety. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My grandmother had a big goiter that she did not get it removed. Later she got a large cyst on the ovary. I mean 8 kg. When she removed it, she found out she had ovarian cancer. She removed it and is healthy today. Now I am terrified that this is hereditary. What do you think? I am so scared for my mother. The doctor told my grandmother to remove the goiter a lot of times, it was huge and she had hyperthyroidism. I have read somewhere that there might be a link to hyperthyroidism and ovarian cancer. I think that the body is trying to tell something when she got all this stuff. My grandmother was smoking for almost 30 years before she got this, and was 55 when she was diagnosed? Do you think it is hereditary? She is the only one in the family with this type of cancer, no breast cancer known in the family. My mother was on a check before a few days, but she is 44 and has irregular bleeding and has an appointment with a specialist next month. I am terrified. My grandmother had an early menopause and the doctor thinks the same is going on with my mother. If she got the menopause from my mother I think she also can get the cancer? But it is very normal to get the menopause on the same age as your mother, is it? My mother is 44 years, has 4 kids, never tried a smoke. Do you think she is in danger? I also have OCD and terrifying thoughts all the time.","Doctor":"Hello. First, it is perfectly normal if your grandmother had and now your mother is started having premenopausal irregular cycles at age of 44, there is no harm in having menopause at this age and studies have concluded that early menopause protects from breast and ovarian cancers. Second, since your grandmother had ovarian cancer then here are a few questions. 1. What was the age of your grandmother when it was diagnosed? 2. What was the histological type and grade of the tumor? 3. Has she underwent screening for other cancers that are common in this age group? 4. And your complete family history with cancer history in family members. 5. The use of hormonal replacement therapy or other exogenous hormones. Third thing is that being concerened (sometimes over-concerned) about the health of family member should not be considered as OCD or any other disorder untill and unless the thoughts makes you sick. One suggestion that I can give to you to relieve of your anxiety is that you should take advice of a medico if in doubt rather than ruminating on thoughts of impending doom.

Several weeks later, I was also diagnosed in my left eye. In addition, I experienced some achilles heel tendonitis and back pain. I completed the 8 week treatment program (dilating drops for the first week and slow recession of Steroid drops) and about 2 weeks later, symptoms began reappearing in the left eye, followed by the right. I began another round of Steroid drops in both eyes and slowly tapered the consistency. I am down to 2 drops per day and I have begun experiencing severe back pain, which had previously quieted down. Also in the past 2 weeks, I have had a Pityriasis Rosea attack - the 2nd attack in 3-4 years. I was also treated for bacterial vaginosis a few weeks ago and prescribed antibiotics. It seems to me that everything is connected, but I tested negative for inflammation in my blood and no doctor has been able to link everything or look at all my symptoms as a whole. Any help or input is greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. It seems from the history that you are having recurrent attacks of uveitis. Uveitis is an inflammatory disease of the eye and it can be because of infections, allergies, systemic diseases. Skin diseases like pityriasis can be seen associated with uveitis. However, there is no definitive relationship between vaginosis and uveitis. Back pain because of arthritis is a common association with uveitis. The treatment for uveitis is by steroids and cycloplegic dilating stops as you are taking now and you can continue same treatment. Since the episodes of uveitis are recurrent I advice for a systemic evaluation. The common tests need to be done are complete blood count, ESR, CRP. Since you are having backpain we need to rule out arthritis and spondylitis as a underlying cause. Hence, you require X-ray of spine and RA factor. There is definitive and proven link between back pain and uveitis, hence I advice you to get evaluation done to rule out spondylitis and arthritis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 33 years old and weighs about 86 kg.

As for Rheumatoid factor, 8 or 11, can be lab variation or instrument variation, but as long as you do not have joint swellings or pain it is insignificant. My diagnosis for pain would go for fibromyalgia. It is more of a diagnosis of exclusion and one only considers it after ruling out the other causes, which they have done so far.

I think she had heartburn. We are now concerned about the abnormal report.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the ECG of your daughter. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  She has a condition called right bundle branch block. A right bundle branch block (RBBB) is a heart block in the electrical conduction system. Our heart is divided into four chambers, upper two are called atria and the lower two are called ventricle. Every heartbeat starts from the sino-atrial node in the right atria called pacemaker of the heart and is conducted to ventricles through bundle branches arising from bundle of HIS in the ventricle. The right bundle branch supplies the right ventricle while the left bundle branch supplies the left bundle. During a right bundle branch block, the right ventricle is not directly activated by impulses traveling through the right bundle branch. The left ventricle, however, is still normally activated by the left bundle branch. Though in 85% of adult population RBBB is a normal finding, yet as your daughter is in the pediatric age group it can be because of atrial septal defect also. A detailed history is required before concluding if its atrial septal defect or not. You have not mentioned her symptoms, does she had breathlessness, especially while playing? Does she have chest pain? Any history of recurrent chest infections in her childhood? Why was she taken to ER? Does she have gastritis or acid peptic disorder or heartburn previously?

After eight weeks, you should have it once a month for the next six months. Now the liver enzyme is deranged likely due to fatty liver, which is related to deranged lipid profile. You should get an ultrasound of liver to confirm it. Now since LDL (low density lipoprotein) is moderately elevated, you may give a try of a healthy lifestyle. So you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily, high calorie foods. Avoid fried, fast food, egg yellow, non veg consumption, and avoid excessive oil. Do not reuse the cooking oil once used for frying. Have regular exercises like brisk walking or running according to the capacity for atleast 30 minutes a day. Repeat lipid profile after eight weeks and if there is a response then should continue a healthy lifestyle or else will medications like tablet Atorva (Atorvastatin) 10 mg bedtime once daily for six to eight weeks. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I got skin color bumps all over my body which are getting darker after going away. I have attached the photos. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello.

I recently visited my GP as I felt swollen glands in my inguinal area for nine to ten months. I feel fit and fine otherwise with no other symptoms. The GP said he was not very concerned, but decided to send me to a hematologist who examined me and he said there are multiple lymph nodes in the neck and inguinal area but they are subcentimetric. The blood was all normal apart of mild neutropenia. He said he does not feel it would be something significant but he booked me for CT neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. I would appreciate your opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your concern. You have swollen lymph nodes for many months. So it is advisable to investigate with histopathology examination of enlarged node to rule out the underlying cause. For that biopsy has to be taken and send it for a histopathology examination. CT (computed tomography) scan is also beneficial and you might not worry about radiation if a CT scan mandatory to perform. However, I recommend to investigate with biopsy for histopathology examination as well for primary work up.

My dad took her to the hospital and undergone treatment also but no use , after up to 2 years prescribed medicine also used . It had been 20 year of not using any medicine and treatment .

In your query you have not mentioned the diagnosis so I can't suggest exactly what needs to be done but I will explain how it works .. The fact that you mentioned that she doesn't remember anyone could be a part of 1. Dementia for which you would require a neurologist , Medications can help to an extent . 2. Psychosis or Depression can have such reactions , you will require a Psychiatrist for this . A complete evaluation is required , the doctor might do a CT/ MRI depending on the symptoms and start treatment accordingly and yes Medications can help to an extent depending on severity of the issue. One way is to get her treated on OPD basis ie at home with followuos with doctor , or you can opt for residential treatment facilities which keep the patient in the facility and there is a holistic approach to treatment where doctor , nurses , therapist , etc works as a team in recovery . I would need more information about symptoms or need to talk to your mother to be able to understand exactly what she is going through . I hope this helps ..

It seems you are suffering from muscular pain. The muscular chest pain aggravates with movement. It is dull, diffuse and continuous in nature. This can result from incorrect posture during the night while you were sleeping. However, in case you have any pain in the upper part of the abdomen, or you had consumed alcohol in case last night, you would require to get an ultrasound abdomen to rule out any evidence of gall bladder stones or alcohol-induced pancreatitis. For muscular pain you should do hot fomentation over the involved area 3 to 4 times a day. You should apply Diclofenac gel locally over the involved area. To take anti-inflammatory and analgesic pain killer like Ibuprofen, Etoricoxib, if the pain is very severe.

One would initially suspect a cardiac abnormality given the drastic fluctuations in your pulse rate, but that would show up on an ECG or echo tests. Since your ECG and echo tests are normal, I would advise you to get some blood work done like, a serum electrolytes test to see if there is any hyponatremia or hyperkalemia. Also a urine test for 24 hours urinary collection of catecholamines. Both of these tests would indicate a disorder of the adrenal gland, Addison's disease with the electrolyte abnormalities or Phaeochromocytoma, diagnosed by the 24 hours urinary catecholamines. Please get these tests done as both these probable conditions, if present, need to be treated sooner rather than later. I hope this helps. 24 hours urinary catecholamines, Serum electrolytes.

Today, I woke up and my eye has become doubled in size accompanied by temperatures, headache, chills, and mild sore throat. I went to the doctor and explained my symptoms including that at work my colleague had recently been off with glandular fever. He checked my eyes, gave me drops and sent me on my way. My eye is not better despite doing the drops every two hours as instructed. I still have all the other symptoms and none are calming down. My right eye is still absolutely fine, so after two days of swollen and watery eyes I cannot believe this is due to conjunctivitis. I should also add I had glandular fever when I was 16 years old. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. According to the history and the photo you attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  There is mild lid edema, conjunctival chemosis and confession seen. There is also a history of glandular fever to your friend. My top of the differential diagnosis would be pharyngoconjunctival fever. It is caused by an adenoviral (commonly type 3) and causes sore throat, fever, conjunctivitis that manifest as watering, photophobia and swelling in some cases there may be rash. It is a self-limited disease. It can take one to three weeks. Only symptomatic treatment is given. For prompt relief: 1. Apply cold compresses two to three times daily. 2. Topical Vasoconstrictor gives rapid improvement. 3. Artificial tear drops give some relief. 4. Prophylactic antibiotic drops are given to avoid any bacterial infection. Sometimes oral anti-allergic or antihistamine is helpful if there is itching. You will get this with your doctor's prescription. So do not worry it will be alright.

I am pregnant and suffering from depression and my main 'trigger' is lack of sleep and tiredness. I am aware that I am having a child. I am signing up for sleepless nights so my main concern is antidepressants and the effect they might have while breastfeeding.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your post thoroughly and I have to tell you that depression during pregnancy must be dealt with carefully. Pregnancy itself causes mood swings and there are episodes of depression, as a consequence of hormonal fluctuation. The best ways to deal with this during pregnancy vary from patient to patient depending on their level of depression. Provided your history with this and the suicidal attempts, you may need to be on antidepressants, which even though are generally considered unsafe for the fetus, a few are of pregnancy safety category C. Meaning, category C drugs may be given when benefits outweigh the risks in your case. Needless to say, these are prescription medications and I recommend you to see a psychiatrist who can evaluate your present situation and decide on that. Please note, that if you ever feel like you need medication during pregnancy, do not hesitate to consider the safer options because harboring something like depression can make it worse and cause more harm to the fetus than the drug itself. I hope this is helpful."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Every doctor I have consulted says it is dust allergy and gives different eye drops, tablets and ointments and says to use it until one month continuously.

Please explain to me why is this happening for the past six months and please help me to get rid of this suffering.","Doctor":"Hello. Unfortunately, allergy is not a disease as much as it is a reaction to some factors. The purpose of any eye drop that we use as ophthalmologists can recommend is merely to suppress that reaction. The main treatment would be to detect the factor that is causing this condition and escape it. In order to do so, you will have to go in your memory six months back and find out what new factor has been introduced into your life. Another option would be to undergo an allergy test and find out what are the main factors you have an allergy to. It would of course help me more to visualize the changes that you currently have in the eyes. You can upload several good quality photos of your eyelids and invert them so that I can see the conjunctiva (the inner layer of the eyelids).

With family history of epilepsy, he wanted me to take EEG and an MRI. In the MRI, he noticed white patch like matter in the brain and wanted to repeat the MRI with contrast. The area did not enhance post contrast. Hence, he suspected it to be either demyelination or low grade glioma. Since the terms scared us, we took a second consultation with the family neurologist who was again doubtful of what it is finally suspects it to be either focal vasogenic edema in cerebellar hemisphere. The report has also has these statements- non enhancing medusa like branching magnetic susceptibility effects within this area and thrombosed developmental venous anomaly. They have asked me to wait for three months and repeat the MRI to see the growth and then come to a conclusion of what exactly it is. I get severe headaches and it reduces only after I vomit.

How can I cure it and will it be sign of blind soon?","Doctor":"Hi, Welome to icliniq.com. I have gone through what you have mentioned in your query. It is quite a common sight here to see people as young as you with a power of -7 to -8. So, there is nothing serious in this. You have mentioned that your power is -7 but you have not mentioned how much you are able to see with it, it is usually mentioned as a fraction of 6 (example 6/6, 6/9,6/12 and so on). 6/6 by is considered as normal, and for most practical purpose 6/9 is also fine.  Solutions you have: Although there are no treatments to cure your power, you can get LASIK/ PRK/ SMILE surgery done to get rid of glasses. We usually recommend a period of stable of power for atleast 6 months before you can make this move. Else you can opt for contact lenses. Though they do not treat your power, they offer cosmetic benefit. Complications that you may get:  Now coming to the problems that people with high powers face -  1. Retinal detachment.  2. Amblyopia.  3. Retinal problems including bleeding.  The only way to avoid these is to see your ophthalmologist atleast once a year where we will be putting in drops to check your retina. The problem that you are facing is a challenging one but with proper follow up you will be able to avoid most of the problems that I have mentioned and be able to lead a productive life."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old and I am in the computer field and have myopia (-10) and cataract in both eyes, will it get stable with time or are there any chances that I can go blind. I am in depression thinking about I might go blind.","Doctor":"Hi. I will first of all say that myopia is correctable and cataracts are curable, so there is no need to worry about blindness as long as you are attending your follow ups regularly. You have mentioned that your power is -10 but I want to ask you how much your vision is with the -10D, it is usually written as a fraction Ex:6/6, 6/12 etc. If your visual acuity is above 6/9, your eye sight is as good as normal and there will cause you problems with your work. In case it is anywhere less than 6/12, means - 1. Your cataracts are in the stage to be operated. Or  2. Your high power has cause a few degenerative changes in your retina.  Unfortunately, your eyesight cannot be improved further is you have the latter, but in case of the former, you have no reason to worry. Like I have told you, cataracts are curable and after the surgery, as we would have put in a intraocular lens inside your eye, you will not need to wear any glasses either. You can enjoy spectacle free good vision for the rest of your life. There are no home remedies or special diets that can make the cataracts or a power of -10D come to zero. If you can scan and send me your doctor's notes, I can give you more clarity as to what is exactly going on. Congenital. B-scan. Fundoscopy, B-scan, OCT macula."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My crown has become loose as there is decay inside the crown and around half the edge but not visible. I was told that tooth is stable underneath. I saw one endodontist who said to rule out implant and he would do root canal but bone and gum are less than ideal and 50-50 chances are there that it will work. He also did not clear all the decay, did not take the crown off but drills straight through. (A wobbly decayed tooth underneath crown?), did not do the post or crown. There is a long standing chronic abcess at root for years. Current root canal was done 7 years ago. I do not have any other molars left in lower. I am in shocked, sad, anxious and 60 years old. I feel tempted to go to an unknown dentist just to see if he could do a hemisection as the Endodontist I talk to \\"no longer do them as implants are available and hemis tend not to last long\\".

Concerned in this decision making process about any further damage being done to gum and or bone. Impeccable hygiene history.","Doctor":"Hello. Seeing the recent X-rays (attachment removed to protect patient identity) it is obvious that the distal root has abscess and should be removed. Hemisection might be a good idea but it alone cannot withstand the biting force and if you can afford, then go for a molar implant behind this tooth so that you will get one extra molar to chew on. A hemisection to retain the mesial root of this tooth along with another implant behind it will give adequate tooth structure to have a normal biting force. If you cannot afford both then go for extraction of this abscessed tooth and an implant as hemisection alone is not strong unless it has more support behind it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from low platelet count, low hemoglobin, burning back pain, shoulder pain, arm pain, forearm pain, breathing problems, abdominal pain, morning stiffness, foot, and hand pain.

Can you please help me with what is going on with me? I am currently taking Naproxen 250, vitamin B12 injection and vitamin D3 capsule.","Doctor":"Hello. The shoulder pain, arm pain like symptoms could be because of low vitamin B12 levels. So you can complete the course of B12 injection. For breathing issue, however, you need to investigate with spirometry and chest x-ray. Additionally, I have observed that your hemoglobin level and platelet counts are low persistently for the past two to three months.

According to your statement, you have been suffering from back pain, tiredness, more sleepy feeling, and inflammation on foot. I have gone through your investigations (attachment removed to protect patient identity) result and found that your Vitamin D3 level is below normal, GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) level slightly high, HDL (high dentisy lipoprotein) level below normal, TG (thyroglobulin) and VLDL (very density lipoprotein) level significantly high, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level normal at the upper limit. Total leucocyte count with lymphocytes count slightly high, eosinophil count are significantly high. So your back pain, tiredness, more sleepy feeling with inflammation of foot may result from vitamin D3 deficiency. Clinical features of vitamin D3 deficiency are repeated infections, tiredness, back pain, depression, bone pain, muscle pain, fatigue, delayed wound healing, feeling sleepy, etc. Again high TG levels may cause abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, fatigue, etc. Your high eosinophil count indicates that you may suffer from allergies. As your TSH level is normal at a higher limit, so you should repeat the thyroid function test within three months. For your vitamin D3 deficiency, you should need more exposure to sunlight for vitamin D3 synthesis as well as take vitamin D3 enriched foods and supplements. For your high TG level, you should continue Fenofibrate along with Omega-3 fatty acid for low HDL level and repeat your lipid profile test after three months. For your low back pain, you can take Naproxen with Esmoprazole combination with Baclofen and calcium supplements."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 22-year-old female and a working professional.

The feeling of symptoms like periods but not actually having bleeding could be due to ovulation pain, what is called in medical terms is Mittelschmerz's pain. If your cycles are ovulatory, all the more good. Try for conception in the middle of your cycle days, say in 25-28 day cycle 8-18 days. Do not worry if three months are gone. Give a fair trial for six months before undergoing any investigations. Folic acid to continue till you conceive. It will prevent neural tube defects in the baby."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been recently diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia by my family doctor. I have been experiencing lightheadedness, fainted a few times after standing. My BP is really high 186/102 mmHg on average with a normal pulse while lying down, then as soon as I sit or stand up my BP drops quite low 104/75 mmHg on average. I have also been experiencing severe fatigue, my whole body just aches all the time and I constantly feel short of breath and get chest tightness and on and off pains. I have reoccurring tremors in my left arm and fingertip numbness. I become very foggy minded usually at night and I get words mixed and my speech gets slurred and stuttered. The worst most uncomfortable feelings I have is shortness of breath and have difficulty trying to breathe. I cannot sleep feeling like this. I have a 3-month-old baby to take care of, but I need some advice on getting at least some temporary relief with my breathing and chest pains until I see the cardiologist. Please help. I am currently taking Celexa 40 mg at night for depression.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. It is postural orthostatic hypotension, i.e. a significant drop of blood pressure which is causing fainting and giddy kind of symptoms. To prevent this avoid sudden movements like while getting up from the bed, sit with the legs hanging on the side for a while then get up. While feeling faint just lie down on the floor, do not try to control and stand, surely you will fall. Second thing, your resting BP (blood pressure) is high it needs to be controlled as early as possible. It looks like gestational hypertension (after pregnancy). Chest tightness and breathing difficulty are due to resting high BP. Take tablet Amlodipine 5 mg once daily until you see any cardiologist and avoid sudden movements."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was adopted. She has no family history and no medical history. She started experiencing back pain in her lower central back. The pain felt like sharp jabs at sometimes and dull at others. This pain progressed to the hips and shooting pains down both legs. She was seen by her regular pediatrician who sent her to get an x-ray of her lumbar spine. The test was clear. Her doctor recommended physical therapy. After starting physical therapy she was sent to a podiatrist to see if her flat feet were the problem. They were determined not to be. She has now been doing physical therapy for about three weeks and nothing seems to help. She recently experienced an episode where she was sitting, reading in class when all of a sudden her whole left side jabbed and got spasmed. She felt the pain the whole afternoon as it felt like all her muscles were pulled. She also experienced sudden vision deterioration and has just gotten glass for that. Could you please tell us what you think this could be?","Doctor":"Hello. I had gone through all the data that you have posted. I can understand your concern being a mother of 15-year-old and facing all this. I will try to help in my way. The first thing is complete detailed neurological examination is very important in this case. Due to the presence of a back problem with sensory symptoms for some time and sudden vision deterioration goes in favor of multiple sclerosis (MS). If the clinical examination reveals some abnormalities kindly go-ahead for MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) spine along with the brain. In MS it is common to have such episodes and more on extending the neck and weakness if any may worse with bath in hot water. Other possibilities include dyselectrolytemia, sciatica. So, kindly consult a neurologist for a detailed neurological examination and discuss possibilities with him and let him decide on further evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 5 months old. His weight is now 5.3 kg. He is premature with birthweight 2.3 kg. I could not breastfeed him. He was on Silmilac. After every feed he used to poop. On his second vaccination, he started getting loose motions. He had almost for 2 weeks. He was then shifted to Isomil and Neogain. After that his motion frequency reduced but it was pasty. In between he had blood in motions, they looked like pepper and 2 episodes of spots of blood. From next month, he became constipated. Using Neopeptine drops three times a day and Colic aid, he went motion once a day. Last week he did not go motion at all for 2 days and had to use Enema to remove. The doctor suggested to use Nan lo lac. Very next day he got high fever, white watery stools and dehydrated and was admitted to hospital. He was given Neusobee in the hospital. He started going green watery motions, flushed face and rash all over body. FM was stopped and Nestum was given. He started going pasty yellow stools. Can Neogain be given? How will he have enough calcium since he does not take milk? Amino acid FM is not available in market here. The doctor advised him to give rice and bread. I am afraid to give him any feed since his gut is damaged. What to be given? He is also anemic and he came out of hospital with a sore throat. He was on antibiotics Montox, Zn 20 for 5 days and Probiotics and Z and D drops to be continued for 10 days.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the elaborate history you have given. You did not mention how you were feeding the baby meaning whether it was bottle feeding or spoon feeding, generally if a baby is bottle fed there are high chances of infection due to contamination, good hygiene should be maintained. It is very unfortunate that the baby did not have breastfeeding, the reason for frequent GI infection could be contamination and lactose intolerance, you have changed formula feeds very frequently which should not have been done, either you should go with a lactose formula like Nan or Lactogen or a Lactose free formula like Nusobee or Zero lac. Continue the one which the baby is compatible with, as far as complimentary feeding is concerned that is rice, you need to start it once baby is 6 months old, do not worry that the baby gut is damaged, it repairs itself and adapts to the food or diet we give. But takes some time, start with liquids or soups, later increase the consistency."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I see that you are facing many issues at the moment. It must be very difficult for you to deal with all these at once and you are still holding on bravely. It is certainly very courageous of you. As you are seeing and hearing things and you have mentioned that you are also having paranoid thoughts. These symptoms point towards a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. You have also not been taking any medicines for the past three months and it may have worsened the condition. The auditory and visual hallucinations that you are having are results of imbalances in the neurotransmitters, which are chemicals in our brain helping us to think and function. The medications normalize their levels and help you focus on necessary tasks. Since you have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), depression and anxiety disorder, it will be very helpful for you to start medications for the symptoms you have mentioned in your query. For that, you must consult either your GP or psychiatrist directly. In your condition, the role of counseling will be amplified only once you are able to do away with the paranoid thoughts and hallucinations. 1. Schizophrenia. 2. BPD. 3. Depression. 4.

The history is complicated trying to explain the symptoms but I will do my best. It was detected polyhydramnios in pregnancy. My daughter born at 36 weeks 4 days through emergency C-section due to pre-eclampsia. Her weight was 3070g. NG tube passed three times due to polyhydramnios. We went home on day two. Readmitted on day five for phototherapy. Till 4 months of age, several visits with health visitor and GP for colic like symptoms and constipation. She will scream in pain which opening her bowel and only opening her bowels every four to five days. Over this time they tried Colief, Infacol, Lactulose, Glycerin suppositories, Ranitidine, Gaviscon and Domperidone, nine different formulas and we also tried all common natural remedies for reflux like keeping upright after feeding, etc. No alleviation of symptoms at all with exception of glycerin suppositories which did seem to help the constipation. In 8 months pediatric consultant suggests functional constipation and recommends higher dose of Lactulose and Movicol for 16 weeks. He suggested that we are giving her too many glycerin suppositories and that is making her dependent on glycerin to open her bowels. And so Glycerin was stopped. We delayed weaning whilst waiting for appointment. At this point, her symptoms completely changed to intermittent diarrhea and constipation, bowel frequency increased to once a day, colic like pain and she does not start vomiting until the consistency of the food moves up to a more solid consistency. The laxatives made absolutely no difference. In her 10 months of age the constipation has turned to diarrhea. The doctor is happy that it was functional constipation and discharged her. At 11 months, she had first acute episode of chronic diarrhea and forceful vomiting lasted for 16 days which coincides with the introduction of cow's milk. During 11-14 months of age she was introduced to solid food. Chronic forceful vomiting which does not seem to follow any pattern. A food diary is followed for several weeks and there does not seem to be any consistent non-IgE allergy as a cause. During her 14 months of age we had an appointment with dietician and switched from normal formula to Pepti and then Neocate. Her chronic wheeze disappears overnight but chronic vomiting continues. She troubleshoots overfeeding as a cause. We are feeding her more as she is vomiting. When we did not substitute the feeds she lost weight. So, if she vomited a feed we gave her another one hour later, we fed her small quantities throughout the day to try and prevent vomiting. Again in 15 months consulted her dietician and he suggested definite non-IgE cow's milk protein allergy and to try trial and error with other three common allergies- soy, wheat and dairy. So, then for a month we followed strict elimination of those three. This month she had only Neocate liquid diet plus corn snacks (organix) and one paella meal. Symptoms improved but sporadic forceful vomiting remains. She tolerated only one baby paella meal well which is overcooked rice, very mushy consistency. Now again we attempted to challenge the three foods back in and move beyond this one meal. All attempts were failed. Her reaction to us seems to be much more about the consistency of the food rather than what the food is. She can tolerate a large amount of breadcrumbs, but cannot tolerate a piece of toast. We continue with food diary and there really is no clear pattern which isolates one food. Again in her 17 months age when we consulted her dietician he was unsure whether the symptoms fit FPIES at all and suggests gastro referral. Then she had second acute episode. We went A and E on day five and was sent home with suggestion of gastroenteritis. Chronic vomiting and diarrhea lasted 15 days. She lost 10% of her body weight. Sent home on Neocate as the only diet. But, there is no evidence of gagging, choking or problem swallowing. No fussing or wriggling during feeding. Four months back, her weight was 12.3 kg and now 10.9 kg. Her barium x-ray showed mild malrotation but at MDT it was decided this was not explanation of symptoms. We have recently tried Omeprazole to rule out severe reflux and it made no change. Genetic blood tests, kidney and abdominal ultrasound were normal. For us her symptoms now are identical to what they were like before the onset of weaning. Again, she is suffering from intermittent colic pain and constipation, but there is no vomiting. She is not sleeping well at all. We have increased her water intake and added Lactulose and the stools are no longer hard, but she still seems uncomfortable. Stools are very dark green. We have tried a couple of solids. She prefers crunchy food. She tolerates corn-based crisps as they basically dissolve into crumbs into your mouth. We tried peas, grapes and she passed all of the peas, grapes and beans completely undigested in her feces. Without solids she does not sleep well at all, because the Neocate just does not fill her up for long enough and so she is screaming all night because she is hungry. So, we tried a few solids and she is still screaming half the night with colic like pain. She is clearly in pain because she is absolutely screaming. She is pretty inconsolable, but the only thing that does relieve it is sucking on something like a bottle of water. She is waking up about every 20 to 30 minutes throughout the night. During the day she still has this colic like symptoms and she is tired and clingy and uninterested in playing. She does tend to have one to two hours a day of good time where she will play happily. One month back we had consultation with SLT. Her elder sister is under SLT.","Doctor":"Hi. 1. Hirschsprung disease. 2. CMPA Barium enema study. Continue on same diet till further plan.

When I went to the hospital I had my arm put into a sling. Since then I have been going back to the hospital every three to four weeks for x-rays, what concerns me is that my doctors seem extremely unsure what to do because my arm has healed in an awkward way. They keep saying I should leave it for a few months but I cannot see how it will ever mend properly. I insisted strongly that they put me on the waiting list to have the bone replaced and have pins put in it, but they said it might not be worth the risk. I want to know what other professional opinions so I can make a more informed decision. I have posted a picture of the x-ray.","Doctor":"Hello doctor, Sorry to hear about your accident. From what I see on the Xrays attached, you sustained a humeral shaft fracture. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  These fractures tend to be very forgiving, that is, they do well in spite of a great deal of malalignment. Humerus has a thick muscle cover all around it, so healing is usually quick and predictable. The shoulder joint has an enormous range of movement. This helps in retaining the excellent function of the arm even with minor amounts of malalignment. In fact, up to 20 degrees of anterior (front to back) angulation, and up to 30 degrees of varus, valgus (side to side) angulation is acceptable. Also, unlike the legs, shortening is not much of a concern in upper limbs, and upto 3 cm of shortening is acceptable in a humeral shaft fracture. Your x-ray show exuberant callus (healing bone), and you are likely to achieve good union in due course of time. I would not worry about the x-ray appearance of your humerus. Even if it heals in a malaligned position, so long as the malalignment is within the acceptable limits, and the bony union is strong, I would consider this an excellent outcome. It is, however, advisable to continue following up with your orthopedic surgeon for repeat x-rays to make sure that the malalignment does not worsen and the healing progresses. You can try to make the x-rays look better by operating, but the function and appearance of your arm externally will remain the same, and you will be left with a surgical scar. In your case, since it has started healing, a long incision will have to be taken to open the entire bone, remove the healing callus, and realign the bone fragments. This will not only expose you to operative complications like blood loss (which will be very high because you cannot use a tourniquet for a fracture that are high in the arm) but also a risk of non-union of the fracture, as you will be stripping off the blood supply to the fracture surfaces.

My symptoms started three years ago. At that time my ANA was high positive, lupus anticoagulant positive, but nothing else specific. My symptoms are joint pain, swelling, severe fatigue, severe hand swelling, severe Raynauds, GERD, nausea, constipation, dysphagia, eye swelling, occasional strange rashes from sun, and muscle weakness. My ANA is high positive, speckled. RNP, chromatin ab, and RNP (but anti smith is negative?) are positive. Scleroderma, anti-DNA, and Sjogrens ab's negative. I also have Hashimotos but the thyroid is functioning fine. I was recently put on Prednisone 10 mg daily. My doctor is not increasing the dose because of psychological side effects. I have an eye exam to start Plaquenil this week. My joint pain and GI symptoms are now under control. I am now struggling with limb weakness, muscles burning (like I am lifting weights). I am unable to work and live completely independently because of it. When my doctor assessed muscle strength she said it was abnormal (4/5 against resistance, lots of muscle shaking). My ESR and CPK were normal but I was not experiencing muscle issues at the time blood was drawn. I am getting more labs done and will possibly be referred to a neurologist at my next visit in a few weeks. My question, based on the positive labs and symptoms, what diagnosis is likely? She has said both UCTD and MCTD, not lupus because of the symptoms. What is your general opinion? And out of curiosity, what is the difference between RNP/sm and sm ab? My current medications are Prednisone 10 mg QD, Cymbalta 60 mg QD, Flexeril 10 mg QHS, Naproxen BID.","Doctor":"Hello. I believe your diagnosis is Overlap syndrome, scleroderma with myositis overlap. Your symptoms do not fit into one connective tissue disease. It is probably overlap of two diseases going on. Lupus I will not be too sure, as you do not specify symptoms pertaining to it. Neither it is UCTD (undifferentiated connective tissue disease). MCTD (mixed connective tissue disease) is more of a diagnosis of antibody only if U1 RNP (ribonucleoprotein) is positive. But in either ways management does not change much. But the antibodies you have to go more in favor of myositis with scleroderma overlap. For management point of view, you would need to increase the steroids dose. 10 mg is not gonna take care of the muscle disease. Plus you need a steroid sparing drug like Azathioprine or Methotrexate along with Plaquenil. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) can be normal in scleroderma. So it is not much a criteria to follow up. Key is your muscle weakness, which needs to be taken care of before it keeps getting damaged. Sorry to say, but your doctors are taking it a bit slowly as at this stage aggression is needed. Psychiatry side effects will not come at a lower dose. I would recommend 30 mg at least to begin with and then start a tapering schedule. I hope CPK (creatinine phosphokinase test) and LDH (lactic acid dehydrogenase) levels have been checked as well. Lastly, make sure that a 2D echo to look for pulmonary artery pressure and HRCT (high resolution computed tomography) of the lungs to look for any lung involvement has been carried out.

I have thinning hair and was planning of preventing through medication. I was planning on taking Finasteride.","Doctor":"Hi.  From the information given it seems you are experiencing the early signs of male pattern hair loss. This is a very common condition and there are many factors responsible, one of them being genetic. Due to the effect of the male hormone on the hair cycle, over a period of time the hair follicle starts shrinking and so the hair which comes out is thinner and more fragile and breaks easily. Also, the growing phase of the hair is shortened, so your hair does not grow as long it used to and becomes shorter and wispier. There are several treatment options available and the sooner we start the treatment the better the chances of reducing further hair loss/thinning and increasing regrowth. A combination of oral supplements to boost hair growth along with the application of lotions containing Minoxidil 5% to begin with will be the best course of action in my opinion. Oral Finasteride, which is the male hormone blocker, is used frequently. Applications with Finasteride are available too. This will be prescribed by your treating doctor after assessing the extent of thinning and discussing the side effects, etc. Several preparations of biopeptides and other natural ingredients like saw palmetto extract, melatonin, etc are also available to boost hair growth. PRP (platelet-rich plasma) is a popular procedure that is often used in combination with medical treatment to stimulate hair growth further. Usually, a combination of treatments is suggested after the clinical evaluation. But using the applications regularly is the key to good results. Hair regrowth takes a few months to show and you will have to be patient to see the benefit of treatment. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have vitiligo. I used for my patches Utramedanine solution with sun and I think I used to much because it burned. Now, I have dark patches like brown. Will it go away?","Doctor":"Hello.  I have noted your description and analyzed the situation at hand. The medicine being used by you is photo-sensitizing agent which means that it needs to be applied and then the treated area has to be exposed to ultraviolet rays for a controlled duration, preferably using a timer. Unfortunately, you exceeded that limit. The problem that you are facing is a common complaint in many patients. It is called photosensitive reaction. The good part is that the problem usually takes care of itself especially if you do not allow it to occur repeatedly. In your case, what has happened is that the skin has got an overdose of medication and is responding by producing inflammation and more pigment than desired at fast speed. If you leave it in this position, even then it is likely to heal but some patients need weak steroidal creams like Hydrocortisone to hasten the process of recovery. In case of itching, one may use anti-allergic. Please protect the area from further sun exposure for some day. Give a rest of a week or so and then restart the same treatment but with smaller dose of application and least possible sun exposure which can be tolerated by your skin. Please be extra-cautious about following instructions for such medications in future. You are highly likely to get good results with these measures.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Ever since, his skin condition has persisted, which involves dry, brownish patches under his armpits (he has white skin), a cracked, scaly pattern of dry skin on his lower back, and dry skin patches all over his torso (reminiscent of desiccated ground pattern in a desert). He has been to many doctors, who have all prescribed various creams, none of which seem to work. I will attach a photo. Have you seen anything like this before?","Doctor":"Hello. I have reviewed the details and the attachment sent by you (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I have had the opportunity to examine and treat at least a hundred patients of similar description in the last five years related to allergy to swimming pool water intolerance. In the case of your brother, I think it is due to the hypersensitivity caused by chemicals used to disinfect water. The most common chemical used is bleaching powder that releases chlorine which is a powerful skin irritant. There are several measures that will need to be put in place simultaneously to help your brother's skin ailment. 1. Firstly, he must refrain from further exposure to swimming pool water or chlorinated water in any other setting. 2. At this stage, using topical steroids is the best option but any creams containing potent steroids should be avoided. Hydrocortisone is likely to proven better choice. 3. Once he feels and looks better, the same cream as described above can be diluted in a sequential manner to reduce the proportion of active steroidal agent and substituted by either a cold cream or moisturizer. This tapering may take up to and beyond a couple of months as the element of chronicity has crept in due to use of various preparation over the last few years. 4. For symptomatic relief, he might like using antiallergic. 5. He should be advised to use a mild soap sparingly and not try to rub the scales off but use liberal quantities of moisturizers as and when needed. I am sure that like other patients of mine, your brother will have a rewarding experience."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 25 years old, male. I have fast ejaculation. If I am very much sexually excited, ejaculation can happen also at about 1 minute. If I do sex second or third time in a row in this case duration of act can be 4-6 minutes or more, but in this case problem is that I sometimes lose erection during the act and I am much less excited, so I do not get big pleasure. I have some symptoms which, in my opinion, can have some connection with my problem of premature ejaculation: 1. I started regular sexual life very late, at age 24, (one year ago) before it was not regular, but very rare. From the age of 13, I was making regular masturbation, almost every day, until I started regular sexual life (3-4 times a week). (Now masturbation almost does not give me pleasure) . 2. I think that the head of my penis is too much sensitive, because it hurts me when it touches to my underwear, if the head of my penis is not completely covered by foreskin. From my childhood until the age of 14-15 the foreskin of my penis was narrow and I could not to make head of penis to come completely out of it. I noticed high sensitivity only after. Now it has no problem and it is very elastic. I am saying this last fact because maybe the sensitivity of my penis was because of later adaptation of penis head without cover. 3. This period I have sex 3-4 times a week. During last one year the frequency of sexual acts was the same, but I want to have more often, minimum 6 days a week. Anyway, I am not sure this is the reason of my problem because also in the case if I do sex every day and next day I am very excited I will finish fast. 4. With oral stimulation of my penis, it is very difficult for me finish, because it does not excite me very much and I need much more time to have ejaculation. 5. My body temperature normally in the morning is about 36.6 celsius, but at midday till evening it remains 37.0-37.2 celsius. Can it be the symptom of inflammation in my genitourinary system or somewhere else, or it is normal? (My general blood and urine analysis are perfect, everything is normal). What can I do for treatment of my problem?","Doctor":"Hello. Forget about your past. It has nothing to do with your present problems. Premature ejaculation has nothing to do with timing of sex or masturbation. Some people have inherently sensitive genitalia. Also your body temperature is perfectly normal. There is no inflammation. The solution is to start a medicine called Dapoxetine 30 mg which can be taken as and when you have sex. One tablet to be taken one hour before intercourse. This will delay the ejaculation. As long as your partner is satisfied it does not matter how fast you ejaculate. You can bring your partner closer to point of ejaculation by stimulating her by other means like oral sex. And then penetrate her at the peak of her excitement. You can also use a jelly for local application on genitalia called Lignocaine 5 % jelly to be applied 20 minutes before sex. In some countries a spray of Lignocaine, Prilocaine is available. Take it easy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My question is actually regarding my husband. He is currently taking Citalopram and Abilify for his depression. He works a manual labor job and is consuming a cup of coffee every morning, two energy drinks, and a five-hour energy during the course of the day. He then comes home and drinks four to six beers and had three to five shots of hard alcohol as well as smoking marijuana all night. He has been diagnosed with sleep apnea and never uses his CPAP machine. I have told him my concerns but he tells me that he is fine. He will not talk to his primary and in fact, lies to him on a regular basis about his lifestyle. What health problems is he at risk with his current lifestyle? Should I contact his primary? I am very concerned about his drinking and lack of sleep are increasing.","Doctor":"Hello. His lifestyle is detrimental to healthy living. One should never mix Citalopram with alcohol and that too in sleep apnea patient. The center of breathing in the brain in these patients is stressed as the patient is not getting oxygen properly and hence constantly needs to wake the patient in the night to maintain that. Now alcohol and Citalopram will hinder this function which can be very dangerous plus him not using CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) makes this dangerous. People with sleep apnea remain very sleepy throughout the day and hence he might be taking all those energy drinks which will end up increasing his weight and cause more sleep apnea. I suggest to stop all energy drinks and alcohol completely and use CPAP which will keep him energetic throughout the day as well. Do revert back if you have any further queries."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple conditions going on right now and fear that it could be a parasitic condition and need some expert advice. Started off with a terrible skin rash that has large and small lesions but no itch. Next a pretty substantial ear infection with swelling and discharge. Now the infection seems to be in my eye were small whitish-yellow things were coming out from under my eyelid from last evening. I have begun to inspect my mucus as it appears to have the same particles. I am very scared at this point and I appreciate anything you can offer.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement you have been suffering from skin rash without itching, ear infection with swelling and discharge, eye infection with coming out of something whitish-yellow under eyelid, and mucus with the same particles. All these sufferings may happen due to parasitic infestation that is your assumption. I have gone through your case several times and I think that all your sufferings may result from any infection due to any cause or allergies.Your skin rash may develop from any kind of allergies like food allergy, drug reaction or allergy, dust, or mite allergy. Then you developed an ear infection which may be due to bacterial cause. After that, you may suffer from conjunctivitis which is easy to catch through touching. You may get conjunctivitis by touching your infected hand that had touched your ear. In conjunctivitis, whitish-yellow discharge may come out under eyelid. You can use an antibacterial drop on your affected ear and eye with antihistamine along with or without broad-spectrum antibiotics orally. But in the case of viral infection, these medications do not work. Wash your eye with water regularly and before touching any part of the body wash your hands with soap or sanitizer. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 26 years old. I am going to get married in another four months. I started masturbating six years back to give it a try.

I understand your symptoms well. The only problem with you is you have been anxious about the whole issue. Believe me, there are no other problems with you. Physiologically or hormonally there are no problems with you. Anxiety is a vicious cycle. You become anxious, you disrupt your normal habits, then it makes even more anxious. Well, you need to start with a schedule. Either in the morning or in the evening you have to workout for at least 45 minutes. You start with this, the rest of it will follow. Because when you workout well, your physiology would be stabilized, you will get more sleep and by default, you would take enough diet. Once you are focused on other things to do definitely you will not feel like masturbating the whole day. For premature ejaculation you can take tablet Tramadol roughly three hours before sex, it delays ejaculation.

I have awful joint pain but minimal swelling and occasional slight inflammation in blood tests. The RA test is negative. Systemic steroid injection gives massive improvement. My consultant started me on Arava recently. At the same time, I have been weaning myself off Tramadol after being put on this irresponsibly by a pain consultant. Within a couple of days of starting Arava, a background headache began and a few days ago this reached an agonizing peak. The only thing that helped was Aspirin. My BP was raised and my Lisinopril has now been doubled. I stopped the Arava. My current medications are Lisinopril, Simvastatin, Omeprazole, Duloxetine. The headache is better but still in the background. So, I have the double issue of this and stopping Tramadol. My question is - Is the headache caused mostly by the Arava? And how long should I wait before seeing GP again? My BP is much better. I stress I am prone to migraines in any case.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. The headache is likely to have been caused by a combination of the Arava (Leflunomide) and your raised blood pressure. Although we cannot know how much each of these contributed? Anyway, if your blood pressure rose a lot on Arava it is probably best not to have this again. Perhaps Methotrexate would be better for you. Has this drug been mentioned to you? Alternatives would be Hydroxychloroquine or Sulphasalazine. I suggest trying to see your consultant or specialist nurses again to discuss these drugs. It might be possible to reduce your Lisinopril back to normal dose soon, your GP can help with this, perhaps in a month.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have what I believe is a panic disorder.

This time I have tried without alcohol and it has gone on for 7 months. What I would like to know is why I get stuck in severe fight or flight for so long and what can I do to help myself. It is like my thoughts are driving this too.","Doctor":"Hello. You are probably experiencing high levels of anxiety and panic symptoms which make you feel edgy and finding it difficult to relax. Physiological signs of sympathetic nervous system activation can happen in anxiety and panic disorders. Alcohol does not help and can make the situation worse. It is good that you are staying away from alcohol. Cut down on coffee, tea, caffeinated drinks. Regular exercise helps. Deep breathing techniques and progressive muscle relaxation can help to calm yourself. Have you had your general examination done to exclude physical health causes like thyroid problems? Sometimes blood tests may be needed. I note that you are on Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine (attachment removed to protect patient identity) which are both effective medication to treat depression and anxiety disorders. Dosage may need adjusting/optimising depending on your response and tolerability. Discuss with your doctor during your next review. Also discuss about CBT/psychological therapy to manage anxiety and panic symptoms. Hope this helps. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 22-year-old man. I have suffered for two years with chronic, nearly debilitating fatigue. Doctors initially suspected a vitamin deficiency or autoimmune illnesses as the cause, but all tests came back negative or normal. However, when I started this summer to notice myself waking up and gasping in the night, my doctors decided to evaluate me for a sleep breathing disorder. I underwent a home test and then an in-lab test. My in-lab test results were as follows: my AHI was normal, but my Respiratory Disturbance Index was 11.3/hour. My lowest oxygen level was 82%, and my REM sleep accounted for just 10 % of total sleep time. Based on these results, my doctor diagnosed me with mild obstructive sleep apnea. My doctor has recommended an oral appliance as the first step for treating this condition, but I know that CPAP is a more common solution. I am really not sure what the best course of action is. All I want is to reduce my fatigue levels and get my life back. What is the best option at this point?","Doctor":"Hi. As per your medical history it looks like sleep apnea with obstruction. We all can agree that it is a disorder which takes away the quality of life and it is very frustrating at times. Good news is that you have been diagnosed so early. Current treatment with CPAP is the best treatment for medical conditions and things will improve over a period of time. Other things to be seen are overweight, sleeping position, stress mangement and any surgical cause of this obstruction which would require a operative correction. Check your blood pressure regularly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I think I have a trematode (fluke) on my eyes and it seems to enter behind the eye as well.

What type of fluke can do this, live on the eyes and globe and also enter inside and behind the eye? And what medicine do I need to treat this? Triclabendazole or is there other medicine? I have tried with Praziquantel and it did not work. Also, I have tried Ivermectin, Albendazole and Mebendazole but it is stil in my eye. What can I do it is very painful and do I need a rehab treatment or sort like Cortizone or is it not necessary?","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your problem, I am not very sure that it is a (fluke) trematode in your eye. By the description of the anomaly that you are giving, I think it is a floater. Just check for images of floaters eye on google and you should see exactly what I am talking about. Floaters are generally harmless and are present without any apparent visual loss and no significant lifetime morbidity to the eye. In some cases, having a floater can be a dangerous sign, which may signify posterior vitreous detachment, retinal tears, and other vitreoretinal pathologies. To diagnose further I will need the duration since when you have started seeing these floating objects in your eyes. If they have started very recently then it can be a start of posterior vitreous detachment or retinal detachment or tear and therefore, you should consult an ophthalmologist, preferably a vitreo retinal specialist immediately. In case of chronic, long term duration, most probably it is harmless and therefore you do not require any treatment if it is not affecting your vision significantly, but still, you should consult an ophthalmologist for eye examination regarding your problem to rule out any other issue.

Some chronic low-grade nausea that can disappear for weeks at a time and is not usually accompanied by a headache. I went through the gamut with GP, he then referred me to an ENT, and then to a neurologist. I am still getting some headaches but have had a clear CT scan of sinuses. A full neurological exam was done and that was normal, and the neurologist did not seem to think that additional imaging (MRI) was needed because my exam was normal. Even though it was a CT scan of the sinuses, they would have seen the brain (particularly frontal lobe) and notified of any abnormalities they could see. I had a clear MRI approximately one year ago for some twitching and muscle pain. Do you agree that further examination is not warranted? In other words, with the above information is a structural problem unlikely?","Doctor":"Hello. You have been elaborate in providing your medical history and that always helps to form an opinion. Coming to your straightforward query, I really do not see any indication for a fresh brain imaging study like CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in view of your transient, very short lasting symptoms and a normal MRI brain, just one year back. Instead, I would suggest here to get one electroencephalogram (EEG) done to look for abnormal electrical discharges in the brain during those episodes. EEG done during the time frame when you are frequently having those episodes will be more rewarding in terms of diagnostic importance. With a normal neurological examination and normal MRI, you should stay calm and assured that it is nothing serious. Lastly and importantly, anxiety is the commonest cause of such symptoms. Please start doing mental relaxation exercises, meditation, yoga and observe for improvement.

I require your advice and treatment as we are trying for a baby. I have attached my reports.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The tiny calcification and minimal hydrocele will not interfere with your fertility. Usually, both arise as a result of local trauma or local infection. I do not know how long the swelling in scrotum (hydrocele) is there? What you are taking to improve sperm count are sufficient to achieve fertility. However, you can add two more drugs to prevent or avoid the interference of calcification and hydrocele to fertility as well as to cure it. Kalarchi kaai seed kernal chooranam, take 10 gm, mix with egg white yolk and make a paste using a finger. Apply this paste on both scrotum at night. Continue this for three months. This is the only medicine to cure hydrocele. In most of the cases, this drug alone can cure it. If the hydrocele is increasing in size, then allopathy doctors can drain the fluid using a needle. I do not think it is required in your case. Take Nandhi mezhugu capsule. One capsule in the morning after food, for five days. Again two days gap, then again take the drug for five days followed by two days gap. Thus, in a week, you take five days capsule and the remaining two days no capsule. This can remove calcification in the testis. This drug can be taken up to six months. However, as the calcification of tiny areas of testis will not interfere in fertility, you can just apply Kalarchi chooranam external to reduce the hydrocele. If you wish, you also take Nandhi mezhugu. You will be all right within the next three months. Trauma or infection in testis. Previous investigations can be repeated after three months.

On examination: Right eye: Dvr: 6/9 with corrections, Anterior segment: Lasik flap, Fundus: chorioretinal degeneration. Left eye : Dvl: 6/9 with corrections, Anterior segment: Lasik flap, Fundus: chorioretinal degeneration. Intraocular pressure : 14mmHg, Intraocular pressure : 16.5mmHg, Diagnosis: Lasik with Myopic chorioretinal degeneration.","Doctor":"Hello.  It seems from the history that you have undergone LASIK surgery for correction of myopia. The symptoms of light sensitivity, headache on watching computer or TV indicate dry eyes which is common following LASIK surgery. No need to worry the treatment is also simple and you can use artificial tears eye drops. Since vision is good no need to worry. Chorioretinal degeneration of retina is common in high myopics and since vision is good it is not causing any problem.  If you have symptoms like distorted vision, then you require evaluation by other tests like fundus fluorescence in angiography and depending on the result treatment can be planned, if required.

MRSA is not related to your spinal stenosis problem. Kindly tell the exact MRI report as if there are no hyper intensities in spinal cord we will not suspect autoimmune etiology also. Spinal stenosis is commonly caused by intervertebral disc prolapse which causes narrowing of spinal canal and produce symptoms like radiculopathy pain, neurogenic claudication and if severe can cause muscle atrophy. The occurrence of symptoms are not related to your hospitalization and minor symptoms might have been ignored previously. If spinal stenosis is severe, it requires surgery. Kindly consult neurosurgeon or spine surgeon for further management. Iif you are on in my no suppression therapy like steroids or if you are going for surgery then medication for MRSA carrier state may be required, discuss with your doctor regarding this and take antibiotics appropriately."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How can I figure out my conception date? My last menstrual period was three months back. I had my dating ultrasound and it put the GA at 9 weeks and 3 days. Also there was a CRL measurement of 26.96. My due date based on LMP and ultrasound are different. Please answer. Also how many \\"safe\\" days are there after a period?","Doctor":"Hello. First of let me tell you that if your menses is coming every month with 2-3 days here or there then it is absolutely normal cycle. Now in normal cycle ovulation occurs in the middle of the cycle (around 12-18th day of cycle) when conception can actually happen. First 8 and last 8 days of your cycle are safe period in normal menses as there is no chance of pregnancy thus safe.  Now pregnancy can happen in regular and irregular cycle both. And it is far more difficult to calculate the actual date of conception. Other than that it is easy to remember last date of menses and easy for calculation, so we are calculating pregnancy from last day of menses. In technical terms there are two age of pregnancy one is gestational age and other is embryonic age. Embryonic age is actual age from conception and gestational age is from last day of menstruation. So do not get confused. Lastly if your pregnancy is growing well that I can assume by your history then no need to worry and the due date according to last menstrual period is the date. Now what is importance of this date? It means if delivery pain starts near this date then let it happen. Do not interfere and if it does not start till date then induce pain with some method of induction."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was at the dentist yesterday and had a gum cleaning and now today there are 2 bumps in the back of my mouth on top and my gums right there also look red and there more looking like balls per say.","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. The feeling of strange, weird and sometimes loose tooth are major complaints that a patient generally comes with, after having the cleaning (scaling and root planing) done. This is because of the removal of the debris. Earlier what would have become normal for the patient is now removed (debris) and the patient interprets it somewhat as loose tooth and strange feeling. The redness you are referring to is the erythmatous tissue that generally occurs post cleaning because the gums while cleaning gets separated from the tooth structure (like an injury). However, the healing capacity of gums is very fast and it would be go in 3-4 days. Referring to the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the bumps you are saying, you do not need to worry about. As also you are saying that there is no pain means they are not infected. They might have occured due to the injury of hard palate during cleaning. I would suggest you to not worry as they are generally seen after cleaning is done. They would be gone after some days (generally 3-4 days). However, if the bumps persists beyond one week, I would advise you to have a visit to your nearest dentist for proper and overall examination. Moreover, I would suggest you to keep maintaining good oral hygiene by brushing twice daily and floss regularly. Also rinse your mouth with oral rinses for 4 days a week and 3 weeks a month. I hope I have satisfied you with my answer."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is facing pain at periodical time since 6 months and period facing two times in a month and it remains for 4 to 6 days. Although she never faced this situation before. My mother's age is 52 years now. What should she do now. Already visited two gynecologist and they advised us to prepare for operation. As per their instruction checked the ultrasonography test, acknowledged us about the ovarian tumor and advised us for immediate operation. And we also checked the blood pressure, ECG , chest X-ray, thyroid, HIV test. Everything is fine except blood sugar and blood pressure. Now blood sugar and blood pressure are under control, physician also prescribed tablet Astyfer (400) for pressure and Insulin for blood sugar applying for 4-6-4 units (BB-BL-BD) per day, it is running since 10 days. The first gynecologist prescribed Trapic 650 for 5 days (1 per day), Protera 40 for 14 days (1 per day), and syrup Inozyme for 7 days (2 times per day). Next time, he also prescribed the Trapic 650 for 5 days and Protera 40 for 5 days and Metformin SR (1000) for 14 days (1 per day) also, and advised us to visit after 2 months for next checking. But we decided to check up another gynecologist after 45 days later of the last gynecologist visit. The second doctor advised us for operation and also prescribed for test of blood sugar, thyroid, ECG, chest X-ray, HIV, reports also attached. He prescribed tablet Stamlo (5), Zentel (400) 1 tablet, Astyfer XT for 20 days (one tablet per day). Astyfer is running now. I request you to kindly check the attached report and advise me what to do now.","Doctor":"Hello. From your history, it is obvious that your mother definitely have to go through the operation and remove the uterus. But one thing is that there is nothing I found like ovarian tumor or something like that in USG (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I have seen all the reports except first which is not loading. Because menses normally ceases at around 40 to 45 years of age or sometime it may extent up to 48 to 50 years of age. So if your mother is menstruating up till 52 years of age with USG suggestive of fibroid uterus with adenomyotic changes, your mother must have remove her uterus and send for examination that whether there is carcinoma or not. And if not then nothing to worry. And if positive then may need another operation or chemotherapy. In your mother's case if carcinoma is there, there is more chance that it would be endometrial carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of uterine muscles. I do not know how there is a doubt about ovarian carcinoma. And if there is chance or good reason for suspecting than than your mother must have to do CT scan of abdo pelvis and some other blood test also. Rest of the test which are done is prerequisite for operation. Mostly they will remove ovaries also along with the operation at the same time. Because there is a chance of ovarian carcinoma in future. And during past life and at 52 years of age there is also no role of ovaries remain. Before operation your sugar level and blood pressure should be under control so what they are giving you. And physician fitness and/or anesthetic fitness will required before operation. So better to get it done as early as possible. It is because if there is endometrial carcinoma also than why to give it a chance to grow. It is better that you remove it on first place."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, After I ate some food, I had a piece of chewy candy and felt a hole on one of my bottom right molars. I immediately spit the candy out, to find a piece of my tooth, and when I shone a flashlight into my mouth, I saw that a chunk of my molar was missing, on the area right next to my back molar. I am not sure if the chunk is a filling or an actual piece of my teeth, but the gaping hole looks pretty deep and there was a lot of sensitivity when I rinsed out my mouth with cool water. Should I be worried, and what can I do to minimize the sensitivity before I see my dentist?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your query and it seems that the filling portion of the tooth is broken (attachment removed to protect patient identity). No need to worry as the tooth seems to be vital. Sensitivity is normal here because dentin of your tooth has been exposed due to broken piece. I would suggest to get this cavity filled soon as the delay would cause problems like food lodging and over time caries. Atleast have a temporary filling done for time being. Sensitivity can be minimised by brushing with fluoride toothpastes. Take a fluoridated paste on your finger tip and massage it gently over the whole involved tooth, brush after 2 minutes with a regular toothpaste after that."},{"Patient":"​Hello doctor, I have been seeing a PCP for a couple of years following my former doctor's retirement. I saw him last time for minor but persistent abdominal pain and blood in the stool which stopped after stopping low dose Aspirin three times a day for one week. He sent me for a CT which revealed a number of things and referred me to a GI specialist who suggested an upper GI. The technician said it would cost me more and waiting for getting my insurance. My question is should I get a second opinion from a new PCP for changes in diet, antibiotic for H. Pylori and other interventions before going to the expense of Upper GI or get a second opinion from another GI specialist about my condition? I am currently taking Sertraline.","Doctor":"Hello.  I had gone through all the details that are posted. The causes for persistent pain in the left lower abdomen were not answered by PCP or your CT (computed tomography) abdomen. Normally if there is frank blood in stools we need to do proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to look for lower gastrointestinal causes. If there are black colored stools then we suspect upper GI pathology (ulcer). So we go for upper GI endoscopy to look for the bleeding cause. Aspirin and Naprosyn may cause gastritis and ulceration which might be the cause they wanted to look for on upper GI endoscopy but it will not answer your blood in stools. CT abdomen has shown multiple things. Mainly important are: 1) 8mm nodule in the right lung middle lobe which needs further characterization. 2) Multiple hepatic cysts were mentioned but characterization was not done. Is it a hydatic cyst or what kind of cyst needs mention? 3) Left non-obstructive renal calculus and a renal cyst. Again characterization of the renal cyst was not done whether benign or Bosnaik's grade? This renal thing is the one that fits into the location of your persistent left lower abdominal pain. For gastric ulcer pain, you can take Esmoprazole or Pantoprazole. If you get UGIscopy we need to look for ulcer and take a biopsy from that and send for histopathology to look for H.Pylori in it. If it is positive treatment is for two weeks only, so do not use antibiotics for H.Pylori. Avoid spicy foods, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs), and alcohol which will help to reduce acidity. Kindly consult a new PCP, discuss these issues with him and then decide on further evaluation and management. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Recently (the last week at the most) my lymph nodes in my neck have been very swollen. When looking at the back of my throat, I can see small tonsil stones, small, but many. There is swelling which I am hoping is associated with the stones and there is a lot of swelling at the top of my right tonsil. The right side of my tonsil definitely is sore but fluctuates throughout the day. I have used tobacco, tobacco-products fairly consistently for the last two years, smoking at most a cigarette per day, and vaping. There are also flesh-colored bumps on the back of my mouth on the left side, they are not painful though. There is one on the top and one down by the tongue. I have not noticed these previously. My depression sometimes affects my hygiene, so I am hoping that this could be the cause of the stones. I have been brushing twice a day, flossing, gargling with salt water, and mouth wash. Since doing this, I have noticed much less swelling in my lymph nodes and a little less in my tonsils. My diet also has not been the healthiest lately (eating about one meal a day) and my sleep schedule has been a wreck. I am just really hoping it is not cancer but I have yet to go see a doctor.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from swelling of lymph nodes on the neck with swelling of tonsil and sore throat. You lead an erratic life. You are a smoker. You do not maintain your oral hygiene regularly. You also do not take your meal regularly. Your presenting clinical features can result from strep throat, peritonsillar abscess, tonsilloliths (tonsil stone), tonsillitis, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or carcinoma, etc. According to your picture that is provided here you may suffer from tonsil stone or peritonsillar abscess. In both cases, treatment are almost the same. You should take a broad-spectrum antibiotic for 7-10 days with gargle with salt mixed warm water, mouth wash, apple cider vinegar, and brush regularly. Usually tonsil stones dislodge themselves over time. If the clinical features such as difficulty in deglutition, difficulty in breathing, breathing difficulty during sleeping, pain radiating to ear, etc., occur consider as a medical emergency and consult with an ENT specialist for tonsillectomy. You should observe your lymph nodes carefully. Any sudden change in size or shape of lymph node, high fever, weight loss, night sweating, persistent fatigue, respiratory distress, etc., should be considered as alarming signs for carcinoma. So do not be worried. Take balanced food and maintain oral hygiene strictly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old. I have chronic pain in joints and morning stiffness.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I have been having contractions for six days straight now. They started at 20 minutes apart, then got closer. They have been two minutes apart lasting an average of 54 seconds for three days. They have not let up or have stopped. I went to the hospital and they said there has not been enough change in my cervix and sent me home and said not to come back unless I start bleeding. During the last checkup, I was 100% effaced, 2 cm, and 0 stations. I have been leaking clear fluid like crazy, but when I called they said it was probably a discharge. My legs and feet are very swollen. I know something is not right, but they refuse to run any tests because they believe it is false labor. What do I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Braxton Hicks contractions do occur about six weeks prior to labor but are generally not associated with effacement. If they were real labor pains you should have started fetal descent from 0 stations by now as well. Now, if the intensity of the pains are increasing between contractions then they are true labor pains and if not they are false labor pains. Ladies tend to gain weight because of hemodilution and edema in pregnancy i.e. swelling of the feet, it is a normal part of pregnancy. Leaking per vaginum is again significant. If it looks like water and starts suddenly, I would request you to reach the nearest hospital as soon as possible. I would finally suggest you meet your gynecologist and request NST (nonstress test) for the fetus and examination of the cervix.

Suddenly, I was unable to bend forward at all and started feeling extreme pain while sitting. The pain is radiating from the lower back to the left hip. Even after 12 hours, the pain has not reduced a bit.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your complaints and understand your concern. I generally have seen many cases like this at my clinic. I advise them rest, analgesics, anti-inflammatory tablets, and ice pack till the symptoms reduce to some extent. Then I get an x-ray and if necessary an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) done to find out the exact reason. In your case, there are three possibilities: 1. Soft tissue inflammation, there may be no bony involvement, only the soft tissues around the region might be inflamed that may be causing the pain. 2. Neuropathy, there may be a partial or complete inflammation of the nerves in that region that may be the root cause of such a kind of pain. 3. Disc prolapse- there may be a compressed nerve in the spine somewhere that might be causing radiating pain in those regions. The possibility of a disc prolapse should be kept in mind. I suggest you get an x-ray as well as an MRI done to find out the exact cause. Physiotherapy, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory drugs should help until then. Do get back to me after your reports are ready. But I assure one thing, even if it is either of the above three possibilities, all have a good prognosis and you should eventually get back to normal in the coming few days. Nothing to worry about."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a teenager. My left eye has got a power of -2.50 D and I am near-sighted. Will my lazy eye recover to normal vision by using spectacles? How long does it take?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. As you have told that you have -2.5 D in the left eye but you have not mentioned refraction of the right eye. Please tell me your exact age? From how long you are using glasses? Do you patch your normal eye or have you done patching previously? Please explain the refraction of both eyes and your corrected vision with these glasses? Is there any deviation of eyes (crossed eyes or squint eyes)? What I understand from this that your right eye is 6/6 and the left eye is lazy eye due to myopia (minus glasses). So actually lazy eye is when one eye can see a clear image and the second eye cannot see clearly due to refractive error and the vision remains blurry in that eye. So vision will not develop properly if glasses are not used at an early age. The connection between the eyes and brain develop in 8-11 years of age and that is the sensitive period. The most common cause of lazy eye is the difference of refractive error between two eyes (Anisometropic amblyopia), the difference of more than one diopter can cause lazy eye (amblyopia). So the most sensitive period is 8-11 years, but in a few paper they say lazy can be improved in teens by full correction with glasses and patching of the normal eye (results are not unpredicted). So you can try full correction glasses and at day time while you are awake patch your right eye for two to six hours and use your left eye so that vision could develop in that. The success rate is less if the patching started at a late age, and amblyopia is severe. One more thing do not patch your right eye all the time because there could be reverse amblyopia due to lack of use of right eye. Studies have shown that patching for two hours and six hours have almost equal results. So patch your good eye while reading or doing some work. Consult your eye doctor for repeat refraction every three to six months. If patching does not improve the vision after six months, there are a fewer chances of further improvement."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,  I have a question about my soon to be 12-year-old son. Since he was 1 year old he has had febrile seizures about once a year. They only happen at night. When he is sick during the day I would give him Motrin or Tylenol. Through out the night and he would not have any symptoms. When he did not show signs of being sick that night his fever would spike. Two years ago we had his first video EEG and there were no abnormalities or no concerns. We did MRI, blood tests, and EKG all are normal. He had two seizures this year both while being sick. So the neurologist wanted another EEG. So we did a video EEG. The first night nothing looked wrong so she wanted to keep him another night. During the day he was getting sick he was running a little fever. So that night they choose not to give him Motrin to see if he would have a seizure and he did. It lasted a minute and was a full-body one. They looked over the tape and said there was no evidence of one coming on it came so quickly. They believe (but are not sure) that it came from the frontal lobe. They put him on Keppra for two weeks and then the doctor looked it over with her partners and they decide that Trileptal and Keppra would be what he needs. I happen to total disagree. He has never had a seizure during the day or one without a fever. I feel they so quickly diagnosed him with epilepsy without considering that all his tests are normal. That seizure they saw came on because we didn't give him medicine for his fever. Which to me seems like he has the rare case of febrile seizures lasting till the age of 12 years. He did not have any seizures last year but just two seizures this year. I personally want to try and build his immune system to stop him from getting sick to see if that will prevent his seizures. His father disagrees with me and agrees with the doctor. I believe the side effects of both these medicine out way the actual problem. I am just overwhelmed and stressed. Because I do not know what is the right thing to do? Can febrile seizures last to the age of 12? Is it rare for someone to have a seizure maybe once a year then not have any, then have one the next year? Does the medicine he is on sound too extreme? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. I would say that both you and your doctor are correct. Your doctor diagnosed epilepsy because: 1. Primary epilepsy is more common in those adolescents who had febrile seizures. 2. Along with the fact, the EEG (electroencephalogram) was supportive of epilepsy, because, the febrile seizure would not start in a single region and spread over. Your concern is also justified because: 1. The child is a very classic case of febrile seizures. 2. The night when the child had a seizure, the child had a fever and the anti-pyretic was not given. I think what would have happened is, doctors would have thought that at 12 years it could not be a febrile seizure, along with that they found probable origin in the frontal lobe, so they prescribed AEDs (anti-epileptic drugs). Have patience, as of now continue the medicines. But three months down the line repeat an EEG when he does not have any fever (after taking off the medicines in a controlled environment, if we can do sleep-deprived EEG, would be better) if he has an epilepsy syndrome, the EEG would still be abnormal. This should be able to settle the whole issue."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have taken meningitis vaccination for visa process. I suffered headache with visual aura with dreamy sleep and less sleep for three months. I started treatment in India and took Cipralex, and Escitalopram. CT scan was normal. My symptoms relieved for about 80-90%. I gradually tapered off the treatment. Later, mild dreamy sleep problem with mild and sound sensitivity occurs. I did not took any medicine for that. I also suffered from scalp pain in head and treated for three months with Phenergan, and Neocalm plus. I felt only temporary relief. MRI was done in consultation with neurologist. Results are normal. I was on Cipralex 10 mg, Naproxen sodium 250 mg then gradually tapered. After that I am suffering from dreamy sleep all day and localized head pain episodes 2-3 times in a week when sleep disturbed in the previous night. Meanwhile, I was heavily stressed due to family issues and job pressure. Once again I was prescribed the same medicines but I did not take and tried to control it with yoga and meditation. I have mild light and sound sensitivity which is quite tolerable. My major problem is disturbed dreamy sleep and episodes of localized head pain in the scalp only. I took vitamin D, B12, calcium for six months. My elevated triglycerides are due to SSRI 230 mg/dl. At present, I am alright but want to get rid of symptoms. My symptoms are muscle tension and nerve pain. I did eyes test OCT and my eyes are normal. My questions are even if I am not stressed I do not get dreamless and refreshing sleep why? Which is suitable medicine in general? Can Flunarizine cause more deficiency of calcium as already I am deficient? Cipralex and Esclitopram are habit forming but I was very comfortable with that it causes weight gain and elevation of triglycerides so I tapered off to end. But after some time dreamy sleep and scalp mild pain comes back. What to do? Kindly suggest and advise some medicines.","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms seem to be related to tension type headache, which is a benign headache. Light and sound intolerance are features of migraine, but the other symptoms you explain, are more compatible with tension type headache. Nevertheless, I agree with your doctor treatment regarding Escitalopram. You should know that the sleep disorders are related to different causes depression, daily stress and anxiety, vitamin D deficiency, an abnormal sleep regime, caffeine intake, etc. I would recommend taking Vitamin D if there is low plasma levels of this vitamin. Regarding your sleep disorder, I would recommend starting Zolpidem for a couple of weeks 10 mg before sleep. You can try half a tablet before going to 10 mg. Melatonine intake can regulate your sleep rhythms too, but it is taken for a more prolonged time than Zolpidem and its effects are lower. A good sleeping hygiene (sleep always at the same time, avoid straining physical or emotional activities before sleep, avoid caffeine intake) would help too. If all these tips and drugs are not helpful, a prolonged brain EEG (electroencephalogram) during sleep would help diagnose any possible sleeping disorders. Regarding Flunarizine, I would explain that this is a calcium channel blocker and as such it can interact with calcium or vitamin D in high amounts. But usually it does not affect the calcium levels. You can try taking Escitalopram for three months initially and then try Flunarizine, if no good results on Escitalopram. I would not recommend taking them both initially. You should know that Escitalopram achieves its effect after three weeks from the starting, and the main changes to be seen are a reduce in the frequency of headaches and also mood changes (optimism). You can try taking Amitriptyline too, if you do not have any symptoms relief after the first month on Escitalopram. It can be really helpful with the sleep too. All the drugs have some adverse effects, but the benefits are higher. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been diagnosed with Sacroiliitis caused by AS and hypermobility, which I manage without tablets, and by doing exercises, stretching and seeing an osteopath once a month to prevent flare-ups.

Well, I was born with an optic nerve abnormality they call it pseudo-papilledema. I was born with high hyperopia en strabismus (high hyperopia may be associated with blurring of the optic disk margin) thats it. My question is, is it possible that this dilution is fake? Or is it possible that the OCT is not working properly in my eyes?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the OCT (optic coherence tomography) reports of your left eye. (attachment removed to proteect patient identity). I understand that you have been informed that you have pseudo papilloedema of your left eye. Let me explain to you in very simple words what pseudo papilloedema means and what an OCT actually does. The term \\"pseudo\\" papilloedema, as the name suggests is an appearance of false swelling of the optic disc. Here even though the disc is normal it appears to be swollen and hence named so. An OCT is an imaging modality, it simply can image a structure (in the eye) and tell us exact measurements of its heights, extent, cellular number, etc. It does so by comparing age and race matched set of control data to your eye. (Indicated by the black colored dotted line on the right-hand side of the black & white retina image). Most of this line in your eye falls well within the normal range (green background) so it is reasonably normal. It is however not able to measure function or how well the eye/ that structure is performing. To further simplify, your eyes do not have any true problem with the optic nerve. Secondly, a functional assessment of the nerves cannot be done using an OCT. In case you feel that you would like to have further tests done, I would like to advise you regarding getting a check of your intraocular pressure and visual field tests along with regular eye tests.

Doctor gave me cream and suppositories. I am in agony and cannot move without being in pain so went back to doctor today who said they need to be drained. I spoke with the surgeon in the hospital who advized that because I am 30 weeks pregnant they will not give me general anesthesic to drain them. And instead keep doing the cream and suppositories and also ice packs and rest. My question is that the piles are easily the size of two grapes in one and I cannot even sit down. I have to lay down and cannot do anything. Has anyone experienced this size of piles before and will they just decrease in size and if so what is the normal timeline as I am finding the pain hard.","Doctor":"Hi. Piles in pregnancy can happen due to increased intraabdominal pressure. For patients who have hemorrhoids before pregnancy they increase more. Now as it is 30 weeks you can wait for another 6 to 7 weeks. They may decrease in size once delivery is over or else you can go for surgery. Now use cream locally.

I have been told by my basketball coach, in order to grow taller, to undergo the following kind of intervention, but my question is, where and how to undertake such a procedure. This is the procedure: Lase the legs' growth plates to zap them away, and then inject treated stem cells from new growth plates in their place. These then respond to cytokine (chemicals) from genetic engineering, that cause growth. And I have been told that I can avoid acromegaly by having the new stem cells only responding to a unique chemical variation of human growth hormone that has no effect on other than engineering new growth plates. So, how and where can I do this?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iclinq.com. Stem cell transplantation is a highly specialized procedure and is generally done for specific indications. Almost all such procedures are conducted by the Surgical Oncology Teams (Specialized Cancer Hospitals). Stem cell tranplantation are generally done in patients with hematological malignancies after total body irradiation so that their bodies can generate new blood cells from the transplanted stem cells. Recently, it is also being used for advanced organ failure but such use remains experimental and is limited to research centers. Having said that, let us come to your particular case. Well in all honesty even if such a treatment is contemplated; it would be totally against current guidelines and ethical norms and probably no one will be willing to do such a procedure in your particular scenario. It has been done for increasing height in children suffering from blood cancers following total body irradiation but other than that absolutely no other indication. That too has been done at research centers with mixed results. With regards to your questions. It is extremely unlikely if not impossible that you will find anyone offering such treatment anywhere across the globe, legally. Yes, the last word is important as many things happen in shady markets but then all those procedures are illegal, unethical and should not be done. The suggested treatment is absurd, highly questionable and unethical is all respects. Additionally you should also know that Stem Cell Transplant is a transplant and it has serious potential for life threatening complications. Just to name a few, infections, bleeding, acute and chronic rejection, graft vs host disease and so on. The million dollar question is not that where you can get this done; the question is whether you should even think about it and the answer is an \\"absolutely not recommended\\".

Just 2 months is a very short period for you to decide your fertility potential. Just check if following tests have been done.

The list goes on and on. I am completely heartbroken for her, watching her and have tried nearly everything thinking it was nothing more than a child that had been given the world but I realize it is much deeper than that.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your situation in trying to deal with your daughter's behaviour. Is her behaviour the same everywhere? What do the teachers say? Does she interact well with her friends? It will help to know whether her behavioral issues are limited to home or present at school as well? A detailed assessment including developmental history will be needed to formulate the reasons behind her behavior. It needs to be clarified whether this is a behavioral issue or whether there is an underlying emotional problem manifesting as oppositional behavior. Discuss with her school teacher first. Explore whether she can see a psychologist based at school, if available. If problems are significant and persistent, it is advisable to consult a child psychologist or child psychiatrist near your place for a comprehensive assessment and manage accordingly. Continue with clear and consistent boundaries. Parenting in this situation can be difficult and exhausting but consistency is the key. Get support from your partner, grandparents as applicable. Most children eventually learn to adhere to parental rules and boundaries. Getting appropriate support will help to make the situation better.

He said he will have to do a root canal which I do not want to do. I was thinking of other ways to go around this because my nerve has nothing wrong in it. I do not think I should get one if my nerve is not infected. I was thinking he could just remove the filling and and replace it with a new one which makes sense. Anyway if we do a root canal he is going to drill in the filling anyway. So let me know if a root canal is the only option because I do not feel like going through that.","Doctor":"Hello. It all depends on your symptoms. Why did you visit the dentist if the filling was already done? Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort in it? If yes, then unfortunately, there is no option left but root canal treatment for it, because it might have touched the roots almost.  Secondly, after the removal of filling, re-filling at the same point will not be possible because if the pulp of root is near as it cannot bear any sort of filling directly on top of it. If it is done in this way it will simply cause huge swelling or throbbing pain will start so the only way to save a tooth is to clean the pulp i.e. nerves of root canal through this treatment and then put a cap on it. You may delay this treatment until you experience any symptoms of a root canal. Can you tell me about your symptoms and provide me with a radiograph? So I can tell you exactly what you can do best."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had an ultrasound abdomen done due to some urine issues. In the findings, they observed gallbladder polyp. I am very scared as I read online that these may turn into cancer in the future.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  As per them, there are multiple polyps measuring 1 to 3 mm. And as per history, you are asymptomatic. Usually, polyps larger than 2 cm are almost malignant and need surgery. While polyps less than 6 mm are usually cholesterol polyp. They usually never turn malignant. As per the study of around 150 patients with polyps less than 5 mm. Only 13 needed surgery for pain and none were malignant. Almost all remained stable in size or decreased. So for your case, I think there is no need to worry. Just you can do follow up USG (ultrasound) after six months to look for size. Also as per your records, your BMI (body mass index) is on the higher side as per Indian standards. As obesity is also a risk factor for cholesterol polyps. Weight reduction by 4-6 kg and diet modification to reduce fat intake is desirable. Cholesterolosis of gallbladder. Follow up USG at six months. Weight reduction, low fat diet."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For the past 17 years of my life, I had perfect eyes. I had a slight sinus allergy but nothing else. During high school I took a 500 mg Biotin pill in hopes to stimulate hair growth and the next day my eyes began to tear excessively. The following day my right eye stopped but my left eye continued. It has been almost two and a half years now and my left eye waters excessively to the point people think I am crying. This ordeal is really depressing. Especially, since I have been to four eye specialists and they are not able to help me. One said I had dry eyes, other said I had blocked tear duct, and other said I do not blink. I am currently on Restasis and still no improvement. Please help. This may sound foolish but could it have been the pill? If so is there something I can do or take to reverse it?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, do not get depressed. Depression leads to a lot of other serious health issues. Now coming to your problem, I do not think your problem is related to Biotin use (at least not directly). Biotin is a vitamin, part of vitamin B-complex, which is required for many things (i.e. its deficiency in the body leads to a lot of problems). If you have taken antibiotics for a long time then you might have had a biotin deficiency. This deficiency might have resulted in conjunctivitis, which may cause excessive tearing of eyes. And the treatment is regular supplements of vitamin A and B complex. The other cause and this is one of the most common causes is a blocked nasolacrimal duct. See allergies often leads to swelling of tissues around it and thus the ducts get blocked. When the allergies resolve the ducts open by themselves. But sometimes infection or some other cause may keep it blocked. Thus causing excessive tearing. I do not think other causes of excessive tearing are relevant in your case. You should get your eyes checked by an ophthalmologist. Ask him/her especially to check for nasolacrimal duct blockage. Alternatively, you can also do a warm massage. Massage your part of the nose, on the side of the eye in which excess tearing is there, from the portion near eye to downwards 1 cm for 10 minutes every few hours, if possible with a warm cloth. This might relieve your blockage to some extent. Take care not to injure yourself. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 17-year-old male. For the past six to seven days I am having a cold. My mucus has turned green and also my mucus become hard and stays just at the end of my nose.

But today in the morning I have coved my finger with a cloth to clean it I just got only one hair out from my nose. After I came home today I washed my nose with water and got some wet mucus. When I tried to clean with cloth I got only one small hair. Later when I forcefully blew my nose I got four to five hairs along with the mucus. I fear that some hair would have gone inside during my action of cleaning. Now I am worried about brain infection, nose infection.ear infections and what not I read online. What to do now? I am totally confused and depressed. Please guide me. From then on I have not blowed, not picked nor put the cloth inside.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Our internal nose has two parts one part which is known as vestibule contains a large number of hair follicles and another part is more inside part of the nose which contains simple mucosa which produces mucus. You seem to be suffering from an acute infection of the nose known as acute rhinosinusitis which is a very common type of nose infection.  You have tried cleaning your nose using fingers and cloth which lead to injury to the hair follicles in your vestibule and caused shedding of the hair which is almost normal with many patients suffering from acute rhinosinusitis. You really need not worry those hairs will grow back.  For acute rhinosinusitis, you need to take antibiotics, decongestant nasal drops and antihistamine tablets. Take Taxim-O (Cefixime) 200 mg two times daily after food for five days, tablet Sinarest (Paracetamol and Chlorpheniramine maleate) three times daily for three days after food. Use Otrivin nasal drops, three times daily for three days.

She was just diagnosed with breast cancer in situ. The medical team says it is not aggressive. The hospital in which she was treated already did a biopsy on her breast. I read today that biopsies can actually open the door to cancerous cells and allow the spread. Also, her surgery is already scheduled for this week. I also read that surgery at such an early stage may cause more problems than there was original. I read an article online. I do not know how reliable it is? Also, in my place, doctors follow a protocol, they will not offer anything but the conventional way which is surgery, no alternative treatments are suggested. What is your advise?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  As far as I was able to understand, the lesion is a high grade (microcalcification and necrosis). Though I had to use google translation. What I am going to tell you is as per recognized and approved evidences it does not include newer theories and understanding which are though upcoming have not yet come in clinical practice. High-grade DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) increases the risk of invasive cancer. What above article has mentioned regarding mortality being the same in DCIS patients and normal individuals is not totally correct. The study which showed mortality of three percent, these patients were treated and it is not sure whether the similar mortality is due to treatment or nature of the disease. The medical community is clear that some DCIS are low grade and may not need treatment and thus have removed DCIS from premalignant. But high-risk DCIS increases risk of having invasive component which might be missed just by biopsies. There is some evidence that we can avoid RT (radiotherapy) in low risk group, but none of the mainstream studies have avoided surgery. The use of hormonal therapy is to avoid recurrence. Now the above article mentions that it does not change overall mortality. But this is due to the fact that we usually detect recurrences earlier and treat them before progressing to advanced stage. If we have not then there is a chance that some of them will progress to aggressive disease. Regarding biopsy there is enough evidence that it does not increase the chance of cancer spreading. These are just hypotheses. Also, it definitely does not affect overall prognosis. Lastly, being from a medical background I do not have an idea regarding natural treatment. Though I would say that all these are just hypotheses and not proven things. As per my idea, she would need a breast conservation therapy plus radiotherapy, and endocrine treatment depending on the final biopsy result. DCIS. Wide local excision, radiotherapy and endocrine therapy depending on the final report, hormone status and invasive component. Six monthly mammography."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have some problems with my heartbeat. It has been three days today and still, I am feeling the same thing.

Now if you are saying all these were normal and still you are having the symptoms, I would like to know any particular stressor that is causing these symptoms? Also, I would like to see your ECG, whether it was a 12 lead with a long lead? If your symptoms are persistent there is a test called telemetry where you wear a device that will record the ECG at the time you are having symptoms.

It seems like you are having a condition known as keratosis tonsil where there will be afrequent collection of whitish debris in the crypts of tonsils. Usually, this condition is not associated with pain and bleeding but commonly it can cause foul smell from the mouth. The pain and bleeding in your case is probably secondary to frequent cleaning which is causing injuries to tonsils and surrounding areas which in turn produces ulcers. Usually, keratosis is a difficult condition to treat and if your symptoms are very significant and recurrent. Then it is better to undergo tonsillectomy which gives a complete cure.

She would spread rumors and talk behind my back to distance me from other hostel mates. I was not able to move on from that feeling. I made some friends at the end of my first year. They are also friends with my roommate. I changed my room in my second year. I will be joining the third year of my college in about eight to nine days. There are a few good friends I have and I do not want to lose them. I fear even they will leave and I will be left alone without anyone. I fear to the point that their interaction with a specific person might ruin their friendship for me. My parents do not allow me to go for college trips. I fear if my friends go out with other people for a trip, they will become acquainted with them and will give me less time or leave me alone. There are many nights I cried, and I need someone to be there with me at all times. I cannot even study properly. In a few days, I will begin my third year at college. I am very scared I do not want to go back there. I want to stay at home. I still have two more years in my college life. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I read about your problem. This kind of problem is common in your age group people. You have depressive symptoms due to which person has more negative thoughts. It happens because of some chemical changes in the brain due to which the brain has difficulty in removing stress. It is a kind of illness and needs treatment.  The treatment includes medicines (antidepressants) and regular counseling sessions. It would be better to give medicines to you after more evaluation. Either you seek treatment from a nearby psychiatrist or you can have an online consultation with me or any other psychiatrist on icliniq.com that would be better and safe in your situation. We will help you out. Until then try to cut the train of thoughts by exercises, yoga and following your daily routine."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I recently had a SPECT scan to evaluate a possible CSF leak. The scan was done with a dye injected into the spine. My brain was scanned and also the abdomen. The scan did not pick-up any abnormalities and a leak was not seen. I was informed today that I may need to have a CT scan of the abdomen for an adrenal issue due to high testerone levels. I assume that the adrenals were seen during the recent CT scan. I am curious to know as to the glands and organs that were visible during this type of scan. I do not want to have another scan if an adrenal problem could have been detected on the SPECT scan.","Doctor":"Hello. I cannot but appreciate what you call your \\"curiosity\\". I would rather call it your awareness and consciousness. One should indeed think twice before going through a radiation exposure for a second time. If I say in one word, the CT scan your doctor has recommended is required if the adrenals are to be visualised. Let me explain and elaborate. Firstly, please note that SPECT and CT are two entirely different imaging technologies (despite the same surname \\"CT\\"). When you had the SPECT, the dye was injected into the central canal, i.e. the CSF cavity of the spine. That way, the dye could reach wherever CSF could reach, so that it could be identified whether CSF was leaking out of its normal boundaries. The dye did not obviously reach the adrenals and so they were not visualised. However, SPECT is usually done in combination with CT (called SPECT-CT). In that case, the adrenals were visualised by the CT component of the scan. Still, this visualization is not sufficient for the adrenals for two reasons. One is that they are very small, so adrenal imaging requires \\"thin\\" sections. Secondly, evaluation of adrenal pathology often involves determining the degree of contrast (aka dye) uptake and washout at specific time intervals. These intervals are programmed into the CT machine under \\"adrenal protocol\\". Your urge to avoid another radiation exposure is reasonable and appreciable. Ultrasound and adrenal protocol MRI may be alternative choices that are free from this risk. However, their applicability in adrenals is quite limited as compared to CT. You may still discuss with your doctor(s) whether ultrasound or MRI may provide the answers they are looking for. So, in conclusion, the adrenals were not visualised in SPECT, and CT is the best way for evaluation of adrenal pathology."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can you, please, explain results? I also have clusters of red and purple dots all over my body and get winded easy. Results: Lupus Anticoagulant Comp. Dilute Prothrombin Time(dPT) 56.2 High sec 0.0 − 55.0 01, dPT Confirm Ratio 1.16 Ratio 0.00 − 1.20 01, thrombin time 18.1 sec 0.0 − 20.0 01 . 02.

No lupus anticoagulant was detected. PTT−LA results are consistent with the presence of one or more factor−specific inhibitors. Since the dRVVT was within normal limits, the factors in question are VIII, IX, XI, XII and the contact factors. The dPT was extended but the dPT confirmatory ratio was normal. This is consistent with a deficiency or specific inhibition of one or more extrinsic pathway factors (VII, X, V, II or fibrinogen).","Doctor":"Hi. You are having multiple petichae (red and purple - healing) spots all over the body (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are also getting winded possibly due to reduced hemoglobin. You were being evaluated for a possible lupus anticoagulant. Specific test done for lupus anticoagulant like DRVVT is normal. PTT-LA is also another test which is specific for lupus anticoagulant. PTT- LA is prolonged while DRVVT is normal. In the other section PT is also abnormal. The clotting mechanism in our body is divided into extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Both end with the common pathway and finally clot formation. Totally 13 clotting factors are identified at present. To measure each pathways, specific tests are present. For intrinsic pathway - Factors 8,9,11,12 are usually evaluated. It is measured through a test called as activated partial thromboplastin time - APTT or PTT. For extrinsic pathway - Factors 7 is important. Extrinsic pathway is measured by prothrombin time (PT). Along with it both extrinsic and intrinsic join and form a common pathway which includes coagulation factors like 10, 5, 2 and fibrinogen. As both PTT and PT are prolonged, they are possibly suspecting multiple factor deficiencies. It could be multiple or only common pathway defect as I mentioned earlier. Not to worry about this report. You are negative for most of the tests with mild variation in few tests. This is about your earlier report.  At present, in your latest report - Your factor assay, shows most of the values near normal limits. Even your PT and APTT are near normal. Possible mild thromobocytosis and leukocytosis could be commonly due to infection. Without an increased RBC count or hemoglobin, I would not suspect polycythemia vera (for which JAK-2 mutation is being evaluated). Increased neutrophil count usually suggest acute inflammation or infection. Not to worry at present about any clotting disorder. Low hemoglobin or malnutrition should be causing you being winded up easy. Red and purple dots are usually petechiae spots. Need to rule out any viral infections with superadded bacterial infections. Require more detiails, about how they started, since when, from which location and whether it is painful or is it changing colors to comment further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife has arthritis and has become very weak over the last few months.

With arthritis, there are 50 variants of it and it is very important to distinguish which one she has it as the management will differ for every arthritis. I would like to ask a few more queries: Any history of oral ulcers? Hairfall? Any history of fever? Which joints are affected? Swelling in the joints? Any deformity? Any changes in skin color or skin becoming tightened? Any history of dry eyes or dry mouth? Any muscle weakness which you have observed? With the start of Raynaud's, it seems like a systemic involvement more, something like lupus, but we need to rule it out. Kindly let me know these queries and I am advising a few tests. If they have been done, please attach the reports as well. CBC (complete blood count). ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). CRP (C-reactive protein). Rheumatoid factor. Anti CCP antibody.

I am very confused and do not undetstand what is going on. I am feeling very weak and sleepy all the time. Please give me some advice what to do.","Doctor":"Hi. There are many causes for irregular periods and scanty flow. Some are due to structural abnormality in the uterus, for which you were asked for Ultrasound which came out normal. Other causes are certain hormonal imbalances in the sex hormones secreted by pituitary or ovaries or thyroid also which can be confirmed by doing the hormonal assay. Your doctor is going in the right direction. But if you can mention me what hormonal test has been advised I can give you more information on that. I also advise you to get TSH test also.

I have been to multiple doctors about this problem and I have been told my reproductive system looks normal and I only ovulate if I reach my 21st day in my cycle which is very rare. However, they refuse to help me as I am 18 years old and I am not a high priority. I have been looking into fertility medication and was wondering what would be the risks if I treated myself with Clomid? I know this would be frowned upon by general doctors but it has started to effect my relationship and I am starting to give up on having my own family. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. First of all, at 18 years of age, you are contemplating pregnancy, that is actually unfair to your own body. A woman's reproductive system matures completely by 20 years of age. You do not need to use Clomid or any ovulation inducing drug simply because your follicle are ovulating, yes, but on the day 21, so what. That makes your cycle slightly longer say 45 days. But this may is normal for you. Do not compare your cycles with others.Doctors are skeptical helping you with infertility drugs simply because you are just 18 years old and you may harm yourself more rather than benefit from it by using drugs. I suggest one simple method. Maintain a menstrual calendar for three months, use the Ova -kit (home based test) to time your ovulation during cycles and then practice timed intercourse for the next seven days of ovulation. Your chances of getting pregnant would be higher then. I am sure you shall succeed with this technique. But please do not contemplate infertility treatment presently."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 23 years old. At about 1 am I suddenly experienced some symptoms at the same time. Extremely severe headache (worst headache I have ever had), blurred vision, my right eye crossed inwards, darkness in my vision, nausea, extreme dizziness, extremely dilated pupils with slightly different sizes (could barely see my iris), bloodshot eyes, severe cold, chills and shivering, The intensity and suddenness of these symptoms made me drop like a sack of potatoes. It was very difficult to not black out. I was unable to call for help. This event lasted around for one hour. I already had two TIA's this year, but this was different. I am still having trouble focusing on objects closer than 18 inches and my pupils are still dilated. Why are my eyes still dilated? What happened?","Doctor":"Hello. After going through your detailed and insightful query, I am of the opinion that you had one episode of cluster headache. I like to inform you that cluster headache affects mostly middle-aged men. Its cause is unclear but may relate to a vascular headache disorder or a disturbance of serotonin neurotransmitter mechanisms. Usually, there is no family history of headache or migraine. Episodes of severe unilateral periorbital pain occur daily for several weeks and are often accompanied by one or more of ipsilateral nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and redness of the eye.  Episodes often occur at night, awaken the patient, and last for less than two hours. Spontaneous remission then occurs, and the patient remains well for weeks or months before another bout of closely spaced attacks occurs. During a bout, many patients report that alcohol triggers an attack, others report that stress, glare, or ingestion of specific foods occasionally precipitates the attacks. In occasional patients, typical attacks of pain and associated symptoms recur at intervals without remission. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a writer, so I use my computer a lot. Pretty sure I have a repetitive stress injury. My father has Carpal tunnel, so it would not be a surprise at all if I have something similar. The pain is triggered when I type, and more so when I use my trackball. More than anything, my arm burns, the skin is hot, red and rashy. I can feel the same thing in my left arm, but it is more milder and takes more strain to hurt. I know I should back off and rest, but I feel like I cannot do that without giving up on writing. I wrap it and ice it. I take a couple of Aspirin every day to deal with inflammation, nothing seems to be helping. If I go to a doctor, I am afraid they will just tell me to do what I am already doing. Is there any point in seeing a doctor, or is there something more I should be doing at home?

I had my tubes tied nearly four years ago but have been displaying symptoms of pregnancy for two months including weight gain in my stomach, nausea, sore breasts fluttering abnormal feelings in my stomach.

My cycles usually came to between one and two set days and last for four to five days with a heavier flow. Recently they have been sporadic in their comings lasting anywhere from two to seven days with a lighter flow and a change in color with no clotting as used to be normal.

It could be possibly a developing ovarian cyst which is duly enlarging in size. Oligo and hypomenorrhea are a feature in such cases. This is definitely not pregnancy. Ovarian cysts are known to produce estrogenic symptoms like sore tender breasts, nausea and bloating sensation as well. The softness of the cervix could be attributed to the same. My advice would be to undergo a pelvic ultrasound at the earliest to rule out right-sided ovarian cyst formation or probably an endometrioma accompanied.

Four years ago, I got a bad flu and I felt horrible pain around my neck. When I put my hand on my neck I found two small balls one on my right side and one on my left side. My doctor said it is because of the flu and I got one pack antibiotic. After one month I found that two lymph nodes may be smaller but did not disappear. I ordered blood test again,and they came back normal. I went to another doctor he ordered a blood test and he said nothing to worry. I went back to the previous hospital, they kept doing blood tests for me every three months and last year after I fought with them, they did a CT scan and they found the biggest one size is 0.8 cm and they said it is normal and I should not worry. So far I saw five doctors and they said not to worry and the last one I saw was last week, she told me to stop touching it and try to forget it because they will not disappear and they refused my request for biopsy and they said the size is normal. But I am really scared and I cannot stop thinking about it and what about if it is cancer and they do not know. How would they know if they did not do a biopsy? In the last visit she said if it was a cancer and you have it for four years you would have other symptoms. I do not know what to do, especially after they said no need for biopsy and I am really scared when I go to bed at night I touch them and I cannot stop crying. Please let me know what do you think? I am tired of doctors, each time they touch them and I got a smile do not worry you are fine. If I am fine why they did not disappear?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Ii understand your concern. After going through your elaborate history, it appears that you have had cervical lymphadenopathy secondary to the flu you had four years back. Lymph nodes are basically the policemen of the human body, they are the first to get inflamed and enlarge when the vicinity which they drain gets infected. It appears from four to seven days after infection. If one takes antibiotics, which as you did the infection so contained in the lymph node gets treated and the swelling reduces in size. But whenever the healing occurs by some amount of fibrosis, so the lymph gland healed but did not reduce to its complete original size. Now again if the gland has not been increasing in size, or painful, or shotty in feeling or have recruited other lymph nodes or there has been a continuous weight loss in these four years, or the natural immunity has gone down and you suffered multiple infections all this while, they all suggest or at least indicate towards a malignant change or cancer. In the absence of these signs, malignancy is unlikely. Secondly, the size of the largest being 8 mm. Malignant lymph nodes are way larger from 4-8 cm (40-80mm) and multiple and aggressive in nature. There is two ways of finding any form of malignancy in lymph nodes. 1. HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan to look for the hot spot. 2. If a hot spot not found in HIDA , then considering the lymph gland benign, further the diagnosis can be then established by FNAC( fine needle aspiration cytology). 3. If costs permit a PET (positron emission tomography) scan can be done to put rest to any further doubt. Depending on the SUV values the malignant and benign nature may be ascertained."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 21-year-old male. I keep getting high anxiety and sometimes have anxiety and panic attacks when around a lot of people. I work in a supermarket so I am around a lot of people all the time and interact with a lot of people. Over a year ago, I was sectioned in a psychiatric hospital with drug-induced psychosis because I was smoking weed every night with my friends and attending raves nearly every weekend taking drugs such as MDMA, Ketamine, and Nitrous oxide balloons. When I came out of hospital I was completely fine and I returned to work and going out with my friends as usual, apart from not taking any drugs. About a year passed and I was completely fine so I thought it would be a good idea to do MDMA at a rave again (this was about 2 months ago). I had a massive panic and anxiety attack and had to sit in the car with my best friend who was trying to calm me down but I could not stop as I was still under the influence of MDMA and I could not speak to anyone properly. After this, I was fine in most social situations but in the last couple of weeks I am now really anxious about going out in public and I cannot seem to speak to anyone properly anymore, not even my best friends. I hate going to work, this has only been going on for two weeks now, so I thought I would seek help here.","Doctor":"Hello. I have understood your query. You have been using drugs previously and after that, you have been diagnosed and treated for drug-induced psychosis. So as per my opinion, even you are better without drugs for so long. You should not try those drugs again because you have faced problems before and again when you use. It will be more than the previous effect and difficult to control. So I insist that you shud not take drugs for the rest of your life. The experience of anxiety and restlessness that you had before 15 days after taking MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine) was probably the acute effects of MDMA. You might have taken a higher dose of the drug than usual. After that, you have started worrying about that previous episode, so it has started continuous anxiety in you, that you can not identify consciously. And when it has prolonged, it has caused depressive feelings in you. So, in my opinion, you shud not take any medication for these anxiety symptoms at present. Go for exercises, meditation, and relaxation therapies. Do not use any street drugs. If your rave is the problem then you should avoid going there because instead of joy, you are getting drugs there and making problems for yourself. If your current anxious and depressive feeling do not improve within the next 15 days, then seek help from a psychiatrist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 25 years old. I have a little long story of typhoid. In March, I tested positive for typhoid with widal test and the report shows TO - 1:80, TH - 1:40. My doctor prescribed me some antibiotics and I took them for eight days. I tested again and all titers were negative. I immediately left all the medicines as I though I have recovered. I was fine. In May, again I tested positive for widal test and the report shows TO - 1:160, TH - 1:80, TA - 1:40. This time I took two antibiotics Oflomac 200 and Ceftas 400 mg for about one month. After one month I tested for widal and my TO titer was 1:60 and TH was 1:40. My doctor said me to leave the medicines and he told that it is normal now. Now here my concerns starts, in July and August, I took two widal tests on the interval of one month and both reports were the same as TO - 1:80, TH - 1:40. I showed this report to three doctors and they all said that it is normal. It will take some time to fall the value of titers after typhoid. Symptoms: I never had any fever during all history. I just had joint pains, leg cramps and sometimes stomach pain. My question is have I become a typhoid carrier or this is really normal? And if I have become the carrier then is it curable or not? I am very stressed about it and it has disturbed my whole life. I am asking this because, now these days, when I go for morning walks, I have leg pains whole day with a very bad taste of my tongue.","Doctor":"Hi. Widal test is a vague test which has limitations. It is done only to get an idea of which type of organism might be present. If you see the report again, you will not find any value for a zero level, means the level of a normal person can also not be zero. Anything less than 160 be it 20, 40 or 80 is considered normal. Only 160 and above needs treatment. You have already taken a lot of antibiotics, no need for anything now. Since you are still thinking about carrier state, do the following things: 1. Get a Typhidot IgG and IgM done. Your IgM will be positive as you had past infection. IgG should be negative as this shows present infection. So this way, you get clarity on what is the status of typhoid now. 2. Get a stool routine and culture done. This will show you if you are excreting typhoid bacteria or not and are a carrier or not. The treatment will be decided only once we find something in that. 3. Get an ultrasound of the abdomen done to rule out any swelling of the liver or intestines. Once you have this done, you will be clear with everything. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 34 years old. My weight is 84 kg.

I do regular walking for 3 to 4 km and also do exercise but even though my blood pressure is not coming down.","Doctor":"Hi. This heart rate is low. You have to stop the medications. I would advise you to take a combination of Telmisartan 80 mg and Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once a day in morning. Commonly available as Telista-H 80. I am hopeful that your BP would get controlled by this. For fatty liver you just need to continue exercises and get Hepatitis B and C tested. Also do not consume alcohol in case you do. As far as anxiety and pulse rate are concerned, this variation is not acceptable. Heart rate going from 50 to 100 BPM is very unlikely just because of anxiety. Thyroid disorders play a role in it. Get your TSH repeated again and also get an ECG and fasting blood sugar. Review with the reports. Till then start on medication I have advised. I am hopeful your BP would start getting into control with normal pulse rate with in a week. Review with reports and BP and pulse rate readings after 1 week. Stay healthy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, This is to request a second opinion on whether I have TB? I have attached the x-ray and other test reports (hematology, AFB, etc.). Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Report -1 shows SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase), SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase), raised that means your liver function test is not normal and has low potassium levels, so you need to supplement potassium. Report-2 X-ray suggestive of pulmonary Koch's pathology (TB). Report -3 Sputum for AFB (Acid-fast bacilli) is negative. This is a test for TB, but this does not exclude TB as it can be false. Report-4 Hemoglobin is low, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is raised, this is suggestive of infection inside the body. Report-5 USG (ultrasound) suggestive of stones inside the gallbladder. Conclusion: In my opinion you have TB and you must start taking ATT (anti-tubercular treatment). If you have further questions, do follow-up."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, One laboratory report says that I am positive for Lyme disease and another lab report says it is negative. Both used serum and western blot. I was in tick borne Lyme areas overseas but do not recall a bite specifically. I have positive ANA test (speckled pattern 1:80), anti ds-DNA 8 iU/ml. I am negative on all the autoimmune disease antibody tests (Sjorgens, lupus, etc). I have low vitamin D, low B12, low calcium and low albumin. I have mild neutropenia. CRP a bit high at 6.7. Alpha 2 globulin mildly elevated. I am wondering if the ANA tear has any significance? I am quite unwell with extreme fatigue, numbness and heavy leg one side, peripheral neuropathy (numb, tingling, spasms), ankle edema and I have put on 10 kg. I am usually quite thin (59 kg and 178 cm), now I am 71 kg and it is all in my stomach (fluid?). I have had skin nodules and my scalp feels swollen and I have some hair loss/thinning. Finger nails have vertical ridges and no moons. I have tried antibiotics, anti fungal oral and topical. I was a frequent traveller for work and thought maybe got something there. I am so confused as to if I should commence treatment for a Lyme disease as I do not know if I have it or not.I am currently taking Vitamin B12, vitamin D supplements, and Nystatin. Illness has been chronic for past three years. Symptoms already discussed except I forgot to say periods suddenly stopped about 18 months ago. It might be pre menopause but strange thing is they did not slow down or become irregular, just bang stopped.","Doctor":"Hi. Your ANA (antinuclear antibody) report is not much significant. Lyme disease test IgG positivity reflects its chronic presence. Many of your neurological symptoms could be attributed to it. However, few symptoms need further evaluation by a rheumatologist, because the physical examination is necessary. Your nail ridges and a few skin changes could be due to Psoriasis or Reiter's disease which may also cause fatigue and joint pains. I would suggest you take treatment for Lyme disease because it is not much longer. Also, you should get yourself evaluated by a rheumatologist, for the presence of inflammatory arthritis. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother has undergone a gallstone and uterus removal surgery simultaneously. From the day of operation, she is having pus secretion from the gall bladder bed. What may be the possible reasons behind this?","Doctor":"Hello. Sorry to hear about your mother's complaints. Pus from the surgical site is worrisome. It may just be a surgical site infection, usually superficial and confined to the skin and it usually subsides with appropriate antibiotics. But since you have mentioned that the pus is from gallbladder bed, which means it is from an intraabdominal source, then it is a matter of grave concern and needs further evaluation both clinical and radiological along with biochemical parameters. Is she having a fever? Was the drain placed after the surgery? Did the operating surgeon mention anything like empyema of the gall bladder or a mucocele? These are some more questions which need answering for more accurate knowhow about the cause of your mother's condition. Sit with your operating surgeon and have a clear discussion about it. He or She would be the best person to help you out. Surgical site infection, Intraperitoneal abscess. CBC (complete blood count), LFT (liver function test), RFT (renal function test), pus culture and sensitivity, USG (ultrasound) abdomen or a CECT (computed tomography) abdomen. Surgical site infection, Intraperitoneal abscess. Surgical site infection, Intraperitoneal abscess. Depends on the cause. In case of SSI (surgical site infection) of the skin, a course of antibiotics depending on the culture and sensitivity report should cure it. In case of an intraabdominal abscess, a surgical drainage may even be required. Maintain a sterile environment around the patient. Follow up with your operating surgeon or any nearby surgeon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 29 years old. I masturbate badly (without lubricants) for over 13 years. Because of this, my artery becomes loose and both of my scrota are becoming small. When I work I get muscle pain, back, and leg pain. I lost my energy and power. I want to recover my energy as soon as possible because I am going to get married within three to four months. Please help. I have not taken any medication yet.","Doctor":"Hello. I have understood your concern. I think that losing power, you mean erectile dysfunction.I will answer in detail about erectile dysfunction and masturbation. Masturbation by any method does not cause any physical and sexual weakness. It is not a bad habit. It is a way of satisfying your sexual needs in the absence of a female partner. Losing muscle power, testis is getting small, etc., all are the psychological counterparts of worrying about the masturbation and considering it as a bad habit. When you believe that masturbation is bad, it causes anxiety and all other symptoms. You are completely healthy and sexually competent. You do not need any medications and should enjoy your sexual life about to come. So remove the myths from your mind about masturbation. Erectile dysfunction can be because of so many causes. It can be because of the anxiety arose in your mind because of masturbation. When a person has something in his mind, which continues to bother him then he might be distracted in every activity and gradually lose interest and started feeling sad and this also happens with sex also. Another possibility is a vicious cycle of anxiety and poor sex performance. So when a person has anxiety about sexual performance, he is distracted and may lose erection in between or even complete absence of erection may be there. Social issues which make you anxious and depressed are also interfering in sexual performance. So you should identify your anxiety and try to deal with it. There should not be disharmony between the sexual partners. Sex should not be at places where the fear of being caught is there. Sex should not be in a hurry. Do not compare your physique with those shown in movies. When you have dealt with all the issues, you should spend more time in foreplay before going for penetrative sex. This will increase the duration of erection and foreplay should be continued during penetrative sex also. So finally I would say that you are completely alright. Need not do anything. Enjoy masturbation and your sex life. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My last period was on April 28. It has been almost seven weeks and I still have not had my period yet. I had unprotected sex on May 24 thinking my ovulation day is over but I started getting very paranoid last week. So I took a pregnancy test on June 10th and it was negative. Then I took one more yesterday on June 14th and it was negative, but if I squinted hard enough it could have been positive. I am very paranoid right now because I do not have a supportive family and I do not have health insurance to go to the doctor to get this checked out, and I am not ready to have a child. I am 21 years old living with my very conservative religious immigrant parents and I do not know if I should take the second pregnancy test seriously. I have been stressed out for the past one month which makes me think I am skipping a month but I am still very afraid that there is a chance I may be pregnant. I have no symptoms of pregnancy. Is it likely that I am pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iclinq.com. It is unlikely to be a pregnancy. However, get a serum beta HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) blood test to rule out pregnancy, as PT has some chances of false positivity and false negativity as it is weakly positive. The likely cause of the delay could be hormonal, anemia, weight gain, hypothyroidism, stress, or change in food and exercise pattern can affect the cycle length and pattern. Hormonal. Serum beta HCG. Pregnancy. Delayed cycle (probably hormonal). If beta HCG is negative, then take tablet Medroxy progesterone acetate 10 mg at bedtime for five days. Menses occur one week after the last dose of Progesterone. Weight reduction if BMI >25."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have an ear infection on my right ear for the past one week. So my doctor prescribes me some antibiotics Amoxicillin with Prednisolone. But my tinnitus did not go away. How long will it take for the tinnitus to go away if there is no pain in my ear?","Doctor":"Hi. The answer to your question entirely depends on how you developed the ear infection in the first place. In general, until the eardrum heals you will be having weird noises, tinnitus, and ear discomfort due to interference with sound transmission and processing. If the ear infection has happened secondary to recurrent allergy or cold, then you will have probably developed a eustachian tube catarrh due to which the fluid is still present in the middle ear causing the tinnitus and will take around two months approximately in toto for tinnitus to resolve. If the ear infection has occurred due to trauma (by earbuds etc), the tinnitus will take approximately four to six weeks, as this the average time it takes to heal the ear drum. I am sure you fall into one of the two possibilities mentioned above. There is absolutely nothing that you need to worry about as this usually takes a while for things to normalize. At the same time make sure there are no triggering factors out there. Some one they include use of earphones, headphones, exposure to loud sounds, consumption of alcohol, smoking, stress, etc. Try to maintain a healthy lifestyle as much as possible and do not think too much about the tinnitus nor try to Google about it too much. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I and my partner had safe sex before three months, after that we never had sex. She had regular periods till now, but this month she did not get her periods on the expected date and till now no periods. She is saying that there is some white discharge. Is this any symptom of pregnancy? If periods are regular why she delays this month? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hello. If your partner has regular periods and you have not been sexually involved, then she is unlikely to be pregnant. It is not necessary that she should get her mensus on that very date itself. If pregnancy is ruled out with a urine pregnancy test, then the most common cause of delayed menses is stress per se, which can be either psychological, emotional or physical which can cause a hormonal imbalance and can cause a possible delay in the periods. Also, if she is experiencing a white discharge per vaginum, then it can be a part of the premenstrual syndrome itself which usually occurs generally a week prior to the onset of menses and may include symptoms like nausea, headache, sore breasts, mood swings, lower abdominal pain or increased frequency of urine. Though it mimics early pregnancy symptoms it also occurs in the absence of pregnancy indicating that menses shall ensue in the next few days. As it has already been more than seven days now, it is advised that she may wait till 15 days post missed periods to allow her menses to return naturally, and if it does not then she may get an ultrasound pelvis to check for the endometrial thickness (ET). If the ET is more than 10 mm, then she can opt for a withdrawal bleed with progestins to resume her menses. But if by any chance pregnancy is suspected, then it is always wise to get a urine pregnancy test done to rule it out first to allay any anxiety associated with it. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Because I cannot hear from my right ear since then.","Doctor":"Hi. It is possible to have hearing loss after a head injury, especially if it was as severe as in your case where it leads to a fracture. Our ear consists of three little bones called ossicles which help in taking the vibrations of sound from the ear drum to the inner ear (cochlea). These little bones may have easily been dislocated due to the impact of your injury. This will cause a hearing loss of 40 - 50%. It may also be possible that the ossicles are intact but your ear drum may have ruptured due to the impact. In this case, you may experience 30-40% hearing loss. The third possibility is that your ear drum and ossicles are intact but there is bleeding within the middle ear from the injury and that is restricting the movement of the ossicles. This may cause 20-30% hearing loss. The least likely possibility is the injury to the inner ear because it is housed within a very strong bone. Injuries here will lead to more permanent hearing losses. The only way to find out is by getting a hearing test pure tone audiogram (PTA) from an audiologist and an examination of the ear from an ENT specialist. A high resolution CT (computed tomography) scan may also be indicated to look for the status of the ossicles and the inner ear. If it is ear drum injury, ossicular injury or blood collection within the middle ear, it can be treated easily through surgery. You can expect to regain your hearing to a close as normal. Please do share the report of your PTA with me for a more specific management pathway."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can a CT scan identify liver metastasis?","Doctor":"Hello.

FBS (fasting blood sugar),  4. PPBS (post-prandial blood sugar). I advise you to start doing Kegel's exercise every day.

I would like to know a few more information to help you better. May I know the medicines list you are on at present? And can you upload the reports?  Some important strategies are to be followed:  1. Improve the heart function ---to decrease load on heart by ACE inhibitors like Ramipril, ARB's like Telmisartan, diuretics like Lasix and beta blockers at optimized dose). 2. Fluid and salt restriction (salt maximum 3 grams /day and consume fluids 1.5 to 2 liter/day maximum). 3. Mild exercise training are also believed to improve exercise capacity and the quality of life in heart failure patients. 4. Diet and life-style modifications (smoking cessation, weight reduction, limit alcohol and avoid smoking, treat if lipid levels are high, control sugar levels, etc.).  With this limited information,I think,you might be needing an increased dose of a water pill loop diuretic (Lasix) to drain out the accumulating flluid regularly.

And it has been about 4 1/2 weeks since my last menstrual period. Unfortunately with labor day being this weekend I have been unable to see my regular OBGYN. But I did go to the ER to confirm the pregnancy 2 days ago. So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks. So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain. I have been taking both of the medications during my pregnancy when I had no idea I was pregnant. Since finding out I have tried tapering on both medications. The Percocet is making me sweat and very agitated and when I tried to cut down on the Lorazepam I was shaking and almost hallucinating and delusion. I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants. I am so scared that I am considering abortion. I do not want to be a terrible mother before I even give birth. I have been having bad panic attacks over this and cannot seem to relax as the complications of these medicines are always on my mind. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. Well in your case, as you said rightly Lorazepam is category D drug and not advisable. Ideally we advise avoidance of this medicine during and even before till 12 weeks pregnancy to avoid congenital malformations. You have tried leaving/ reducing it, but your withdrawal have been strong and you are finding it difficult to cope. My advise would be you can contemplate abortion with medical management to be safe or if you are keen on continuing pregnancy then the only way of finding any manifested malformation would be at 16-18 weeks. Then abortion can be contemplated if malformation found on anomaly scan, else you can plan to continue pregnancy. These are two options you may consider."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 36-year-old female, I never had any children and I have been on Depo-Provera for almost 17 years. Although I am a heavy smoker, I do not get sick very often. A few years ago I found lumps in my breast(s) which were not painful but I did visit a doctor and he said it was just thickening of the tissue but advised me to go for a mamogram but they refused me a mamogram due to my young age. It never bothered me again. This morning my left breast was itching and in the afternoon there was a stabbing pain in the breast. The pain eventually went from a stabbing pain to being painful the whole time. The breast feels heavy, and there is pain in the armpit and the arm but no swelling or redness and though it feels like it is burning up, it does not feel warm to the touch, no discharge from the nipple or any hard lumps nor fever. It looks like if a small vein has errupted and when I pull on the breast I can see a thin blue vein which seems to pop out with white bulging around it.","Doctor":"Hello. As you mentioned some years ago, there were lumps in your breast. These can indicate that you have fibroadenosis/ fibroadenoma. In some occassions since it is a hyperplastic cystic disease (where cells are multiplying rapidly), it can be a little painful. Since there was a pain in the breast it had radiated towards your arms and hence the pain in the armpit. Mastalgia or breast pain can also be due to cyclical changes of hormones. Sometimes there can be an hormonal imbalance, more so since you are taking Depo-Provera for so long. Normally cyclical mastalgia resolves in a day or two and hence I will advise you to wait for 2 days before being alarmed. You can take tablet Brufen 400 mg twice daily after food with tablet Ranitidine. This will help in resolving your pain. If you develop fever/ pain starts getting worse/ there is a discharge or bleeding from the nipple, it is better to get a General Surgeon's opinion straight away. Make sure you are resting for the next 2-3 days till you completely recover. Also make sure your bra is not loose and it supports the breast properly so that it is not hanging. If fibroadenosis is the cause, and it can be, your general surgeon after a breast examination will be able to guide you further. However, let me reassure you that fibroadenosis/ fibroadenoma is completely benign and there is nothing to worried about. If it does not cause any symptoms, it can be left alone."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am married for over three years. In these three years, I had five miscarriages. First three times I had miscarriages in the second and third month (due to missed heart beat of the baby) then in the fourth time I had the termination of pregnancy in the sixth month (due to low amniotic fluid level of the baby) it is found in the fifth month scan but baby parts are found normal. Again for the fifth time I had a medical abortion due to no heart beat in the baby. I undergo all medical tests HSG Scan, thyroid, prolactin, anti cardiolipin Ab IgG, anti cardiolipin Ab IgM, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), HbA1c, LH, FSH, Estradiol - 17 b (E2), platelet count, hemoglobin, prothrombin time (PT), control (PT), INR, bleeding time and clothing time, etc. And in the karyotype test done for me and my husband reports that chromosome analysis of culture peripheral blood lymphocytes cells revealed a normal female karyotype. No clonal numerical or structural abnormalities were noted. A variant in one of the chromosome 9 was observed with an additional heterochromatin region on the long arm. Rest of that everything is normal. In that sixth month termination of pregnancy I took injection Heparin 5000 iu daily once, Ecosprin 75 mg, Porgy ova 2 mg, Duphaston 10 mg, Folvete 5 mg. Even though my pregnancy terminated due to severe oligohydramnios. But till now I did not find any solution to my problem and the doctor too was also not able to find out what is the problem. They are telling its unexplainable thing. Please give some suggestions for me. Four months passed away for the last miscarriage. Now give me some suggestion for the next step.","Doctor":"Hello. Learning from your history, you are a case of recurrent pregnancy loss with three continuous abortions (missed abortion) in the first three pregnancies but you had a fourth naturally conceived pregnancy which lasted for six months and was terminated for severe IUGR (intrauterine growth restriction) and oligohydramnios. Your next pregnancy was again a missed abortion. With this view and your normal karyotyping and tests that you have furnished seems all right. This pattern fits into the criteria of Thrombophilias which are a major cause of recurrent pregnancy losses. As you said you have undergone test of anticardiolipin antibody (ACLA), thyroid and prolactin. I need to see the reports. Further need to know your antinuclear antibody status, serum progesterone levels, serum testosterone and prolactin levels as well. They are important to decide the cause and further diagnosis of RPL due to thrombophilias. My advice for you would be: 1. Do not plan any pregnancy for another three months as the uterus needs time (minimum of six months) to recover from the previous pregnant state. 2. Start tablet Folic acid 5 mg from today for the next three months when you can consider pregnancy again. The idea is folic acid should be started three months prior to planning pregnancy which would avoid any chances of congenital anomalies and malformation in the fetus and thereby missed abortions (which probably may be the cause, though there are no means to do tests on just two months fetus). 3. When you get pregnant say after three months then as soon as you get a urine pregnancy test confirmation you need to be started on thromboprophylaxis for thrombophilia with injection Enoxaparin 20/40 mg s/c daily depending on your weight and tablet Ecosprin 75 mg daily for the whole of pregnancy till delivery. 4. Tablet Dupastan 10 mg also to be started from the day of confirmation of pregnancy till 14 weeks. All these can be considered and there are ways to prevent further losses, but I would like to see all the reports especially the above-mentioned ones. But no pregnancy for the next three months please and start Folic acid immediately so that your chances of missed abortion reduce due to unknown cause in future pregnancy, which you may plan after three months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Some white rashes or patches have grown up on the upper portion of the palm, behind and the left side of the neck and arms.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

She is now experiencing continuous pain, though not unbearable. When she had the blood reports, her erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 40 mm/hr and her SGPT is 38 U/L, both above the reference levels. It is suspected that she has disc degeneration because of auto-immunity by some doctors. Can you please look at her reports and let me know the actual scenario of her health and what are her health implications in the future? I am about to marry her and is hesitating because of her health condition. Please let me know about her present health by looking at the MRI scan of the spine and the blood reports. Her CRP is normal.","Doctor":"Hello. I have studied your case with diligence. I have seen the reports also. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Raised ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) with raised SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) suggest the possibility of polyarthritis. You may need further investigation like RA (rheumatoid) factor, ACCP (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide), if required PET (positron emission tomography) scan, ANA (antinuclear antibody), HLA-B27 (human leukocyte antigen). As per your MRI, there is no significant disc bulge or fluid collection. SI (sacroiliac) joint should be ruled out on MRI again. Ankylosing spondylitis typically involves spine and hips with other large joints also. There is reduced chest function in this disease. Stiffness in the spine is increased. Do you have such stiffness in the spine? Clinical examination is also required to diagnose it. You can do a blood test to confirm it. If all tests are normal you may need proper exercises and lifestyle modifications. You can do all these tests as early as possible to plan for the future. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 48-year-old male in reasonable health other than a back problem that leaves me unable to sleep. I am having sharp stabbing pain in my left flank, only when I lay in bed and change positions. I am negative for kidney stones, so assume it is spinal nerve related. I only get relief when I take 30 mg immediate-release Oxycodone and have been obtaining them illegally. I have no health insurance and would like a legal alternative for obtaining this medication. I do not use them recreationally and only take a maximum of two per day. Do you have any advise?","Doctor":"Hello. I have studied your case. There is a possibility of spinal disc bulge leading to back pain. I will advise you to do MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) spine to see for any disc bulge or spinal canal stenosis. And also check your vitamin B12 and vitamin D3 levels. Medication like Methylcobalamine and analgesic will reduce pain. You can continue yoga exercises and focus on spine extension exercises. Some exercises which can be done include spine extension exercises, lying on your stomach flat and lift the leg six inches from the ground, do it for other leg. Now lift both hand and leg simultaneously, six inches off the ground and stay. Position for around ten breathes. Core stabilizing spine exercises will help. You may consult a physiotherapist for guidance. He may start TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), or ultrasound which is helpful in your case. If not relieved you can take an epidural injection. You can cure the disease by doing all modalities with balancing your posture habits. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have noticed that whenever I get out of the shower I have these small red bumps on my cheek bones and around my eyes and eyebrows. They usually take hours or the entire day to go away. Also, recently my skin has been very rough and makes makeup application very difficult. I am assuming it is just from the cold and dry weather, but I have been using the same face wash and moisturizer for years now and have never encountered these issues. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am on birth control and Spironolactone.","Doctor":"Hello. I appreciate you asking about your concern. You have very good skin in terms of tone and quality for your age. I would like to draw your attention to a few things though. Well, as you mentioned the hormonal pills can make your skin behave funny. It pops open the pores and makes your oil glands work overtime. Also, the hot shower makes your oil glands secrete more oil. Ergo only luke warm to cool water for the face. Hence you lose all oil stored in the skin when you shower. Thereby rendering your skin dry throughout the day. Apply a good oil control moisturizer like the Avene cleanance moisturuzer right after the shower. Never rub your face during a facewash. Wash it off immediately. I feel when you correct these practices and stop the medicines your skin will return to normal. Always use a non-alcoholic make-up remover and just apply organic make up very light if you have to. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 61 years old mother underwent vestibuloplasty for lower jaws. Since she arrived, it seems to be bleeding. I know blood and saliva mixed together will seem like bleeding than it actually is. We live in an isolated area. And reaching a doctor was not possible. Could you please let us know what to do to clot the blood for now?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your situation. Bleeding after vestibuloplasty or any oral surgical procedure is normal for the next two hours. There are certain instructions you can follow at home to stop bleeding. 1. Apply pressure to the surgical site. Place a thick cotton or gauze pad (probably from the first aid kit of your car) and ask your mother to bite it with pressure for the next 45 minutes. 2. Swallowing saliva. It will be difficult to swallow saliva with the blood taste. Saliva helps faster clotting. Avoid spitting which will increase bleeding and delay clotting. 3. Avoid disturbing the area frequently (to check for clotting). Leave it undisturbed. If the surgical area is disturbed after the clot formation, bleeding will start again. 4. Ask her not to disturb that area with the tongue. 5. Take some ice cubes in a ziplock. Wrap a clean cloth/ tissue over it. Give periodical and very gentle cold compress extra orally (not directly to the surgical site) after 45 minutes of gauze biting. You should seek emergency care if the bleeding is profuse even after three hours. Whereas, very mild bleeding is absolutely normal for today. And place an extra towel over the pillow before laying on the bed, which prevents pillow staining. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 26 years old, currently pregnant with my second child for 26 weeks and 5 days. I just left the doctor's office having done an anatomy ultrasound. The doctor said there is a little fluid around my baby's heart, but not to worry. I have been scheduled in three weeks for the same ultrasound and also have been scheduled I believe for an abnormalities test. Even though the doctor has told me not to worry I am just freaking out and have been crying all day. It would be nice if I could get an answer as to what may have caused small fluid around the heart? What would the worse outcome be and what I can do now with my everyday habits if that makes sense, as I will be stressing for three weeks about this? Any information would be helpful.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your anxiety. Let me clear you some facts. A basic anomaly scan is done at 18-20 weeks and if that was normal, it shows that no structural anomalies are there. Secondly, this scan was done at 26 weeks and 5 days when the fetus is half developed. As far as the fluid is concerned around the heart, it is the pericardial fluid. The fluid inside the pericardial layer covering the heart to initiate smooth functioning. It is around 5 ml in adults with progression in pregnancy it would regress and my advise would follow it up with serial ultrasounds. Unfortunately, every day habits cannot make a difference. I would like to suggest you not to be worried and stress yourself. All is well. Just get three weekly serial ultrasounds to follow up on the fluid level. Baby's growth is not affected as I learnt."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis last week. I have a very weak sense of smell and taste, tinnitus, post-nasal drip, and congestion. My sense of smell is also getting weaker for the last five days. Can chronic sinusitis permanently damage my sense of smell at this time? Or can it be reversed? I have used nasal sprays, antibiotics, and Prednisone to no avail. This has lasted nine weeks.","Doctor":"Hello. Chronic rhinosinusitis is a chronic inflammation of the nose and sinuses where there will be significant dysfunction in sinus physiology. This causes swelling of the nose tissues leading to symptoms such as nasal congestion, nasal discharge, post nasal drip and heaviness of head. Decreased sense of smell or loss of sense of smell is also one of the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. Disturbance in sense of smell in chronic rhinosinusitis is usually due to mechanical obstruction to the passage of air to the nerves which carry the sense of smell rather than actual injury to the nerves. Usually, there will be recovery of sense of smell and may take a few months with treatment for rhinosinusitis. You may need to take better antibiotics such as Clarithromycin for a week, along with a repeat course of steroids. Nasal washes with saline mixed with steroid respules are also useful in reducing the swelling and improving the sense of smell. I can say that permanent loss of sense of smell is very unlikely in chronic rhinosinusitis. Treatment of rhinosinusitis either by medicines or surgery usually brings back the sense of smell. CT (computed tomography) scan of paranasal sinuses, diagnostic nasal endoscopy. Clarithromycin 500 mg once daily after food for seven days. Montair LC (Montelukast and Cetirizine) once daily in the night for a week. Wysolone (Prednisolone) 10 mg two times daily for five days. Nasowash saline washes two times daily (mix two respules of Budecort to 500 ml of solution for washing). Pan 40 (Pantoprazole) once daily before food for seven days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 25 year old female. In childhood, I had malaria and double typhoid. Everything was normal until few years back. Things started all over again since the last five to six years. I have been putting on weight continuously, suffering from weakness, horrible fatigue and body pain all the time. So, I was done with blood and thyroid tests. My TSH level was at 5.4 then. Doctor told it is at border level. Walking and good food would be enough to make it normal. Two years later of it, also nothing much changed instead symptoms worsened. Apart from the symptoms stated above, muscle cramps, low energy levels and irregular periods got started. This time, I was tested with whole body health checkup package. Results are stated below. T3 138, T4 7.53 and TSH 6.89. Through ultrasound scan peripherally placed small follicles got revealed in both ovaries, might be PCOD. Creatinine serum/plasma 1.0, HDL cholesterol serum/plasma 36, LDL cholesterol serum/plasma 103, ALT (SGPT) serum/plasma 20, calcium serum 9.4, urine routine and specific gravity 1.005. These tests were done two years back. I have mentioned only the values which were not in the normal range specified. So, it was confirmed as the hypothyroid condition and I went on with homeopathy treatment. When I was done with thyroid profile test again in a year's time during the treatment, my results were T3 112, T4 8.26 and TSH 4.15. During the first month of the treatment, I felt slightly better. But, after that nothing changed. Doctors affirmed that there was an improvement, but I kept suffering from symptoms horribly. I had a test again a year back and the results were T3 140, T4 8.68 and TSH 4.92. Though I learned from reports, that I am fine, nothing was actually changed. My quality of life has been ruined completely. Doctor suggested using vitamin D supplement Must D3 60K for three months. After using it also I did not get required energy to bring life on track again. Since the start of the treatment, I have joined in the gym and later did things like walking, exercise at home, proper diet but nothing had still changed. Seeing the symptoms persist, I lost motive in doing any of them. My treatment period was completed one year ago and I have given up on homeopathy. Now I had done all tests once again, and would like to consult a physician. Please check the latest reports, which I have attached. Before taking treatment again, I would wish to know the answers and have some knowledge from my few questions. So, it would be really helpful if you suggest solutions to them. My present and persistent symptoms and issues are as follows. I have hair dryness, hair fall and dandruff. I am getting dry cough while waking up from sleep sometimes in one-sided position sleep. It is like I wake up because of cough. I am unable to bear the weight of the head on the neck often. I was done with x-rays of neck for neck and shoulder pain. A numb ache persists all over neck and shoulders. Everything was normal there with x-rays. I have cold intolerance. I am getting joint pains too quickly. I am affected with cold easily. It always present each day around the year. I am unable to lose weight how much ever I exercise. With or without exercise it remains the same. I was on 75 kg when I did the tests. After three months of exercise, I came to 71 kg, but again it went up to 74 kg. Now too it is the same. My height is 5'4\\". I have shoulder sockets, neck and upper back area ache almost constantly. I use a heat pad and ice bag for relief, but it aches numbly again. Massaging muscles there gives relief for some time. Ribs, lower back, hips, thighs, calves and wrists ache badly during nights and late afternoons. I am getting some electric spark like sensation, itch in fingers, palms and arms mostly on midnights, sometimes during the daytime as well. The main symptom of all is fatigue. This is the worst problem I face. It ruins my day, energy and focus. I sleep seven to eight hours daily. Morning, I cannot wake up due to the coldness and body stiffness. After breakfast and lunch, fatigue takes over me at any cost. In the evenings, I am active and energetic compared to rest of the day. I usually stay up to 11 or 12 to cover up afternoon’s work. Even after some days of good deep sleep also I end up sleeping easily all the day. It is more of like an unreasonable, unknown nervousness, hesitation and fear that I may not memorize things and concentrate well on an issue than the actual point is. I lose focus on things easily due to internal disturbance. I am getting irritated easily these days. Even after sensing not to shout, I lash out at others and stay fuming for a long time. I am suffering from high mood swings and unpredictable moods. I feel happy and positive in one hour and suddenly nothing seems to change how much ever I try, getting sad in next hour. Again, I will end up boosting myself to keep going in next hour. The same goes on. I am naturally ambitious since childhood. As my state affected my studies and made me unemployed, I get depressed few times. But, I still feel I am an optimistic person and do hard work with what I have. I am taking a lot of time to digest and accept change and decisions in life. I just lost self-confidence completely to take any initiative in everything. Cravings over specifically on ice creams, chocolates, sweets and samosas. It gets high during midnights. I had irregular menstrual pain. They got corrected, but there is PMS pain, giddiness, irritability, etc. During periods, my back pain is very high. Now my periods has been delayed for 10 days. I tried hard to push myself to walk half an hour daily. Then I tried exercises at home for an hour. Failing to push further, joined in the gym and did aerobics, strength training for about five to six months. I did breathing exercises regularly. And tried my best to make myself mentally strong. I used B-complex and vitamin C supplements often for pains. Now, I stopped everything and looking for proper medication and advice. I would like to start everything again with confidence.What is my exact condition? How worse it is? Is it only hypothyroidism or any other condition? If it is only hypothyroidism, why it did not show any improvement on the physical symptoms level? I want to present all new present condition reports before the doctor. So which tests should I undergo? Which specialty doctor should I consult who can treat these above conditions well? Apart from doctors and treatment, what personal measures should I take? Which supplements can I take? Which foods can I take for energy boosting and to remain healthy? Which exercises can I do? I am desperate for a proper solution for this, as it is affecting my career and personal life.","Doctor":"Hi.

Two months back, one fine day, when I woke up I had acute pain in my whole body. I was unable to stand up, walk or pull anything. I had pain in and around the knees, elbow and wrist. I consulted a general physician and got uric acid test done. My uric acid was 8.3 mg/dL. My physician advised me to take certain medicine, but it did not give any relief even after 15 days and then physician advised me to consult an orthopedic doctor. Orthopedic doctor said me that the pain may be due to winter season and advised me to take certain medicine, but it did not give any relief even after 15 days. Then, I consulted a neurologist who advised me to take many tests (Hb, TC, DC, ESR, RA factor, platelet count, uric acid and LTF) and an MRI test (MRI of lumbosacral spine). In these tests everything was fine, except ESR, which was 70 mm in the first hour. Even my uric acid was under control. Again his medication did not give any result and my ankle started swelling. Then my neurologist suggested me to consult a rheumatologist. 12 days back, I consulted a rheumatologist who diagnosed my problem as acute polyarthritis and advised the following medicines. Injection Folitrax (once in a week), Zofer (one pill before injection), Folvite 5 mg (two tablets on weekends), Pantocid DSR (one pill daily) and Zycolchin (one pill daily). I also got the following tests done such as calcium, C-reactive protein, Anti-CCP, ANA, vitamin B12 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Everything was fine except C-reactive protein (3.6 mg/dL) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (3.87 ng/mL).

If you have been regular with your menses these years and this is the first episode at 53 years of age when the menses have been delayed by two weeks, the causes can be a possible initiation of perimenopausal stage where menses are often delayed for a month or two and slowly tend to stop in next one to two years. Perimenopausal stage can be verified with the hormonal FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (Luteinizing hormone) levels which if high shall indicate an onset of perimenopausal stage. However, it is suggested that pregnancy should anyways be ruled out and if negative then you can wait naturally for your menses to resume. Hence, try maintaining a menstrual calendar and keep a mark for your dates, duration of flow and quantity to evaluate the possible onset of a perimenopausal state.
