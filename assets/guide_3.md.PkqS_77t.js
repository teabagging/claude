I do have a past history of breast cancer, Stage 0, DCIS, and was put on Tamoxifen for five years after a breast biopsy and lympectomy. I have been cancer free for six years. My mother had breast cancer as well. I now need a MRI with contrast. I am a RN, but of course I am concerned. What can cause the shadowing on the ultrasound? I do have dense breasts, fibrocystic disease and saline bilateral implants behind the muscle. What are your thoughts please? Thank you!","Doctor":"DCIS(stage 0) is a precursor lesion for breast cancer, meaning if left untreated it progresses to Cancer.Thats why it is surgically removed and adjuvant treatments are offered to prevent its recurrence and futher progression to breast cancer.Coming to your question, Having dense breast tissue, fibrocystic disease and saline implants leads to varying tissue density , the shadowing can be a result of that. An MRI with contrast and breast coil is recommended to get complete information as the normal tissue is disturbed by surgery and implants.  Nevertheless a 50 % chance of malignancy is present in normal woman with such findings. Risk of recurrence  in your case is very low. I would also advise you to consult your onoclogist regarding continuation of tamoxifen for 5 more years. If you are post menopausal , letrazole/anastrazole is advised.Regards"},{"Patient":"Am I a low risk or intermediate risk?

I am Susan.  I am experiencing sharp pain in the lower right side of my abdomen.  It comes in waves, never going away, but sometimes less discomfort, then turning into stabbing pain. I notice I had a lot of unexplained flatulence last night and didn't feel very well.  The sharp pain started late this morning.  I am not eating anything different in my diet.  I took otc gas pills  at 5:00 pm this evening to no relief.  I also had a large bm at 5:30 this evening and thought that may help, but to no avail.  I am in extreme discomfort.  Anything I can do to give me quick relief?  I do not think this is appendix related as I can jump without making the pain worse.","Doctor":"HI Susan,It is not necessary that you have to have pain while jumping to be diagnosed as appendicitis. Appendicitis is more a clinical diagnosis, and investigations can only be corroborated with the physical findings.As you had a large bowel motion, you have to exclude any kind of food poisoning if you eat from outside. Apart from it a ureteric calculi may also give rise to similar symptoms of pain which comes in waves. I would also like to know date of your LMP(Last menstrual period) if you are in your reproductive age, and are sexually active. If you have a missed period, then you should go for a urine pregnancy test and a serum HCG test on consultation with your family physician. If still nothing is clear, then your physician may advise you for an ultrasound to exclude any other intra abdominal pathology,which might have been missed clinically. Wishing you an early recovery."},{"Patient":"I was recently diagnosed with single cell lung cancer. I ve completed 30 treatments of radition and 4 treatments of chemotherapy.

Four days ago I had surgery on my breast.  Reduction, reconstruction and lipo.  I had been diagniosed with organising phnemonia few months ago, which eventually I should treat with steriods, but didn't want to before this op.  I have been coughing up a little bit of phlem and sometimes there is a bit of blood in it.  In November I had a broncoscopy and they preformed lots of biopbsies which all came back clear of cancer and other things (that's why they are putting it down to BOOP) A couple of days after the broncoscopy I was coughing hard and burst a blood vessel and was coughing up blood (I went to the hospital and that's what they told me)  It settled down.Should I be concerned about the blood as I am panicking because to me blood means cancer.  I do cough hard.I am a non smoker.  Thank you","Doctor":"hi dear. blood on coughing is always abnormal. there are other causes also, other than cancer, for such symptoms eg. tuberculosis, BOOP, ulcers etc. as your previous biopsies were normal, so chances are less that it will be cancer. if your age is less than 50 years, chances are less for cancer. if you are a nonsmoker and female chances are lesser. so i think that the bleeding is related to your  previous pathology rather than cancer. but you should consult a chest physician to treat the underlying cause."},{"Patient":"My wife's cousin, who also happens to be her best friend has developed pancreatic cancer which has also been found in her liver.

But since you are a patient of lymphoma, it can be related to it as you will be having high lymphocyte count as well as lymphocytosis (mature as well as immature) in other organs too.

Following this the surgeon may put her on medication or may decide to operate again if there is indication of the intestines getting blocked.She should not ignore the pains any longer and seek surgeon consultation at the earliest.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been having thin red blood in my stool. I am female and only 41 years old. Is it possibly cancer? I have had it since I had a hysterectomy in 2012 and have been having blood in my stool since then. I did go to the doctor and she told me it was hemmoroids and another doctor told me it was a fissure. Confused....and worried.","Doctor":"Sir, pseudumyxoma peritonei is a bad disease with high recurrence rates.It responds poorly to chemotherapy.

Her primary physician has stated he would not treat this, but we are wondering if she should get another opinion as far as possible treatments.  She is currently on Hospice, using a concentrator for oxygen (at 4) and is using 2mg of Moraphine once a day before she goes to bed to help with breathing.  Her breathing is labored, but has become much better since we increased the concentration of her oxygen.  She is 76 yrs old and a survivor of Breast cancer (2007).

Nerve pain and tingling is an ongoing thing now for over 5 weeks.  Just two days ago his left ankle started swelling up.  What could that be all about?","Doctor":"please dont worry. I hope your father was offered acyclovir for shingles. Prednisolone is also prescribed in severe cases to reduce nerve pain. Other medications like amitryptyline give relief from neuropathic pain.

Since i am at a higher risk than realized, I guess I should say, should I inform my Dr?","Doctor":"it would be better if you get periodically screened for cancer.

It has been a really rough last few years including a divorce and a move to another state after 40+ years in a place I love to a place I dislike, but for family reasons.. Before that I had been taking Citalopram (sp/0 for quite a number of years for the same thing with no side effects and mild to moderate relief. A couple of weeks before Thanksgiving I developed diarrhea like I have never had before---watery and uncontrollable to the point I was afraid to go to sleep at night without an old, heavy towel under me to keep from messing the mattress. i am also very drowsy much of the time and have a terrible time getting up in the morning, often sleep quite late (thank heaven I am retired, age 66, and don t have a daily schedule I must meet. Then I have a terrible time not dosing off in the afternoon. My mood has improved significantly, but no cause has been determined for the diarrhea. I have had blood, urine and stool tests--no infection, though I was put on Cipro for 10 days before the test results came back just in case .. Next is an early colonoscopy. My previous colonoscopies have been normal. I see that diarrhea can be a side effect of Cymbalta, but mine did not appear until a couple of months after I started taking it.. I had no problems at all initially. Now I am just plain depressed by the limitations the diarrhea has put on my life. I am hinking I should go back to the Citalapram, and seeing a counselor I found who will take Medicare, and deep six the Cymbalta. Till now I have not known enough to ask my doctor if there might be a connection, but I plan to ASAP when I can get an appointment, which is usually pretty quickly. What do you think? Are there withdarwal symptoms associated with Cymbalta? I am getting really desperate. I cancelled Thanksgiving with my family and two long planned road trips becaus of this. That, in itself is really depressing and I think my family thinks I am turning into a hypochondriac and I am practically living on Imodium, beside losing 5 pounds,which, in my case, is not at all a good thing.

But there was only an increased risk after 15 years use for hormone sensitive breast cancers (oestrogen or progesterone receptor positive) and after 20 years use for all types of breast cancer. The researchers say that the risk of breast cancer after 20 years use is about 40% higher. So, in women taking oestrogen only HRT for 20 years, these researchers expect that 49 women would get breast cancer out of every thousand. In women not taking HRT, 35 out of a thousand would be expected to develop breast cancer.RegardsDR De"},{"Patient":"I was a breast cancer-2nd stage patient,in 1998,at the age of 41 years,got surgery.Total masectomy,had radiation and kheemo therapy done.Every year i am going for tests in hyderabad.I have a daughter,do i need to have BRCA tests done now.Where is it done at Hyderabad,(address)and what is the cost for it..plz clarify my doubt.

He also lost 40 pounds unintentionally in the last year or two. He also has fatigue, and his blood pressure is getting lower, He had an atrial septal defect (3 holes) repaired about 6 years ago and was put on blood pressure medication to slow down his heart. My husband cut the atenolol in half within the last year. He had a kidney repair 36 years ago for because of a congenital anomoly where the kidney was not draining into the ureter because the connection was too small. His kidneys have been checked (left one only functions at 20-30%) and was told they are okay. He has had a colonoscopy, x-rays, MRI, CT scan etc, and many lab works done. They cannot find anything. He looks as though he is withering away. He is 6 feet 1 inches and used to work hard to keep his weight just under 200 pounds, and he now weighs 166 pounds. It started with the abdominal pain and the other symptoms are now getting worse. Could this be some endocrine type of disorder? He had a recent AM cortisol done which was okay, but he had it repeated today. Very frustrated!! He has also had a metal-on-metal hip placed 6 years ago. It doesn't seem to bother him very much, just on and off sometimes. Could this be the metal getting into his system? My husband still feels as though there is something wrong with kidney.","Doctor":"Hi ! Losing 40 pounds unintentionally is of course worrisome. When was his colonoscopy done ? If it was long back, then I think he should get it repeated. Was any biopsy done at that time or not ? If not, then you may discuss with your gastro enterologist for it during the repeat colonoscopy. Many times inflammatory bowel disease does not get diagnosed for a long time unless biopsy is done and this could be a reason for the weight loss and pain in abdomen. He should continue with his anti hypertensive medications. If there is no blockage in the pelvi-ureteric system after the operation for kidney, then nothing much to worry from that angle, but if there is a blockage persisting, then it could also give rise to the pain in flank. It does not seem to be related to any endocrine system. You can discuss with your doctor for a CT Scan or a PET scan if nothing is conclusive based on the weight loss, which is significant.I wish your husband an early recovery."},{"Patient":"My friend has just received results.

Hepatitis C can cause such elevations without a lot of symptoms. If you were my patient, that is one of the first things I would check.

Would supplements be suggested by my Oncologists if they would be a good idea. . .or should I ask, because they might not think outside the AMA box so readily?","Doctor":"You don't say what kind of supplements you are considering. You need to talk to your oncologists. Even certain supplements and herbal medicines may interact with the chemotherapy you are receiving, so they need to know so they can advise you properly. I would not recommend taking supplements in place of the chemotherapy. If your oncologists thought a supplement such as iron would help with your low RBC count, I am sure they would suggest it. Usually the RBCs are low because of the cancer and chemotherapy and not because of iron deficiency. In that case iron wouldn't help much. Eating good nutritional meals and using food supplements like Ensure may be helpful.Hope this answers your query.

I too have a son 9 y.o. who has been diagnosed with a 12p12.1 deletion and cerebral palsy. The geneticists at a top children s hospital had no experience with 12p12.1 deletion and could only find two other cases in the world in the medical journals. The geneticists nor the neurologist could tell us what to expect. The two cases found in the medical journal were apparently much more severe. My son has mild developmental delay, mild speech and motor delays, vision issues and has recently developed a movement disorder. He is able to run and play and is served under an IEP in the inclusion classroom to address reading, writing and math delays. I have done internet research and am concerned that I see genes in that region associated with cancer. Could this increase the likelihood of him developing cancer. Also, With the diagnosis of 12p12.1 deletion, would there not be another chromosome 12 (since they occur in pairs) that would contain the genes that are missing.","Doctor":"Hello, Having a genetic deletion does not automatically increase the risk of cancer. Cancer is always multifactorial and genetics is a certain risk factor. Chromosome occurs in pairs. But some times gene requires two copies for normal expression to be produced. So one chromosome has deletion, end product won't be there. As there is limited knowledge in present deletion, not much can be commented upon.Now about risk of cancer - what cancer are we talking about. If we check ourselves, we would have plenty of mutated gene causing us high risk. As it has a multifactorial cause, cancer risk would be the same as most of us. However, better nutrition and healthy habits can still further reduce the risk.Hope I have answered your query. Happy to help, if you have any further queries.PS.

Internal bleeding or injury to internal organs: it can be detected by Ultrasound scan of the abdomen & pelvis.If any injury is noted, it should be managed immediately.So, it will be better to start with topical analgesic & muscle relaxants.

The radiation therapy given to face and neck area for tongue cancer has the following side effects:1. It burns out the taste buds resulting in loss of taste sensation. Most of the patients can only appreciate salty taste.2. It damages saliva producing glands resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth)3. It damages the mucosa (inner lining) of tongue, mouth and throat which causes painful and difficult swallowing.These side effects might improve with time but it is never a complete recovery. Lifestyle changes will help reduce the intensity of symptoms.I will suggest the following:1. Maintain good oral hygiene. Avoid menthol or chlorhexidine containing toothpaste and mouth wash respectively as they cause irritation of mucosa. Use only benzydamine containing mouth wash.2. Take frequent small sips of water instead of full glass at a time in order to keep mouth moist.3. Chew sugar free chewing gums to stimulate the residual salivary glands to produce saliva.4. Avoid spicy, sour foods. Generally salty foods are better tolerated in this condition.5. Use of suspension sucrulfate may help. Keep in mouth for 3-5 minutes and then swallow.6.

Ideally radiation therapy (RT) should be completed within the stipulated time. Since RT MegaVoltage machines have sophisticated electronics, machine breakdowns do occur and are common world over. To overcome the detrimental effects of gaps during RT, different institutes follow different SOPs. Some are:1. Treat on closed day/ bank holidays to cover for gap.2. Give two exposures of RT per day with a gap of atleast 6 hours in a day.3. Increase the dose per exposure to compensate for the gaps.4. Shifting patient to a mirror machine in case of long breakdowns.Fortunately breast cancer has a slow doubling time and time to kick off (radiobiological terms which I will not be able to explain unless you have a sound knowledge of radiation biology) and so gaps are not as detrimental as in Head & Neck cancer or cancer of cervix.

Its very sad to hear about your sister's health. Stomach cancer is notorious for producing sub centimeter peritoneal metastasis (peritoneum is the inner lining of abdomen and the coverings of stomach and intestines). Sensitivity of PET scan is low for detecting sub centimeter metastasis and so a diagnostic laproscopy (putting a camera into the abdominal cavity) to rule out peritoneal deposits before radical surgery is recommended.Stage 4 stomach cancer has poor prognosis with a 5 year survival rate of less than 5% and a median survival of 9 to 12 months.Palliative chemotherapy after radiation therapy will continue till disease progression or till the time patient can tolerate chemotherapy.I hope your questions have been answered.

I would be grateful if you could advise on possible next steps. Does it just require patience on my part?Many Thanks","Doctor":"HiSometimes,because of continuous bleeding from small blood vessel,there will be haematoma after any surgery.As your surgery was 3 weeks ago,it should get subsided by now.Please go for an Ultrasound abdomen and see the nature of the swelling.If it contains fluid,it could be haematoma.Sometimes,after healing of the wound,there will be induration which will be hard.So,get it confirmed by ultrasound abdomen.IF haematoma is confirmed,please get it drained as it may get infected.Wish you good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"I passed 4 brown/black fibrous things about 1/2 inch long in my stool.

Will we have to put her in a nursing home? She was vomiting blood last nite.","Doctor":"hi, what ever u have written indicates towards a cancerous growth in esophagus, but final diagnosis is given by biopsy. the extent of disease/ stage of disease is to be analysed with the help of a good quality CT scan or other imaging. after stage of disease, to some extent we can predict the average survival. sometimes if first biopsy is inconclusive, we may do second biopsy. her admission into a nursing home is not necessary just because of the fear of malignancy. follow the advise of ur doctor and give ur sister care and love as much as u can."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor,My dad was operated for prostate cancer two years ago and the recent psa reading is 0.02 (previous readings were 0.01).

From the information you have provided, it seems your treating team has given you the understanding that if PET SCAN turns out to be negative for metastatic disease then the CT scan picture at the moment makes the tumor resectable.Adenocarcinoma of Lung can be cured with surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if required depending upon hitopathology report).

I m from chittagong bangladesh.","Doctor":"Breast cancer is considered a systemic disease i.e. apart from the cancer in the breast, microscopic cells are considered to be in circulation in the body that may deposit and form a tumor nidus elsewhere in body (metastasis). So breast cancer is treated with multimodality therapy including surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation therapy and/or biological therapy.Any primary breast cancer that is more than1cm in size needs systemic therapy which is usually chemotherapy. Your oncologist will order estrogen receptor ER, progesterone receptor PR and Her2 neu receptor status on the histopathology specimen of the removed breast cancer. If ER and/or PR status is positive then chemotherapy will be followed by hormone therapy as well and if Her2 neu receptor status is positive then a year of biological therapy with trastuzumab will also be given after chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is given after considering certain features in hitopathology report.I hope your query has been answered. If you have any further questions I will be happy to answer.

Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi. Very sorry to hear about your mother's illness. I am sure a CT scan of chest must have been done before proceeding onto biopsy. If not, it should be done.From the description you have given index of suspicion for malignancy (cancer) should remain very high in this case. Since she has a previous history of breast cancer I suspect that its a breast cancer relapse in lungs producing multiple metastasis.Other possibilities are primary lung cancer with metastasis or primary cancer elsewhere with lung metastasis.The exact primary disease will be confirmed by histopathology report of biopsy. Immunohistochemistry IHC will also help in narrowing down on the diagnosis.Once diagnosis of cancer is confirmed, metastasis in other body parts should be ruled out with an ultrasound scan of abdomen & pelvis and a bone scan.I hope your query has been answered.

You have CLD (chronic liver disease) secondary to hepatitis B resulting in liver damage and cirrhosis ( shrinking ) of liver. The dilated gastroesophageal varices are dilated blood vessels under the inner lining (mucosa) at the junction of esophagus (food pipe ) with stomach. Theses varices form due to high pressure in portal circulation due to shrinking of liver. Portal circulation is the blood vessel system responsible for bringing blood from intestines to liver. High pressure in portal circulation also results in splenomegaly (enlargement of spleen due to back pressure).Propranol is given as a prophylaxis to prevent bleeding from gastro-esophageal varices by lowering pressure in splanchnic circulation (vessels supplying & draining blood from gut).Yes liver cirrhosis puts you at high risk for liver cancer. It takes years to develop. I would suggest that you have your ultrasound scan of liver on 6 monthly basis to pick any malignant nodule at an early stage.I hope I have answered your query.

Whether her life time will be short .please explain in detail","Doctor":"Hi. Very sorry to hear about your mother's illness.Breast cancer with secondaries (metastasis) to back bone is stage 4 disease. Stage 4 disease is not curable. Its treatment includes chemotherapy &/or hormone therapy, bisphosphonates and radiation therapy if required.Breast cancer with only bone metastasis has better overall survival than breast cancer and metastasis to other organs like liver. The survival also depends upon the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and Her2 neu receptor status of the tumor. ER and/or PR positive tumors with bone only metastasis have a better median survival of about 60 months with treatment compared to 40 months for Her2 positive or ER , PR and Her2 negative patients. Median survival means that studies have shown that at the median survival time 50% of patients were alive and 50% were dead with the particular disease.You can ask the treating oncologist regarding sites of metastasis and ER,PR and Her2 status of your mother's breast cancer.I hope I have answered your question.

If residual tumor is found on histopathology report of dissected specimen, two further cycles of chemotherapy will have to be given.Retroperitoneal lymph nodes dissection's most common side effect is retrograde ejaculation apart from surgical complications like wound infection, blood loss during surgery etc like in any other surgery.I hope I have answered your query. Please discuss it with your oncologist and I would be happy to answer any further questions.Thankyou for choosing Healthcare Magic."},{"Patient":"I had breast cancer eighteen years ago; consequently I had a lumpectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A year ago I was diagnosed with D.C.I.S. in the same breast, I had this breast removed in July. Last week I had my regular blood test; these tests were not because of cancer. However the results indicate that I have high glucose levels. Does this mean that I might have cancer in another part of my body?","Doctor":"Hi. Raised plasma glucose level does NOT indicate cancer at some site. It shows that you may have diabetes mellitus.Do you have a family history of Diabetes Mellitus? Was it a first reading of raised plasma glucose level? How high was the plasma glucose level from upper limit and was it fasting or random levels?If it's the first time a raise in plasma glucose levels is observed, I would suggest that you have your fasting plasma glucose levels (after at least 10 hours fast) repeated. If it is raised have your serum glycated hemoglobin levels (serum HbA1c levels) done which will give your plasma glucose control for last 3 months and discuss with a dietitian and your doctor for dietary recommendation and medication (if required)I hope it helps. I would be happy to answer any further questions if any."},{"Patient":"My mother in law has lung cancer and keeps getting fluid drained from her lungs? They are talking about putting in a tube so she can drain them from home? How serious is this procedure and does this mean her cancer has progressed and she is going to pass away soon?","Doctor":"Your mother in law is suffering from stage 4 lung cancer.The tube inserted in her tube is called chest tube.It will help her as the recurrent fluid which will accumulate in her lungs will drain to the chest tube automatically and tapping in lungs will not have to be done.A procedure called pleurodesis can be done where a chemical is inserted in the lungs through the chest tube which will cause the fluid not to be accumulate in her chest anymore.She is in stage 4 lung cancer and now the aim should only be basic supportive care.RegardsDR De"},{"Patient":"My dad had colon cancer 23 yrs ago and had his colon removed and has been cancer free ever since. He went in to have his gallbladder removed and they found spots on his liver but all bloodwork was normal. They are doing a biopsy, but I m too anxious for the results. Are his odds higher for liver cancer?","Doctor":"Hi. The biopsy will clear the doubt. There are chances of having spread (metastasis) from his old treated cancer as well as metastasis fron some other cancer and liver cancer itself. If his blood tests of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and CEA are normal, odds of liver cancer and metastasis from colon cancer are low. Biopsy is the recommended procedure to make things clear.

I have been getting lower right abdominal pain recently, and I went to walk-in clinic and did a urinalysis test. It is not appendicitis because its a different pain from that. Doctor said my urine has a lot of white cells and that my bladder is infected. He gave me antibiotics to cure it. But I do not have any other symptoms of bladder infection (urge to urinate, blood in urine, etc) except for bladder pain (lower right ab). It is now hurting my right back, pelvis, and upper legs of my right side too. I sometimes get pain in my lower right ab where my right bladder is, when I urinate. The right side of my body's pain goes on when I am lying down, too.  Would it be better to go to another doctor? Or get a CT scan or ultrasound? Do I have bladder infection??","Doctor":"Welcome to health care magic. 1.The possibilities in this case will be repeated UTI or any calculus in the right lower ureter. 2.As your history suggest the pain gets ease off after passing urine - suggest possibilities of any calculus in the kidney or ureter. 3.In this case its recommended to get a ultrasound abdomen and pelvis - to evaluate the kidney and urinary bladder. 4. Infection features in the urine also seen in case of the calculus.  5. Some time after the antibiotic course of UTI - the intestine does gives some discomfort and pain. How so ever i recommend to get Ultrasound.

I do 5 day regiments w/ 2 weeks off.  I am concerned because the last 3 days I have been unable to do anything but stay in bed and that has not helped.  I feel drainrd with ache muscles and shortness of breath.  Could I be acing a chemical imbalance or what do you think.   Exhausted","Doctor":"EP chemotherapy is a two drug protocol containing Etoposide and Cisplatin.Etoposide's major toxicity is myelosuppression ( i.e it decreases blood cell counts) and Cisplatin is notorious for kidney toxicity and electrolyte imbalances. The toxicities of both these drugs is cumulative that is it adds on as the chemotherapy cycles progress.Now feeling of being drained with aches and shortness of breath can be due to anemia secondary to myelosuppression. The muscle aches and weakness may be due to hypokalemia (low serum potassium levels) and/or hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels). I would suggest that you have your lab investigations including Complete blood counts (CBC) and Renal function tests (RFTs) including electrolytes to see if there is any abnormality which can be rectified.I hope I have answered your query.

Lately he has been very fatigued and sleeping alot.  I'm trying not to worry because we won't know if benign or malignant until after it is removed but I can't help it.  Are there tumors that are benign that have the same characteristics?","Doctor":"Tumors that rapidly increase in size over a short period of time with associated enlarged cervical lymph nodes are usually malignant.If a patient had presented with these features in my clinic, I would have advised a FNAC of parotid swelling and an MRI scan. FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) of parotid swelling will give a diagnosis if malignant cells are seen. MRI scan would give better tissue contrast and involvement of deeper lobe or facial nerve (which traverses through parotid gland).I hope it helps.

It is seen to be an infected area as opposed to a tumerous mass, but it is a rather large area thats involved. Can you tell me if this in your opinion, can be surgically removed without leaving her with a stoma or if it can be cured with radiotherapy and chemotharapy? Regards Anita","Doctor":"A rectal tumor which is located 15cm from anal verge in the rectum can be removed surgically with an anterior resection without the need of a permanent stoma. Other factors have to be considered prior to this surgery including:1. Is the tumor localized or has distant mets. A CAT scan of abdomen and pelvis and a chest radiograph would give the stage of the disease and confirm or rule out metastasis.2. Negative circumferential resection margins (CRM) can be obtained or not. An MRI of rectum will settle this issue.If patient has no distant metastasis and no peri-rectal extension (extension through rectal muscle into surrounding tissue) or peri-rectal lymph adenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes around rectum) then upfront surgery with anterior resection can be done.If there is peri-rectal extension (T3 tumor) or peri-rectal lymph nodes then neoadjuvant (pre surgery) chemoradiation therapy needs to be given prior to anterior resection.If there are distant metastasis then its a palliative case requiring palliative surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.I hope I have answered your query.

Late last February 2011 I started to have some light post menapausal bleeding. I made an appointment with my gyn about 6 weeks later. Turns out I had endometrial adenocarcinoma which was found during a hysterectomy in June 2011. No lymph nodes were taken, cancer was unexpected. Gyn/Onc did a CT scan after hysterectomy which came back all good, he noted 2 small lung nodules (1 was 2mm, 1 was 4mm) but said he wasnt concerned and was nearly positive that had nothing to do with the cancer. Since lymph nodes werent taken, he said he was 85% sure that it didnt invade the nodes but he ordered a PET scan as well in late July 2011 and all came back clear. The cancer was invasive endometrial adenocarcinoma, Stage 1b (new FIGO staging), Grade 2. It says that it was contained in uterus but was about 79% through muscle. There was \\"some\\" LVSI. My Gyn/Onc said that with no further treatment he would put my non-recurrence rate at 80% but with external and external radiation, he would put it about 90-95%. I had all the external radiation and internal radiation treatments in August/September 2011. The Gyn/Onc said that since it has been 6 months since my last scan (clear PET Scan in late July 2011, after my hysterectomy but before my radiation treatments began) he would have me do a CT (chest, abdomen, pelvis) this week and meet with him for my 6 month follow up next week. I havent had any symptons or anything since my radiation, and my PET was clear 6 months ago, yet I am nervous my CT will show a recurrence or some problem. Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Your oncologist rightly explained to you the benefit of external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy (internal radiation). Surgery alone results in Disease Free Survival rate (DFS) at 5 years of 80% and addition of radiation therapy to surgery improves the DFS to about 95%.You have received the standard treatment after your surgery and you do not have any symptoms at present, so it would be a surprise if the follow up CT scan shows a recurrence. So, stay positive. Wishing you all the best and a healthy life ahead."},{"Patient":"My brother who is a recovering addict and has COPD has been diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. They say it is limited stage, but he is presenting with a lot of symptoms. He has started Chemo 3 days a week and then again in 2 weeks with radiation every day. Realisticly, what are his chances of survival?","Doctor":"Small cell lung cancer is a very aggressive disease. The tumor responds initially well to chemotherapy and radiation therapy with complete responses (no evidence of disease on repeat CT scaning) in 45 to 60 % of limited stage disease patients. But it has a tendency to relapse in the medistinum (the central compartment between the two lungs) and in the brain. That is why after completion of his chemoradiotherapy to the thoracic (chest) disease, your brother will be given prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) to prevent relapse in brain.The 5 year survival rate of limited stage SCLC is 25%, meaning one fourth of the treated patients of limited stage disease would be alive at 5 years.I hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be more than happy to answer. Wishing your brother a rapid recovery and good health."},{"Patient":"I am trying to understand what is meant by - right upper lobe 5 mm non-calcified nodule and suggestion of a vague subcentimeter satellite nodule versus focal inflammation or fibrosis; although the nodule may be inflammatory/granulomatous, a pulmonary metastasis or early primary neoplasm the result of a baseline CT study following Chemotherapy after surgery for ovarian cancer.","Doctor":"It means a 5 mm lesion (shadow) seen on the CT scan in right lung in its upper lobe (Right lung has three lobes: upper, middle and lower). Since the nodule size is very small 5mm (half of a centimeter), the radiologist has not been able to give an exact disgnosis and he has given a differential diagnosis (meaning it can be one of the following) of the following:1. Inflammatory/granulomatous lesion: secondary to infection or foreign body etc2. Pulmonary metastasis: metastatic disease to lungs is a possibility since you have a primary ovarian cancer3. Early primary neoplasm: A primary lung cancer in its very early stages because of the small size.Since the size of the lesion is very small, a biopsy would not be possible to confirm the diagnosis. I would suggest a repeat CT scan after 2 months to see if the nodule size has increased. If the size remains stable, its likely to be benign. If it increases to > 1 cm, a PET scan or a biopsy can be done.I hope I have answered your query. I would be more than happy to answer if you have any further queries."},{"Patient":"My 96-year old mother has suddenly developed a pain in her lower left abdomen.

The CT scan showed a cyst on one of my fallopian tubes and they are planning to send me for another to check if it is still there before they proceed further.  Nothing else was detected on the first CT scan.  Should I be concerned regarding a potential cancer of my ovaries, fallopian tubes, etc.","Doctor":"Although Leser Trelat sign is associated with malignancy, cases have been reported in literature where it occured with benign tumors as well. The suspicion of index for a malignant primary tumor should remain high. If the repeat CT scan shows the cyst on the fallopian tube, it should be biopsied.

Pl. advise","Doctor":"Hi. I think the issue is not with taste buds. In fact, after radiotherapy there develops a phenomenon we called Radiation induced mucositis (RIM). There is inflammation of mucosa of mouth and throat along with destruction of salivary glands that produce watering in mouth. This results in extreme dryness in mouth and pain while eating and even talking. There can also be ulcers in mouth. Unfortunately, RIM take long time to settle and dryness of mouth usually last quite long. There are many measures you can take. Ask your mother to take more fluids and semi-solid high caloric diets. Taking frequent sips of water along food help reduce dryness. She can use artificial saliva for reducing dryness. If she is not diabetic natural honey improves RIM and also have high nutritional value. Honey can be mixed in water or milk. Nutritional supplements like ensure powder will be helpful if she is not having diabetes(sugar).

My question - does CML cause internal bleeding, and does being on gleevec help or hurt this?Thank you,Susan","Doctor":"You have not mentioned whether your husband was in chronic phase or accelerated  phase at diagnosis.Chronic phase CML is unlikely to be associated with bleeding from gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Colonoscopy is the right way to proceed to look for a pathology in colon or rectum causing the bleed.Accelerated phase CML can be associated with bleeding from GIT and in that case Gleevec is likely to stop the bleed by improving blood cell counts.Please discuss it with your oncologist."},{"Patient":"Mid 50s male ... testicular cancer survivor w no symptoms for 5 years and have been celibate since my cancer first was manifest (5 years ago) ... now on a bender in Bangkok ...  1st night good vigorous sex session ... condom of course and no issues 2 night later post sex had blood in my urine.

She has been suffering from headaches since 10 years. whenever she used to get headache she used to take paracetamol 500 mg and it used to get reduced. she used to get headache twice  a month during the last 2 years and she used to take paracetamol. But 3 month back, she has got severe headache along with vomitings. So we went to a neurologist and got a CT scan done which says like this \\"RIGHT PARASAGITTAL OCCIPETAL EXTRA AXIAL CALIFICATION IS SEEN\\". Impression of the report goes like this \\" ?MENINGEAL CALCIFICATION, CALCIFIED MENINGEOMA IN RIGHT OCCIPETAL REGION\\".Doctor has prescribed encorate chrono 200 mg(Twice a day), spenzo(0.5mg), Mylonerv D tablets. . she used them for 1 month . she did not get headache in this 1 month.After 1 month when we went for follow up, Doctor prescribed the following medicines    -   Franxit(composition-flupentixol 0.5mg, melitracen 10mg) ,               Vibrania D(composition-vitamin d3,methylcobalamin,pyridoxine hydrochloride) tablets. she used them for 2 months. she did not get headache in these two months also.  10 days back we went for follow up .

They arise from meninges which are sheaths covering brain and spinal cord. They are usually benign and slow growing with resultant calcification.Since they are causing symptoms I strongly suggest that the patient gets an MRI scan of brain and is seen by a neurosurgeon for possibility of safe excision.

I’ve Type-2 Diabetic since 2007 and it’s well under control with Metformin.      I’ve been given steroids and Plasmapheresis twice to control my spinal chord inflammation. All the tests came negative for MS, NMO and all other known autoimmune diseases. This time CT Scan was done to check under the spinal chord cancer and that also came negative. All of my blood tests came negative.      First time, I was admitted in Valley Presbyterian hospital on Oct. 17th after they saw lesion in my spinal chord in MRI, I was tread for Transverse Myelitis with 5 dozes of steroids. I was discharged from the hospital and i was able to walk (no oral medicine was given).      I had 1st relapse after 2 weeks, i was transferred to Keck Medical Center of USC. This replace was very severe leaving my lower part of body below the chest area completely paralyzed, lost pain and temperature sensations.      I was treated with 5 dozes of steroids and oral medicine for 2 days but my condition was not getting better so the did 5 days treatment of Plasmapheresis. I was able to move my toes after the Plasmapheresis. I was shifted to rehab and after 7 days, i was able to walk with walker then cane and then without cane slowly (no oral medicine was given).      I had 2nd relapse after 1 month. Luckily we got on time and the condition did not go worse, after 5 days of Plasmapheresis treatment i was discharged on 24th Dec. and now i’m walking again without cane.      This time Dr. has put me on immunosuppressive Prednisone 40mg twice an day until the Azathioprine 50mg once a day kicks in. They will monitor my condition with blood tests to keep my immune system suppress.      It’s idiopathic transverse myelitis and they are not able to find out what triggered my immune system. they will try all the medicine to see which will help to keep my immune system suppress. I know the possible of side effects of weakening my immune system. I would appreciate your response to my question. Thanks in advance for taking time and looking into my request.

Since plasmaphoresis helped you both times, it is antibodies that are causing problem thats why we call it auto immune. Cause can be viral infection. even some menifestation of known or unknown infection. It could be allergy to something in food or air. Malfunctioning of your immune system as well.

Appendicitis can be excluded more confidently by clinical examination than with any kind of investigations like X ray. Sometimes gall stones and kidney/ureteric stone may also give rise to such symptoms, and an ultrasound abdomen is considered to be a better modality in detecting stones, which you can go for after discussing with your treating physician. Also you can discuss with him for a liver function test with serum amylase and lipase. In the mean while, you should stop eating from outside like fast and fried food or alcoholic beverages, if you do. You can also go for some kind of prokinetic drug and proton pump inhibitor along with a probiotic on consultation with your doctor.

Since the patient is receiving chemotherapy, febrile neutropenia should be suspected. It means fever in the setting of low  white blood cell count. These white blood cells act as body's police against infectious agents preventing infections. If due to chemotherapy, the white blood cell count (specifically neutrophil count) drops, infections occur. You need to have his complete blood counts CBC test to rule out neutropenia.

It can be due to low platelet count (platelets are responsible for clotting blood). Although abiraterone is not known for decreasing blood cell count but this possibility should be ruled out.

My mom has even questioned if the cancer spread to his brain because he is not the same person he was before going in for the 2nd surgery.  After the first one he was back riding his bicycle 10 miles on some days.  He was not given a life expectancy but his doctors told us that he will be with us 10 years from now although they would have to go back in and clean up his liver again within that time.  We are trying to figuring out what is causing all these changes in him so any help would be great!  thanks","Doctor":"Mood swings and personality changes need to be investigated in a cancer patient who already has stage 4 disease with liver metastasis.

Most common are the germ cell tumors with two subtypes seminomatous and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors.Apart from lymph nodes in back (retroperitoneum), serum tumor marker levels ( including serum alpha-fetoprotein, serum beta-HCG  and serum LDH ) have to be taken into account for treatment decision and response monitoring.If only lymph nodes are there, it is stage 2 and if liver involvement is also there it is stage 3.

What should I do?","Doctor":"Anal canal cancer is treated by chemotherapy with 5-FU and Mitomycin alongwith external beam radiation therapy. The symptoms you have mentioned are due to side effects of chemo-radiotherapy. You need to have a urine RE  (routine examination) test and a course of antibiotics will help. Meanwhile increase your fluid intake. Cranberry juice will also help in settling the urinary issue.The dark skin and blister can be treated with topical application of steroid, antibiotic and antifungal cream combination. Once the chemoradiotherapy  is complete you will be observed for reduction in size of tumor. Normally anal canal cancers keep reducing in size upto 3 months.

The site of primary origin of tumor has to be determined.Cytological exam to look for malignant cells in the abdominal fluid (ascites) drained should be done. A CAT scan of abdomen and pelvis and a chest radiograph will aid in looking for the primary tumor site. A needle biopsy of primary tumor (if located) should be done. If primary is not found than needle biopsy of liver metastasis with histopathological exam and immunohistochemistry IHC to determine primary tumor of origin will be required and will aid in treatment planning.Since it is stage 4, treatment will be palliative and is likely to be chemotherapy.Please discuss it with your oncologist."},{"Patient":"I am a very fit/active 46 year old female (exercise 6 days a week - mostly high intensity exercise).

Inhale steam for 10 to 15 minutes thrice daily. Maintain good hydration with good fluid intake. A short course of NSAIDS pain killers will also help.The acid reflux is GERD (gastro esophageal reflux disease). You need to reduce the acid production in your stomach with a PPI proton pump inhibitor like meprazole or esomeprazole and increase the motility of your gut with a pro-kinetic drug. Raising head end of your bed slightly will help. Try sleeping in right lateral posture to promote stomach emptying.I hope it helps.

What could I have and what should I do?","Doctor":"HI Thank for choosing HCMIf your blood test, scanning test are negative then there is strong possibility of ulcerative  colitis and the colonoscopy is the only way to confirm it, if turns negative then go for stool examination this will clear the picture, or barium meal study, if every test shows no abnormality then this could be anxiety depression related problem, Have nice day."},{"Patient":"is fibroadenosis and fibroadenoma the same thing?i just found out through an ultrasound that i have a small fibroadenoma with normal cysts.do i have to remove it and will it turn cancerous as my doctor says it is fine?i used to get a lot of fibroadenosis during menstruation time.i am 42yrs old and pre menopause.","Doctor":"Fibroadenoma is a benign condition and since it is small in size and is not causing symptoms, it can be safely observed."},{"Patient":"Hi I had an ultrasound that showed multinodular goitre, a cystic mass with solid components and thyroid lower poles reaching both sides of the neck, I have been feeling lethargic had weight loss and difficulty breathing I am concerned about thyroid cancer","Doctor":"You need further investigations. 1. Thyroid function tests TFTs to see if you are hyperthyroid, euthyroid or hypothyroid.2. An ultrasound of neck and an ultrasound guided FNAC (fine needle aspiration for cytology ) of suspicious nodule in thyroid to get to a diagnosis.Dyspnea can be due to pressure on wind pipe from goitre. A chest radiograph should be done to see lungs for any abnormality.Weight loss can be due to a hyperfunctioning thyroid (Hyperthyroidism) but a malignancy should be suspected.I hope it helps.Please discuss it with your doctor."},{"Patient":"hi  my name is sade, i just recently learned that my mother has cancer. yes they found it in the early stages and have begun the process of chemo but her white cells aren't building back up like they should. what can i do to help increase them in a non harmful way.","Doctor":"White blood cell count can be safely increased with pegfilgrastim 6mg given subcutaneously. This injection should be given at least 24 hours after chemotherapy and next chemotherapy should be administered 14 days after the injection.If next chemotherapy is scheduled in less than 14 days from now, then injection filgrastim 6 microgram per kilogram can be given subcutaneously once daily for few days.Please discuss it with your oncologist."},{"Patient":"I have white patch in the right side of cheek and now a days i am feeling numbness in the cheek and stress / tightness in neck muscles.

Iam very concerned since Ive been having irregularity My docter diagnosed me with diverticulosis but he never schedualed a colonscopy and I'm afraid it could be colon cancer.","Doctor":"Altered bowel habits (irregularity) and blood in stools should be investigated. Possibility can be an inflammation mass secondary to diverticulitis causing obstructive symptoms and alteration in bowel habits but a high index of suspicion should be kept for colon cancer.I would suggest routine lab tests and an ultrasound scan of abdomen and pelvis to be followed by a CAT scan if required. If no inflammatory mass is seen then a colonocopy can be planned.Please discuss it with your doctor."},{"Patient":"hi, is nutrillite  protein powder good for cancer patients? my aunt already had a breast cancer surgery and completed her 1 year course of medicine after the surgery and now she is almost fine regarding her cancer. now she is has high blood pressure and she is a diabetic patient. can you please suggest me that is it good for her to consume nutrilite protein powder?","Doctor":"Nutrilite is a protein supplement and is safe to consume by a cancer survivor, diabetic or a hypertensive."},{"Patient":"My Digital Diagnostic Mamo revealed internal vascularity.  the Radiologist writes, color doppler interrogation reveals some internal vascularity,  The apearance is highly suspicious for malignancy,  I am having biopsy tomorrow, it says best performed under ultrasound, but the oncologist said he can do it without a ultrasound.

In that case even if all the scan results are normal, you can discuss with your doctor for a serum lipase and amylase estimatioin to rule out pancreatitis. Also, a repeat ultrasound after 24 hrs may be helpful. In the meantime, you can continue to go with pantoprazole as advised your doctor, and also a probiotic after consulting him. Also go for bland diet, and avoid spicy and fried food. Get a routine stool test for ova and cyst.Wishing you an early recovery."},{"Patient":"Hello, I had testicular cancer, i have been through chemotherapy, and was given the all clear 18months ago.

I am scheduled to return for another blood test in one month. Thanks","Doctor":"LDH is not a specific tumor marker and can be raised in benign conditions as well. If you are asymptomatic at present, have all tumor markers ( serum AFP, serum beta HCG, serum LDH) repeated in a months time. If raise persists or any tumor marker other than LDH is also raised, i would strongly favour imaging with CAT  scan.

I have been monitoring my PSA levels for many years.  I am 56 years old and my PSA levels have fluctuated up and  down from 2.6 to 3.3 over time. In 2008 it was 3.1 and just 2 wks ago it was 3.0.  I had a Colonoscopy on on the 28th of November and was concerned about my PSA, so I asked my DR. to do another PSA. In 11 days  PSA went from 3.0 to 3.4.  He said it was most likely due to the trauma of the colonoscopy.  On Nov 19th I had a PSA of 3.00, up from 2.7 last year and 2.8 on Dec 2010, so you can see how it moves up and down.  I have to take pain medication (Loratab) daily for over a year and was told that constipation can cause elevated PSA readings.  I am now taking more natural fiber, ie Metamucil, but will frequent Bowel Movements make PSA levels go up also.  I am now concerned that frequent bowl movements may be as harmful in raising PSA levels as constipation. I have no Family history of Prostate cancer, but have had 2 friends diagnosd with it within the past 2 years.  Should I be concerned?Both my Dr's say no","Doctor":"Prostate cancer causes a rise in serum PSA levels but a rising PSA level due to manipulation of prostate secondary to colonoscopy or constipation or digital rectal examination etc does NOT cause prostate cancer.From your question what i have understood is that you are concerned that a rise in PSA due to constipaton (resulting in prostatic massage with hard stools in rectal ampulla with resultant rise in PSA) can cause prostate cancer. It is NOT so. So don't worry about it."},{"Patient":"Im 43...have normal size uterus, normal size ovaries but endometrium is thick at 15mm. Ultrasound was done 5 days before period...doctor suggests GYN visit for possible endometrial carcinoma. Is it likely? My periods are like clockwork, no abnormal bleeding.

He began chemo 3 weeks ago and was admitted to the hospital a couple of days ago because he cannot eat anything and is vomitting constantly and has diarehha to boot.  Is this the sign of the end for him?","Doctor":"Diarrhea and constipation can be a complication of chemotherapy. Drugs used for treatment of stomach cancer cause mucositis (inflamed inner lining of entire gut) with resultant diarrhea, vomiting and superimposed bacterial infections. Neutropenia (low neutrophil count; associated with chemotherapy can further worsen the infections.These conditions require aggressive treatment.

He is to start radiation.Do doctors check to see if cancer has spread to other areas before starting radiation on tonsil area?Thank you.Best regards,Concerned Daughter","Doctor":"You have mentioned that PET scan showed tumor in tonsil area only. PET scan is a metabolic scan in which radioactive flouride labelled glucose is injected into patient's body. This glucose becomes trapped in malignant (cancer) cells in body from where radioactive flouride releases signals (positron) which is picked up by camera.So your oncologists already know the site of tumor in the body via the PET scan.

I have recomended that she go see her Dr. ,  Would you have any other ideas?","Doctor":"Hi ! Did she have any food from outside which might have been infected ? In that case it could be food poisoning and could be an onset of diarrhoea. However why does she think that it is a possible kidney infection ? Did she have a past history of kidney infection, or any urinary symptoms at present ? From the history of feeling comfortable on bending knees up to her chest, any chance of inflammation of the peritoneum has to be excluded, and all these possibilities could only be confirmed or excluded only by clinical examination by a general surgeon followed possibly by various investigations, and so you should see your doctor at the earliest.

But now i am feeling that i should haven't used this and not any more , but i am not able to control this. Even i have fear of cancer ??? please give me a best way to make my self calm Dr.. ??","Doctor":"Smoke less tobacco causes cancers such as oral cancer, esophageal cancer, and pancreatic cancerThere is no safe form of tobacco. At least 28 chemicals in smokeless tobacco have been found to cause cancer. The most harmful chemicals in smokeless tobacco are tobacco-specific nitrosamines, which are formed during the growing, curing, fermenting, and aging of tobacco. The level of tobacco-specific nitrosamines varies by product. Scientists have found that the nitrosamine level is directly related to the risk of cancer.In addition to a variety of nitrosamines, other cancer-causing substances in smokeless tobacco include polonium–210 (a radioactive element found in tobacco fertilizer) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (also known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons).So i advise u to totally stop using smoke less tobacco.RegardsDR DE"},{"Patient":"My brother has been diagnosed with a GI Cancer and will begin chemo treatments next week.

From the details you have given I presume that it was Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma since you have completed R-CHOP chemotherapy. At the end of therapy PET CT Scan is repeated. Since you have mentioned that a 2cm nodule remains in the lung, PET scan will clarify whether there is metabolic activity high enough for a residual tumor in the nodule. If the PET scan is negative then the disease is in complete remission. However if the PET  scan is positive for residual disease then you need to have a re-biopsy of the nodule to see that the disease has not changed its type.

If there is no evidence of disease recurrence on examination or imaging studies then complication of radiation therapy resulting in atrophy of lining (mucosa) and telangiectasia (dilated capillaries) is a possibility.

I started them in my mid 40s and have not stopped except for a few years when I took premarin. I stopped that when medical studies warned of breast and ovary cancers. I have them maybe 5 times during the day and also at night. Any info would help.","Doctor":"Hot flashes are typically caused by hormonal imbalance. When a woman hits menopause and her body starts to make the transition, production of estrogen and progesterone is disrupted. This change causes the hypothalamus to think that the body needs cooling down so it sends signals to the rest of the body, which in turn causes a hot flash.The most effective treatment for hot flashes is estrogen. Medications such as antidepressants and anti-seizure drugs also may help reduce hot flashes. For most women, hot flashes fade gradually within a few years.RegardsDR DE"},{"Patient":"Hi.

Sorafenib blocks several kinase proteins that either prompt tumor cells to grow or help form new blood vessels (angiogenesis) to feed the tumor. By blocking these proteins, sorafenib can help stop the growth of cancer cells.Sorafenib in liver cancer showed improvement in median overall survival of 44%  Both median survival and time to progression showed 3-month improvements.

Two weeks later she was found in a pool of blood in the middle of the night, she lost over 25% of her blood and had the crash team and blood transfusions. Apparently her femural artery had burst. On the third operation to correct this they stopped the femural artery and she relies on the veins in the back of her leg. Can you please explain who this happened and what are the implication of this in her future life?","Doctor":"Hello,I really cannot say why the femoral artery had burst but in case it was cannulated, a peudoaneurysm which had burst is the most likely diagnosis. Ligation or stoppage of the femoral artery usually does not lead to problems in later life because of the excellent collateral circulation in the lower limb and the blood flow should be adequate to keep the limb viable.

It is used in the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.Raloxifene(evista) was as effective as tamoxifen in reducing the incidence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk. A major adverse effect of tamoxifen is uterine cancer;Raloxifene caused fewer cases of uterine cancer. Tamoxifen increased the risk of cataracts, but raloxifene did not. Both groups had more blood clots in veins and the lungs, but that side effect was more common with tamoxifen than raloxifene. On September 14, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced approval of raloxifene for reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and in postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer.RegardsDr De"},{"Patient":"My sister is having sever nose bleeds she had to have a vessel tied off through her groin area a few days ago went into her nose twice to pack but the bleeding started back to day she has lypmphemda can that be the problem the doc can't find the answer","Doctor":"Most commonly, trauma to the nose triggers a nose bleed. Trauma to the outside of the nose, such as a blow to the face, or trauma inside the nose, such as nose picking or repeated irritation from a cold, can cause a nose bleed.Less commonly, an underlying disease process, such as an inability of the blood to clot, may contribute to the bleeding. Inability of the blood to clot is most often due to blood-thinning drugs such as warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin. Liver disease can also interfere with blood clotting. Abnormal blood vessels or cancers in the nose are rare causes of nosebleeds. High blood pressure may contribute to bleeding but is almost never the only reason for a nose bleed."},{"Patient":"My mother was diagnosed with stage 4 GBM brain cancer.

Is it as common for guy to get breast cancer as a girl? Can physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer? Can a healthy diet help to prevent breast cancer? Does smoking cause breast cancer? Can drinking alcohol increase the risk of breast cancer?","Doctor":"HIThank for asking to HCMI appreciate your concern here are the answers of your questions 1) while comparing with the normal breast, the normal breast looks more pendulous than the malignant one, on palpation one can feel the hard lump inside the breast, untreated case more prone to fungal infection, loss of weight.2) If you find the lump look for mobility if this is freely moves then no need to worry, still mammogram, CT scan, biopsy are must.3) Wearing the bra does not cause the cancer. 4) NO if this benign lesion then this can not turns into malignancy. 5) The breast malignancy is not always inheritant. 5) Being a female you could get the breast cancer this is not true, but of course the incidence increased. 6) If you are physically active then the chances of this reduces greatly. 7) The balance and healthy diet makes the difference. 8) the chances of breast cancer in smokers is high than the non smokers, and the same is true for alcohol, hope this information helps you have nice day."},{"Patient":"hello my friend is going to start her chemo treatment thursday for breast cancer.

It is soft at the touch, the doctors could not taste any enlarged lymphonodes. He did an MRT scan and the radiologist said that it is a lipom (actually two, size of a small orange on each side, even though it looks more like two bumps), and that he does not need to take any further measuers. My question is: is an MRT examination accurate enough to exclude with 100% certainty that it is a liposarcom? Should we do further tests or remove the lipom to have a biopsy done? He did the MRT in a small radiology clinic, the doctor said right away that it is a lippom, is the diagnosis really so easy to make after an MRT scan?A part for this, he is also feeling very weak and tired since several weeks, which can not be explained by a diagnosis of lipom. His blood test did not show anything abnormal, nor did a ultrasound examination.Thank you very much and best regards,Simona","Doctor":"Hi,    As Liposarcoma is a malignant tumour of soft tissue and an experienced radiologist might suspect a diagnosis based on test result of MRI and also x-ray. But if you have any suspicion about the diagnosis then you should consult a surgeon ,who will do the physical examination of patient and plan with a radiologist and a pathologist that biopsy will be safe for your patient or not.

Soon upon onset, I noticed a skin rash that runs strictly along the inner thigh, and has now spread behind the knee to the inner ankle . The rash is not particularly itchy, but initially felt very sensitive to the touch, but sensitivity pain has now subsided. The rash appears as very defined raised red bumps with a pale skin colored perimeter and fades when pressure is applied. Recent incidents that may help a diagnosis are frequent heavy lifting 75lbs moving boxes and a hard butt bump to a tree riding a tree swing that caused immediate pain, but subsided quickly with little bruising. The onset of pain began several days later. There is none to very minimal swelling in any region compared to the left side, and no fever nor hotness noticed. The pain seems to change daily, first concentrated in the lower back, shifting to the hip, and now particularly in the upper thigh, feeling constricted. Pain is mostly noted while standing and sitting, but is never eleviated by lying down or walking. I find most relief while jogging. I have had a no-illness history, but mother with ovarian cancer and history of bloodclots...possibly resulting from the cancer and treatments. Should I seek medical attention or rather let this take its course...I feel some improvement in pain today after suffering for approximately 5 days.

Also, lately, seems like a shortness of breath with activity even some chest pain . NEVER had this before, never smoked . Numbness in shoulder blade that comes and goes (but I think that I have had that on and off for a few years, cant remeber because I m so nervous about things). Arm twinges are all over the under arm, down the arm some and on the outside of the breast, (both sides). Talked with people and they experience same arm twinges/ breast pain with peri, AAAAAAA and post. HOWEVER, this new chest tightness and breath thing have me sooo worried about lung cancer . I will see my physician but they think Im crazy because I always have something goingon but I promise I dont make the symptoms up. This time I am ultra concerned because i have never had chest painand my back is numb as we speak.","Doctor":"Dear, I would say you to relax first. Yous seems to be anxious.Chest pain and breathlessness are due to various causes, heart or lung disorders or just anxiety. Few symptoms can be due to the reason that you are nearing menopause or can be due to vitamin deficiency.Please go have a overall general health check up done, which covers the chest x ray, ultra sound, your blood tests to know the cell counts, any ongoing inflammation and you can get vitamin B12 and Vitamin D tests done.Based on all these results, your doctor will let you know, what is the actual cause of the symptoms.Lung cancer is mostly unlikely, do not worry. Please consult your Physician soon and get treated for the Anxiety too.Hope this helped.Thank you."},{"Patient":"My husband just had part of his colon removed,he was informed on that part of his colon there was a tumor that they said was pretty aggressive.

From July (7-15-11) to now (3-11-12) I have asked several doctors to both feel the knot and explained my symptoms which are: pins and needles pain, radiating pain, dull or aching pain. It never really goes away. I ve had no injuries, no disease and no other health problems. I am a 40 yr. old female. As of the last few weeks, I ve now noticed at least one more knot that is painful and feels like a bruised area if touched though there is no bruising and again, no injuries.

They tend to miss significant cancers (very rarely) owing to the location of the tissue and hence it can be presumed that they did not \\"pick up\\" the cancer earlier rather than thinking that cancer has just grown fast in 3 weeks.

No heart burn pain just feeling of tightness. I'm scared as my mom died of gallbladder cancer at 50 and she burped a lot. Is it the same thing? Is it possible that my constant exercising created the hiatal hernia? Is it that I drink coffee in the morning?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understand your concern.As you know, a hiatus hernia is a condition in which a portion of the stomach is displaced into the chest.Hiatal hernias are considered important, because of the erroneous perception that a hiatus hernia predisposes to esophageal reflux. We now know that acid reflux into the esophagus is usually due to inappropriate relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, the muscle barrier between the stomach and esophagus. The hiatus hernia is an incidental finding that is not related to the development of the clinical problem.   Individuals who exercise will often have heartburn due to acid or food refluxing into the esophagus. When you lift weights or do situps you strain and bear down increasing the pressure in the abdomen.  This increased pressure can overcome the pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter causing material to reflux into the esophagus.  Therefore, although exercise does not make a hiatus hernia worse, it can cause symptoms that are often considered by the lay public to be associated with a hiatus hernia.   The only way that you can prevent reflux is to avoid exercises that increase intraabdominal pressure, not a realistic option for most people who exercise.  The good news is that the reflux episode usually lasts a short time and there is no long term consequences of the reflux. However, if you are in the minority of patients who have severe reflux symptoms associated with exercise, you may consider taking one of the over-the-counter H2 receptor antagonists or Proton pump inhibitors like Ranitidine or Pantaprazole with Antiemetics like Domperidone.Do not get concerned about this. And it does not have any relation with gall bladder.Avoid coffee or tea as you have reflex symptoms.

Some are  Chronic peptic ulcer disease, gastric polyps and gastric cancer.It is essential to do an upper GI endoscopy to find the cause.Also do H.Pylori test.If it is a peptic ulcer disease with H.Pylori, antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors like pantoprazole are the treatment.If it is found to be a polyp or cancer, it either need removal or chemo and radiotherapy.

One point in your history is perplexing, that is how couldn't both the ultrasound and the CT scan could not differentiate between the hematometra and fibroid.

The rising tumor markers mean that the tumor was not completely removed and nothing else can be done to address this at this time.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Sorry to learn about the diagnosis of esophagus and stomach cancer in your husband. It is very difficult and may not be possible to advise treatment on such issue without seeing the patient personally, and without going through the investigation reports including that of the biopsy. However, one  can go for some proton pump inhibitor drugs, some probiotics, and some kind of antacid gel to relieve him symptomatically of his esophageal symptoms,and also get the head end of his bed elevated to aid in this. Further management has to be discussed with the treating doctor of your husband.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your husband's problem.

I do not believe in foley cathethers so they would be told from get go NO if they said they do this and also the anal barium will not be allowed either. It is an exit not an entrance. I was told I am cancer free so I don t see the reason for it plus the side effects. I have been through enough as is and will not allow any form of pain,discomfort and the embarrassment of the whole procedure. When I shad my surgery I was told if I refused the catheter they could refuse to do my surgery. I went ahead against my better judgement and I had trouble with my bladder for 3 weeks. Painful.I was told they would only leave it in for2 or 3 hours. It was left in until the next morning, I feel most catheters are left in to make the nurses job easier. This way they don t have to help you get up to go to the bathroom. Never again. I do not need to hear from you as I pay enough medical bills currently and all I wanted was an answer and I will just wait until I go to my doctors again. Should have known it would be too good to be true to get an outside opinion. We over pay as it is . Sorry I wasted my time.","Doctor":"you have not mentioned what cancer you are suffering from, but from what you have written. I presume it is uterine or cervical cancer. Internal radiation is mandatory for these conditions. therapy is incomplete without ICR, intracavitory radiotherapy. cathers are required, but these are placed temporarily only. remember life is more important than anything. Instead of having undue fear of catethers, think of other things in life and go ahead with therapy"},{"Patient":"I have lower abdominal pain on my right side.

Would my liver disease affect my choice of cancer procedures? I also am taking thyroxin for an underactive thyroid. I have been on disability since 2008.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,An invasive breast cancer is managed by surgery- mastectomy.Lumpectomy can result in recurrence of the lesion later.If the breast lump is associated with involvement of lymph nodes, chemotherapy is also needed.The presence of autoimmune hepatitis, intake of thyroxine or liver medication will not interfere with the type of surgery.Lumpectomy is not done now-a-days because of chance of recurrence.You need to consult your surgeon for further management.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"I am currently undergoing chemotherapy for stage 3C ovarian cancer. I was advised not to completely shave my head, but the short stubble I now have is irritating. I was told if I shave my head, I might get ingrown hairs and risk infection. Is this true? Also, I would like to know what I can use on my scalp to moisturize and soothe the bumpy and very irritated skin. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi my dear, I am sorry for the situation you are in. I understand your impatience of getting your hair shaved. What your doctors told you was right: shaving hair (especially during chemotherapy) increases the chances of ingrown hairs and infection. 1. You should wash your hair with warm water and hypoallergic soap.2. apply otc antibiotic cream with hydrocorticose (gentamycine + hydrocortisone). If not OTC available in your country, should consult your doctor for a prescription. 3. You might also need oral prescription antibiotics, for which you can discuss with your doctor.

I was considering a leep procedure but chose a hysterectomy because I also suffered from migraines and thought perhaps this would remedy the headaches.  I was not planning on having any more children and had my tubes tied years prior so opted for a hysterectomy.  Post-hysterectomy I was diagnosed with cervical cancer stage 1b with extensive lymphatic invasion.  I had chemotherapy, (couldn't complete because I had a severe allergic reaction) memory is blurry but I believe I had 3 treatments.  I completed the radiation treatments and had a cesium implant.  I have had faithful paps since then and all have been negative.  My concern is with the extensive lymphatic invasion and not having had  a \\"radical\\" hysterectomy..what is the risk of metasis.  I have been suffering from phantosmia (cigarette smoke odor) to the point that it gives me a headache for over two years.  I've researched this condition and understand that it can be a symptom of a brain tumor.  I also have chronic back pain.  I guess my question boils down to:  Could the cancer have spread considering the lymphatic invasion and if so...what are the most likely places for this type of cancer to metastasize to, bone?, brain?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanx for the query .In Stage IB chances of extensive lymph node(i.e.  outside pelvis) is 6-8%.IN early stage like IB after treatment chance of metastasis is very rare.It is more common with advanced disease like disease with extensive Lymphatic spread.Most common site of metastasis in those cases  is lung( nearly 20% chance) ."},{"Patient":"I was reading Dr Js posting and I wish to God I could find a doctor like him.

My WBC have been between 18,000 & 22,000. On June 2012, it was 21,000. I had a bad upper respiratory infection in Oct 2012. My PCP put me on antibiotics. He also recommended that I have a full blood test. My results showed that my WBC spiked from 21,000 to 30,000. He ordered another test and was tested 6 days later and my WBC went to 35,0000. He recommended that I see a Hematologist and referred me to the Norris Cotton Cancer Center in Manchester, NH. This hematologist is one of the best in NH and he has also done a lot of research on his own. The hematologist ordered a complete blood test of my blood. My WBC spiked to 51,000 from Dec. 18 to Jan 2nd. . The hematologist concluded that my globulin level was low and that was why my WBC spiked and are keeping rising.

I would like to know if I have to change my lifestyle during the treatment, is it going to affect my work, and or sports?

Also, once I conclude this treatment, are my WBC go back to normal? Please advise. Thanks.","Doctor":"Dear  ,Thank you for genuine query. Normally CLL does not require any treatment until it is symptomatic. Blood counts do go up when  there is reduction in the body immunity which is a common problem in CLL.  In the infective stage it is not the lymphocytes but granulocytes which increase in number to be verified by DLC. Immunoglobulins will definitely increase your immunity to infections and WBC count may fall if it is infective nature but if your counts still go up you need to undergo proper management.Dr. J.

It is true that sugar/glucose is the main source of fuel for cells, malignant or benign. Unfortunately, in the case of malignancies, the cells' growth is more influenced by other factors (mutations in growth genes, response to chemical signals). In your sister's case, she would very likely benefit the most from a consultation with a medical professional (nutritionist or physician) who can assess & balance her needs for carbohydrates for normal physiologic functioning."},{"Patient":"I am in terrible pain after having a colonoscopy and banding of three haemorrhoids done 14 hours ago as day surgery at a hospital.

After New Year I had neck pain on th right side of my neck and found a lump at the same time . Over the weeks since I first noticed it, the lump will grow and diminished in size.

Is he completely sterile? please give possible treatments please","Doctor":"HiThanks for your query.There are two parts to your query.1. to prevent testicular cancer, we can try to get the affected testis out of the body by surgery (NOT fixing it, which failed earlier).2. Whether he is sterile now, that can be determined by semen analysis. If he has normal sperm counts then nothing needs to be done. But sometimes in these situations, even with one normal testis, sperm counts are low. Then you should consult infertility expert.Hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"About four finger lengths down from my belly button, on the right hand side, I'm experiencing severe tenderness (on a scale of one to ten, I would say the pain is a seven).

A very common process in the breast that can cause pain & seems to be affected by menstrual cycle/hormonal fluctuations is a benign entity called fibrocystic change.

The cause of low platelets can be many & cancer especially can confound other organ systems & cells in the body.  It would be very reasonable to have a complete blood count performed on your mother's blood & a physical examination to try to determine the cause of the bruising."},{"Patient":"Hi i have had reoccuring abdominal pain for the past 2 years almost.I had my appendix removed in 2011 and also cysts removed in 2011.My appendix contained carcinogens and I was hospitalized for a long period of time in which i was told there was no more cancer left.The pain did not go away no matter how many pain killers i took.Last summer my bowel bled badly and i was hospitalized for 6 weeks.The consultant could not find a reason for my pain again and i was sent home on more medication.I have had many tests done and the pain never seems to end.It is mainly in my lower right side but it spreads around my entire abdomen and into my back and down to my pelvis.I dont know what to do anymore.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query to H.C.M.

The adjacent structures could be the from the urinary tract like kidneys above, ureters on both sides and bladder below and behind.Following reasons could cause your sharp pains:1. Due to fetal growth at times the position of uterus can cause momentary external pressure to the passage of urine. You might be feeling this as sharp shooting pain.2. It may also happen that you might have used public washroom and got infected in the process.3. Another possibility is that you are drinking less amount of water these days.I suggest you consult your doctor and get routine urine and microscopy examination. When you go for fetal ultrasound, you may request your radiologist to see your kidney and bladder for your present problems.Lastly, avoid using public washrooms and drink lots of water and do not hold your urine.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"cist in the breast that are painful can be cancer?

Our body knows how to throw out the things which it do not need. Digestive system is very powerful. Things goes into the stomach when we eat. Immediately on finding something strange in the food, stomach reacts and throws it through vomiting. Second option is diarrhea. Colic etc. Third, our liver disintegrates any toxins and removes them through sweat and urine. Means we have our own defence. Melted plastic, should come out through your digestive waste.Cancer means malignant tissues. That hppens when there is some sort of malignant tissues inside like gangrene or so.

I faithfully do yrly exams. !st cancer was treated w/ tomoxifen, 2nd. one is treated w/ letrozole. 1st BC at 50 and most recent one 2012. Both my cancers are est. & prog positive. Should I have a hysterectomy now as a preventive??","Doctor":"the tamoxifen has documented side effect of causing uterine cancer in later time.So usually i follow UltraSound test to know the uterine wall thickness. If it is increasing in size then i suggest to undergo for  hysterectomy. The hysterectomy also comes with some unwanted effects. So usually it is not advisable to go  Prophylactic Hysterectomy.But as you mentioned the incidences of cancer in your family, you may go for  hysterectomy if you  are fit for surgery."},{"Patient":"Yes my name is vnmbmrk and I have been having this burning pain in my vagina l, also a while back when I was pregnant my doctor told me I had cervical cancer/genital warts and I still have not been treated for it what shall I do?

It is important to determine is it just warts or cancer. cancer is very serious diagnosis which should be treated promtly and further investiagtions should be done. both these diagnoises can cause vaginal burning. so go back to your gynaecolgoist and do tests to rule out cancer. everything else can be treated.

They are going to do a biopsy on the cluster. She also has a tendency to get kidney stones. I'm worried about the cluster. Can you give me a better explanation of what a cluster is","Doctor":"Hi, I have read your query and according to my opinion these cluster are enlargement of lymphnode ,that's occurs due to any type of infection in there draining area.That infection may be bacterial or malignant.Thanks for using HCM."},{"Patient":"I recently had an EUS and an MRI done as a preventative measure because both my father and my brother have pancreatic cancer.  My EUS results came back \\"clean\\".  My MRI results indicate that id have mild atrophy of the downstream pancreatic body with otherwise unremarkable pancreas and pancreatic duct.  I am not overweight and I only have a few drinks per week on average.  For the past few years my fasting glucose levels have been a little high (110-112) and my A1C at 5.8.  What does all of this mean when taken into consideration altogether?  Do my MRI results increase my chances of developing pancreatic cancer?  Or are results such as that common?","Doctor":"Hi. I do understand your concerns. Yes, the Pancreatic cancer may run in families. Now you see you have a near normal report. So enjoy the day. It is always better to take NO alcohol. Sugar is fine. Just continue to screen yourself regularly as per your Doctor's advise. If at all there is a chance of development of cancer, you will be detected far early to make it a curable disease in your case. Kudos to your awareness."},{"Patient":"My husband was diagnosed 3.5 years ago with prostate cancer, stage 3, Gleason rating 9, no real elevation in PSA. He was put on hormones to shrink the tumors for surgery.  He had his prostate removed and found out he had it in 9 lymphnodes after surgery.  Went through chemo, radiation and seemed to be doing good.  A year later he found out it had metasticized to his bones and was hormone resistant with lupron.  He was put on casodex and he did well for about seven months.  He then got a hot spot in the jaw and required more radiation.  His PSA started showing a rise, so the doctor monitored him over the months to become a candidate for provenge.  He was treated with provenge in spring 2013.  About February we noticed alcohol made his legs restless and he had a cough.  Cough, lungs checked on four separate occasions, X-ray, no concerns.  In May, he started having trouble breathing.  All during this time, he went to work and would come home and lay down.  He started to throw up almost daily after eating.  In May, he was put on Zytiga, which can effect the liver.  My husband was on this for just over a month because he started to retain water in his legs and had a bloated abdomen.  He started to lose all of his muscle as well and continued with his breathing issues.  We were in the doctors office week after week and I pushed his doctor to do scans for his lungs.  Cancer metasticized to his lungs.  Heart was doing ok, he was filling with more fluid but the doctor would not drain because it would come back unless cancer w as treated.  I made the doctor put him on the table and feel his abdomen, he said he believed the cancer was in his liver.  Ascites is common with liver metastic.    More scans and confirmed in the liver.  Doctor did not tell us the extent of the damage.  Doctor suggested jevtana chemo, he went on Thursday and died on Saturday.  He went from being able to swim with our children July 4 to dying on August 18. I struggle with the lack of information that was provided, I took care of him and my two young children 9 & 12.  My husband was 46.  He was given jevtana when his platelet count was down, on Saturday he struggled with weakness, his heartrate was low, he could not eat, drink, and was constipated.  He had bloody noses, etc....  I called 911, fire dept, paramedics came and all were surprised at his condition.  I followed ambulance to the hospital, they could not get in an IV.  Ended up having to go through carotid artery.  Bloodwork was from blood taken in his groin.  My husband was throwing up blood and the doctor said it was old blood.  He went into a coma like state with me holding his hand, i could not get him to respond.  Apparently, at this time his heart stopped and they had to work him.  He never regained consciousness nor could they get his heart going.  The doctor said there was an extraordinary amount of blood.  His cancer doctor would not meet with me.  All I wanted was to know how bad he really was and get some explanation of what I saw and experienced that day.  I was refused by his office manager.  I reached out to my primary care who got this medical records for some answers.  HIPAA was on file so he could talk to me.  I found out his liver was so damaged, cancerous tumors too numerous to count.  One tumor was three inches.  Cancer throughout the bones, lymphnodes, partial hernia, right lung, enlarged spleen, he was full of it.I honestly feel that me and my family were robbed of a goodbye.  I knew he would die from cancer but was not given enough information to be given options with hospice.  My husband never knew he was in his final descent.  His last words to my son were I will be fine.  After researching myself, my husband showed all of the symptoms of full blown liver failure which may have been speeded up by the zytiga and in the end he was not in good enough shape to do jevtana.  Why was he given these treatments without all of the facts?  I am an intelligent woman and have nightmares about the lack of knowledge we had, how little I knew about what was going on because I am not medically trained.  I remember that night vividly and the suffering he went through, I saw and did things that most people may never experience.  I hope some day i can find some way to live with these memories.  Questions:  Why so much blood and what caused this?  Why would a doctor put a patient on zytiga without properly looking to see if there was already liver damage?  Why would a doctor not do scans or appear to not notice his breathing issues?  Why did I have to force this, I literally broke down in his office because I told him I was afraid he would not wake up.  Why keep the real truth from us?  Why will he not talk to me?  I get our society is sue happy but I was only looking to hear the truth, get answers for what I saw to help the healing process my husbands entire family.  Why continue with treatment if he will die soon anyway?","Doctor":"Hi. To begin with, the treatment that your husband has undergone seems to be correct medically, more or less. To begin with he was suffering from locally advanced prostate cancer which was downstaged and then surgically removed. However he had a relapse of his disease in the bones and was placed on hormonal treatment. He seemed to be suffering from hormone resistant prostate cancer which can occur in 10% patients to start with. Thus he failed to respond to most of the treatments and eventually died of his disease. At every stage of progression, doing a scan is not mandatory. Just a rising PSA and symptoms are enough to know that the disease is progressing. Doing a scan only documents that the disease has spread to a particular part. It will neither change the treatment nor the outcome. The blood was basically because of 2 reasons. One the disease in the lung which can commonly lead to bleeding on its own of varying quantity. Added to that was the fact that he was in liver failure which further increases the chances of bleeding from any site. Zytiga has a large number of side effects and one has to weigh the risks against the benefits and take a call. I assume and you should too that the call to give zytiga despite liver failure by your doctor was in good faith and based on sound judgement. I think the only part where your doctor failed you entirely was by not keeping you informed at every step the prognosis, the treatment options, the disease status and the likely outcome. It is something that I would have done and is nothing but unfortunate. While it would not have changed the outcome of your husband, it might have left you in peace after his demise. Hope my answer takes care of your unrest in some measure and you find strength enough to move on in life. Take care"},{"Patient":"i have the symptoms of ovarian cancer i had a ca125 test done and it came out a little elevated at 43, my pap, uterus, and ovaries look normal on a sonogram but i do have a fibroid tumor i'm waiting for results of a ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast can i still have ovarian cancer what really concerns me is that my abdomen swells up alot i've even had people ask me if im pregnant that doesnt bother me what bothers me is that i don't know whats going on","Doctor":"Thanks for query.CA125 is not specific for epithelial ovarian cancer and is elevated in other benign and malignant conditions, including menstruation; endometriosis; pelvic inflammation; liver, renal, and lung disease.It is also elevated in 6% of women who do not have epithelial ovarian cancer.so there is no reason to worry based on ca125 levels. the thing you should be  concerned more is ascitis(fluid in abdomen).we may get a hint of diagnosis after CT report.but final diagnosis in such scenario is generally made by staging laprotomy.discuss with you gynaecologists.regards"},{"Patient":"I am worried about a pancoast tumor. I have pain in the shoulder blade and tingling in my pinky and ring finger that are worse with use. Some shortness of breathe when tying shoes. I have a heart cath in july after er visit in May due to an irregular ekg. I went to a cardiologist and had a second ekg which mirrored the first but he did a heart cath to be safe.  The ER visit was due to chest pain and tingling to both arms and shortness of breath likely from the anxiety it caused. Now it is only the right side.  It went away a few weeks after the heart cathand came back quite painful. It was hard to concentrate and work. My doctor ruled out cancer based on the fact that the ER did a cheat xray andwould have noticed in may. It felt better a few weeks again and is now back the worst yet. Not sure what to do next. Would love to know what to discuss with him when I go in. The thing that seemed to most mirror my symptoms online was a pancoast tumor which scares the crap out of me.

In the dental office I was treated with antibiotics under my gums (2 spots) and also my doctor used some sweet and bitter yellow liquid which supposed to help slowing down bacteria grouth in my mouth. In one hour after that I started vomiting and very strong pain above my naval area. I ate nothing before that. I ended up in the emergency room of the local hospital where they did blood work, urine test and abdominal cat scan . They decided that I have urine infection because they found nothing besides blood in my urine (but I just started my period being in the emergency room). I do not have urine infection symptoms for sure. Or at least my pain has nothing to do with urine infection symptoms. I called to the dentist office and the doctor/technician who performed my teeth cleaning said that it s impossible to be poisoned with medications she used. Why would I have such bad pain after my dental appointment? And another question why should I pay for my emergency room visit if they were useless at all? They could not even eliminate my stomach ache just made it not so strong for a while.","Doctor":"hellofirst of all i feel real sad for what happened with younow talking about what happenealthough stomach pain is most difficult to treat as there are many organs in the space and you cant be sure before a long list of examinations are donebut as u say it all started soon after the dental painso what i assume is that the antibiotics used in the dental treatment must be the culprityes there are antibiotics used in dental offices that may lead to gastric upset...and severe pain in some rare casesso what would advise is that the next time you visit your dentist ,do tell him the history of your pain and if you have got the prescription and treatment chart than you must also reproduce that before starting up your treatmentthis will help your dentist from taking necessary pecautions and save you from any other future discomfortsbest of luck"},{"Patient":"what does it mean to have squamous cell carcinoma of linqual tonsil.  his tonsils were removed in his teens.My husband had a needle biopsy of a lump on the side of his throat and it was in the lymph node.  then a biopsy of the base of the tongue.  the dianosis was as above.  what can I expect we have sessions with cancer doctor on 13th Jan.

Had an ultrasound....showed kidney stones (9mm) in one kidney and that the bladder was grossly unremarkable.  2 days later blood seen in urine again for a short period (2 hours)...now I am scheduled for an cystoscopy and wonder what my odds of bladder cancer are?","Doctor":"Hi, thank you for asking Healthcare Magic.I have gone through your query and understood your concerns.Blood in urine can be from anywhere along the urinary tract.Blood at the beginning of urination is most likely to be from urethra, blood towards the end of urination is likely to be from bladder while blood in urine from the beginning to the end is either from the kidney or a severely bleeding lesion in the bladder. This can give you an idea concerning the origin of blood in your urine. With the history of a kidney stone, I think it is most probable that the source of blood would be kidney and not bladder. Even within the bladder, there are other possible causes of blood in urine apart from cancer.I hope that answers your query.

Other less common mechanisms responsible for adenopathy include nodal accumulation of inflammatory cells in response to an infection in the node (lymphadenitis), neoplastic lymphocytes or macrophages (lymphoma), or metabolite-laden macrophages in storage diseases (Gaucher disease).In young children,front of neck  lymph nodes as large as 2 cm, armpit nodes as large as 1 cm, and groin nodes as large as 1.5 cm in diameter are normal, and further evaluation is usually not indicated.  malignancy is usually associated with nodes larger than 3 cm in diameter.However, the presence of even shotty (< 0.5 cm) supraclavicular or epitrochlear nodes may be associated with malignancy and warrants further evaluation.as your child blood counts are normal I hope its not a serious issue.biopsy of the node will make things more clear.regards"},{"Patient":"I have had a more or less constant pain in the left side of my neck from my lower head to my shoulder for months.

But i suggest you to go to Gynecologist who will take care of you by doing examination and few tests."},{"Patient":"I am undergoing treatment for Non- hodgkins lymphoma and have undergone chemotherapy treatments which ended last month.This morning I have developed symptoms of burning sensation in the urinary passage with occasional discharge of blood clots (I have already had similar problem earlier 3 times). I am at least 8 hours away from the hospital. So, I want to have advice from the doctor regarding the preliminary treatment which I can undertake.I have got the reports of routine urine examination from 2 different pathology labs: The reports are as the following: Lab-1 Lab-2 Albumin: NIL NIL Sugar : NIL NIL Bile salt & Pigment Negative Negative Deposits: Pus Cells 0-1 / HPF 4-5 / HPF Epithelial Cells 0-1 / HPF 5-6 / HPF Cast & Crystals NIL NIL Note: The Blood report (TC-DC report) is enclosed. The burning sensation in urinary passage has subsided a little, but still occurs occasionally after urination. Moreover, there is no further blood discharge. I was not able to meet urologist yesterday because of Good Friday holiday. So, please suggest if any preliminary medication is needed now or can I see you directly on Monday.","Doctor":"seeing your oncologist is better than seeing urologist at present.

The positive point is the biopsy is not showing any cancer condition means he does not need any cancer treatment at present.the treatment you have mentioned , usually prescribed by hematologist/ medical oncologist.

I have had chronic pain , very sharp at times bilaterally, where my ovaries used to be. I often feel bloated, and have started to feel lightheaded and nauseous lately. I told my surgical oncologist when I saw him in December; however, he did not seem concerned. I am very concerned. This pain and nausea is not going away.","Doctor":"The medical treatment will come in bundle/package, not in singles. It means most of  post surgical problems , which you mentioned ,will be relieved by simple medications.  But remember one point: severe pain in the abdomen, severe vomiting ,  constipation and not able to  pass even gas, abdominal distension  - these symptoms show Intestinal Obstruction - can be relieved by medication and simple surgical procedure, if neglected,   otherwise can  lead to threatening problem.At any time if you face all these problems together, my sincere advise is,  to consult the doctor immediately."},{"Patient":"My left arm, outside of left leg, and top left of my left foot feel slightly numb. I saw my doctor on Friday, unfortunately I didn t start having this loss of sensation until yesterday morning. My history, during chemo for breast cancer 2.5 years ago I developed a blood clot due to my port on my left side. No major damage and I have since had the clot sight (left side clavicle area) imaged at least twice and it appears there is very little damage to the vein with the exception of normal disrupted blood flow because of having a clot (not sure I worded that correctly). I m also a type 1 diabetic, very controlled, and have had no issues at all with the diabetes and I m 51-years old. I see several doctors (4 exactly) at least every three months, do you think this is something I should consult with my oncologist or internal medicine doctor?

Everything seemed fine but I have had persistent bright red blood loss about 5 times since then. I went to my Dr & he sent me for an ultra sound & has referred me to a specialist gynecologist . I have had the ultra sound & the report said: Regular endometrial complex measuring 5mm. No sonographic evidence for retained products of conception However, it does also say Right ovary volume 4cc with normal sonographic appearance. Left ovary is enlarged to a volume of 47cc by a 47x38x44mm simple appearing follicle/cyst. There is also a 29mm haemorrhagic follicle. No pelvic free fluid Is the size of the left ovary within normal limits???? Am I correct in thinking that the left ovary is 12 times the volume of the right? Can cysts cause my ovary to enlarge this much? I know these are all questions for the gynecologist which I am seeing in 10 days time but I am worried it might not be as simple as cysts? I am 35 & I have a history of bowel cancer in the family. In fact my nan died last year of bowel cancer that had spread to her uterus, bladder & ovaries. Thanks.","Doctor":"during reproduction life, cysts will come and disapear due to hormones. i think in this situation, you should not worry. But cancer in the family may caution you to be careful but not to worry. Your Gynacologist may repeat Ultra sound againand she will do some other tests, if suspicious about ovarian cysts such as tumour marks and ct scan etc. At present you should not worry, but don't forget or neglect the appointment by your Gynacologist."},{"Patient":"My cousin is having brain tumor ..she had gamma knife treatment..she used to have severe headaches(like brain is pumping)now she is having breathing problem..and at a stage she stopped breathing then we pressured her chest then she was breathing again...when we took her to doctor they said that that due to brain pumping the pumping is going to diaphragm and there by she is having breathing problem..","Doctor":"the breathing is controlled by the brain. sometimes due to increase of the pressure in the brain can cause breathing problems, sometimes it will be dangerous also. the other reason to exclude is tumor spread to the lungs.the treatment will be directed towards the cause.Raised pressure in the brain is due to swelling of the brain, by accumulation of the liquid(edema) ,it can be treated by drugs but if it is due to tumour enlargement, there is no treatment, as he has already received radiation."},{"Patient":"I recently had a mammogram following a few months of pain, discomfort in one breast.

Any idea what that could be? im not to sure if i have a lymph node right there that could be that wide ?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning and wish you a New Year 2014. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.In your history, you have not mentioned about the reasons and investigations basing on which your doctor diagnosed you as having a lymph cancer. In case it is a confirmed diagnosis, then the swelling what you have got might be an extension of such problem. Lymph nodes are everywhere in the body, and they can be enlarged due to very many reasons, and cancer is one of those reasons. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the swelling, and depending on the result might advise you for a MRI scan, or chemotherapy or radiotherapy as the  case may be. It is not possible to pin point the exact diagnosis without a clinical examination and related investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

I do not have any pain with this just wondering if it is something I should be concerned about. Every time I eat the slightest little thing, my stomach will bloat really big and get really tight, and it is very uncomfortable. Would appreciate any feedback. Thank you in advance !!","Doctor":"Hello Good Evening,You are suffered from bloating, which may cause constipation due to decreased bowel movements and constipation may also caused bloating.Frequent heartburn and gastritis and duodenal ulcers can occurred because of indigestion and bloating.There are many causes of bloating, including: diet, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, re flux, and constipation and some more.Gas and bloating is a sign that food is not being digested correctly by the body. An inadequate intake of water will cause excessive stomach bloating.Water benefits the body by aiding with digestion because it supports a majority of the body's daily functions. Fatty foods cause a formation of fat cells to develop throughout the body and contribute to bloating as well. A build up of fat cells slows down the body's ability to empty the stomach.Dairy products also contribute to excessive cramps, gas, and bloating.Persons who are intolerant to lactose products experience this effect more than others.Following steps should follows to lessen the bloating:-Walk after eating a meal.-Exercise-Avoid coffee and chocolates.-Avoid Meals that are high in fat.-Avoid extremely hot or cold food.-Avoid bubble gum or bubbly beverages. If needed then medication should be included antacids, PPI, domperidone, Levosulpiride (prokinetic), digestive enzymes and some laxatives.Regards,Dr. Naresh Jain."},{"Patient":"I have a dry weird patch on the very back of my tongue with small bumps starting to go down my tongue into my throat.
