Adhesive tape test can be done to confirm the diagnosis. Mebendazole is the drug of choice in adults. It is given as a single oral dose, and is best repeated after 2 to 3 weeks in case re-infection has occurred. Other possible drugs include albendazole and pyrantel pamoate. Consult a gastroenterologist for the opinion and needful since the infection has reoccurred.Thank you."},{"Patient":"My brother was fine until he laid down in his bed for the night and when he did he got very dizzy and starting sweating....I took his blood pressure and it is 120 over 73 and heart rate is 67...what could be causing this he is 68 and borderline diabetic ...takes no medicine for it but does use cimzia once a month....","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

I can tell if he has been in a room because it lingers so long. our bedroom is 28 feet long and the WHOLE room smells like his nose odor. It smells like spoiled parmesan cheese, and its a very sharp smell. He cannot smell it himself. I have known him for three years and it has been on and off. he had surgery in December 2013 to fix a deviated septum. I thought that might cure the horrible smell. But no it was back a few months after the surgery stronger then ever. He said that he still has a stuffy nose most of the time and using nasal spray like patanse and Flonase don t help they make the smell worse actually. His ENT did a ct of his head and if there was any polups making his nose stink would they have found them? I am so sure that it has something to do with his sinuses. Also he went urgent care last week because of a pain in his back that was on his lower left side and went around to his lower left abdomen. So the doc took a ct with contrast to look for a kidney stone and didn t fine one. HE DID find that his lungs look congested. They ended up saying there not sure maybe a prostatitis and gave him a months worth of cipro 500. And that antibiotic is not helping the smell either because it as worst as ever. Could he have a fungul infection in his lungs cause nasal odor? Im at a loss and I don t even want to be in the same room as him because it smells so bad. please help!","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCMI have gone through your query.Usually anaerobic infections gives such smell.In such case a nasal secretion culture and swab from sinus should be done.Antibiotics like Co-amoxiclav usually covers the anaerobic bacteria also.In such case i advise it for 7 days therapy.Paranasal sinus X ray should be taken and puncture and drainage should be done if no improvement with antibiotics.Hope this may help you.Let me know if you have any further query."},{"Patient":"Hello, I had a hysterectomy in Sept 2013, shortly after the surgery an abcess developed above the stitching which had to be drained.

I got my belly button peirced over two months ago and I have no problems with it. Today, I noticed when I stretched it seemed like my belly button ring was hitting something that hurt. I didn t think much of it at the time. When I got home, my cat stepped on it and it hurt extremely bad. I lifted my shirt up to look at it and saw a lot of white pus around the bottom of the ring. I then went to the bathroom to clean it off and noticed a bump. I pushed on the bump and a mixture of reddish-whitish pus oozed out. I was wondering if you could tell me whether it s an infection or an abcess.","Doctor":"Boils and Abscesses are both formed when bacteria invade tissue and are being contained by white blood cells. Boils are less severe, whereas abscesses can occur within skin tissue and have the potential of rupturing, then spreading the infection further into the body. Catching boils, abscesses and infections early is the easiest way of dealing with them effectively. So I would like to suggest you to see a doctor as soon as possible and get it drained. Abscesses are often the result of a new piercing that could not drain fluid properly (where the entry and exit points have been left crusted by blood or, more commonly, puss) and can appear as reddish-pink bumps in between the ends of the piercing. The piercing itself may feel hot, sore, swollen and appear redder in colour. More severe abscesses may also cause nausea and fever.More typically, a prescribed course of antibiotics can deal with the infection. But sometimes lancing the abscess with a needle will allow the fluid to drain, and give the body less infectious material to deal with.  Always keep your piercing clean and dry, and especially while it is experiencing complications."},{"Patient":"i have a friend thats 36weeks pregnant and she found out today that she has Group B streptococcus she has already lost her mucus cord,the baby is already down and she 50%thin doctor did not give much info about it..should she be worried or is there something she should do now???The doctor just sent her home instead of sending her to the hospitial to get her on ivs and get the baby out","Doctor":"Hello, your GBS bacteria are found in pregnant woman's vagina or rectum. It can be found in 25% of all healthy adult woman also. Normally a pregnant female is tested between 36-38 weeks for GBS infection. If she is positive for GBS, that means she is colonized and she has a risk of transmitting this infection to her baby. However only 1 in 200 babies born to GBS positive mother becomes ill. Normally treatment for this is IV antibiotics(Penicillin) given to mothers during delivery. Antibiotics given before labour is not useful to prevent the transmission as this abcteria stays int he gut and they can come back after antibiotics. This is the reason why her physician sent her home without medicatin, as he will start her on IVantibiotics as soon as she gets in labor. However when she gets into the labor, she may remind the physician or the nurse regarding her GBS status."},{"Patient":"I need to know what could be wrong with my friend when he falls asleep his heart rate slows down and then stop saying and will start up again and he s afraid of going to sleep what could be the problem?He s 22 and in perfect health condition.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

I am also having a vaginal discharge with them (greenish yellow, no odor). I am in significant pain from them.

Even though they are usually benign your doctor will send them for a test to make sure once they are removed. This is called a pathology test and makes sure there are no cancerous cells present. We do not know what causes them to appear but I do not think they would be related to your connective tissue disorder.

All the species of Staphylococcus causes the same pathogenicity, so differentiating in species wont cause treatment simple.I advice you should do Antimicrobial sensitivity of the organisms and take the treatment accordingly. Take the complete schedule of the drugs to prevent cross infections.Glad to answer your further concern. We wish you a best health at healthcare magic.

Once they were fully healed I decided to change the earrings I had in. Mind you I have pretty sensitive ears.

I did this about a month ago and just realized now next to my earring hole there is a small bump. It looks kind of blackish (I m thinking because the earrings I had in were pretty cheap and managed to stain my ears). This morning the bump had pus in it that I got out. I have cleaned the ear hole and bump and applied Neosporin. What is this bump? I really hope it s not a keloid. I hear that keloids don t puss though. Anyways what is this bump?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for contacting HCM,Bump is nothing but any swelling on the skin and it may be pus filled or not, it may be red, pink or white, it may be painfull or not, it may be localized or general in to the skin. There are many different causes of bumps. Bump is the general laymen term for skin eruption. So in your case u developed pus filled bump so it is infected and so u have to take antibiotic oral for 3 to 5 days and if it is painful then take any painkiller. Continue neosporin ointment.

The fact that Diflucan worked, even if just partially, confirms that. Sometimes using just one dose of Diflucan is not enough for yeast infections of the skin. If I was your caring doctor, I would recommend using for some days a topical cream like Fluconazole cream, ketoconazole 2% or miconazole 1%. The topical antifungal will avoid systemic side effects and clear the area that has still the fungus.Hope this helps,Take care.Dr. Papaqako"},{"Patient":"I have had a callus like spot on ball of my foot in middle for years, have done the trimming of it tried pads to keep pressure off it while walking ....basically ive tried it all, not it is really big and thick and it causes me some really bad pain. what should I do? could it be a bone spur in that area of my foot?","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for consulting HCM. It could be a callus but it sounds like you may have a plantar wart. Warts are different from calluses in that they often have a small dot in the middle of them and calluses do not. They are common on the bottom of the foot and can get very thick and painful. If you think it may be a wart, there are two types of over the counter medications you can try.

A doctor is a professional who does not judge you and you do not have to be ashamed to see him/her. A single dose of 400mg of ofloxacin used to be considered sufficient for gonorrhea. In 2007, the CDC changed their gonorrhea treatment guidelines to remove single-dose fluoroquinolones from the recommended list. Fluoroquinolone-resistant strains have been identified around the world, including in many areas of the U.S. The prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant gonorrhea in California went from less than one percent of infections in 1999 to over 20 percent in 2003. It would be much more now. I do not use quinolones in gonorrhea management. The most effective medicine I have found in my practice is a single injection of Ceftriaxone.

If there is infectious mononucleosis, caused by a viral infection, penicillin group of medicines can make it worse.If the cough is really bad and if there is yellow and rusty sputum or fever, it is good to have a chest Xray to see if there is a pneumonitis.If it is a viral or allergic cough only symptomatic treatment with plenty of warm fluids, an expectorant and ketotifen would be helpful.If it is the cough due to asthma, one would require bronchodilators.So the management has to be individualised depending on the cause.There is no shoe that fits all.Take careDr Noble Zachariah"},{"Patient":"hi doctor, am dilip kumar.,, my sister in la affected for Recurrent demylienation ... she getting pain day by day increasing, while taking steroid she better few month after again getting pain .. this happening from 2 years.. so please help me what we do cure this disease ...","Doctor":"HIThanks for posting your query to Healthcaremagic.

If they can what are the things to consider in taking care of people with these conditions so they won't be able to contaminate other people? Is isolation required even if they are not currently infected?","Doctor":"VRE stands for Vancomycin resistant E.coli and MRSA stands for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Both of Staphylococcus aureus and E.coli are normal inhabitants of our body and ALL of us are always carrying these bacteria. If tested in persons who do not have the disease, many of us will test positive for such bacteria. But still there is not much to worry about. In specific situations, when these enter our blood stream, they become pathological. There are all sorts of antibiotic sensitivity and resistance traits in a bacteriological pool. Out of that, on occasion, one strain gets identified. Once treated properly, the person would be cured of the infection and there is no need to think that he is a carrier.If a person has already been treated for the infection, there should be no issues with living in a multi bedded boaring facility and I do not think that the state licensing board will have any issues with the same.The simple precaution to maintain is proper health and hygeine issues that you have to maintain anyway.

From the symptoms you have described it seems to be some kind of neuropathy that is damage to peripheral nerves. There are various causes for this and can be as simple as some vitamin deficiency. To treat this condition you need to be thoroughly evaluated that includes a physical exam and some blood tests and maybe some X-ray. Do visit a physician who can conduct an examination and suggest blood tests like, CBC, Vitamin B12 levels, Urine routine, Vitamin D levels, Serum Calcium, Kidney functions, Liver function, Thyroid functions as a baseline to find the cause of any nerve damage.Most commonly Vitamin B deficiency can lead to these symptoms, especially if you are a vegetarian as B12 is present only in animal sources.

What can I use and What should I do","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM,The ring worm is caused by a fungus. They thrive on moist surfaces due to sweat formation, they infect that area and the infection spreads if not treated. Wearing wet clothes and not wiping that region completely dry creates a favorable condition for the fungus to multiply. Ringworm infection needs to be treated with antifungals.You can apply clotrimazole cream or terbinafine cream. Either of these has to be applied twice a day. They have to be used for two to four weeks depending upon the area infected.I would advise you not to use clotrimazole combination with steroid cream since it basically masks the infection. You should use a plain clotrimazole cream.If the infection is not controlled by application of cream for a month then oral antifungal might be needed.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hello, I recently had a yeast infection and now a bacterial infection( I think).

She requires certain blood tests like Complete Hemogram, IgM Typhi dot, Smear for Malaria, SGPT,SGOT, Urine routine and Throat swab culture sensitivity. With the results of these tests we  will get an idea of what is causing  fever.   Till then continue giving him Ibuprofen . Ask him to do salt water gargling . Avoid oily food , non veg food and citrus fruits.   Kindly get these tests and revert back with reports."},{"Patient":"Hi. My son has never really been sick other than a mild case of the sniffles.

It seems from the history that you are having running nose, sneezing, fever...These symptoms indicate upper respiratory tract infection in the form of sinusitis.This requires treatment by the use of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs and decongestants.

The pain in your left arm could be related to possible local inflammation or a pinched nerve. Anyway, an exercise cardiac stress test would help investigate for coronary artery disease.

Despite being careful, I contracted (what I am assuming) is hsv-1 about 6 weeks ago from one of my students. He has constant outbreaks on his lips, nose, and chin. At all times he has at least 6-8 cold sores. My initial outbreak was about 25 on my lips, one on my tongue, 2 near my lips, and many in my mouth.  I also felt sick and had a sore throat for the first few days. For about 5 weeks, I continued to get new blisters. This past week, I have only gotten a few (so I'm assuming my primary infections is finally over now,) and they are in the same spot as some of my previous blisters. Oh, and the one on my tongue came back in the same spot. Two days after this first began, I went to the doctor. I tested negative for hsv-1 and hsv-2 and my culture was also negative.  I definitely believe this (culture) was a false negative because of my symptoms. The doctor did tell me he got a great sample of a fluid filled blister in the best stage for getting a good culture, but for whatever reason, it was negative. I saw my doctor again around week 3, and he commented that although there were so many blisters, they were small. He wants to do another blood test in a couple months to confirm HSV-1. But I'm confused, is there any way this is NOT HSV-1? Also, I have always had a great immune system, getting sick less often and with less severity than any teacher I know. So how can this virus affect me so? I'm so surprised that I've had a hard time with this. The things I have been doing so far include: I took three rounds of Valtrex in the beginning. I take a lysine tablet and vitamin every morning. I eat cheese every morning for breakfast, and I've been avoiding chocolate and nuts. I don't get enough sleep, but I can't change that. My main questions are: 1) Is this definitely HSV-1? 2) Is it possible that I got a \\"bad\\" version of it?  3) Do you have any suggestions?","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCMFrom your history I conclude that you probably do not have HSV and neither does the student. Form you description it sounds more like impetigo. Impetigo is a skin infection that affects the mouth and nose. starts with honey colored blisters and spreads. Since your blood tests are negative for HSV I truly think that you have impetigo. To treat the impetigo the student needs to wash his or her hands frequently or use disinfectant gel. You will also need to be on oral as well as topical antibiotics. When you notice the first break out of the lesions a topical antibiotic may help prevent it from worsening. The child will also need to be treated and controlled.Hope this answers your question. Please contact us again with your health care concerns and questions"},{"Patient":"I have had a bruised feeling all over my right leg and top of my right foot now for a few week and it s gradually getting worse skin feels bruised to touch and uncomfortable when walking or at night but there is not visible bruise there what could this be","Doctor":"Since there is no visible bruising, I infer that you basically have a burning irritation sort of sensation. Burning feet, or paresthesias, is the term used to describe a hot, painful, “pins and needles” sensation in the feet. Such a thing generally happens due to nerve damage which could be the result of conditions like diabetes. I insist that you visit a dermatologist and get it examined. He would be able to pinpoint the possible causes based on his findings."},{"Patient":"I have had a massive headache for a couple of days and started to get a sore throat. Last night, I started getting chills which turned into being freezing to the point of shivering uncontrollably. I just took my temperature and it was 104.6 degrees. I m exhausted, yet I ve been sleeping on and off all day. I had traveled to the Boston area for a week and got back last friday and have had the headache and accredited it to jet lag. Is my temperature at a dangerous level. Should I go to the emergency room. I have been taking NyqQuil and Excedrin but they do not seem to be helping. I feel horrible. Is it possible that I have Meningitis?","Doctor":"Fever is indicative of infection. If associated with chills and rigors it could be malaria or urinary tract infection and needs to be investigated. Although meningitis is also a possibility, there is no need to jump to conclusions without having associated symptoms or investigations pointing to it. Sore throat, headachhe and fevers are commonly associated with common cold which is basically a viral infection. Viral infections are associated with high rise of temperature and if not controlled properly and promptly, it could lead to brain damage. 104°F is definitely a very high temperature and there is reason to be concerned. You may try Meftal P (mefenamic acid) which is more effective in controlling temperature."},{"Patient":"I have had two urine cultures done in the last 3 weeks. The first one indicated that I showed 10,000 - 25,000 cfu per ml. Dr. prescribed cipro 500mg, but test said it also appears susceptible to levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, penicillin and vancomycin. I have no symptoms but am quite nervous about taking any of these, and regarding cipro - especially because of the side affects in joints - I have an elevated ra factor. (plus vit d and b12 deficiency) I had a second culture done and while I don t know the results, Dr s nurse said to fill cipro and it s not a big deal. I ve been told in the past that I have metro valve prolapse and to take antibiotics before dental work and was told I didn t need to any more. 4 questions: Is this level of bacteria alarming? Is it possible this is in my bloodstream and dangerous? What penicillin do they mean, amoxicillin? Is there any healthier way to treat the bacteria in a more natural, less damaging to good bacteria way?","Doctor":"For urinary tract infection to be diagnosed, the bacterial count needs be be above 10^5 i.e. 10,00,000. Unless that is the case, the count is not considered to be high. However, your doctor has decided to play safe and given the antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin can be taken safely and you need not worry about that. Please complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed.Though there is a possibility of the bacteria being in the blood stream, the chances are quite less as you do not have other symptoms.Amoxicillin is an antibiotic of penicillin class but not same as penicillin.A healthier way to manage such bacteria is to drink plenty of water which basically flushes the bacteria out. You also need to maintain proper hygeine."},{"Patient":"My husband just got out of a skilled nursing home where he got c Diff.

When antibiotics are given as in the hospital, the beneficial bacteria die out and all that is left is the C. difficile which then cause diarrhoea. Usually it subsides in 5-7 days. Giving curd or yogurt helps as it contains beneficial bacteria. Alternatively, you can give probiotics and prebiotics like Econorm or vizylac which will take care of C.difficile.Our body is made of protein and for the repair and healing process, adequate protein intake in the form of food is required.

While ceftazidime ( third generation antibiotics ) is the drug of choice .You should also take aceclofenac 200 mg twice with serratiopeptidase20 mg twice in day with pantaprazole (  for nausea and vomiting).So in my opinion consult a surgeon and get his opinion as small incision may require .Cold massage also help .Hope this will help you.In such cases usually we remove nail as this is source of infection."},{"Patient":"I started with a fever of 101 Thursday evening, took some Tylenol and it went away but then I broke out in a sweat.

His other grandmother f has the shingle virus. My 15th month old grandchild visited his grandmother with the shingles. My grandson has only had 1 vaccine for the chicken pox virus. My question is can he get the chicken pox from his grandmother with the shingles and if so can I get the shingles from him should he develop chicken pox. I had chicken pox as a child but not the vaccine for shingles. I read if I should get the shingle vaccine I should not be around my grandson who has not had chicken pox.","Doctor":"Shingles is a contagious viral infection caused by a virus of herpes family called Herpes zoster. There is a possibility of his getting it from his grandmother. The chicken pox vaccine wound not be protective against shingles. However you need not panic. It is not necessary for him to catch the disease simply because he has visited his grandmother with shingles. If he gets the disease and if you are unable to maintain proper hygiene, only then you can get it from him. Singles will not convert or give rise to chicken pox. Whether you want to get shingles vaccination is something that you would have to decide. The vaccine has to be given prior to exposure, to be effective and if anybody has shingles (not chicken pox), you need to stay away from him.

This is the same doctor that gave me hysterectomy cestecele and rectocele repair 2006.

What s wrong?","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for contacting HCM.Before answering your question i would like to clear some facts:-The lymph system is a network of lymph nodes, lymph ducts, lymph vessels, and organs that produce and move a fluid called lymph from tissues to the bloodstream.The lymph glands, or nodes, are small structures that filter the lymph fluid. There are many white blood cells in the lymph nodes to help fight infection.Lymphadenitis occurs when the glands become enlarged by swelling (inflammation), often in response to bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The swollen glands are usually found near the site of an infection, tumor, or inflammation.Lymphadenitis may occur after skin infections or other infections caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus or Staphylococcus. Sometimes it is caused by rare infections such as tuberculosis or cat scratch disease (Bartonella).Going throw your history , which is provided here , I think your lymphadenitis is tubercular origin and it is in Abdomen Can you explain me the location of Lymph Node and what was the Investigation was done at time.... For example If any Lymph node in Intra abdominal it will come on Ultrasound or in CE CT ( Contrast Enhance C T) Abdomen.If Lymph Nodes externally then it was come through FNAC or Biopsy.if Lymph Node still persists and not reducing in Nowdo your a Ultrasound of Whole abdomen and compare with size of lymph node in previous Ultrasound.iF YOU ARE TAKING ANTI TUBERCULAR DRUGS KINDLY DISSCUSS WITH YOU DOCTOR about gene Expert test ( test conducted for sensitivity of First Line Tubercular drug)- effectiveness of tubercular drug which responding on your body or not.take some Pantoparazole and Domperidome combination LIke Tab Pan D before brakefast to reduce your Pain and vomiting.thanks my answer will help you... contact me any problem regarding diagnosis with your reports on drabhishek@aol.in"},{"Patient":"I m a 45 year old male. I m 75 KG in weight and am very fit. However for the past year I have been getting stomach upsets intermittently with fever and loose stools and cramps and a lot of flatulence. I also got hepatitis E virus infection followed by jaundice 4 months ago. That has cleared up now and all of my tests are fully normal. I spoke with my gastro and he said that I can start drinking beer if I wanted. I was a habitual beer drinker before I fell sick with jaundice/hepatitis. By habitual I mean 4-5 pints daily. When can I start drinking again? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM,Hepatitis E is a self limiting condition and there is no specific drug used for the treatment of hepatitis E.The treatment consists of adequate hydration by fluid intake and normal diet. At times it can take 3 to 6 months for SGOT and SGPT to return to normal. Monitor SGOT SGPT after a month.A hepatitis E diet includes high carbohydrate intake like Bread, pasta,wheat,rice and grains.The increased carbohydrate helps in preserving the protein in the body and prevent muscle wasting. Take vitamin B supplements, particularly B complex vitamins which your doctor would have prescribed. Wash hands well after using any washroom. Prefer to pick hot food and clean water. It is recommended to cook food at home. Drink only commercially bottled water or boiled water especially at places where sanitation and the water supply are unhygienic. Peel off raw fruits or vegetables before you eat. Thank you."},{"Patient":"I have an issue that I ve encountered over the past year. I keep smelling gasoline and its making me very nauseated.

My question is: how often should I be getting tested. My doctor said I did not need to get tested any more that my body cleared. I have been reading that a second test should be done.","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM,Antiviral medicines are used to treat long-term (chronic) hepatitis C. These medicines can help prevent the hepatitis C virus from damaging your liver. Sometimes treatment doesn't permanently lower the amount of virus in your blood. But some studies have shown that treatment may still reduce scarring in your liver, which can lower chances of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer. Further medicines to treat hepatitis C don't work for everyone. Chronic hepatitis C infection is cured or controlled in about half of the people who are treated with a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin. I suggest you discuss this with a gastroenterologist and then your doctor will decide what is good for you depending on further testing.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hello.

These medications should be taken for atleast one to four weeks.You need a few tests including labs to check his kidney function and an ultrasound of the kidney area and an urine culture to rule out an infection.

If you have no wound, then this is most likely a boil.You seem to have pyoderma in groin area. It is a bacterial infection caused by staphylococci. You consult dermatologist for firm diagnosis and investigations. Antibiotics like cefixime and antiinflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen may be taken for 1 to 2 weeks. Immunoboosters may be taken to improve immunity. Hygiene should be improved to prevent relapse. Dettol bath may be taken to improve hygiene.

And never very hard, just playfully. But this time it started to bleed out the tip. There s no external wound. And it stopped after about 15 20 minutes. I think it might be a uti, but not really sure. Can you help?!?","Doctor":"Hi,The skin in the head of penis is thin and vascular. Also it is elastic and stretchable making it difficult to see any small wounds. You might have got bitten and this led to bleeding when the penis was erect. After 15 - 20 minutes, the penis became flaccid and the bleeding stopped. The wound is not visible because it is small. Please apply any antiseptic ointment and do not have sex or do masturbation for about 1 week. It is not looking like urinary tract infection because you are giving history of being bitten by your girlfriend before oral sex."},{"Patient":"I recently am recovering from Hands foot and mouth disease caused by the Coxsackie virus.

This is a standard dose schedule and is recommended. The dog is healthy and vaccinated so there in no immediate risk from rabies. You have also mentioned that the dog is at home and never comes in contact with strays.With the above information, it is best to give your daughter a single shot of the same vaccine.

Today you noticed that the area is swelling and he is getting bruising around his eyes. This is to be expected. The trauma has caused tissue damage to the scalp and there is bleeding underneath the skin. This blood now is seeping down toward his eyes and giving him the bruises.

Now it's up to 103.4 and I just gave him more tylenol. He is not complaining about anything should I wait and see what happens of call the dr.","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM. It is safe to give your child Tylenol for his fever. I recommend in my practice that you can give Tylenol every 4 hours for fever. You can also use a tepid bath. Place him in bath water that is about 99 degrees and place him in it. That will slowly lower his temperature. Do not use a cold bath as it will make him shiver and actually increase his core body temperature. Overall temperature is not a bad thing. We only reduce a temperature if the child has a history of febrile seizures. Remember fever has been around of thousands of years as a defense against infection. The fever reduces the ability of the infection to grow and it also brings more white blood cells into the body to help fight that infection. So fever is not a bad thing.You can wait and see how he behaviors over the next day or so. Hope I answered you question.

On Wednesday morning she woke up with puffy eyelids & still not did not feel well. On Thursday, eyes still puffy, body aches, and she had a mild fever of 99-100, & then it went up to 102 in the evening. Same symptoms remained on Friday with fever remaining between 99-100 when using tylenol. I took her to the Dr. on Friday. Dr. wasn t sure what she had - something viral? Flu? NO blood work was taken. Although we are not aware of any tick bite (we are in a high tick area), we discussed the possibility of the tick disease, anaplasmosis because 2 of our close neighbors were recently diagnosed. Dr. suggested waiting things out through the weekend to see how she did and wrote us a script for Doxycycline and left if up to us on whether we wanted to start it. Fever went up to 102 again on Fri. night. Saturday morning we gave her 1 doxycycline & tylenol. Thoughout the day, fever averaged about 100.6 then went to 101+ during the night. Before bed we gave her a 2nd dose of the Doxyclycline which she threw up within just a few minutes of taking. Eyes seem to get more puffy the higher the fever. After throwing up the Doxyclycline, we did not give it to her again and have continued with tylenol or ibuprofen to try to keep the fever down. Tonight follows the same pattern, fever up, body aches worse (legs feel crawly to her at times), & eyes more puffy again. Cool compresses do not bring down the puffiness of eyes. We re not sure what to do next. Start her back on Doxy, take her in tomorrow for blood work? She is visibly uncomfortable. She has also had a decreased appetite. At times, in addition to the puffy eyes, her face looks somewhat swollen. No sore throat but some swollen glands in neck. Please help. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello,her symptoms seem a lot like influenza although other illnesses (viral or bacterial) could have caused the same symptoms. Since there are not many symptoms to guide the diagnostic procedure, you've got the choice to wait and see or to do some tests. Some useful tests include the complete blood count and the c-reactive protein (CRP). Increased white blood cells (with polymorphonuclear predomination) and high values of CRP likely indicate bacterial disease which needs antibiotic treatment. Low CRP values usually accompany viral illnesses although none of the above is 100% error-free. Worrisome symptoms and signs include faintness or orthostatic hypotension, very high pulse rate, decreased urine output, shortness of breath, too many breaths/minute and decreased cognitive functions.

It's unusual to have pain in case of piles be it external or internal. Presence of pain indicates thrombosed pile ( Piles are dilated blood vessel, clotting of blood is thrombosed pile) or also possibility of fissure in anus is to be considered. Proper management will therefore require thorough clinical examination to know the character of pile and other associated complication. I would suggest you the following which will definitely help 1. Increase water consumption-Consume at least 2 to 3 liter of water per day. 2. High fiber diet- Two serving of vegetable salad everyday 3. Hot Seitz bath- Add a handful of common table salt to a tub of lukewarm water. Immerse your bottom by sitting in it for 15 to 20 minutes each session twice a day.

Not sure if I should be worried or if its just because its fresh , I have put polysporn on it and a bandaid.","Doctor":"HIThanks for posting your query to Healthcaremagic.    First issue is whether you should get Rabies Vaccination or not ? Was it a pet dog or a Vaccinated Dog ? Can you observe the dog for 10 days.    If the dog is vaccinated or if nothing happens to the dog in 10 days then no need for Rabies Vaccination. But if the dog dies within 10 days then you need to get Rabies Vaccination for you. Also get a Tetanus Shot for yourself . Hope this answers your query.   Hope you find this information useful.Any clarifications or Queries feel free to ask. Happy to help you.

So I waited a year and then got it repierced. Its been pierced for like a year now and at first wasn t getting better. I thought I was allergic to the metal (because some of my other piercings have done that and gold seems to be fine) so I put gold in it and I thought it was getting better.

But then it randomly like a week ago it started oozing a bit and has been doing that ever since. Im not sure why that happened.

I take dexedrine 5mg 2x daily(for adhd) and metoprolol half a 25mg pill at night usually(to lower anxiety and hart rate). I went to the cardiologist last year because I thought I had SVT and I had several EKG s, 1 ECG, a 24hr holter monitor and although my heart rate rose up to 168bpm that day, without exercise, the doctor just told me I was an anxious person with very slight mitral valve regurgitation that needed to be on anxiety meds, so I got diagnosed with panic disorder and put on klonopin. I no longer take them as i ve switched to the Tropol(lowers my heart rate & palpitations which is where the anxiety would stem from but that wasn t taken into accreditation which leaves me to believe even more I had a misdiagnosis). I do notice small things when it comes to health issues but i ve noticed now that i m back on my adhd medicine my heart rate tends to always be over/around the 100bpm range resting, and with exercise can get up to 205bpm(that happens anyway with exercise though if I don t take my metoprolol). I ve developed a slight cough that I can t get rid of, I can always see my heart beating out of my chest, sometimes I get a choking feeling or I can feel my pulse in my neck, and my stomach is a little bigger. I go running or biking at least 2 times a week and I eat healthy, so this leaves me to believe I am either psyching myself out or I have a pre-existing heart condition that the doctors have all shrugged off and I should not be taking dexedrine. However I do smoke around 3 cigarettes a day sometimes less. And if that is the case i m really afraid I have heart damage or something with these new symptoms.

Reading through your querry I would say at first sight your aunt has pneumonia which is most at times caused by bacteria and the right management is by the usage of antibiotics, mucolytic drugs and fever medications. However the cough might take a few days to subside after the fever and chest pains if there are any. In case of persistent cough and fever, there might be a need for a change in the type of antibiotics like from Amoxilline tablets to Erythromycine tablets and if this still does not work I would advise you consult a pneumologist for a sputum exam and possibly an endoscopy. The location of opacities at the apex could be suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis or pulmonary tumours. So I would advise for pneumologist consultation.

I am scheduled for IVF treatment sometime from June to Aug. Could there be a possibility that the doctors in UK may postpone the IVF Treatment until they completely kill TB. They have not shared with me what kind of TB I have or even if I have latent TB or any other advanced TB? Query is - does by any chance if I got TB then would it interfere with IVF?","Doctor":"You would need to postpone IVF if you have TB and receive treatment. At the minimum you have latent TB or a past exposure. They may get a chest xray and sputum tests to see if it is active or if there is evidence for a previous infection. The treatment for TB (both latent and active TB are treated) entails several antibiotics for a prolonged period, so you would not want to be carrying a child during that time. Additionally, pregnancy makes you more susceptible to infection, so even if it's latent TB, pregnancy might allow it to become active. So you do need to wait and be sure the TB is cleared from your system before you do IVF. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I contracted the herpes virus from smoking off a weed pipe not knowing she had it I was always using meth her too didn t find out till 6 weeks later when I asked her why I had so many whiteheads. she said that s not acne its the herpes cold sore virus wash ur hands often & don t touch anywhere else. too late been there done that.

But, whiteheads are not the same as herpes cold sores.Those are groups of blisters on a red base that occurs in a localized area, usually in the same place each time. People who use meth regularly can get other problems with lesions on their face, and often pick at them and this can cause all sorts of damage.I think what you have, sounds more like acne and is related to the meth.

If an abscess has not formed, the use of warm water compresses and soaking the affected finger in vinegar might help.  Tylenol can be taken for pain relief. Mild cases may be treated with an antibiotic cream (e.g. BactrobanNeosporin] alone or in combination with a topical corticosteroid.For severe infection it is important to consult your doctor and get the puss drained out."},{"Patient":"had an duodenal ulcer. ...trouble coming out of it.....it created some problems and chronic duodentis...been seeing GI(gastreoendocrenology) specialists for over 6months..... getting nowheere. they just keep throwing omeprozole and antacids at me...... did a an upper GI, blood urine and stool samples come up negative for bactereia....having some toruble and very uncomfortavle.....any suggestions to get the duodentis to go down and get normal bowels?","Doctor":"Hi,Duodenal ulcers that occur on the inside of the upper portion of your small intestine (duodenum).Usual treatment of duodenitis includes the following, depending on the other tests.Antibiotic medications to kill H. pyloriMedications that block acid production and promote healingMedications to reduce acid productionAntacids that neutralize stomach acidMedications that protect the lining of your stomach and small intestineNot improving duodenitis might be due to the following reasons.1.

Recurrence has happened in all four people originally infected. Symptoms : Vomiting and/or diarrhea Fever Severe headaches Nausea Dizziness Abdominal cramps Could it b residual infection or parasite?","Doctor":"Hi,There can be many reasons for recurrent symptoms of food poisoning after taking treatment.1. The first reason can be that the medications and antibiotics did not clear the bacteria. This can happen because the bacteria are resistant or the antibiotics were not taken for a duration long enough to cause elimination of infection.2. The second reason can be that there is still some contamination around in food or drinking water sources and this leads to persistent infection.3. The third can be due to severe form of infection like typhoid and this requires long duration treatment for 2 - 3 weeks.4. The symptoms of food poisoning might be potentiated by underlying irritabe bowel disease.5. There can be an underlying surgical cause like diverticulitis that is causing the symptoms.An ultrasound scan or CT scan abdomen might be required for persistent symptoms."},{"Patient":"i have had chills thats send a wave of dull pain through out my body i dnt have fever ive had this before i recently went to hospital for palpatations after i have an episode of palpataions i get regular chills but whats been bothering most is these fraustrating pain chills","Doctor":"HIThanks for posting your query.

She is required to consume easy to digest foods that would give rest to the system. First thing is to maintain the fluid and electrolyte balance. To do so, she must take plenty of plain water, tender coconut water and drinks like fresh soups (not the packed ready to make kind), salted lemon juice with sugar or honey (no soda), barley water will also be helpful. Maintaining small and frequent meals. Taking light foods and avoiding peel or seeds of the fruits/vegetables, wherever possible.

Is it safe for me to take it?","Doctor":"Sulfamethoxazole is a sulfa drug. If you are allergic to that class of drugs, you should not take it. The other drugs you took are not in the same class, so there is no way to predict whether you will have a reaction to this one. You seem to be sensitive to antibiotics, so it's possible you are at increased risk of having an allergic reaction, even though this drug is entirely different from the others. The only way you will know is if you have a reaction when you take it. I am sorry I cannot give you a better answer than that, but everyone is different and there is no easy way to know how a particular individual may respond. All you can do is decide if the risk of taking the drug is worth the possible benefit it may have on the sinus infection.

Allergic reactions can be immediate or delayed, though immediate reactions are more common.The treatment varies slightly according to the severity of the reaction. In severe reactions (decreased blood pressure, increased pulse, hives, difficulty breathing) hospitalization is required for treatment.Where there is only swelling and rash, you can treat at home by the use of oral antihistamines such as benadryl. In addition, if the area is painful, you can use paracetamol.If the severity of the reaction worsens, then you would need to seek medical attention.If you haven't had a tetanus shot in the last 5 yrs, you also need to take a booster dose.Thank you."},{"Patient":"My horse bit my bum cheek two weeks ago.

It will also help to know if you were tested for tuberculosis. If you felt better with antibiotics then it is less likely to be tuberculosis. Sore throat coming and going in an hour is difficult to explain. A thorough throat examination is required to know if there is residual throat infection. Please do warm saline water gargle every day in morning and evening. This will prevent recurrent throat infection. The lung infection, if it appears again might need to be evaluated by chest CT scan to know if you have any focal or diffuse lung changes like bronchiectasis causing repeat infections."},{"Patient":"Recently I found out my younger sister was self harming.

There are so many blood borne pathogens that its difficult to suggest you a single test. If she is doing well then there is no need to worry. The HIV if any does not stay long enough on a blade to cause reinfection.

Only a person who has had chickenpox at one time can get shingles. Now people who have NOT had chickenpox CAN get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This would be unusual for a senior citizen; most people are immune to chickenpox by that age. It was just a coincidence that the person sitting next to the infected person also got it.

Fevers can be caused by viral and bacterial infections, but they can also be caused by other conditions, such as parasites like malaria, blood diseases, and other problems. When a person has had a fever for a long time without a diagnosis, it is called Fever of Unknown Origin, and a work up for the cause should be done.

Was told that introduction of this marrow infection to my blood stream will stop my heart. What is this infection called?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.Infection of the bone marrow with the surrounding bone is called osteomyelitis. This iinfection is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Usually this infection is caused if any penetrating injury through skin which reaches the bone or from blood which is carrying bacteria to the bone. When one of the major bones are involved like bones of the thigh, leg or arm, there are chances of infection spreading to the blood called as septicemia. If there is a fracture of a major bone, there could be dislodgement of the blood clot of the fracture which could cause emboli and block pulmonary vessels causing pulmonary embolism. This affects the heart.I suggest you discuss with your treating doctor the various ways of treating osteomyelitis without surgery. Identification of the bacteria causing infection is very important. Surgery under antibiotic cover will prevent spread of infection to a large extent.I hope I have helped you with this answer.Thanks"},{"Patient":"my husband had single bi-pass surgery 3 weeks ago.

If you have taken 15 days treatment then you should take nutritious home cooked food for about a month and half or 6 weeks. The food should preferably be home cooked and not spicy.

Another method is to have a continuous recording of the heart's electrical activity with a Holter monitoring. If any episode of AF occurs during the monitoring it would be picked up. During Holter monitoring you can also mark the record if any symptom occurs and that will also help decide whether your symptom is due to AF or not.

After an infection with certain strains of strep, some people develop an antibody reaction to the strep that causes rheumatic fever. The antibodies attack your own body and can cause damage to the heart. You do not mention what problems you have had as an adult, but if you are having problems with the heart valves, then your doctor is correct.

PLEASE ANSWWER THANK YOU","Doctor":"Shingles isn't contagious unless you haven't had chickenpox. What happens is you get chickenpox, usually as a child, then the virus goes dormant in the body. Years later it can break out in a localized rash as shingles. So shingles itself can't be transmitted. However, since it is the same virus that causes chickenpox, if someone has not had chickenpox or been immunized for it, they can get it from the shingles patient who has the rash. So unless some one is susceptible that way, there is no reason to have her stay home, especially since she has no rash and the doctor isn't even sure yet. If she does get a rash, she can keep it covered while she is working with a bandage, and then with her shirt over that. Things should be okay that way. Frequent handwashing is important for her and everyone else as well. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I had an injury to my elbow including a small cut. After approximately 12 hour I developed a sharp pain and swelling to the joint. 24 hours later I still have inflammation and swelling. The elbow is warm to the touch. Now experiencing pain in other joints. Should I be worried about infection or is this just a normal reaction to the original injury ?","Doctor":"You could be developing an infection in your elbow. There is a small bursa (fluid sac to help joints move) at the tip of the elbow which can easily get infected with even minor trauma. It would be best to have it looked at and get on antibiotics if necessary. I can't say why you are having pain in other joints; this is not a typical reaction. You could be in the early stages of a viral infection. But get the elbow checked and they can also look at your other joints and see what's happening there. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"My 4 year old son has had a temperature sunday and monday and saying his tummy hurt, his head hurt and was feeling lethargic.

I was wondering if this is chicken pox.","Doctor":"From your description it does not sound like chickenpox. That usually starts on the trunk area and affects the legs and arms later. It also will start with small spots and bumps that progress into blisters, and is generally quite itchy. Other viruses can cause different types of rashes, so this might be related to that infection. You might want to mention the rash to your GP and see if s/he wants to take a look at it to be sure it's not something treatable. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi! Ma daughter is 10 months old.

Allergic reactions can be immediate or delayed, though immediate reactions are more common.The treatment varies slightly according to the severity of the reaction. In severe reactions (decreased blood pressure, increased pulse, hives, difficulty breathing) hospitalization is required for treatment.Where there is only swelling and rash, you can treat at home by the use of oral antihistamines such as benadryl. In addition, if the area is painful, you can use paracetamol.If the severity of the reaction worsens, then you would need to seek medical attention.If you haven't had a tetanus shot in the last 5 yrs, you also need to take a booster dose.Thank you."},{"Patient":"hi !my pet german shepherd dog just scratched me on my face n arm while playing . he is 5 months and all his vacinations are properly and regularly done . the scratches on my face and arm are not deep .. but there has been a little blood on the cut .do i need to get vacination done ? please advice .","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM,As you were bit by a pet fully vaccinated dog it is very important to initiate the treatment as early as possible, as dog can transmit rabies,which is 100 % fatal but it is 100% preventable by proper and adequate treatment.I would suggest you to follow 1.Wash the wound immediately with soap and water. 2.Active immunization with anti rabies vaccine on days 0,3,7,14 and 28.

I have no idea what caused this or what it is. Should I be alarmed?","Doctor":"HelloThank You for contacting HCM.There could be two possibilities in your case. First, bacterial infection of the belly button area.  Second, incisional hernia. For first case, clean the area with spirit and apply polyfax plus ointment thrice a day for a week. For second, you need to visit hospital where doctors will confirm it by examining it.Hope this answers your question.

Why is this so and what do we say to this problem in medical terms?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. It appears to be a sinus.2. I do not think it is from the hip joint. It could be a draining abscess, possibly superficial. Culture of the fluid is necessary to identify the organism for treatment of infection.3.

What could this be?","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCMYou are concerned about getting an infection in the area of prior mosquito bites. This is actually a common occurrence. When the mosquito bites and you start scratching the area you cause small cuts to occur on the skin and that introduces bacteria into the wound. This progresses to infection and small abscess. I recommend that you seek medical attention where they can give you oral antibiotics.I also recommend1. elevating the leg2. using warm compresses3. Tylenol for that pain and burningHope I answered your medical question. Please contact us again with your medical questions and concerns"},{"Patient":"My legs swell terribly. Doesn t this strain my heart? I take amylodypine and propaphenone. Why take this if it puts a strain on my heart? I also have no energy and would be happy to just sleep all the time. Have been taking both prescriptions about 5 years.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I would explain that leg swelling could be related to Amlodipine adverse effects. Anyway, it is also recommendable performing some tests to investigate for other possible causes of increased fluid retention (heart failure, kidney, or liver dysfunction). In this regard, I would recommend performing these tests: - A cardiac ultrasound and NT pro BNP plasma levels. - Complete blood count - Blood electrolytes - Kidney and liver function tests. If all these tests result normal, I would recommend gradually reduce the dose of Amlodipine and switch to another drug (Hydrochlorothiazide or Torasemide) to help reduce blood pressure values. Starting a diuretic like Furosemide may help reduce the leg swelling. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"My daughter received a third degree burn from a motorcycle accident. To day she went to the hospital because of on going infection. They informed her today that she has mesa. Can other family members become infected or are there different types of mrsa?","Doctor":"MRSA can be transmissible. MRSA stands for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Staph aureus is a common bacterium often found on the skin. Some strains of staph can be very virulent, others less so. Methicillin resistant means it is a strain of staph that is not susceptible to the antibiotics usually used to treat it. There can be different strains of MRSA because there are different strains of staph. The MRSA are harder to treat because not so many antibiotics are effective enough. Staph can affect anybody. The fact that it is MRSA doesn't change that. People with weaker immune systems are more likely to get infected. Or people who have open wounds like abrasions or cut. The bacteria can get in through the wound and cause infection. The best things to do to prevent transmission is to wash your hands frequently and clean up areas, using gloves, where your daughter may have touched the infected burn on. hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Yes a male friend of mine just a few days ago come down with flu like symptoms and the next day his leg was really red and had fever in it. He said he was very sick and couldn t hardly get out of bed. What could that be and should he be worried about it","Doctor":"It sounds like he may have cellulitis, which is an infection in the skin. Often before an infection shows up, you can get flu-like symptoms, like muscle aches and feeling sick. If he could hardly get out of bed, then I think he is quite sick and should be seen for it right away. An infection in the skin can easily cause blood poisoning (sepsis) and can be very dangerous. He may need someone to take him to emergency but he should be seen and started on antibiotics right away. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have a chronic infection of Staph Aureus in my lower spine for which I have been treated since 2010. In the past three months I have developed pain in both jaws as well as teeth. It started as an occasional occurance, and is now nearly constant. It is a sharp piercing pain. Could it be related to my infection? I hate to bother my infectious disease doc as he is so busy, but it feels too widespread for my dentist. Suggestions? Advice? Thank you.","Doctor":"It could be related to spread of the Staph aureus, in which case I am sure your infectious disease doctor would want to know about it. But I recommend you do check first with your dentist, as it could be something else. You could have temporomandibular joint syndrome, which is often due to grinding of teeth while sleeping. This can cause pain in teeth and jaws. The dentist can get a panning x-ray view of your jaws and all your teeth and see if this is a possibility. Treatment would be quite different, as this is not an infection. A dentist could also check for other conditions that could be causing the pain. I suggest you start there before assuming this is spread of the staph. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"My daughter had what she thought was an ingrown hair or pimple on her inner thigh. She popped it and it was not just the white head, but a watery pus that came out with a little blood. The white tip is now gone, but it is red, hard and a little painful to touch.","Doctor":"It sounds like the pimple is developing into a full-fledged abscess. This is an infection in which a large amount of pus has collected within the skin. It can develop from an ingrown hair. It may come to a head again and drain on its own, but if it's large or more painful, it might be better to have it incised and drained by a doctor. That way it can be completely cleaned out and allowed to drain for a while so it doesn't come back.

I am sorry to hear that  you have had itching for 3 years. The louse infestation maybe the cause but could you also have scabies or bed bug infestation. I would recommend being sure that you bed and bed clothing are all disinfected properly and that the bed itself gets treated. To help the itching try oatmeal baths, hydroxyzine for itch and hydrocortisone cream to the areas that itch.

Yet I notice I still have a discharge and rashes on my body. what concern should I have","Doctor":"My concern is that you have secondary syphilis. You've already had one STD, which puts you are at risk for another, especially now with the recent affair. Secondary syphilis means the syphilis germ has been in your body awhile and is now spreading. It typically presents with many different types of rashes. Syphilis may respond to penicillin, which amoxicillin is a form of, but unless you receive an adequate treatment for a longer period of time, you will not get rid of it. I recommend you see your doctor and get tested for syphilis, and get the appropriate therapy if you have it.

If it is just plain amoxicillin you were given, that is not adequate treatment for a cat bite. Augmentin (amoxicillin with clavulanate) would be adequate. Ice will not provide much benefit. If you can't get hold of a doctor immediately (there is usually a doctor answering emergency calls at night if your doctor isn't available), then you should go to the ER now. You might need more aggressive antibiotic treatment and if an abscess has developed, it will have to be drained. Good luck.

I just came down with hives on my hands, around my neck area, and possibly on my ears and head because they itch.   Am I doing something wrong?            Thanks, Kara","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCm with your medical concernsYou recently being having a problem with a red rash, possibly fungal infection, in your groin and in the folds of your arms. The first thing I recommend is that you stop using the Augmentin and the triamcinolone ointment. The Augmentin is an antibiotics and will kill off all the good bacteria and your skin allowing the fungal infection to grow unchecked. normal bacteria on our skin helps protect from overgrowth of fungus. Also Augmentin can cause more allergies and the recent rash with itching maybe allergy to Augmentin.The second thing is that the triamcinolone is a steroid and it will also help the fungus grow. Steroids reduce immune response again allowing for the fungus to grow.Third keep the areas where you have a rash as dry as possible. Fungus likes to grow in areas that are warm dark and moist.Fourth continue diflucan and nystatin powder or spray. These are antifungal medication and will help control the infectionHope I answered your question.

Your husband was diagnosed with a staph infection on his penis recently. Staph is a bacteria that is on everyone's skin. The staph only becomes a problem with open skin from trauma or abrasion that gets into the deeper layers of skin and starts an infection. MRSA is a specific type of staph infection where it is resistant to most antibiotics. We do have antibiotics for MRSA but it can be more difficult to cure. If your husband has a regular staph infection he should have received antibiotics and he should complete the course of medication. Hope I answered your question.

I would explain that the hot flashes are not a common adverse effect related to stents. They could be related to blood pressure fluctuations or anxiety. Coming to this point, I would recommend you to closely monitor your heart rate and blood pressure values during those flashes. If your blood pressure values are high, I would recommend going to the ER for a physical exam, a resting ECG, cardiac enzyme levels and other blood lab tests (complete blood count, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, etc.).

Please do not try any home remedies as you might infect it by doing so. Hot fomentation will help to some extent to soften the abscess. This abscess usually has septae which divide the abscess and these have to be broken for the pus to be drained. I suggest you get in touch with a GP nearby you and get the abscess drained. You might also have to take antibiotics for 5-7 days for faster healing.Keep the area clean and dry as possible.Thanks."},{"Patient":"my doctor prescribed isosorbide MN 30 Mg for high blood pressure 1 x daily.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I don't think that Isosorbide is an alternative for Diovan, in treating chronic high blood pressure. There are many other drugs that can low the blood pressure like Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide combination, Lercanidipine, etc. Isosorbide may be used in patient taking some other medications for high blood pressure, that can cause an episode of high blood pressure despite taking other medications (only one take, not chronic), not for chronic use in treating high blood pressure.

But for next 1-2 days avoid contact with your grandchild , if it is shingles then in next 2 days there will be even more skin lesions which increases the possibility of the diagnosis of Shingles .

How much time it takes to control this Rubella and Cytomegalov infection and is she giving us the right medicines?","Doctor":"IgG antibodies are associated with a past infection. Since the antibodies did not change after 3 months, this means the infection was long ago in the past, and that she is immune. I'm not sure what you mean by a \\"natural abortion\\" or if you meant the TORCH test was done on the fetus. Results of IgG antibodies in the baby indicate only passive transfer from the mother and do not indicate active infection. IgG antibodies remain after an infection clears up, and what her tests indicate is that she does NOT currently have an infection with either rubella or cytomegalovirus. Folic acid supplements are strongly recommended before and during pregnancy to avoid damage to the baby's nervous system. Iron deficiency anemia is common during pregnancy so supplemental iron is also recommended. Based on these tests, I am not clear why she received an R-vac injection. She was already immune.

Also anything else that may happen.","Doctor":"It's not that the amox is toxic, but that antibiotics can wipe out the normal bacteria in the colon, and if C diff is present, it can start to overgrow. Probably just 2 doses won't be enough to cause that, but it is still possible, so be on the lookout for C diff symptoms. Get treated right away if they occur. As far as the amox causing other problems, unless you are allergic, that was not a toxic dose so you should be okay.

This can occur with a urethritis if she had a recent infection or with strictures from old infections.There can be some thickening of the urinary bladder wall from a urinary infection or it can be due to other lesions, benign or otherwise.A transvaginal ultrasound examination with post micturation volume will help to come to a proper diagnosis.Wish her a quick recovery."},{"Patient":"I was treated for h pylori and unfortunately thought everything would go back to normal.

If the doctor has given you these and you had taken them regularly, then you probably do not have it. The way to make sure that it is gone is to do a urea breath test after a month of the treatment.If your pain recurred after drinking alcohol, it is probably due to alcohol induced gastritis and not H.Pylori.So my suggestion would be to do a urea breath test and if it is negative, keep off alcohol and take a PPI for 1 month to help the gastritis heal.I am available if you have queries,Wish you good healthDr. Noble Zachariah"},{"Patient":"My son has had a wound on his back that has not healed x1 week. He has also had loose stools runny nose and what seems to be an uri. He also has reactive airway disease. i have also had a wound appear on my neck this week and have had headaches. Could any of this be from mrsa?","Doctor":"Hello,MRSA may cause damage to many organs but the clinical picture of your son probably relates to a viral infection. MRSA can cause sinusitis which usually presents with headaches, nasal congestion and perhaps even fever. I could not tell by your description. Nobody could tell you actually. Cultures are needed to diagnose infections by specific pathogens. Normally in cases like that, doctors do not ask for cultures.I could not also comment on your wound. This description is too vague to be assessed. It could be better assessed in a clinical encounter. If you could provide a good quality picture, it would probably help. In general, MRSA is not a common pathogen in normal individuals. Risk factors for having MRSA include MRSA carriers (MRSA can reside in their noses), hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients, diabetes, cancer, hospitalization, stroke etc. Of course close contacts can acquire MRSA from high risk patients.So the answer is that unless you have any of the above you're not likely to have MRSA.

I think instead of debating on what caused the boil or bite and made way for the entry of the bacteria it is important to treat fast. I would suggest you to take some lab investigations like CBC, blood culture, routine urine examination and culture of the wound discharge. I suggest you to take oral antibiotics first for at least 2 to 3 weeks to contain the spread of cellulitis. You need anti inflammatory like Ibuprofen up to 600mg per dose two to three doses a day.

After which virus tends to die out and looses the capacity to transmit disease to normal individuals.Chicken pox is a self limiting disease which will subside by itself. Antiviral drugs like valacyclovir can be taken, it will not cure the condition but it will halt the progression of disease and prevent further complication associated with the disease.Topical application of calamine lotion will dry up the rashes.

The burning and hurting go along with a blood flow problem, and the overall awful feeling suggests something more significant. These are not typical symptoms of HPV. I suggest you see a urologist or dermatologist specialist to evaluate this more fully, and very soon. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I stepped on a nail three weeks ago.

Do the lesions have to be like an open sore before contagious, or is it contagious before it becomes as open sore? I get sores on my mouth when im in the sun to long is this a form of herpes? Can I get blood tested to determine if I have herpes and will be determine which type if either I have?","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magic Herpes is transmitted by contact with lesions though there is  small risk of asymptomatic transmission as well.Asymptomatic transmission means that the person does not have any symptoms of an acute outbreak but still capable of transmitting the virus.Herpes 1 is most commonly associated with the oral lesions and herpes 2 with the genital infections though it is possible for the opposite to occur.Oral herpes is very common.It is possible for you to be tested to determine if you are infected with either one of these infections. The tests can determine the type if any, if present.You can speak to your doctor about this possibility.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Good Morning: I had a tick that was attached to my side. My husband removed it. It is now red and itchy. This has been a week. I have an extremely swollen gland in my groin area and am extremely tired. I am a type 2 diabetic but my last a1c was 5.6. I am not overweight. Any ideas? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello there,I understand your concern about the swelling and pain. That gland is probably because of the tick bite. You need to be examined to make sure that there is no other reason or problem in the groin leading to the lymph node swelling. Your A1c is in good control. If I were to treat you I would give you a course of Doxycycline antibiotics to cure the infection and swelling in the gland. But you need a proper examination before the medicine can be prescribed. So please visit your physician who can do the same. Till then try to take paracetamol for the pain and do some cold compresses to the swollen area if there is no pus formation so that can relieve the pain. If there is pus then there is need for drainage of pus by the physician.Hope this helps.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I am 4 1/2 weeks post Lavh, removing everything, and have been doing well.

He cannot tell me what it is? He has gave me 2 different anti-biotics. It will not stop draining and its been almost a month.Now he says he does not know what it is. He wants me to see a breast specialists. It does not sound right that he sent a culture to the lab and the only thing he ruled out was MRSA. Should I get a second opinion fro another doctor or see someone that specializes in infections.","Doctor":"Thank you for you question. I am Dr Asanghanwa. Boils or abscesses are usually a collection of dead or dying white blood cells and bacteria. They are formed as the white blood cells of the body try to fight a bacteria infection and normally should subside after good incision and drainage and appropriate antibiotics. However a persistent breast boil may be an early sign of a potentially dangerous underlying condition like breast cancer. I would advise you to consult a gynaecologist as fast as possible so the breast is examined and necessary tests are carried out and proper medications prescribed. However other underlying conditions can make an abscess drain for longer than necessary like diabetes and immunodeficient states. Good luck and take care."},{"Patient":"I JUST HAD MY GALLBLADDER REMOVED YESTERDAY. I HAD GALLBLADDER STONES AND IT WAS VERY INFECTED.

Warmth, redness, tenderness and swelling can also occur if an area is inflamed even if no infection is present.You can consider using an anti inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen, cataflam or  naproxen. Monitor the area for 24 to 36 hours (unless notice a discharge or symptoms worsen prior to this), if no improvement occurs with medication, then you should visit your doctor for assessment.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hello, I recently got 2 spider bites, I don t know the type of spider.

Also You can place a sticky piece of tape against your child's rectum. Pinworm eggs will stick to the tape so than the doctor can look for pinworms or eggs under a microscope. The best time for a tape is at night or in the morning before a bath. If your tests comes back positive your doctor may prescribe medications like Mebendazole, Albendazole or Pyrantel. Please note that this medications may be prescribe to all members of your household to prevent infection.Also You should wash bedsheets, towels, underwear and nightclothes every few days and change underwear and bed linen every day.  Shower in the morning (it can help reduce the number of pinworm eggs). Try to keep fingernails short and wash your hands often to reduce risk of getting an infection. Do not scratch - ask your doctor for anti-itch cream. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables and try to limit sugar. Eating more garlic may also help. Hope I have answered your question.

Tomorow I need to receive the 4th shot but I am away from Argentina, in a small town in Switzerland (Gstaad).

This will take several weeks to get control. I also recommend at night before going t sleep. put on the betamethasone and then put on a white cotton glove.

Pin worms are a very common parasitic infection that is transmitted from person to person. The pin worms lay eggs at the anal opening at night and that is what causes the severe rectal itching. The eggs then stick to clothing and can be transmitted through the clothing. Also after going to the bathroom the eggs can get on your hands and with inadequate hand washing will also transmit the eggs.The treatment requires washing clothes and bed sheets. You will also need to take anti-parasitic like albendazole or pyrantel. You can purchase pyrantel over the counter as Pin-X or Reese's Pin worm. You may need to retreat in 2 weeks after your first dose.Good luckHope this answers your question.

The risk is low, since the needle and syringe were probably old, you cleaned everything up right away, and you did not inject anything deep into the muscle or your bloodstream. Also did you see if old blood was in the syringe? That would increase the risk.That being said, there is a risk no matter how small that should be followed up. You would want to should find out if the daughter has any of these diseases. If she has HIV, you can take antiviral HIV medicines as a preventative for a short time. You also should get baseline tests for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. These tests will need to be checked a few months later if they are negative now as they take a while to change if you've been infected.

Sometimes the cause is a prior injury to the brain like a concussion. But most of the time whenever find the answer to the causeThe treatment is to take anti-seizure medications. Your neurologist will choose one that will control her seizures. This may take several days to a week to get adequate blood levels. Once her levels are stable then she should be controlled and able to have a normal life.

Please help!!!!!!!!","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM with you health care questions.I am sorry to hear that you have a yeast infection. Yeast is an opportunistic infection that grows in areas that are dark and moist. So this is a frequent problem with young women especially after taking antibiotics. Men do not usually contact yeast though if he is uncircumcised then he need to be sure to clean well after having sex as it can occur. For him he needs to pull back the foreskin and clean well with soap and water. For you I recommend you actually seek medical attention as this pain and discharge may not be just a yeast infection. I also recommend to help prevent bladder infections after sex that you urinate after sex. This may help prevent infections in the future.Hope I answered your question.

It is possible though that you and your husband had chicken pox when you were children but very mild cases. If that is the case then you both may not contract the disease.

I am Dr Asanghanwa Carlson. Lung infections are due to the infectious agents like bacteria, viruses and fungi. A few conditions favour lung infections amongst these are smoking, alcoholism, exposing yourself to cold, and underlying immuno deficient conditions such as diabetes, HIV and other constitutive disorders. For your case, smoking favours the occurence of a chest infect and it can affect any lobe in your lungs though pulmonary tuberculosis has a predilection for the upper lung lobes. I would advise you to reduce and possibly stop smoking as this will expose to recurrent chest infections and possibly lung cancer. I will advise you visit a pneumologist for proper follow up. Have a great time"},{"Patient":"I am 29 years old from Zimbabwe Height 1.6cm and weight 63kg, I am working in Liberia since April 2014.

If there are no changes in cardiac chambers (atrium), it may need anticoagulant drugs for some time and the doctor may try cardio version with medications or electrical to restore sinus rhythm.

Prostatitis is frequently cause by a urinary tract infection that also infects the prostate. Even after treatment the prostate can become chronically infected.

This is frequently seen after taking antibiotics. The antibiotics kill bacteria and they also killed the bacteria in your mouth. The candida is then an opportunistic infection and starts to grow.

Pneumonia after any surgery is always a concern; that is the the reason for incentive spirometry and deep breath and cough- to prevent pneumonia.

From your description she has been treated with medication for the giardia, which by the way is a protozoan infection, and has diarrhea again. After taking any antibiotics the usual gut bacteria are also killed off and a opportunistic infection called clostridium difficile can grow. Since this is her first episode of C. difficile she will more than likely be on one or two additional antibiotics for 2 weeks. This may also kill of the other \\"protozoan infection so she would not need additional antibiotics. The liver lesions are more worrisome.

I dont want to take that.He gave some medicines altiva 120,moxikind cv 375","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCMI am sorry to hear that you have been having persistent sinus headaches. You doctor has already taken x rays of your sinuses and found no infection. Your doctor then went ahead and prescribed an antihistamine and a course of antibiotics and I assume you continue to have headaches. In my clinic I see people who have been diagnosed with sinus headaches for years and no documented abnormal Sinus x rays or CT scans. I then question whether they actually had sinus problems in the first place. Typically people with migraine headaches will complain of sinus congestion and pain. If these headaches cause you to stop what you are doing and lose work or time with family then you more then likely have migraine headaches. For this I usually recommend taking a triptan medication like Imitrex to help abort the headache. Another frequent cause of sinus headaches is TMJ or temporal mandibular joint syndrome. This headache or facial pain starting in the and around the jaw that can radiate into you head and sinus areas. This is frequently associated with a clicking or popping at the TMJ. For this I recommend an anti-inflammatory like Naprosyn and possible dental referral for a bite guard.At this time I would not recommend taking a CT scan since your initial X rays have been negative. I would ask your doctor if any of the above problems could possible cause your headaches.Hope I answered your question.

I washed my wound under running water and also washed it with detergent soap and later with dettol. The bleeding stopped after some time.  The pup remains within the house and has no exposure to other dogs. Do I need to take any antirabies vaccinne.Please advise","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM with your medical question.Since this is your own animal and you do know for sure that it was vaccinated then the chance of rabies is very low if not non-existent. For a dog to contract rabies it must be out doors and then bite or eat an animal that has rabies. Since this is a pup I doubt it has been exposed to rabies.

We are not sure exactly what PR is or how it is transmitted but we do know that women who are pregnant have a higher incidence of PR. Some studies have had women who contract PR in their first trimester having higher spontaneous abortion and early delivery. These studies were very small and no real conclusions can be drawn. Since your exposure to the wife of a family member is already in her late 2nd trimester she and her baby are relatively safe.

A few days ago I noticed a small cyst on lobe (I have ezcema so sometimes ears get itchy) - I have assumed this is a flu but am now wondering if perhaps some kind of insect bite?","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCMI see you are concerned about having new lymph nodes appear under your left ear. Enlarged lymph nodes occur when your body is trying to protect itself from infection or insect bites. The enlargement can also be non-specific meaning they enlarge for unknown reason. Since your ear is also swollen there must be some type of irritation occurring to your ear. it could be a bug bite our it could be a small cyst which occur frequently behind the ear or it could be a small flair of your eczema.

From your discussion it appears you have had them before and treated yourself  with Zentel. Now you have a possible reinfection and that is not uncommon since there is some one in your life that maybe a carrier. It is real important to wash your hands frequently to prevent transmission.I would recommend that you be sure you have pin worms before you retreat. Rectal itching could be caused from other things like hemorrhoids, rectal fissures or proctitis. I recommend you get tested for pin worms before you treat yourself again.

This has been going on too long for a mild infection and sounds more serious. Get him to a doctor or urgent care to have an examination. He may need a chest x-ray and blood tests to diagnose this.

Recommended therapy was weight reduction to his ideal weight, a low salt diet ( What is the diagnosis for this individual?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Elevated TPR might be from an essential hypertension or secondary hypertension. Normal renin levels suggest that a secondary cause, like renal artery stenosis is excluded. Ventricular hypertrophy, retinal hemorrhage and proteinuria are caused from an untreated hypertension for a long time. I suggest you to do an ECG, a cardiac sonography, a 24 hour blood pressure monitor Holter, a renal sonography and some routine blood tests to see renal function. After doing this, you might need treatment for high blood pressure. All the best!"},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with a yeast infection before. I was treated.

It starts like a cold, with congestion and upper respiratory symptoms, and then progresses to a cough.It spreads through close contact with oral secretions and respiratory droplets. So it's easily spread through the cough, especially when people are in close contact like living in the same house with a person who has whooping cough.It can be treated with antibiotics usually erythromycin for 2 weeks.  it's important to take the doses on time to develop and maintain the appropriate antibiotic levels in the blood to clear the infection.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hello, I really hope you are able to help. About 4 months ago I got a cluster of little red bumps near the lower area of my butt. Initially I thought they were heat rash because I play a lot of sports. I thought the best thing to do would be put alochol to dry the itchy bumps up. However that seemed to make it worse. Now the cluster has spread out and is up and down my butt cheeks. The bumps are not itchy anymore, but have changed. They are now not all clustered and most are bigger like the size of a regular pimple . They also look like they are pus filled or need to pop. So, I though maybe they just need to be popped and drained. This is where I get confused. Each time I pop these pimple like bumps, not pus comes out, but something that looks like a little white bead or ball or sack. Then afterwards each bump I have popped this way bleeds like crazy. Strange thing! They dont clear up, they just keep coming back. They are not itchy, just super annoying and ugly, and wont go away. I dont know what caused this but I am an athlete and also moved to a new house recently and had sat n the bathtub and noticed the bumps in a similar location to where my cheeks would b on the tub. I just kept thinking it would go away, but its been 4 months now. Ive tried, ointment, tea tree oil, scrubs, bodywash, alochol, peroxide ...no relief","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM.The description in your query matches acne in the gluteal region.

Tiredness following a viral infection is very common and and generally takes a few days to weeks to go away. however if that is much of problem as causing you to be sleepy, I would advise you to go in for anti-asthenics such as Vitamin C formulations.

It doesn t appear swollen and isn t red.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns.It seems that your wound is healing and the white layer is fibrinous slough composed of fibrin and serum containing white cells and proteins.

Wounds heal by filling in from the bottom.Clean your wound with antibacterial solutions and not with soap & water and then  apply the antibacterial ointment (eg mupirocin topical ) & cover with a non-adherent dressing changing it every other day.  The white layer  will eventually be reabsorbed as new tissue fills in the woundRegards Dr. T.K.

The test is to examine the early morning sample of sputum for AFB for 3 consecutive days. If there is no sputum , then a morning gastric lavage is examined. An AFB smear may be done in conjunction with a molecular test for TB termed nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Both Smear and NAAT are negative then probably the lesion is inactive. Certain countries insist on sputum culutr ff the samples are negative . It takes about 6 to 8 weeks to know the result.In addition indirect tests like a high ESR, a stongly postive Mantaux ( PPD) test are indirect evidence for an active disease.Rules vary from country to country.
