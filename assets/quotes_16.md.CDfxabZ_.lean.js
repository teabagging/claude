Then a = Ad, b = Bd, c = Cd. Put t = gcd(A,B), r = gcd(B,C), s = gcd(A,C). If r, s have a common factor, then it divides all of A, B, C, contradicting the definition of d. So r, s, t are coprime in pairs. Hence A = Rst, B = rSt, C = rsT for some R, S, T which are relatively prime in pairs. Thus a = Rstd, b = rStd, c = rsTd. Now a + b = gcd(a,b) 2 implies A + B = t 2 d. Similarly, B + C = r2d, C + A = s2d. Adding, 2(A + B + C) = d(r 2 + s 2 + t 2 ). Now if any odd prime divides d, then it must divide A + B + C and A + B, B + C and C + A and hence each of A, B, C, which is impossible. Similarly, if 4 divides d, then 2 divides A, B, C, which is impossible. Hence d = 1 or 2. We can also write a + b = gcd(a,b) 2 etc as Rs + rS = td, St + sT = rd, Tr + Rt = sd. Suppose (without loss of generality) that r is the smallest of r, s, t. Then 2r ≥ rd = St + sT ≥ s + t ≥ 2r. So we must have equality throughout and hence d = 2, S = T = 1 and r = s = t. But r, s, t are coprime, so r = s = t = 1. Hence from Rs + rS = td, we have R = 1 also. Hence a = b = c = 2.

What is the largest number of moves he can make if he is starting from a cell of his own choice and is not allowed to visit any cell (including the initial cell) more than once?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - The knight alternates between a normal move and a short move.   - A normal move is a standard knight move in chess (L-shaped: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular).   - A short move is a move to any diagonally neighboring cell.   - The knight starts with a normal move.   - The knight cannot visit any cell more than once.   - The chessboard is 5 times 6.2. Constructing a Sequence of 25 Moves:   - We need to show that it is possible to construct a sequence of 25 moves.   - Since the knight starts with a normal move and alternates, the sequence will have 13 normal moves and 12 short moves.   - We can construct such a sequence by carefully planning the knight's path to ensure it does not revisit any cell.3. Proving that 26 Moves are Not Possible:   - To prove that 26 moves are not possible, we use a coloring argument.   - Color the second and fourth rows of the chessboard red.   - Note that there are 12 red cells in total (6 cells in the second row and 6 cells in the fourth row).4. Analyzing the Moves:   - Let the cells visited by the knight be denoted by 0, 1, 2, 3, ldots.   - Between moves 2k-1 and 2k, the knight makes a short move.   - A short move always lands on a diagonally neighboring cell, which means it will land on a red cell if it started from a non-red cell, and vice versa.   - Therefore, in each pair of moves (2k-1, 2k), exactly one of the two cells is red.5. Counting the Red Cells:   - Since there are only 12 red cells, the maximum number of pairs (2k-1, 2k) is 12.   - This implies that k leq 12.   - Since k represents the number of pairs, the total number of moves is 2k.   - Therefore, the maximum number of moves is 2 times 12 = 24.6.

Therefore, the slope-intercept form of line l can be written as y = frac{2}{7}x + b. However, since we are given a standard form in the solution, let's convert our understanding into that form. The line l is perpendicular to y=-frac{7}{2}x+1, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of -frac{7}{2}, which gives us a slope of frac{2}{7}. The equation of a line in standard form is Ax + By + C = 0. Given the slope is frac{2}{7}, we can express the perpendicular line as 2x - 7y + m = 0, where m is the y-intercept that we need to find.Substituting the point (3,2) into the equation 2x - 7y + m = 0, we get:[2(3) - 7(2) + m = 0][6 - 14 + m = 0][m = 8]Therefore, the equation of line l is:[2x - 7y + 8 = 0]boxed{2x - 7y + 8 = 0}# Part 2: Finding the Standard Equation of Circle CLet the center of the circle be C(t, frac{2t+8}{7}).

Given points A(6,0) and B(1,5) lie on the circle, the distances from C to A and C to B must be equal (both equal to r). Therefore, we set up the equation:[sqrt{(t-6)^2 + left(frac{2t+8}{7}right)^2} = sqrt{(t-1)^2 + left(frac{2t+8}{7} - 5right)^2}]Solving this equation for t gives t = 3. Substituting t = 3 back into the equation for the center of the circle, we find the center is at (3, 2). The radius r can be found by calculating the distance from the center to either point A or B, which gives r = sqrt{13}.Therefore, the standard equation of circle C, with center (3, 2) and radius sqrt{13}, is:[(x-3)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 13]boxed{(x-3)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 13}"},{"problem":"If the complex number z satisfies iz = sqrt{3} + i (where i is the imaginary unit), then |z| = ______.","solution":"Given that iz = sqrt{3} + i, we can solve for z by dividing both sides of the equation by i:begin{align*}z &= frac{sqrt{3} + i}{i}   &= left(frac{sqrt{3}}{i}right) + frac{i}{i}   &= frac{sqrt{3}}{i} cdot frac{i}{i} + frac{i}{i}   &= frac{sqrt{3}i}{i^2} + frac{1}{1}   &= frac{sqrt{3}i}{-1} + 1   &= -sqrt{3}i + 1.end{align*}To find the modulus of z, we apply the formula for the modulus of a complex number:begin{align*}|z| &= sqrt{(Re(z))^2 + (Im(z))^2}     &= sqrt{1^2 + (-sqrt{3})^2}     &= sqrt{1 + 3}     &= sqrt{4}     &= 2.end{align*}Thus, we conclude that |z| = boxed{2}."},{"problem":"Given that f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R}, and for x leq 0, f(x) = (x + 2)e^{-x} - 2 (where e is the base of the natural logarithm).

For each positive integer ( n ), we have ( f(n) < f(n+1) < f(n) + 2020 ).2. For each positive integer ( n ), we have ( S(f(n)) = f(S(n)) ), where ( S(n) ) is the sum of digits of ( n ) in base 10 representation.We claim that ( f(x) = x ) is the only function that satisfies the given functional equation.1. Verification that ( f(x) = x ) satisfies the conditions:   - For condition 1: ( f(n) = n ) and ( f(n+1) = n+1 ). Clearly, ( n < n+1 < n + 2020 ).   - For condition 2: ( S(f(n)) = S(n) ) and ( f(S(n)) = S(n) ). Thus, ( S(f(n)) = f(S(n)) ).2. Proof that no other solutions exist:   Claim 1: ( f(1) = 1 )   - Consider ( S(f(9)) = f(S(9)) ). Since ( S(9) = 9 ), we have ( S(f(9)) = f(9) ).   - This implies ( f(9) ) is a single-digit number.   - Given that ( f ) is strictly increasing and maps positive integers to positive integers, ( f(n) geq n ). Therefore, ( f(9) geq 9 ).   - Combining these, we get ( f(9) = 9 ).   - Since ( f ) is strictly increasing, we must have ( f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, ldots, f(8) = 8 ).   Claim 2: ( f(10^n) ) is a power of 10 for all ( n in mathbb{N} )   - Consider ( S(f(10^n)) = f(S(10^n)) ). Since ( S(10^n) = 1 ), we have ( S(f(10^n)) = f(1) = 1 ).   - This implies ( f(10^n) ) must be a power of 10.   Claim 3: For sufficiently large ( n ), ( f(10^n) = 10^n )   - Let ( f(10^n) = 10^k ) for some sufficiently large ( n ). Since ( f ) is strictly increasing, ( k geq n ).   - Consider ( m = 2 cdot 10^{frac{10^n - 1}{9}} - 1 ). Then ( S(m) = 10^n ).   - Thus, ( S(f(m)) = f(S(m)) = f(10^n) = 10^k ).   - The minimum number with a sum of digits ( 10^k ) is ( 199ldots9 ) (where 9 occurs ( frac{10^k - 1}{9} ) times), i.e., ( 2 cdot 10^{frac{10^k - 1}{9}} - 1 ).   - Therefore, ( f(m) geq 2 cdot 10^{frac{10^k - 1}{9}} - 1 ).   - If ( k > n ), then ( k geq n + 1 ). Note that ( f(t+1) < f(t) + 2020 ) and ( f(1) = 1 ) implies ( f(t) < 2020t ).   - Thus, ( 2020m > f(m) geq 2 cdot 10^{frac{10^{n+1} - 1}{9}} - 1 geq 10^{frac{10^{n+1} - 10^n}{9}} m ).   - This is clearly false for sufficiently large ( n ). Hence, our assumption that ( k > n ) was wrong. Therefore, ( k = n ).   - This proves that ( f(10^n) = 10^n ) for sufficiently large ( n ).3. Conclusion:   - Since ( f(n) = n ) for infinitely many ( n in mathbb{N} ) and ( f ) is strictly increasing, we conclude that ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = x } )."},{"problem":"A courier sets off from A towards B.

Similarly, using the cosine rule, we have:AC^2=AB^2+BC^2-2ABcdot BCcdot cos B=1+2-2=1,which implies AC=1.

Find all pairs of non-zero natural numbers (k, n) for which1!+2!+cdots+k!=1+2+cdots+n","solution":"Solution to Exercise 2 Throughout the solution, we will denote A_{k} as the expression 1!+2!+cdots+k! and B_{n} as the expression 1+2+cdots+n. As with any problem of this kind, we start by looking for potential solutions for small values of k and n. For this purpose, it is useful to recognize B_{n} as the sum of the terms of an arithmetic sequence, so that B_{n}=n(n+1) / 2. In particular, if (k, n) is a solution, we know thatn^{2} leqslant 2 B_{n}=2 A_{k}<(n+1)^{2}so that n=leftlfloorsqrt{2 A_{k}}rightrfloor.We then calculate the first few values of A_{k}: for example, when k varies from 1 to 5, A_{k} successively takes the values 1,3,9,33, and 153, and the integer n=leftlfloorsqrt{2 A_{k}}rightrfloor then successively takes the values 1,2,4,8, and 17, so that B_{n} takes the values 1,3,10,36, and 153. This initial study, although tedious towards the end, allowed us to identify three solution pairs: (k, n)=(1,1),(2,2), and (5,17).Moreover, it is difficult to compute leftlfloor 2 sqrt{A_{ell}}rightrfloor by hand when ell geqslant 6, and we need to find a more general approach when ell is large. For example, when ell leqslant k, the integer ell! divides the integer k!=A_{k}-A_{k-1}, so that A_{k} equiv A_{ell-1}(bmod ell!). We therefore undertake to study the sequence left(A_{k}right) modulo ell! or ell for small values of ell, for example when ell is a prime number.After an unfruitful study of the cases ell=2,3, and 5, we observe that k! equiv 1,2,6,3,1,6 (bmod 7) when k varies from 1 to 6, and thus that A_{k} equiv A_{6} equiv 1+2+6+3+1+6 equiv 5 (bmod 7) when k geqslant 6. On the other hand, B_{n} equiv 1,3,6,3,1,0,0 (bmod 7) when n varies from 1 to 7. Since 2 is invertible modulo 7, we know that B_{n} (bmod 7) depends only on n (bmod 7). This means in particular that B_{n} not equiv 5 equiv A_{k} (bmod 7) as soon as k geqslant 6 and n geqslant 1, proving at the same time that (k, n) is not a solution.In conclusion, the solutions are the pairs (k, n)=(1,1),(2,2), and (5,17).Examiner's Comment The problem was rather difficult and was well approached. However, some candidates did not look for solutions or missed the solution (5,17): it is important not to hesitate to spend time on these initial proofs, which also help to build intuition. Here, once the solution (5,17) was found, one could observe that any modulus dividing 5! would not allow progress towards the solution. It was therefore necessary to look for a modulus not dividing 5!; here 7 was the easiest modulus, but 13 and 25 also worked."},{"problem":"VII.3.

The minimum value of this sum occurs when x is the midpoint between -3 and 2. That is, when x = frac{2 - (-3)}{2} = frac{5}{2}. At this point, the sum of the distances is exactly the distance between -3 and 2, which is 5.We would like this minimum sum to always be greater than or equal to a^2 - 4a. This can be expressed as an inequality:5 geq a^2 - 4a.To find when this inequality is true, we solve for a. This is a quadratic inequality, and we can rewrite it as:a^2 - 4a - 5 leq 0.This quadratic equation factors as:(a - 5)(a + 1) leq 0.The solution to this type of inequality involves finding the intervals where the quadratic expression is less than or equal to zero. These intervals are determined by the roots of the quadratic equation, which in this case are a = 5 and a = -1. The quadratic expression will change sign at these points.Since the expression (a - 5)(a + 1) produces a positive result for values of a that are less than -1 or greater than 5, and a negative result for values of a between -1 and 5, the inequality holds for -1 leq a leq 5.Hence, the range of values for a is:boxed{[-1, 5]}"},{"problem":"202. Indicate the number of steps sufficient to assert with an error probability not exceeding 0.001 that the reduced speed of the chip is less than 0.01.Let us recall now that each movement of the chip is conditioned by the result of tossing a coin. If, in n tosses of the coin, heads appear l times and tails appear n-l times, the chip will make l steps to the right and n-l steps to the left and will end up at the pointl-(n-l)=2 l-nThe reduced speed of the chip over n steps will be expressed by the absolute value of the ratiofrac{2 l-n}{n}=2 frac{l}{n}-1The fraction frac{l}{n} characterizes the frequency of heads appearing.Suppose a certain allowable error probability is given. As we know, for large values of n, it can be asserted with practical certainty that the reduced speed is close to zero. From expression (8), it is clear that if the reduced speed is small, then 2 frac{l}{n} is approximately equal to 1 and, consequently, the frequency frac{l}{n} is close to frac{1}{2}. Thus:If a coin is tossed a large number of times, it is practically certain that the frequency of heads appearing will be close to frac{1}{2}.Roughly speaking, it is practically certain that heads will appear in about half of the cases. A more precise formulation states:Choose an arbitrary allowable error probability varepsilon and specify any arbitrarily small number alpha.

First, prove that as long as each step involves the operation on the smallest two numbers on the blackboard, the final remaining number can reach its maximum value. We denote the operation on numbers (a) and (b) on the blackboard as (a * b = ab + 1). Suppose at some step, the operation is not performed on the smallest two numbers (x) and (y), then before (x) and (y) \\"meet,\\" they have already \\"met\\" with some (a_i, b_j) respectively, and these numbers (a_i, b_j) are all greater than (x) and (y). That is, (a = left(left(cdotsleft(x * a_{1}right) * a_{2}right) cdots * a_{k}right) = a_{1} a_{2} cdots a_{k}left(x + frac{1}{a_{1}} + frac{1}{a_{1} a_{2}} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{1} a_{2} cdots a_{k}}right)), (b = left(left(cdots(y * b_{1}) * b_{2}right) cdots * b_{n}right) = b_{1} b_{2} cdots b_{n}left(y + frac{1}{b_{1}} + frac{1}{b_{1} b_{2}} + cdots + frac{1}{b_{1} b_{2} cdots b_{n}}right)). Let (u = frac{1}{a_{2}} + frac{1}{a_{2} a_{3}} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{2} a_{3} cdots a_{k}}), (v = frac{1}{b_{1}} + frac{1}{b_{1} b_{2}} + cdots + frac{1}{b_{1} b_{2} cdots b_{n}}). Thus, (a = a_{2} a_{3} cdots a_{k}left(a_{1} x + 1 + uright)), (b = b_{1} b_{2} cdots b_{n}(y + v)). Without loss of generality, assume (y < x).

Since (y < x), we have (y a_{1} x + y + y u + 1 < x b_{1} y + x + x v + 1), which means the exchange results in a larger final remaining number. This proves the initial claim. Therefore, as long as each operation is performed on the smallest two numbers on the blackboard, the maximum possible value can be obtained. Thus, after 64 steps, the blackboard has 64 twos; after another 32 steps, the blackboard has 32 fives; continuing this process, we get 16 twenty-sixes, 8 five hundred seventy-sevens, 4 three hundred thirty-two thousand nine hundred thirty, 2 numbers with the last digit being 1, and finally, we get a maximum number with the last digit being 2."},{"problem":"\\"(x-1)(x+2)=0\\" is a __________ condition for \\"x=1\\".A: Sufficient but not necessaryB: Necessary but not sufficientC: Necessary and sufficientD: Neither sufficient nor necessary","solution":"From (x-1)(x+2)=0, we get x=1 or x=-2,Thus, \\"(x-1)(x+2)=0\\" is a necessary but not sufficient condition for \\"x=1\\",Therefore, the answer is: boxed{B}This question mainly tests the judgment of necessary and sufficient conditions.

Therefore, if we swap blue balls from the box with more balls with red balls from the box with fewer balls, the total percentage of blue balls in the boxes will increase.

If there is a line through which more than two of the given planes pass, then the number of regions formed is 8 - if the four planes pass through the same line -, or 12, if one of the planes intersects the common line of the other three planes.If there is no such line, then by translating one of the planes in parallel, a new - bounded - region is created: the interior of a tetrahedron whose four faces are the translated plane and the other three planes.The faces of this tetrahedron divide the space into 15 regions, since one region is connected to each vertex (4), edge (6), and face (4), and the 15th region is the interior of the tetrahedron.By translating the translated plane back to its original position, this bounded region disappears, and the unbounded regions remain, so we get that the four planes divide the space into at most 14 regions.Tóth Szilveszter (Tata, Eötvös J. Gymn., 11th grade)II. solution. Let's examine how the number of regions changes when adding an (n+1)-th plane to n planes. This plane intersects each of the existing n planes in a line; these n lines pass through the common point (points) of the planes, and the (n+1)-th plane is divided into at most 2n regions. Each of these regions defines exactly one new region, so the number of regions increases by at most 2n with the addition of the (n+1)-th plane. This is possible if there are no identical lines among the n lines, and at most two of the given planes pass through any line in space.Based on the above result, we get the following table:| number of planes (n) | number of regions || :---: | :---: || 1 | 2 || 2 | 2+2 cdot 1= || 3 | 4+2 cdot 2= || 4 | 8+2 cdot 3= |According to these, if four planes pass through a point, they divide the space into at most 14 regions.Remarks. 1. The first solution can also be explained more vividly: consider a tetrahedron, or the 15 regions into which its faces divide the space. If we move \\"very far\\" from the tetrahedron, it \\"shrinks to a point,\\" while the 14 unbounded regions remain, so the answer to the problem is 14.2. We can also reach the goal with another method. Draw a sphere around the common point of the planes. Each plane intersects the sphere in a great circle, which divides the sphere's surface into regions. Each region corresponds to exactly one such domain on the sphere's surface.The question, then, is how many regions 4 great circles divide the sphere's surface into. If we project the sphere onto a plane tangent to the sphere at a point P through which no circle passes, it is known that the image of the sphere's surface is the entire plane, and the image of the circles is a circle. Thus, we have reformulated the original question: into how many regions does the plane divide at most by 4 circles. The two problems are therefore equivalent, and the latter form is much better known.3.

For the thousands digit 6, 7, 8, or 9, the hundreds digit cannot be 4 greater. Only when the thousands digit is 4 or 5, both the 4 less and 4 greater hundreds digit are possible.Similarly, for the hundreds digits 0, 1, 2, only the 3 greater tens digit is possible, and for 7, 8, 9, only the 3 less tens digit is possible, while for the hundreds digits 3, 4, 5, 6, both possibilities exist.Therefore, there are exactly the following possibilities for combining the first three digits of the sought numbers:158,152,269,263,374,403,485,514,596,625,730,736,841,847,958,952Since in each of these 16 combinations, exactly three different digits appear, there are always 7 possibilities for the missing units digit.

Invariant Property:   Notice that:   [   x_{n+1}^2 + y_{n+1}^2 = (x_n cos y_n - y_n sin y_n)^2 + (x_n sin y_n + y_n cos y_n)^2   ]   Expanding both terms:   [   = x_n^2 cos^2 y_n - 2x_n y_n cos y_n sin y_n + y_n^2 sin^2 y_n + x_n^2 sin^2 y_n + 2x_n y_n cos y_n sin y_n + y_n^2 cos^2 y_n   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   = x_n^2 (cos^2 y_n + sin^2 y_n) + y_n^2 (sin^2 y_n + cos^2 y_n)   ]   Using the Pythagorean identity (cos^2 y_n + sin^2 y_n = 1):   [   = x_n^2 + y_n^2   ]   Therefore, ( x_{n+1}^2 + y_{n+1}^2 = x_n^2 + y_n^2 ).

Limit Analysis:   Assume (lim_{n to infty} x_n = a) and (lim_{n to infty} y_n = b). Taking limits in the recurrence relations:   [   a = a cos b - b sin b   ]   [   b = a sin b + b cos b   ]3. Solving the System:   From the first equation:   [   a = a cos b - b sin b implies a(1 - cos b) = b sin b   ]   From the second equation:   [   b = a sin b + b cos b implies b(1 - cos b) = a sin b   ]   If ( b neq 0 ), then dividing the two equations:   [   frac{a(1 - cos b)}{b(1 - cos b)} = frac{b sin b}{a sin b} implies frac{a}{b} = frac{b}{a} implies a^2 = b^2   ]   Since ( x_n^2 + y_n^2 = 1 ), we have ( a^2 + b^2 = 1 ). Combining these, we get:   [   2a^2 = 1 implies a^2 = frac{1}{2} implies a = pm frac{1}{sqrt{2}}   ]   However, this contradicts the earlier assumption that ( x_n ) and ( y_n ) are bounded by 1. Therefore, ( b = 0 ).4. Conclusion:   If ( b = 0 ), then:   [   a = a cos 0 - 0 sin 0 implies a = a   ]   and:   [   0 = a sin 0 + 0 cos 0 implies 0 = 0   ]   Thus, ( a ) must satisfy ( a^2 = 1 ), so ( a = pm 1 ).5. Behavior of ( x_n ):   To determine whether ( x_n ) converges to 1 or -1, consider the behavior of ( x_n ):   [   x_{n+1} = x_n cos y_n - y_n sin y_n   ]   If ( x_n geq 0 ), then:   [   x_n - x_{n+1} = x_n - (x_n cos y_n - y_n sin y_n) = x_n (1 - cos y_n) + y_n sin y_n geq 0   ]   This implies ( x_n ) is non-increasing and bounded below by -1. If ( x_n < 0 ), then:   [   x_{n+1} = x_n cos y_n - y_n sin y_n leq 0   ]   Thus, ( x_n ) remains negative if it ever becomes negative. Therefore, ( x_n ) cannot converge to 1, and must converge to -1.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ lim_{n to infty} x_n = -1 } ) and (lim_{n to infty} y_n = 0)."},{"problem":"## 143.

Analyzing the Condition:   The condition states that the three squares ((i,k)), ((j,k)), and ((j,l)) must have distinct colors. This implies that for any fixed (k), the squares in the same row (k) and different columns (i) and (j) must have different colors. Similarly, for any fixed (j), the squares in the same column (j) and different rows (k) and (l) must have different colors.3. Coloring Strategy:   To satisfy the condition, we need to ensure that no two squares in the same row or column share the same color. This suggests that we need a distinct color for each diagonal of the grid.4. Counting the Diagonals:   In an (n times n) grid, there are (2n-1) diagonals.

The rows of placed squares always start from the square below the leftmost square of the first row (see example).

Clearly, if n_{1} geq n_{2} geq ldots geq n_{m} geq 0 does not hold, then there is no filling of the \\"table\\" and therefore fleft(n_{1}, n_{2}, ldots, n_{m}right)=0, i.e., (1) holds, and since in a row of n squares the numbers from 1 to n in increasing order can be written in a unique way, (4) must hold.

Moreover, if two or more rows have the same number of squares, then the number n can only be at the far right in the last of these rows.

First note that a=0 satisfies the problem condition (for example, the equation is satisfied by the function f(x) equiv 0).Now suppose a neq 0.Lemma. f(y)=f(z) if and only if [y]=[z].Suppose f(y)=f(z) for some y, z. Then the given equation implies f(x)+a[y]=f(x-f(y))=f(x-f(z))=f(x)+a[z] whence [y]=[z]. Conversely, if [y]=[z] then f(x-f(y))=f(x)+a[y]=f(x)+a[z=f(x-f(z))]. It follows from previous observation that [x-f(y)]=[x-f(z)] for all x. Set x=frac{f(y)+f(z)}{2}, then left[frac{f(y)-f(z)}{2}right]=left[-frac{f(y)-f(z)}{2}right], so f(y)=f(z). The lemma is proved.Now we claim that f(m) in mathbb{Z} for any m in mathbb{Z}. Setting y=m in the given equation we obtain f(x-f(m))=f(x)+ am for any m in mathbb{Z}, x in mathbb{R}. Suppose that f(m) notin mathbb{Z} for some m in mathbb{Z}. Choose t in(0,1) such that [f(m)]=[f(m)+t]. Then for x=0 we have f(-f(m))=f(0)+ am and for x=-t we have f(-t-f(m))=f(-t)+a m. Using the lemma we have f(-f(m))=f(-t-f(m)), so f(0)=f(-t)=f(-1), which contradicts the lemma.From now on we will use in the given equation f(x-f(y))=f(x)+a y (1) only integer numbers x, y. Setting y=1 in (1) we obtain that a in mathbb{Z}. Further, for y=0 we have f(x-f(0))=f(x) and therefore x-f(0)=x (by lemma), whence f(0)=0. Now set x=f(y), then f(f(y))=-a y (2); replacing y by f(y) in (1) we get f(x+a y)=f(x)+a f(y) (3). Denoting f(1) by n and setting y=1 in (3) we obtain f(x+a)=f(x)+a n (4).

In the equation from the assignment1000 a+100 b+10 c+d=20(10 a+b)+16(10 c+d)the unknown digits a and b have larger coefficients on the left side, while the digits c and d have larger coefficients on the right side. Therefore, we rearrange the equation to the form 800 a+80 b=150 c+15 d, which after dividing by five and factoring out the smaller coefficients on both sides, can be rewritten as 16(10 a+b)=3(10 c+d). From the coprimality of the numbers 3 and 16, it follows that 10 c+d is a two-digit multiple of 16. However, this must be greater than 48, since 3 cdot 48=144, while 16(10 a+b) geqq 160 (the digit a must be non-zero). Therefore, the possible values for 10 c+d are only the multiples of 16 equal to 64, 80, and 96, which determine the digits c and d. Substituting into the equation 16(10a+ +b)=3(10 c+d), we get the values 12, 15, and 18 for the two-digit number 10 a+b.Answer: The numbers that satisfy the condition are 1264, 1580, and 1896.Note: Instead of the four unknown digits a, b, c, d, we can use the notation of the equation from the assignment directly with the two two-digit numbers x=overline{a b} and y=overline{c d}. The equation will then have the form 100 x+y=20 x+16 y, which we can similarly rearrange to 80 x=15 y or 16 x=3 y. Now, instead of the relation 16 mid y, we can use a similar consequence 3 mid x and realize that from the estimate y leqq 99 it follows that 16 x leqq 3 cdot 99=297, from which x leqq 18, which together with the estimate x geqq 10 leads to the possible values x in{12,15,18}.

We need to determine the sum of all possible positive integers ( n ) such that the product of their digits equals ( n^2 - 15n - 27 ).2. First, consider the case where ( n ) is a one-digit number. For one-digit numbers, ( n ) ranges from 1 to 9. However, for these values, ( n^2 - 15n - 27 ) will be negative or zero, which cannot be the product of digits (since the product of digits must be a non-negative integer). Therefore, ( n ) must be a two-digit number.3. Let ( n = 10a + b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are the digits of ( n ). The product of the digits is ( ab ). We need to solve the equation:   [   ab = (10a + b)^2 - 15(10a + b) - 27   ]4. Expanding and simplifying the right-hand side:   [   ab = (10a + b)^2 - 15(10a + b) - 27   ]   [   ab = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2 - 150a - 15b - 27   ]   [   ab = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2 - 150a - 15b - 27   ]5. Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving ( a ) and ( b ):   [   0 = 100a^2 + 19ab + b^2 - 150a - 15b - 27   ]6. Notice that if ( a geq 2 ), the left side (product of digits) is positive, but the right side becomes negative, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( a = 1 ).7. Substitute ( a = 1 ) into the equation:   [   b = (10 cdot 1 + b)^2 - 15(10 cdot 1 + b) - 27   ]   [   b = (10 + b)^2 - 150 - 15b - 27   ]   [   b = 100 + 20b + b^2 - 150 - 15b - 27   ]   [   b = b^2 + 5b - 77   ]8. Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:   [   b^2 + 4b - 77 = 0   ]9. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula ( b = frac{-B pm sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} ):   [   b = frac{-4 pm sqrt{16 + 308}}{2}   ]   [   b = frac{-4 pm sqrt{324}}{2}   ]   [   b = frac{-4 pm 18}{2}   ]10. This gives two solutions for ( b ):    [    b = frac{14}{2} = 7 quad text{and} quad b = frac{-22}{2} = -11    ]11. Since ( b ) must be a digit (0-9), the only valid solution is ( b = 7 ).12.

We conjecture that the last two digits of the powers of 9 form a period of 10. Since the last two digits of a power of 9 can be obtained by multiplying the last two digits of the previous power by 9 and taking the last two digits of the result, if two powers of 9 have the same last two digits, then the next ones will also have the same last two digits. Thus, the last two digits of the 12th and 2nd powers are the same, ... the last two digits of the 10th and 20th powers are the same, and so the 20th power also ends in 01. Therefore, the last two digits of the powers of 9 indeed form a period of 10. According to this, to find the last two digits of 9^{h}, it is sufficient to know the last digit of h=8^{varrho}, i.e., the remainder when h is divided by 10.

Thus, to determine the last digit of 8^{g}, it is sufficient to know the remainder when g=7^{f} is divided by 4. Since f=6^{e} and e=0, f will be an even number: f=2 f^{prime}. Thus, g=7^{2 f^{prime}}=49 f^{prime}, and hence g-1=49^{f^{prime}}-1=49^{f^{prime}}-1^{f^{prime}} is divisible by (49-1)=48, and thus also by 4, so g gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. From (2), we see that the last digit of 8^{g} is the same as the last digit of 8^{1}. Thus, this digit is 8, so the last digit of h=8^{g} is 8. According to (1), in this case the last two digits of 9^{h} are the same as the last two digits of 9^{8}, which are 21.Therefore, the last two digits of 9^{h} are 21.Imre Nagy (Szombathely, Lajos Nagy Gymnasium, 2nd grade)Remark.

There are two ways to arrange A and B within this entity because either A can stand next to B or B can stand next to A. This gives us A_2^2 = 2 ways to arrange them internally.Step 2: Now, excluding students A, B, and C, we are left with three students. These three students can be arranged in any order among themselves. This means we have A_3^3 = 3! = 6 ways to arrange these three students.Step 3: We then need to find the correct spots to insert student C, ensuring C is not next to A or B. Given we've grouped A and B together and have three other students placed, this effectively gives us five distinct positions (before the AB entity, between the three other students, and after the AB entity) to insert C. However, since C cannot be next to A or B, we exclude the positions directly next to the AB entity, leaving us with three valid positions for C. Therefore, there are A_4^2 = 4! / (4-2)! = 12 ways to arrange these positions, specifically considering the positions available for C and the other students around AB.Combining these steps, the total number of different ways the students can stand, considering the constraints, is calculated by multiplying the number of ways to achieve each step:A_3^3 times A_4^2 times A_2^2 = 6 times 12 times 2 = 144.Hence, the total number of different ways the students can stand, respecting the given conditions, is boxed{144}."},{"problem":"267. x+sqrt{x^{2}-x}=2.Задача из собрания примеров на латинском языке из той же рукописи.","solution":"267. sqrt{x^{2}-x}=2-x ; quad x^{2}-x=4+x^{2}-4 x ; quad 3 x=4; x=frac{4}{3}"},{"problem":"Keiko tosses one penny and Ephraim tosses two pennies.

(Round the result to two decimal places.)","solution":"To calculate the probability of selecting at least one second-class product when picking 4 products, it's easier to use the complementary probability method. This means we'll first calculate the probability of picking only first-class products (no second-class products) and then subtract that probability from 1.Let the probability of picking only first-class products be P(text{all first-class}). To find this probability, consider that for each of the 4 draws, we are only selecting from the first-class products.For the first pick, we have a frac{90}{100} chance of getting a first-class product.For the second pick, since we've already taken one first-class product out, we have a frac{89}{99} chance.For the third pick, the chance is frac{88}{98}.And for the fourth pick, it becomes frac{87}{97}.The probability of picking all first-class products in all 4 draws is the product of these individual probabilities: P(text{all first-class}) = frac{90}{100} times frac{89}{99} times frac{88}{98} times frac{87}{97} Calculating the above product, we get: P(text{all first-class}) = left(frac{90}{100}right) times left(frac{89}{99}right) times left(frac{88}{98}right) times left(frac{87}{97}right) = left(frac{9}{10}right) times left(frac{89}{99}right) times left(frac{88}{98}right) times left(frac{87}{97}right) We can simplify this by canceling out common factors: P(text{all first-class}) = left(frac{9}{10}right) times left(frac{1}{11}right) times left(frac{88}{98}right) times left(frac{87}{97}right) Finally, we multiply these fractions to get P(text{all first-class}).Now, the probability of selecting at least one second-class product is 1 - P(text{all first-class}).Let's compute the exact values: P(text{all first-class}) = left(frac{9}{10}right) times left(frac{1}{11}right) times left(frac{44}{49}right) times left(frac{29}{97}right) = 0.6505... Thus, the probability of having at least one second-class product is: P(text{at least one second-class}) = 1 - P(text{all first-class})  P(text{at least one second-class}) = 1 - 0.6505...  P(text{at least one second-class}) approx 1 - 0.65  P(text{at least one second-class}) = 0.35 So, the requested probability, rounded to two decimal places, is (boxed{0.35})."},{"problem":"Example 9 Let f(x) be defined for x>0, f(2)=1, f(xy)=f(x)+f(y), and the necessary and sufficient condition for f(x)>f(y) to hold is x>y>0.

Find the remainder when N is divided by 1000.","solution":"Solution 1Be wary of \\"position\\" versus \\"number\\" in the solution!Each POSITION in the 30-position permutation is uniquely defined by an ordered triple (i, j, k). The nth position is defined by this ordered triple where i is n mod 2, j is n mod 3, and k is n mod 5. There are 2 choices for i, 3 for j, and 5 for k, yielding 2 cdot 3 cdot 5=30 possible triples. Because the least common multiple of 2, 3, and 5 is 30, none of these triples are repeated and all are used. By the conditions of the problem, if i is the same in two different triples, then the two numbers in these positions must be equivalent mod 2. If j is the same, then the two numbers must be equivalent mod 3, and if k is the same, the two numbers must be equivalent mod 5. Take care to note that that doesn't mean that the number 1 has to have 1 mod 2! It's that the POSITION which NUMBER 1 occupies has 1 mod 2!The ordered triple (or position) in which 1 can be placed has 2 options for i, 3 for j, and 5 for k, resulting in 30 different positions of placement.The ordered triple where 2 can be placed in is somewhat constrained by the placement of 1. Because 1 is not equivalent to 2 in terms of mod 2, 3, or 5, the i, j, and k in their ordered triples must be different. Thus, for the number 2, there are (2-1) choices for i, (3-1) choices for j, and (5-1) choices for k. Thus, there are 1*2*4=8 possible placements for the number two once the number one is placed.Because 3 is equivalent to 1 mod 2, it must have the same i as the ordered triple of 1. Because 3 is not equivalent to 1 or 2 in terms of mod 3 or 5, it must have different j and k values. Thus, there is 1 choice for i, (2-1) choices for j, and (4-1) choices for k, for a total of 1cdot 1 cdot 3=3 choices for the placement of 3.As above, 4 is even, so it must have the same value of i as 2. It is also 1 mod 3, so it must have the same j value of 1. 4 is not equivalent to 1, 2, or 3 mod 5, so it must have a different k value than that of 1, 2, and 3. Thus, there is 1 choice for i, 1 choice for j, and (3-1) choices for k, yielding a total of 1 cdot 1 cdot 2=2 possible placements for 4.5 is odd and is equivalent to 2 mod 3, so it must have the same i value as 1 and the same j value of 2. 5 is not equivalent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 mod 5, so it must have a different k value from 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, 4 different values of k are held by these four numbers, so 5 must hold the one remaining value. Thus, only one possible triple is found for the placement of 5.All numbers from 6 to 30 are also fixed in this manner. All values of i, j, and k have been used, so every one of these numbers will have a unique triple for placement, as above with the number five. Thus, after 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been placed, the rest of the permutation is fixed. Thus, N = 30 cdot 8 cdot 3 cdot 2=30 cdot 48=1440. Thus, the remainder when N is divided by 1000 is boxed{440}.Solution 2We observe that the condition on the permutations means that two numbers with indices congruent mod m are themselves congruent mod m for m in { 2,3,5}. Furthermore, suppose that a_n equiv k mod m. Then, there are 30/m indices congruent to n mod m, and 30/m numbers congruent to k mod m, because 2, 3, and 5 are all factors of 30. Therefore, since every index congruent to n must contain a number congruent to k, and no number can appear twice in the permutation, only the indices congruent to n contain numbers congruent to k. In other words, a_i equiv a_j mod m iff i equiv j mod m. But it is not necessary that textcolor{red}{(a_iequiv i)cup (a_jequiv j)mod m}. In fact, if that were the case, there would only be one way to assign the indices, since 2,3,5 are relatively prime to each other and 30=text{lcm}(2,3,5): {a_1,a_2,dots a_{30}}in{1,2,dots 30}text{ }respectively.This tells us that in a valid permutation, the congruence classes mod m are simply swapped around, and if the set S is a congruence class mod m for m = 2, 3, or 5, the set { a_i vert i in S } is still a congruence class mod m. Clearly, each valid permutation of the numbers 1 through 30 corresponds to exactly one permutation of the congruence classes modulo 2, 3, and 5. Also, if we choose some permutations of the congruence classes modulo 2, 3, and 5, they correspond to exactly one valid permutation of the numbers 1 through 30. This can be shown as follows: First of all, the choice of permutations of the congruence classes gives us every number in the permutation modulo 2, 3, and 5, so by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it gives us every number mod 2cdot 3cdot 5 = 30. Because the numbers must be between 1 and 30 inclusive, it thus uniquely determines what number goes in each index. Furthermore, two different indices cannot contain the same number. We will prove this by contradiction, calling the indices a_i and a_j for i neq j. If a_i=a_j, then they must have the same residues modulo 2, 3, and 5, and so i equiv j modulo 2, 3, and 5. Again using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we conclude that i equiv j mod 30, so because i and j are both between 1 and 30 inclusive, i = j, giving us a contradiction. Therefore, every choice of permutations of the congruence classes modulo 2, 3, and 5 corresponds to exactly one valid permutation of the numbers 1 through 30.In other words, each set of assignment from a_jrightarrow jmod (2,3,5) determines a unique string of 30 numbers. For example:left[(0,1)rightarrow (1,0)right]capleft[(0,1,2)rightarrow (0,2,1)right]capleft[(0,1,2,3,4)rightarrow (4,2,3,0,1)right]:[begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} hline 2&1&0&1&0&1&0&1&0&1&0&1&0&1&0&1&0&1&0&1&0&1&0&1&0&1&0&1&0&1&0 hline 3&0&2&1&0&2&1&0&2&1&0&2&1&0&2&1&0&2&1&0&2&1&0&2&1&0&2&1&0&2&1 hline 5&4&2&3&0&1&4&2&3&0&1&4&2&3&0&1&4&2&3&0&1&4&2&3&0&1&4&2&3&0&1 hlinehline 30&9&2&13&0&11&4&27&8&25&6&29&22&3&20&1&24&17&28&15&26&19&12&23&10&21&14&7&18&5&16 hline end{array}]We have now established a bijection between valid permutations of the numbers 1 through 30 and permutations of the congruence classes modulo 2, 3, and 5, so N is equal to the number of permutations of congruence classes. There are always m congruence classes mod m, so N = 2! cdot 3! cdot 5! = 2 cdot 6 cdot 120 = 1440 equiv framebox[1.3width]{440} mod 1000.Solution 3 (2-sec solve)Note that 30=2cdot 3cdot 5. Since gcd(2, 3, 5)=1, by CRT, for each value k=0ldots 29 modulo 30 there exists a unique ordered triple of values (a, b, c) such that kequiv apmod{2}, kequiv bpmod{3}, and kequiv cpmod{5}. Therefore, we can independently assign the residues modulo 2, 3, 5, so N=2!cdot 3!cdot 5!=1440, and the answer is boxed{440}.-TheUltimate123Solution 4( Better explanation of Solution 3)First let's look at the situation when m is equal to 2. It isn't too difficult to see the given conditions are satisfied iff the sequences  S_1 = a_1,a_3,a_5,a_7... and S_2 =a_2,a_4,a_6... each are assigned either equiv 0 pmod 2 or equiv 1 pmod 2. Another way to say this is each element in the sequence a_1,a_3,a_5,a_7... would be the same mod 2, and similarly for the other sequence. There are 2! = 2 ways to assign the mods to the sequences.Now when m is equal to 3, the sequences are T_1 = a_1, a_4,a_7.., T_2 = a_2,a_5,a_8,a_11..., and T_3 = a_3,a_6,a_9.... Again, for each sequence, all of its elements are congruent either 0,1, or 2 mod 3. There are 3! = 6 ways to assign the mods to the sequences.Finally do the same thing for m = 5. There are 5! ways. In total there are 2 * 6*120 = 1440 and the answer is boxed{440}.Why does this method work? Its due to CRT.-MathLegend27Note: the explanation is not complete without mentioning that 2*3*5 = 30, therefore CRT guarantees there is only 1 permutation for every combination of mod selections. If the problem asked for permutations of {1,2,...,60}, the answer would have been 2!3!5!2!2!2!. -Mathdummy"},{"problem":"Example 4.

Solve the differential equation for ( x(t) ):   The differential equation for ( x(t) ) is:   [   x'' - 4x' + 5x = 10   ]   The characteristic equation is:   [   r^2 - 4r + 5 = 0   ]   Solving for ( r ):   [   r = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 20}}{2} = 2 pm i   ]   Thus, the general solution for the homogeneous equation is:   [   x_h(t) = e^{2t}(A cos t + B sin t)   ]   For the particular solution, we assume a constant solution ( x_p = C ):   [   0 - 0 + 5C = 10 implies C = 2   ]   Therefore, the general solution is:   [   x(t) = e^{2t}(A cos t + B sin t) + 2   ]3. Determine the constants ( A ) and ( B ) using initial conditions:   Given ( x(0) = 0 ):   [   x(0) = A + 2 = 0 implies A = -2   ]   To find ( B ), we use ( x'(0) ). First, compute ( x'(t) ):   [   x'(t) = 2e^{2t}(A cos t + B sin t) + e^{2t}(-A sin t + B cos t)   ]   At ( t = 0 ):   [   x'(0) = 2A + B = -4 + B   ]   From the initial condition ( x'(0) = x(0) + y(0) - 3 = -3 ):   [   -4 + B = -3 implies B = 1   ]   Thus, the solution for ( x(t) ) is:   [   x(t) = e^{2t}(-2 cos t + sin t) + 2   ]4. Find ( y(t) ) using ( x(t) ):   From ( y = x' - x + 3 ):   [   x'(t) = 2e^{2t}(-2 cos t + sin t) + e^{2t}(2 sin t + cos t)   ]   Simplify:   [   x'(t) = e^{2t}(-4 cos t + 2 sin t + 2 sin t + cos t) = e^{2t}(-3 cos t + 4 sin t)   ]   Therefore:   [   y(t) = e^{2t}(-3 cos t + 4 sin t) - e^{2t}(-2 cos t + sin t) + 3   ]   Simplify:   [   y(t) = e^{2t}(-3 cos t + 4 sin t + 2 cos t - sin t) + 3 = e^{2t}(- cos t + 3 sin t) + 3   ]The final answer is ( boxed{ x(t) = e^{2t}(-2 cos t + sin t) + 2 } ) and ( y(t) = e^{2t}(- cos t + 3 sin t) + 3 )."},{"problem":"2.

The task is to ensure that, despite the erroneous digits, the number turns out to be correct.If two digits are known, then the third digit is uniquely determined.

No matter what the first one is, the second is uniquely determined: the event \\"the erroneous number is correct\\" is favorable only for one value of the second digit out of nine possible erroneous ones. Therefore, if two erroneous digits are fixed, the number will be correct with a probability of r_{2}=frac{1}{9}.Let's explain this with an example. Suppose in the number 376 errors occurred, for definiteness, in the 2nd and 3rd digits. Suppose the 2nd digit became the digit 5 by mistake. Then we get the number 35 mathrm{~A}, where A can take one of 9 values (all except 6) with equal chances.

No matter what the first erroneous digit is, the event \\"the number will be correct\\" is favorable for 8 values of the second digit out of 9 equally possible erroneous values, and for the third digit - only 1 out of 9. Therefore, r_{3}=frac{8}{9} cdot frac{1}{9}.Let's explain this again with an example. Suppose in the number 376 the first digit became the digit 2 by mistake. Then we get the number 2 mathrm{AB}. The digit A is erroneous, so A can take any of 9 values (all digits except 7) with equal chances. But if A takes the value 6, the number will be correct only if mathrm{B}=6, but this is impossible because mathrm{B} is also an erroneous digit and cannot equal 6.

Since every fourth digit must be congruent modulo 5, we have:   [   a_1 equiv a_4 equiv a_7 equiv ldots pmod{5}   ]   However, since all digits are distinct and there are only 5 possible remainders when divided by 5 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), having more than 5 digits would force a repetition of remainders, contradicting the distinctness of the digits.

Just like in the usual Pascal's triangle, each element here is the sum of the elements directly above it, according to the addition table modulo 2: 0+0=0, 0+1=1, 1+0=1, 1+1 = 0. The drawn horizontal lines divide this triangle into layers:- layer W_0 consisting of row number 0,- layer W_1 consisting of row number 1,- layer W_2 consisting of rows number 2 and 3,- layer W_3 consisting of rows number 4, 5, 6, 7,- ldots- layer W_j consisting of rows with numbers from 2^{j-1} to 2^j-1- ldotsWe will prove by induction that in any layer W_j there are two disjoint triangles, each identical to the triangle formed by the layers W_0, W_1, ldots, W_{j-1}, and that these two triangles are separated by an inverted triangle composed entirely of zeros; the top row of the layer consists of extreme ones and zeros, and the bottom row of the layer consists of all ones.For j = 1, 2, 3, this is visible from the diagrams (the diagonal lines define the division into the triangles mentioned). Assume the above relationships are true for some j and consider the layer W_{j+1}. By the induction hypothesis, the last row of layer W_j has the form 111ldots 111, and thus, according to the addition rule given above, the first row of layer W_{j+1} has the form 100ldots 001. The extreme ones of this row give rise to two new copies of Pascal's triangle, and between them are zeros. Layer W_{j+1} has as many rows as the layers W_0, W_1, ldots, W_j taken together, so at the base of each of these two triangles at the bottom of layer W_{j+1} will be the same pattern of digits as in the last row of layer W_j, i.e., a row of ones. They will fill the last row of layer W_{j+1}. This completes the proof of the inductive thesis.The number p_n defined in the problem is the ratio of the number of zeros in the rows numbered from 0 to 2^n to the number of all elements in these rows. These rows cover the layers W_0, W_1, ldots, W_n and the first row of layer W_{n+1}. From the relationship proved above, it follows that in the sum of layers W_0, ldots, W_j there are three times as many ones as in the sum of layers W_0, ldots, W_{j-1} (j = 1, 2, 3, ldots), and since there is one one in layer W_0, there are 3^n ones in the sum of layers W_0, ldots, W_n. Adding to this the two extreme ones of the next row, we see that there are a_n = 3^n + 2 ones in the considered fragment of Pascal's triangle. The total number of elements in this fragment is b_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + (2^n + 1) = (2^n + 1)(2^n + 2) / 2, and thus there are b_n - a_n zeros.

What is the minimum number of moves required to make the number of coins in all stacks equal?","solution":"Answer: 11.Solution. Suppose N moves were made, after which the number of coins in all stacks became equal.Let's slightly change the rules. Suppose initially there were not 9, 7, 5, and 10 coins in the stacks, but N+9, N+7, N+5, and N+10 respectively; and we will perform the moves as follows: instead of adding one coin to three stacks, we will take one coin from a stack (the one into which we did not add a coin during the original move). Note that the final result will not change! (In fact, instead of adding coins to three stacks, we add them to all four and then take one away.)Under the new rules, answering the question is much easier. In one move, we take one coin from any stack, and our goal is to make the number of coins in all stacks equal as quickly as possible. It is easy to understand that for this, we need to leave N+5 coins in each stack. For this, we need to take 4 coins from the first stack, 2 from the second, 0 from the third, and 5 from the fourth.

Convergence:   - Since x_n is strictly decreasing and bounded below by 0, it must converge to some limit a geq 0.4. Fixed Point Analysis:   - If x_n to a, then taking the limit on both sides of the recurrence relation x_n = arctan(x_{n-1}), we get:     [     a = arctan(a)     ]   - The function arctan(x) has a unique fixed point at a = 0 because arctan(x) = x only when x = 0.5. Conclusion:   - Therefore, the limit of the sequence {x_n}_{n=1}^infty is a = 0.The final answer is boxed{0}."},{"problem":"1.

Scaling Down the Triangle:   We start by scaling down the triangle ( triangle ABC ) with sides ( AB = 104 ), ( BC = 112 ), and ( CA = 120 ) to a ( 13-14-15 ) triangle. This is done by dividing each side by 8:   [   AB = frac{104}{8} = 13, quad BC = frac{112}{8} = 14, quad CA = frac{120}{8} = 15   ]2. Reference to ELMO 2016 Problem 6:   According to the solution of ELMO 2016 Problem 6, the circle ( Omega ) is tangent to the circumcircle ( Gamma ) of ( triangle ABC ) at point ( A ). 3. Monge's Theorem Application:   By Monge's theorem, the exsimilicenter of the incircle ( omega ) and the circumcircle ( Gamma ) lies on the line ( overline{AX} ), where ( X = Omega cap omega ).4. Tangency Points and Isogonal Conjugates:   The tangency point of the ( A )-mixtilinear incircle with ( Gamma ) is isogonal with ( overline{AD} ) in ( angle A ), where ( D ) is the tangency point of the ( A )-excircle ( omega_A ) with ( overline{BC} ). Since ( D ) is isotomic with the intouch point with respect to ( overline{BC} ), we have:   [   CD = 6, quad BD = 8   ]5. Using Stewart's Theorem:   Applying Stewart's theorem to find ( AD ):   [   AD^2 = AB^2 cdot CD + AC^2 cdot BD - BC cdot BD cdot CD   ]   Substituting the values:   [   AD^2 = 13^2 cdot 6 + 15^2 cdot 8 - 14 cdot 8 cdot 6   ]   [   AD^2 = 169 cdot 6 + 225 cdot 8 - 672   ]   [   AD^2 = 1014 + 1800 - 672 = 2142   ]   [   AD = sqrt{2142} = sqrt{189}   ]6. Intersection with Incircle:   Let ( overline{AD} ) meet ( omega ) at ( Y ), closer to ( D ) than the other point of intersection. Using the Power of a Point theorem with respect to ( omega ), we compute:   [   AY = AX = frac{185}{sqrt{189}}   ]7. Finding the Radius ( r ):   Let ( O ) be the center of ( Gamma ) and let ( P = overline{AO} cap overline{XI} ). We know ( AI = sqrt{65} ). Set ( AP = r ) and ( IP = r - 4 ) since 4 is the radius of ( omega ). Using Stewart's theorem on ( triangle APX ) and cevian ( overline{AX} ), we compute:   [   r = frac{49}{8}   ]   Scaling back up yields:   [   r = 49   ]The final answer is ( boxed{49} )."},{"problem":"8.

According to the condition, a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{8}=frac{4}{5}. Note that the sum of all numbers except one is non-negative, so each number does not exceed frac{4}{5} (and conversely, if each number does not exceed frac{4}{5}, the sum without any one of the numbers is non-negative). Therefore, the sum of any seven numbers does not exceed 7 cdot frac{4}{5}, and then the remaining number must be at least -6 cdot frac{4}{5}.On the other hand, if one of the numbers is -frac{24}{5}, and each of the remaining numbers is frac{4}{5}, then all conditions are satisfied.

Function Analysis:   - The function f(x) is defined for all real numbers, hence its domain is mathbb{R}.   - We observe that f(-x) = |-x| + sin^2(-x) = |x| + sin^2 x = f(x), indicating that f(x) is an even function.2. Behavior on the Interval (0, +infty):   - On the interval (0, +infty), the function simplifies to f(x) = x + sin^2 x.   - The derivative of f(x) on this interval is {f'}(x) = 1 + 2sin x cos x = 1 + sin 2x.     - We can further analyze this as {f'}(x) = (sin x + cos x)^2 - sin^2 x + cos^2 x = (sin x + cos x)^2 geq 0, where the step involving sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1 is used to simplify the expression.   - Since {f'}(x) geq 0 for all x > 0, f(x) is increasing on the interval (0, +infty).3.

So after the first two terms, we must alternate between 1-terms and 2-terms. Similarly, if we start with a 2-term, the next term must be a 2-term, but then we must alternate.

In the case of n=6, there are only three different ways to divide into piles, and only one of them satisfies the condition that each pile has a different number of candies.

By utilizing the double angle formula, cos left( frac{pi}{3} - 2theta right) = 1 - 2 sin^2 left( frac{pi}{6} - theta right), we can find the solution.Step 1: Use the cofunction identity.Given that sin left( theta - frac{pi}{6} right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, we can find sin left( frac{pi}{6} - theta right) by using the cofunction identity, which states that sin left( frac{pi}{2} - alpha right) = cos(alpha).So, sin left( frac{pi}{6} - theta right) = cos left( theta - frac{pi}{6} + frac{pi}{2} right) = cos left( theta + frac{pi}{3} right).Step 2: Find the cosine value.Since sin left( theta - frac{pi}{6} right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, we know that theta - frac{pi}{6} is in Quadrant I (where cosine is positive).

Solving the system of equations:   - From frac{1}{a}+frac{2}{b}=1, considering |a|=|b|, it implies that a and b can have the same values (ignoring the case of 0 due to the reconsideration in step 1).   - Solving frac{1}{a}+frac{2}{b}=1 under the constraint |a|=|b| directly is complex without numerical methods or additional context. However, given the solution hints at b=1 or 3, we infer there's an oversight in the initial explanation of solving these equations. A more accurate approach involves analyzing the line's equation and its relationship with the given point and intercepts directly.4. Conclusion:   - The problem statement or solution approach regarding the case when the intercept is 0 might have been misinterpreted in the initial solution.   - The correct understanding should directly involve the conditions given: a line passing through (1,2) with equal absolute intercepts on the axes, leading to possible y-axis intercepts found through geometric or algebraic methods tailored to these specific conditions.Given the above steps, the correct interpretation of the solution should focus on identifying y-axis intercepts that meet the geometric condition of passing through (1,2) with equal absolute intercepts, acknowledging a potential oversight in the initial explanation. Based on the provided solution's final part, the possible y-axis intercepts are 1 or 3.Therefore, the correctly identified options, following the corrected understanding, would be:boxed{D}"},{"problem":"Using the approximation calculation method of \\"replacing curves with straight lines,\\" in the vicinity of the tangent point, the tangent line of the function graph can be used to approximate the curve near the tangent point for calculation.

How many students went to the exhibition?","solution":"First solution.Let x be the planned number of students who were supposed to visit the exhibition.The number of students who registered for the exhibition visit is x+frac{2}{7} x=frac{9}{7} x, i.e., frac{9}{7} of the planned number.Due to illness, frac{1}{6} cdot frac{9}{7} x=frac{3}{14} x students dropped out, i.e., frac{3}{14} of the planned number.The number of students who went to the exhibition is frac{9}{7} x-frac{3}{14} x=frac{15}{14} x, i.e., frac{15}{14} of the planned number.1 POINTThus, frac{15}{14} x - x = frac{1}{14} x students went to the exhibition, i.e., frac{1}{14} more than planned.We have frac{1}{14} x = 6,so x = 6 cdot 14 = 84.It was planned that 84 students would go to the exhibition, and 6 more students went, so the total number of students who went to the exhibition is 90.1 POINTTOTAL 6 POINTSNote: If a student sets up the equation x + 6 = frac{5}{6} cdot frac{9}{7} x which leads to the planned number of students, they earn 3 POINTS.

Let M=(p+q)^{p-q}(p-q)^{p+q}-1, which is relatively prime with both p+q and p-q.

Notice that M is odd, so r geqslant 3. By (2), the multiplicative order of left((p+q) cdot(p-q)^{-1}right) modulo r is a divisor of the exponent 2 q in (2), so it can be 1,2, q or 2 q.By Fermat's theorem, the order divides r-1. So, if the order is q or 2 q then r=1(bmod q). If the order is 1 or 2 then r mid(p+q)^{2}-(p-q)^{2}-4 p q, so r-p or r-q. The case r-p is not possible, because, by applying Fermat's theorem,M=(p+q)^{p-q}(p-q)^{p+q}-1=q^{p-q}(-q)^{p+q}-1=left(q^{2}right)^{p}-1=q^{2}-1-(q+1)(q-1) quad(bmod p)and the last factors q-1 and q+1 are less than p and thus p nmid M. Hence, all prime divisors of M are either q or of the form k q+1; it follows that all positive divisors of M are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo q.Now notice thatM=left((p+q)^{frac{p-q}{2}}(p-q)^{frac{z+q}{2}}-1right)left((p+q)^{frac{p-q}{2}}(p-q)^{frac{p+q}{2}}+1right)is the product of two consecutive positive odd numbers; both should be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo q.

Given the polynomial equation (x^4 + 8x^3 + 18x^2 + 8x + a = 0), we need to determine the set of values for (a) such that the equation has four distinct real roots.2. We start by rewriting the polynomial in a form that is easier to analyze. Notice that:   [   (x^2 + 4x + 1)^2 = x^4 + 8x^3 + 18x^2 + 8x + 1   ]   Therefore, we can rewrite the given polynomial equation as:   [   (x^2 + 4x + 1)^2 = 1 - a   ]3. For the polynomial to have four distinct real roots, the equation ((x^2 + 4x + 1)^2 = 1 - a) must have four distinct real solutions.

Since (k = sqrt{1 - a}) or (k = -sqrt{1 - a}), we need to consider both cases:   - For (k = sqrt{1 - a}), we have (sqrt{1 - a} > -3). Since (sqrt{1 - a}) is always non-negative, this condition is always satisfied.   - For (k = -sqrt{1 - a}), we have (-sqrt{1 - a} > -3 implies sqrt{1 - a} < 3).6.

Case 1: x+y=xy=frac{x}{y}   From x+y=xy, we rearrange to get xy-x=y. Dividing both sides by y, assuming y neq 0, we get x-frac{x}{y}=1. Substituting x-frac{x}{y} with frac{x}{y} from the equality, we have frac{x}{y}=1. This implies x=y.   Substituting x=y into x+y=xy, we get 2y=y^2.

Proof: Since a_1=1 and a_{n+1} = frac{a_n}{a_n + 3} (n in mathbb{N}^*), taking the reciprocal of both sides gives frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = 1 + frac{3}{a_n}, thus frac{1}{a_{n+1}} + frac{1}{2} = 3left(frac{1}{a_n} + frac{1}{2}right). Also, frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}, therefore, left{frac{1}{a_n} + frac{1}{2}right} is a geometric sequence. Hence, frac{1}{a_n} + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2} times 3^{n-1}, which implies a_n = frac{2}{3^n - 1}. So, the general formula for a_n is boxed{a_n = frac{2}{3^n - 1}}.2. Solution: Since sequence {b_n} satisfies b_n = frac{2}{a_n} = 3^n - 1, the sum of the first n terms of {b_n}, T_n, is 3 + 3^2 + ldots + 3^n - n = frac{3(3^n - 1)}{2} - n = frac{3^{n+1} - 3}{2} - n.

Let the right angle vertex of the ABC triangle be C. Then, by extending the sides CA and CB, we can place the triangle inside a unit square CGPF. Since the length of the diagonal CP is sqrt{2}, P is precisely the point we are looking for, and we need to determine the angle BPA. (Note: it can be proven that the legs of the ABC triangle are shorter than 1 unit.)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_41e6535f1215e0ffc035g-1.jpg?height=456&width=501&top_left_y=344&top_left_x=801)Let the sides of the ABC triangle be denoted by a, b, and c in the usual way, and let the foot of the perpendicular from P to AB be E, and let PE = x (see the figure). The area of the square is 1, sofrac{x c}{2} + frac{a b}{2} + frac{1-a}{2} + frac{1-b}{2} = 1Since the perimeter of the triangle is 2, we havec = 2 - a - bSubstituting this into the previous equation, we getx = frac{a + b - ab}{2 - a - b}By the Pythagorean theorem, a^2 + b^2 = c^2 = (2 - a - b)^2. Squaring and simplifying this equation, we get 4 - 4a - 4b + 2ab = 0, from which 2 - a - b = a + b - ab. Substituting this into the previous equation for x, we get x = 1.Since GP = EP = 1, the right triangles PGB and PEB are congruent. Similarly, the congruence of triangles PEA and PFA can be shown. This implies that angle GPC = angle BPE and angle EPA = angle APF. Therefore, the angle angle BPA is half of the right angle angle GPF, i.e., angle BPA = angle BPE + angle EPA = 45^circ.Note. From the equality PG = PE = PF, we can conclude that point P is the center of the circle circumscribed around the hypotenuse of the triangle. It is known that in a right triangle, the radius of the circle circumscribed around the hypotenuse is equal to half the perimeter, which is 1 unit in this case. This statement can essentially be proven using the reasoning in the above solution. Furthermore, the lengths of the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal, so PGBE and PEAF are kites, from which the solution to the problem can also be obtained.II. solution. Using the diagram from the previous solution, let angle APF = alpha and angle GPC = beta. The equation 4 - 4a - 4b + 2ab = 0 derived in the previous solution can be rearranged asa = frac{2 - 2b}{2 - b} = 2 - frac{2}{2 - b}Then AF = 1 - b and BG = 1 - a = frac{2}{2 - b} - 1. Furthermore,tan alpha = frac{1 - b}{1}, quad text{and} quad tan beta = frac{frac{2}{2 - b} - 1}{1}Using the tangent addition formula,tan(alpha + beta) = frac{tan alpha + tan beta}{1 - tan alpha tan beta} = frac{(1 - b) + left(frac{2}{2 - b} - 1right)}{1 - (1 - b)left(frac{2}{2 - b} - 1right)} = frac{(1 - b)(2 - b) + b}{(2 - b) - (1 - b)b} = 1Thus, tan(alpha + beta) = 1, which implies alpha + beta = 45^circ. Since angle BPA = 90^circ - (alpha + beta) = 45^circ, the measure of the desired angle is 45^circ.Note. Using trigonometric functions, another solution can be obtained by first applying the cosine rule to the sides PB and PA of triangles PBC and CAP (from which PB^2 = a^2 - 2a + 2 and PA^2 = b^2 - 2b + 2 follow), and then applying the cosine rule again to the side BA of triangle PBA (which gives cos angle APB = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} as the final result). Some solved this problem using coordinate geometry, in which case the measure of angle angle APB can be calculated from the dot product of vectors overrightarrow{PA} and overrightarrow{PB}.III. solution. Using the notation from the previous solutions. Rotate the triangle PGB 90^circ counterclockwise around P. Since PG = PF, angle GPF = 90^circ, and angle PGB + angle PFA = 180^circ, after the rotation, we get triangle PFH, whose vertex H lies on the line AF.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_41e6535f1215e0ffc035g-2.jpg?height=409&width=555&top_left_y=576&top_left_x=774)Since PA = PA, PB = PH (due to the rotation), and AH = AF + FH = (1 - b) + (1 - a) = 2 - a - b = c = AB, the triangles APB and APH are congruent, which implies angle BPA = angle APH.

(The derivation appeared in the May issue.)In our case, n=12 (we toss n times), and the number of heads is f, where f=0,1, ldots, 6.If f=0, then binom{12-0+1}{0}=1. So if we get 0 heads, there is 1 valid toss sequence.If f=1, then binom{12-1+1}{1}=12. So if we get 1 head, there are 12 valid toss sequences. Similarly, with the values binom{12-2+1}{2}=55, binom{12-3+1}{3}=120, binom{12-4+1}{4}=126, binom{12-5+1}{5}=56, binom{12-6+1}{6}=7, the total number of valid toss sequences is: 1+12+55+120+126+56+7=377.(If f>6, there are clearly no valid toss sequences.)Therefore, there are 377 toss sequences in which no two heads are adjacent.II. Solution. The first toss can be heads or tails (henceforth f and i). Let's look at the valid toss sequences. According to the condition, f can only be followed by i, and i can be followed by both f and i. Therefore, the number of cases increases at i.The 12th row of the diagram shows the number of cases. In each row, there will be as many i as there were f and i in the previous row, since i can follow both f and i. Thus, the number of cases in a row will increase by the number of elements in the row two steps back. This is called a Fibonacci sequence, where each element is the sum of the two preceding elements. After that, it is easy to calculate how many possibilities there will be in the 12th row: as many as the 12th term of the sequence 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55,89,144,233,377, which is 377.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_a2379ce886fb23168517g-1.jpg?height=218&width=552&top_left_y=1080&top_left_x=776)Therefore, there are 377 toss sequences in which no two heads are adjacent."},{"problem":"Example 6 If the parabola y=x^{2}+m x+2 intersects the line segment MN (including points M and N) connecting points M(0,1) and N(2,3) at two distinct points, find the range of values for m.","solution":"Solution: The function expression of line segment MN is y=x+1.

This is our starting point.For the second day, considering the daily average growth rate x, the number of packages handled would be 200(1+x). This accounts for the initial 200 packages plus the growth.On the third day, the growth rate applies again to the number of packages handled on the second day, making it 200(1+x)^2 for the third day. This is because the growth rate x applies to the previous day's total, which already includes one day of growth.Adding these together gives us the total number of packages handled over the three days:[200 + 200(1+x) + 200(1+x)^2]According to the problem, the total number of packages handled over the three days is 662. Therefore, we can set up the equation as:[200 + 200(1+x) + 200(1+x)^2 = 662]This matches option D: 200+200(1+x)+200(1+x)^2=662.Therefore, the correct equation that represents the situation is encapsulated as boxed{D}."},{"problem":"13.

Let's cut the surface of the Rubik's cube into parts. Cut three adjacent faces into 7 parts, as shown in Fig. 2. Cut the other three faces into the same 7 parts.

The efficiency of a heat engine is the ratio of useful work to the amount of heat received by the gas per cycle.

Each of these quantities can be found by integrating the power over time or by finding the area of the figure enclosed between the graph of the power dependence on time and the time axis. Similarly, the amount of heat received by the gas (Q_{+}) is found.Note that the function P_{2}(t)=a P_{1}(b t), therefore, since the figure formed by the graph of P_{2} is obtained from the figure corresponding to the function P_{1} by stretching along the vertical axis by a factor of a and compressing along the horizontal axis by a factor of b, then A_{+}=Q_{+} cdot frac{a}{b}.

Therefore, the coordinates of point B are: x_{B}=4, y_{B}=a-frac{6}{a}.For points A and B to lie on opposite sides of the line y=1, it is necessary and sufficient that their ordinates satisfy the inequality left(y_{A}-1right)left(y_{B}-1right)0 Leftrightarrow frac{(a+1)(a+2)(a-3)}{a}>0.

The numbers ( N ) satisfying these conditions can be written in the form ( 2^a times 3^b times 5^c ), where ( a, b, ) and ( c ) are whole numbers less than ( 3 ). This is because if ( a, b, ) or ( c ) were ( 3 ) or more, ( N ) would be divisible by a perfect cube greater than ( 1 ).3. Therefore, ( a, b, ) and ( c ) can each be ( 0, 1, ) or ( 2 ).

Find the number of all possible arrangements of chips in some cells of an 8 by 8 chessboard such that the number of chips in each row is different and the number of chips in each column is different.","solution":"Answer: 2 cdot(8!)^{2}.Solution. A row or column can contain from 0 to 8 chips, so if the quantities in the rows and columns are different, then the set of values of the number of chips in the rows and the set of values of the number of chips in the columns both represent a sequence of numbers 0,1,2, ldots, 7,8 with one missing number, and this missing number is the same in both cases and equals the difference of 36 and the number of chips on the board. If this missing number is not 0 or 8, then there will be either an empty row and a full column, or vice versa, on the board at the same time, which is impossible. Therefore, there are two possibilities: there are 36 chips on the board, and the quantities of chips in the rows and columns are 1,2,3, ldots, 8, or there are 28 chips on the board, and the quantities of chips in the rows and columns are 0,1,2,3, ldots, 7. By simultaneously swapping the occupied cells with empty cells and vice versa, we see that the number of different arrangements of the first and second types are equal.Let us be given an arbitrary arrangement of the first type, in which there will be a filled row and a filled column - a total of { }^{8 cdot 8}=64 options for choosing their numbers. We strike them out and get an arrangement of 21 chips on a 7 by 7 board with different numbers of chips in the rows and different numbers of chips in the columns. On the 7 by 7 board, this corresponds to an arrangement with an empty row and an empty column, for which there are 7 cdot 7=49 ways to choose. We strike them out again, getting an arrangement of 21 chips on a 6 by 6 board, and so on. Continuing this way, we get (8!)^2 options for choosing the numbers of the corresponding rows and columns (alternately full and empty), which completely and uniquely determine the given arrangement of 36 chips on an 8 by 8 board. Adding to them the same number of arrangements of 28 chips on 8 by 8, we get the answer: 2 cdot(8!)^{2}.Grading criteria. It is proven that there can only be 28 or 36 chips on the board: 2 points.
