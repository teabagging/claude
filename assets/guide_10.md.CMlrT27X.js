Thanks, Sushma.","Doctor":"Hello, vwmulasaisushma, I am glad to see that you have limited the intake of spices. If you are regularly experiencing stomach distress after eating, we definitely have to look into causes. You are a very young female, and I am sure you are under a lot of stress. Duodenal ulcer is common among young population. If you have a family history of stomach problems, more likely that you have this. Eno or alkaseltzer can give very minor relief but they don't control acid very well. If any, they can cause more acid rebound. There are very effective medications available over the counter, such as H-2 blockers,Proton Pump Inhibitors for acid control. H-2 blockers include Cimetadine, Ranitidine etc. PPIs include Omeprazole,Lansoprazole,Rabeprazole, Esomeprazole etc. These are highly effective. You can start taking these twice a day about one hour before breakfast and before the evning meal. You need to take this for 4-6 weeks. If you get complete relief, you probably don't need x-rays or endoscopy. If the symptoms continue, see a specialist. I also want to tell you that most of the duodenal ulcers are associated with a bacteria called H.Pylori. You need to be tested for that and if positive, needs treatment. Avoid excess caffeine, alcohol,tomato and citrus products. I wish you the very best."},{"Patient":"Hi, my baby boy is 7 months old, he has had a high fever for the last 36 hours, I took him to GP yesterday she gave me ibuprofen and pamol for him - so far it has been working well, tonight however he is burning up again but still has freezing cold hands and feet - what does this mean and what should i do??","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks and welcome to healthcare magic.High fever must be controlled irrespective of diagnosis with paracetamol 15 mg/kg every 4-6 hourly along with tepid sponging to prevent febrile convulsions.For cure of the disease cause of fever has to be investigated.viral fever subsides of it own within a couple of days.Otherwise consult pediatrician .Hope this answer is OK for you Please feel free to ask further queries if any.Dr.M.V.Subrahmanyam."},{"Patient":"hello there doctor!

Radiologists describe mural thickening and convince us that it means inflammation of intestinal wall, but without clear clinical presentation we cannot get the right diagnosis. Yes, mural wall thickening can be sign of terminal ileitis which means that you could suffer from Crohns disease but there are better ways to find it out. If you want to check it i think you should do colonoscopy or irigography.

Do u know what tthis could be. The earliest appt I could get for her is this thursday","Doctor":"Hello! I read your query and I understand your problem.Looking through the symptoms you described, your daughter might have a urinary tract infection causing irritation during urination, staining and the yellow-greenish mucus on her pants. These infections are much more common in girls, because a girl's urethra (a tube that empties the urine from the bladder outside the body) is shorter and closer to the anus, and the bacteria can spread from the anus to urethra. If your daughter was my patient, I would suggest you to not use bubble baths and strong soap for your daughter because they might cause irritation of the genital area, to not wear tight-fitting clothes and wear cotton underwear to your daughter, to teach your daughter wiping from front to back after a bowel movement, to tell your daughter that infrequent urination or delaying urination for long periods of time can contribute to develop urinary tract infections, and keep clean your daughter's genital area. Also, I would suggest you to monitor your daughter's urination frequency, ask you daughter about the presence of pain, burning and blood during urination, check her body's temperature, and ensure that your daughter drinks plenty of fluids. I suggest you to call your daughter's doctor if she is having high fever (over 101 Fahrenheit); bad smelling, bloody or discolored urine; low back pain or abdominal pain.I hope I answered your question. I hope your daughter will get better soon!Best regards!"},{"Patient":"My granddaughter age 4, red hair, fair skin, had  little red bumps oin her face yesterday then today preschool tookthe swimming today and her entire body is breaking out and now there are like whiteheads with white stuff on each whitehead.

The treatment will obviously based on the tests."},{"Patient":"I have been in a automobile accident . I have had some neck and back injuries. I have also noticed a pain on the right side of my lower abdomen . I didnt notice it for about 3 days or so.. its right next to my hip bone . Im not coughing up blood or anything and sometimes I dont even notice its there but now when I touch that area I can def tell its there and i think its starting to get a little worse. A doctor said that its where the appendix is located but he said if your not dizzy or you didnt experience symtoms right away than its probably not caused from the accident and I should just keep an eye on it. I have never had a pain like this before the accident so Im wondering if the seatbelt could have damaged my appendix or given me a hernia or something.","Doctor":"Hi. If you prove that this is appendix damage due to car accident I d like you to send me all infos because i wanna public this as case study:)) There are plenty of organs which can be damaged and incidence of appendix injury is probably 0.000001%. So you should think of the most common disorders first. Did you check(x-ray) pelvic bones and lumbal spine. Pain can be felt due to even small fractures. Just dont worry, I think its nothing but... I am an author of the book \\"Abdominal trauma-for medical students\\" and I want to inform you that abdominal injuries can have very unspecific clinical presentation. It is not necessary to have symptoms right after the trauma, even more then 5 days can pass.Seatbelt can cause variety of injuries especially of the spleen and small intestines, but its very hard for hernia to develop. The most dangerous disorders that can occur are intraabdominal bleeding and hollow organs perforation followed by infection and sepsis. You obviously dont have bleeding, but organ injuries and abdominal infection should be ruled out. The best way to do it is ultrasonography or CT scan. Check your red blood count and inflammatory parameters."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor my daughter is 19 months old .by birth she had a problem of anus.surgery also over.in that time we used medicine smuth for her.without medicine now she cannot pass the motion.plz give me the suggestion how to stop the medicine and how she can go motion free.plz","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks and welcome to healthcare magic.High calorie and fiber containing foods like whole wheat bread, leafy vegetables, juicy fruits,legumes will ease constipation .Exclusive milk feeds will lead to constipation .Lactulose syrup daily will prevent constipation and helps in normal bowel movement.Hope this reply is OK for you.Please feel free to ask further queries if any.Dr.M.V.Subrahmanyam."},{"Patient":"My 4 yr old had red eyes when he went to swimming pool last Friday.

Must I just leave it, or try to clean it, put a cream on? and what cream?","Doctor":"Hello! I read your query very carefully and I understand your problem. Your son might have a bacterial infection that can affect any part of the urinary tract: kidney, ureters (tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder), bladder and urethra(the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body). These infections may occur often around age of 3, as children begin toilet training. Urinary tract infections are usually easy to treat, but if left untreated they can cause complications. I suggest you to call your son's doctor for an appointment in order to confirm the diagnosis and begin the right treatment, if needed. Till your appointment, I suggest you to give plenty of fluids to your son (drinking more makes your child urinate more frequently by flushing the bacteria out of the urinary tract), consider offering your son small amounts of cranberry juice (it is a popular home remedy that may help recovering from urinary tract infections). Keep your son's genital area clean to prevent bacteria from entering through the urethra. I suggest you to call your son's doctor immediately if your son develops new symptoms like: pain during urination and pain in pelvic area, fever of 100.4 Fahrenheit, vomiting and blood in urine.I hope I answered your question. I wish your son will get better soon!Best regards!"},{"Patient":"sir, my nephew is 3 years old, he came to my place for vacation. n from yesterday he is urinating frequently n blood is discharged along with the urine. v can visit the doctor only tomorrow. can u please suggest some immediate home remedy to reduce this?","Doctor":"Hello!

I suggest you to be very careful for other symptoms that might develop like: fever, poor appetite, pressure or pain in the pelvic area, vomiting. Till you meet the doctor I would suggest you to monitor your nephew urination frequency, asking your nephew about the presence of pain or burning during urination, checking your nephew temperature in the morning an evening, and especially you should take care that your nephew drinks plenty of fluids. I suggest you to seek immediately medical advice if your nephew develops new symptoms. If the doctor prescribes treatment for your nephew, I would suggest you that during your nephew's treatment to contact the doctor if symptoms persist or worsens. I hope I answered your question.

I read your query and I understand your problem! It is wonderful that you breastfeed your baby but you should be very careful with the medicaments you take during this time because some of them could pass to your breast milk, and then to the baby and could harm the baby. Paracetamol is rather safe to be taken but aceclofenac is contraindicated during lactation and therefore you should stop taking Acemiz Plus. Regarding erythromycin it is safe to use during lactation.

I am giving her multi vitamin syrup but she frequently get suffered with them though she drinks lot of water, please let me know the precautions or suggest me the diet plan so that their re-occurence can be prevented.Thanks,Payal","Doctor":"Hi PayalWelcome to the HCMThere's some evidence that food allergies, viral infections, and dietary deficiencies (in particular, not getting enough iron, folic acid, zinc, or B12) can trigger oral ulcers. Ulcers almost always go away on their own, usually in a week to ten days (although large ones can take longer). The pain often subsides in three or four days. So you may take the following measures to treat her and prevent future episodes:-Apply ice to the sore to help numb the area. If your baby's eating solid food, cold or frozen foods — such as ice pops — may also do the trick. But don't give her hot, spicy food or citrus, which could make her mouth hurt more.- Apply teething gel or cream, but apply it carefully as touching the sore can hurt. For a home remedy, combine 1 part hydrogen peroxide and 1 part water. Dab on the canker sore with a cotton swab. Follow by dabbing on a little milk of magnesia. Do this three or four times a day to soothe the area and help it heal.-Give her pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen- continue multivitamin and give her a balanced diet with regular fluids.Hopefully this will help you.Take care"},{"Patient":"hi good morning i have pains in my left side of my lower belly went to my doctor who sent me for an ultra sound which shows i have 15 + follicles,is that cancerous and is it curable.

More then 95% of ovaric cysts and follicle disorders are benign. Usually hormone disbalans trigger ovary hypertrophy and menstruation abnormalities.  Your pain can be caused by ruptured follicle or cyst. You should check your estrogen and progesterone levels . Also laparoscopic examination can be performed to clearly visualize your ovaries and also can be theapeutic .

I have a body odor but my hygiene is very clean I shower everyday to be honest when I go for a shower it takes me an hour to finish up.  But I searched for treatments on the internet about body odor and they told me the best solution is to put on Baking Soda. I tried it and I was glad because it worked but there are some side effects, my armpits became really dark unlike before when I havent started using baking soda then its leathery that i can remove the brown skin and sometimes I m having a red rash. I dont want to have a body odor so I continued using it. But I dont want to risk my armpits being brown. But I did.  So I tried putting vaseline on my armpits because I think it would work being odorless, flaky, leathery and stopping it from being really brown.  I did a test a while ago, this month I tried to be healthy so I exercise everyday. Then I putted vaseline on my armpits then do my regular workout after that I smelled my armpits and it has no odor at all and I m quite amazed because my armpits was dry even though I had my exercise. (I sweat a lot to especially my armpit area thats why all of my clothes are either black or white I have clothes with different colors but its dry fit even though I sweat, my armpit sweat area wont be seen)  I did this test because I wanted to check when I sweat with vaseline on will I have an odor? And can I use this everyday as my deodorant? I had my shower then I putted on some vaseline and after 2 hours I checked my armpits if i have an odor then I had a little.  Is that method correct? Please help me doctor I dont want to have this odor and discoloration anymore. I spent my elementary and highschool days with my armpit odor and dark arms. I tried deodorants, that stone deodorants, lemon, powder, even hair oil but when I had a solution it has a bad side affect. Thank You :) Best Regards, Abby","Doctor":"it seems you have metabolic disorder. You should avoid overeating of proteins.

I read your query very carefully. These symptoms occur in children everywhere, but you should be very careful especially if your child has high fever; stiff neck (can’t bend the head forward), vomiting and confusion because it could indicate the onset of meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and the spinal cord of your child) which needs immediate medical care. I would suggest you to give fluids to your child; they hydrate the body and help your child’s organism fight the fever. If your child was one of my patients I would suggest you to give your child acetaminophen for high fever, avoid drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, which may not be safe for people with untreated meningitis. Meanwhile, I would suggest you to contact your child’s doctor in order to establish the diagnosis, because it is easy to mistake the early signs of meningitis for the influenza (or another viral infection) or vices versa. It is important to understand whether it is a viral infection or a bacterial one, because the last one needs treatment with antibiotics. Take your child to the emergency room right away if your child develops persistent fever, vomiting, confusion and especially stiff neck. The longer your child has meningitis without treatment, the greater the risk of complications. Don’t worry, check carefully your child’s symptoms, give plenty of fluids to her, and call your child’s doctor if your child is not getting better or is getting worse. I hope I answered your question and I hope your girl will get better soon!Best regards!"},{"Patient":"hello doctor, my son is suffering from cough and running nose since 10 days. doctor suggested to do nebulisation levolin,budecort and duonase.still he has same problem.in worse situation doctor prescribed wysolone 5mg.it is same to give wysolone.please help me.","Doctor":"For cough and running nose along with nebulisation you have to give your son some antibiotic preferably moxikind-cv or zifi-cv after an expert advice along with syrup wikoryl or syrup no-cold for running nose and fever if present.

This consists of the same pattern. She puts her left hand over her chest, tilts her head back and sometimes it looks like her eyes don,t close all the way she rolls her eyes. the rocking is very aggressive an can last from a couple of minutes to 15 mins, until she goes to sleep. The parens said they have checked with a dr and they should not be concerned. I am conserned because it looks more like a programmed seisure.","Doctor":"Thanks for queryThe posture you are describing is typically  body rocking. This is extremely common in children of age 6 months to 3 years. It is not uncommon to see children using body rocking as a means to soothe themselves and typically at bed time to fall asleep, as described in your description. The only worry could be that you have to make sure that the child does not hurt himself while doing body rocking. Only rarely it is associated with developmental anomalies like autism. So, be assured. Its definitely not a seizure as per your description.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"My baby has glassy eyes, has maintained a temperature between 37 C and 39 C, she has been very sleepy as well which is unusual, the last 2 days she has lost her appetite and I've been giving her water and breastmilk.

During fever, due to hyperdynamic circulation, many a times innocent murmurs are audible on auscultation. So the murmur heard may be a normal finding in your child.

The best choice for this is Kutki or Kutaj herb. But it is bitter. So many preparations are available by modifying the palatability.Kutaj syrup or Kutajarishta may be given 8 hrly to 6 hrly as per age. Kutajghan Vati tablets 6 hrly. Lavanbhaskar chooran and Bilv chooran mied equally to be given in curd four times a day. Dose as per age. Any Ayurveda doctor can guide you well. After a week generally mucous cleanses out of intestines. DONT forcibly stop stools if you start this med. It will normalize itself within a week.By acting on intestines, these herbs create immunity too and bacteria do not grow further and day to day possible food infection doesn't take place. Totally harmless unlike antibiotics.If your son cooperates, give him chhachh ( buttermilk) to drink.

I would suggest you to keep your baby hydrated with plenty of water  and follow to hypouricosuric diet(avoid chocolate,peas,beans,radjma,dal,market juices,junk food,radish,beet,etc.),because there are lots of uric acid,which can accumulate and cause ketones and cyclic vomiting.

A deficiency of hemoglobin or red blood cells will affect the lip color accordingly. In severe cases this discoloration may be slightly blue and becomes more pronounced with cold weather.2.Cyanosis associated with a higher than normal level of deoxygenated blood. This can be caused by any number of pulmonary diseases as obstructive bronhitis, pneumonia. Emergency medical attention is necessary if blue or purple lips are associated with a diminished level of consciousness, cold and clammy skin and difficulty breathing.Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing your baby good health."},{"Patient":"My father aged 70 years, heinght 5.5 feet, weight 60 kg had an abdominal ultrasound done around 6 months back when he complained of severe abdominal pain . The ultrasound report suggests that he has acute cholecystisis, diffuse irrugular thickening of urinary bladder wall and enlarged prostate . Gall bladder wall with diffuse edematous thickening of gall bladder wall mesuring 0.58cm however no calculus is seen within the lumen. After taking medication, he was fine however even now sometimes he complains of stomach pain. Please suggest what treatment needs to be done?","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for your query.Your father had acute Cholecystitis and his Ultrasound revealed findings suggestive of Acute Cholecystitis As he is getting repeated attacks of pain due to Cholecystitis It is better to get it removed by Laproscopic Surgery which is safe and gives permanent remedy. As regards his Enlarged Prostate consult some Urologist who will advise some medication like Tomsulosin ,Dutasteride or Syrgery(TURP)depending upon the severity of his Urinary symptoms and Ultrasound findings."},{"Patient":"we were told our child may have abdominal migraines- both of this parents have regular migraines( headaches) and strong family history of headache migraines on both maternal and paternal sides.  One family member ( adult) has abdominal migraines.  Our child has what appears to be very strong episodes of nausea that can last for as long as six hours but usually around 1 to two hours.  nausea is in waves.  He gets extremely pale and says his cheeks feel numb and then sometimes his hands and arms do as well.. this can last as long as nausea sometimes.. I thought the tingling sensations might be panic related ( panics when the nausea is very bad) but GI doc said tingling should not last that long with panic.  He also has dark circles often with these and more recently has complained of back bothering him when he has these episodes.  He has had stomach cramping for two months now as well as the nausea but nausea is getting more severe... he had upper and lower scoping done and has been recently diagnosed with acid reflux for which he is taking 40 mg of prilosec in capsule form ( capsules poured out).  He has also been prescribed ondansetron for nausea ( which does not always seem real effective) also just started him on amitriptyline ( 10mg) just started last night.  had been hesitant to start him on the amitriptyline as the GI specialist said that with as severe and as long-lived as the nausea seemed, he wondered if it was maybe abdominal migraines and that the nausea would not be that long lasting with reflux alone.   So, my thought was if it was abdominal migraines, I wanted to monitor what he had eaten the days the nausea has been really bad.  The common thread I found for each day was caffeine and he loves iced  tea.  He has had six episodes of severe nausea, tingling etc in the last two weeks..... all lasting at least an hour if not more... He also urinates a lot and when he has these episodes and sometimes says he feels dizzy.  My main question is, if he continues to take the amitriptyline, is it then going to be difficult to diagnose him with abdominal migraines ( GI doc said if it is abdominal migraine, that is the med a Neurologist would prescribe).  Can reflux cause abdominal migraines or make them worse?    Looking back over the last couple months when this first started... he has been pale a lot ( looks sick)... we were pediatrician several times and were not to see specialist until next week but when he started losing weight specialist saw us sooner.  Son had difficulty eating at times the past couple of months due to feeling so nauseated and became thinner. and thinner.. trying to get him some relief he is absolutely miserable when he has these episodes.  Having nausea with headache migraines, I know how severe nausea can be... he does not cope with it well at all.  I take something at onset of headache migraines and feel good within a half hour... this is not happening for him...I really don't want him on meds for a long time but since migraines are so strong in our family, I am concerned this may be the case.  Do kids usually grow  out of these if it is abdominal migraine?  Could it be related to his hormones? He is 10 .  Concerned about side effects of med.... maybe things will subside when reflux clears up?  Thanks so much for any help you can provide!!!   Heartfelt thanks!!","Doctor":"With such presentations in my clinic, I would prescribe Domperidon 1 tablet 3 times after 15 min before meals . It is gold standard for acid reflux.Kindly follow Pevzner's diet 1, don't give him ice or other tea, it will increase acidity, avoid chocolate and cheese, it can cause migrains also.Begin to take flax seeds(boil 1 tbs in 2 glasses of water,take 1/2 glass before meal twice a day). Give him yoghurts,probiotics(Visilac), it will decrease nausea and increase appetite. For headache  migraines you can use 1 tablet of Diclofenac and 1 tablet of Domperidone.  Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, my baby is almost 8 month old.  He's been constipated for 4 days (never went well after starting solid).  I tried giving him diluted prune juice, but he didn't like it after a while.  Now, I am feeding him watermelon puree, will that help his constipation?  Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello! Watermelon, is a watery fruit, and is one of the fruits that help babies with their constipation.  I would suggest you to try apple or pear juice if your baby doesn’t like the taste of prunes. As your baby is 8 months old he can have as much as 6 ounces of juices a day to treat constipation. You can cut down constipating foods like bananas and rice. You can also give your baby a few tablespoons of pureed apples, pears, apricots (they will help loosen his bowel movements). You can also help your baby get some exercises (while he is lying on his back move his legs gently as if he were pedaling a bicycle); and you can massage his belly, below his navel measure three finger widths and gently pressure him with your fingertips. If he doesn’t get better, if the diet is not helping his condition, talk to his doctor about other treatment options. Call his doctor if your baby isn’t eating, loses weight, or has blood in his stool. Do not worry, all babies go through this, especially when parents start to introduce solids to them. I hope, I asked your question. Please, let me know if your baby boy is getting better."},{"Patient":"Hello,  My granddaughter is seven yrs. old has a rash in both arm pits and behind the knee.

If I were your treating Doctor for this case of rash, I would come up with two possibilities, these include: The first possibility is of Sweat rash. Diagnosis can be confirmed by dermatologist and appearance in time of heat wave.  To help control the sweating ,you should use Nyacin or other powder to affected areas.The second possibility is of chlorine water in the swimming pool as it may cause allergy, dry skin, itching.

Name: Milind Age:19 yrs Gender : male","Doctor":"Dear Milind, ulcer disease is a chronic disease which goes through different phases and each of these phases has specific treatment. First of all every patient with ulcer need to change his nutrition and lifestyle. This means you need to avoid stress (one of factors that increase incidence of ulcers) and specific food and drinks( coffee, alcohol, fats, fast food etc). But it seems like you ve already developed a serious type of ulcers, you are pretty young and it must be definitely treated in a right way.So second Line of Defense are medications. We usually use 3 of them (proton pump inhibitors, antacids and Ca channel blocators). Rabeprazole is proton pump inhibitor and one of most useful drugs BUT it s not the only one.  Ask your doctor about antacids and Ranitidinum medicines or combination of them, it might be helpful.In modern medicne  permanent pain can and must always be treated. You shouldnt suffer because there are more treatment methods...One of them is endoscopic treatment of ulcer, I dont know reason why your gastrologist didnt do this,i t is called terapeutic endoscopy...The last \\"hope\\" is a surgical treatment but I am not gonna decribe it :) If there will be need for it just call me:)"},{"Patient":"my 33 month old son has tubes. he has complained about his ear hurting and now there is yellow gunking fluid coming out. he got his tubes put in at 12 months and they were still in as of june 2012. is this normally to happen when the tube actually falls out?","Doctor":"Yellowish fluid discharge from ears in an infant is suggestive of infection.

Depending on these findings doctors can focus on specific diagnostic tests. The most common disorder i suspect is IBD so you should do gastroenterologic exam and tests.

If you have pain in abdomen and an umbilical hernia seen on US then the first thing to think about is \\"abdominal pain caused by hernia\\":) .  There are many conditions in medicine where pain doesnt need to bo localized near the \\"patology\\". Sometimes pain can be felt on the opossite side of the affected organ. It is known that one of common symptom of  myocardial infarction is pain in the left shoulder. Also,  infection of the abdominal organs can give many types and localizations of pain. The reason for it is simple: when i see pain, i see nerves, not organs (this is my own phrase:)) . Nerves conduct pain, and nerves are all around, going from perifery to the brain so pain can be localized on its pathway, So just lets go back to your problem."},{"Patient":"My baby is 15 days old and we just noticed a small brownish colored marking on his inner left thigh/knee area. It almost looks as if he got some brown furniture stain on him(we have not had/used any products like that since he was born). It is probably about 1 inch by 1/2 inch in size. Is this a birthmark?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMIn my opinion it seems to be the cafe au lait spot. Cafe au lait spots get their name from the color, which often appears similar to coffee with a bit of milk. They range in shade from light brown to dark brown, and they can appear anywhere on the baby’s body within the first few years. These spots will change in coloration and size, but you should not be alarmed by this. The spots themselves are just concentrations of melanin in most situations. I would recommend concern, though, if more than six appear on the skin and are larger than a quarter. In those instances, it may be an indication that your baby is developing neurofibromatosis. You will need to take your baby to the doctor to discuss the possibility and check for other symptoms.Hopefully this will help you. For further questions, you may contact me.Take care"},{"Patient":"My 5 year old son has had severe mood swings since he was 2 and half, he is quite lethargic compared with his peers, we had campalabacter when he was about 15 months old, a few days ago he had a day of vomiting and today he has been burping smelling very strongly of sulfur, is any of this related?","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote I feel your kid might be having inborn errors of metabolism.

So shud i continue feeding or stop for a while?","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote this looks like a food allergy to some ingredient in the cerelac you are using. I suggest you stop giving it. Rather than artificial preparations like this I suggest you give only exclusive breast feeding till 6 months of age. That's what even the World Health Organization (WHO), recommends. So give only exclusive breast feeding till 6 months age and then we can decide further.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My daughter is 11 years and 5 months old. She is suffering from knee pain.

Its too late to take her to the doc tonight and I am freaking out so I just want to know what this could be..she doesnt have a fever","Doctor":"HI...please do not worry. It seems like a viral diarrhea. Unless there is blood in motion you need not worry.Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my son 1.5 yrs old having fever from last night.

Don't worry, it can be managed by the following measures:1. Keep him well hydrated by regular feeds and oral rehydration therapy such as lemonade, soups or butter milk. If the fluid loss is excessive, than hydrate with oral rehydration solution available OTC after proper constitution.2. You may give him Syp. Emeset or Domperidone for  vomiting episodes.3. Also, start him on Syp. ZnD or Zinconia for next 14 days. It contains Zinc which is good for early recovery.4. In case of any fever episodes, you may give him acetaminophen syrup.In case his oral intake drops significantly and he looks dehydrated then do contact your pediatrician.Hopefully this will help you.

If still the fever doesn't respond, you may repeat the same dose after 6-8 hours. 2. Syp. Meftal P can be given for fever spikes not responding to Tylenol.3.

Petechiae do not blanch on pressure and can develop due to rupture of minute blood capillaries in subcutaneous tissue. It might have occurred in your daughter due to pressure from several vomiting episodes she had. I would recommend you to take her for a proper clinical examination is you feel that the spots are increasing or there is any frank bleeding from any site. It may occur in some children with bleeding disorders. In case the spots are blanching on pressure, the cause could be allergic reaction. You may give her Syp. Chlorpheniramine in that case.Hopefully this will help you. For further questions, you may contact me.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi, my seven month old son had high fever since last 3 days.

I would recommend you to take a complete course of antibiotics according to the culture and sensitivity pattern of urine. Usually if properly treated with compliance, it will be fine.Also, since this episode has occurred so early in life, the cause and it's effects on the urinary system needs to be thoroughly investigated. Ultrasonography KUB should be done soon after the diagnosis of UTI. The MCU is recommended 2-3 weeks later, while the DMSA scan is carried out 2-3 months after treatment.

Than it would go up to my shoulder making a sharp pain down to my chest . than it would move over to my chest. I thought i might been pregnant at first . but now i have bleedin from my vagainal area for like a month.","Doctor":"Dear Miss, there are many conditions that can cause the symptoms that you described but It seems to me like abdominal or gynecological \\"story\\". First, it would be helpful to know your age and your medical history. Pregnancy must be always excluded, but it can also be some kind of missed or early abortion that causes vaginal bleeding. Pain that you are describing seems like position-dependent pain and it can be sign of serious abdominal infection (including pelvic infection) such as intraabdominal or tuboovarian abscesses. The most common vaginal bleeding is benign and it is called dysfunctional uterine bleeding, but without more information I cannot give you the right answer. I should know does it bleed after intercourse, during menstruation or all the time? Shoulder pain is usually referred pain from other place like abdominal cavity (for example abdominal infection as I ve mentioned before) and also you can feel it associated with abdominal discomfort( especially when you re feeling bloated because bloated stomach makes pressure on phrenic nerve). My opinion is that there is high possibility that you suffer from endometriosis... So I advice you to do this: 1. laboratory findings ( red blood count to look for anemia, inflammatory markers to look for infection, urine analysis- uroinfection, vaginal microbiology tests- STDs, estrogen,progesteron and steroide  hormone levels) 2. Ultrasound- abdominal and Gynecological !- to search for intraabdominal abscesses, tumors, cysts,endometiosis etc. 3. CT scan if needed Also you should apstinate till your symptoms disappear.

Should I give her something to lower it?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI understand your concerns. Fevers are an immune response of the body towards infections and should be treated if they spike more than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.I would recommend you to start her on acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever episodes. Repeat the dose at 6-8 hours interval if fever persists.Also , cold sponging will be helpful to bring faster relief.If fever persists for more than3days or if it's associated with any other symptoms, then a proper clinical examination by pediatrician will be helpful.For more questions, you may contact me.Take care"},{"Patient":"my daughter is 11 years old....the GI order 2SPECIFIC blood test, and stool,plus a ultrasound....the ultrasound was all normal.....we are waiting for the rest....i ask him to give my daughter pancreatic enzymes he told me not....i ask him to do a MRI in the pancreas to my daughter....he just want to wait because he said she looks fine....she have 49 in elastina-1 the normal range must be 200....im seriusly thinking travel to my country and gwt otger dx getting everything faster....im fustrated....she also have autism,always being organic food,probiotic and enzymes trienza to be more specific....the dr. told me know take away the enzymes ...im not sure ?? please what i can do....","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.These enzymes should be used during 1-2 months ,but not constantly, because it will suppress function of pancrease.

But not all the time he urinates.. Now two days later he suddenly developed a dry cough.","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.  Normally, urine that contains a lot of water has little to no odor. If your baby's urine becomes highly concentrated and very yellow — a high level of waste products with little water — urine odor may have a strong ammonia smell.Many foods and medications, such as lots of chocolate,peas,beans or certain vitamins, can affect the odor of urine. Sometimes, unusual urine odor may indicate a medical condition or disease, such as:-Urine tract infection-Dehydration-Diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of blood acids called ketones)-Gastrointestinal dysbiosis, which lead to increase of uric acid and ketoacidosis -Maple syrup urine disease (rare genetic disease that causes difficulty breaking down certain amino acids)-Metabolic disorder If I were your treating Doctor for this case I would suggest:1. Keep your baby hydrated with plenty of water or ORS.2.Hypouricosuric diet-avoid products, enriched with uric acid(spinach,beets,radish,chocolate,peas).3.For better digestion I advise my patients to take Enzyme's syrup.4. Also take probiotics group of medicines like as Darolac, Visilac 1 capsule once a day for normal flora of intestine. Start on these changes and get back to me in 2 to 3 months. Wish you and your son good health."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, My 2 yr old baby girl has this problem of mucusy and frequent stools every once in a while. It looks like diarrhea but not very loose stools. There is mucus in stools with a need to poo every 10 min. She is very thin with 10 kg weight at 2 years of age. Please suggest whether it is IBS? Is there any medication available at this age? Regards.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMIn my opinion your child seems to be suffering from infection of the gut mostly likely an intestinal amoebiasis. I would recommend you to take the following measures to treat her:1. Start her on Syp. Metronidazole at 30-50mg/kg/day and complete the course of 7 days.2. Keep her well hydrated by regular feeds and oral rehydration therapy such as lemonade, soups or butter milk. If the frequency is very high with excess fluid loss than oral rehydration solution will be more helpful.3. Also give her a dose of albendazole 400 mg to treat any worm infestation.4. Start her on Syp ZnD for next 14 days. Zinc supplements help in early recovery.5. Continue a healthy, balanced and frequent diet.Hopefully this will be of help.

Many a times our body releases histamines in response to some insect bites which leads to such type of reactions. You may take the following measures to help her:1. Apply lactocalamine lotion on the lesions. It will be soothing.2. Start her on an antihistamine such as Syp Benadryl or Chlorpheniramine. 3. In case the condition worsens, steroids and adrenaline will be helpful but only under pediatrician supervision.4.

Antibiotics are prescribed in pre-term babies as well (in preterm babies and newborns) in case of infections because there is no other choice if they are needed. Therefore your precious little one-month daughter should have no problems with it. Please continue for 5 days at least because early stopping of antb increases the chances of antb resistance.

The spraines ankle could lead to fever if it was severe enough as to destroy the structures incolved. Especially if you didn't take care of it after it happened. For example, after the injury of joints the best thing to do is to insert the joint in cold water and then to rap it up with onion and salt in order to suck and remove the fluids causing edema of the joint. If this is not done the fluids coming out because of the injury will be swolled and hurting. The ankle neess to rest as well but you say your daughter continues to move around thereafter. Therefore, after aome days in this conditions with fluid in the joint space the inflamation could occur leading to fever. However this is little probable if the skin is intact (not perdorated or torn out) as microbes dont have an entry point. My asvice: try to treat the ankle with grilled onion mixed with salt and rapping it with a piece of clothing or bandages and give paracetamol to lower the temperature. If the situation does not improve then you have to see a doctor.Best!"},{"Patient":"HI MY PAED IS BUSY IN A DELIVERY, PLEASE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH AN ANSWER, MY 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER HAS A URINARY INFECTION, THEY HAVE TESTED A SAMPLE OF HER URINE, AND THE RESULTS SHOW BACTERIA IS GROWING, WHAT DOES IS THIS MEAN, AND HOW SERIOUS IS IT?

The second option is less likely since it implies that a systemic infection has also affectes kidneys or the urinar bladder. therefore, with the information you provide, I would be more in favor of the first option. howeve, even in this case I suggest consisdering the use of an antibiotic based on the type of bacteria detected, the number of bacteria per field and other signs and symptoms of the baby such as fever, discomfort, etc.Also, the hygiene of the baby in that region is important: frequent baths, use of local nutritive and protective creams, and fast change of pampers after stool comes out.Take care!"},{"Patient":"In basketball today, I dove for a ball and I landed hard on top of the ball right in my abdominal region.

Rehydrating is very important so please take the rehydrating preparations (tresol, for example). Also, avoid milk and oily and fat foods. You can give her soup with meat juice but not meat with fat, only red meat, boiled eggs and hard white cheese. The virosis will complete its cycle so please be patient.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put  the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If  still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

As you have had 3 abdominal surgeries, there is very possible that inside your abdomen you have a lot of adhesions. Such adhesions can affect intestines and cause bowels obstruction. This should be ruled out at first with abdominal X-ray. Your symptoms can be also caused by ovarian cyst, ovarian infection, diverticulitis, urinary tract infections, pregnancy (recent bleeding does not rule it out). It is advisable for you to have abdominal ultrasound, full blood work, urine analysis, pregnancy test, transvaginal ultrasound. Hope this will help.

It's mainly due to lack of adequate sleep as children on and need minimum 8 to 10 hours of peaceful sleep, the lack of which not only causes such symptoms but also can trigger a seizure. The stomach pain can also be a part of her condition because there is also an entity called abdominal epilepsy which can have the same symptoms. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen might be useful to rule out any other pathology. Please consult your doctor again and clarify regarding these. If you have further questions I would be glad to answer.

He weighs 6.9 kg now. He was 2.3 kgs at birth. I feel that my milk supply has reduced substantially these days.My milk alone is not able to satisfy his hunger, so i have started reducing the frequency of breastmilk and increasing the frequency of solids. His schedule is 7 PM-Breastmilk, 9 PM-Cerelac-Rice mixed with 1 finely ground almond. 12 PM- Raagi, 3 PM- 3 ounce stage 2 Emfamil milk,5 PM- Breast milk, 6.30- Cerelac- Wheat mixed with 1 date(khajoor) boiled and mashed nicely or Cerelac-(Rice-Wheat-moong dal khichdi- this one is the latest addition to cerelac stage 1 food) or suji/rava porridge, 8.30- banana porridge and then he goes to sleep. he gets up 2 times at night and i feed him breastmilk. I give him around 10-15 ml of orange or grape juice occasionally. Havent started much of vegetables yet, have tried pumpkin which he sometimes eat, sometimes doesnt.Used to eat bananas nicely but has stopped eating it offlate. My questions are: 1) Am i feeding him too much solids? Should I be giving him more breastmilk or emfamil( infant formula milk)?He doesnt take more than 3 ounces of emfamil at a stretch, sometime only 2 ounce. Forcing him to have more results in puking out the milk. 2) Is he getting adequate nutrition or should i include anything else in his diet? 3) Will feeding too much Cerelac make him fat in coming future?

In my opinion it can be due to the following problems:1. Musculoskeletal pain- it's likely because it gets aggravated on use of muscles like bending and pushing. It should respond to acetaminophen or diclofenac.2. Pain due to gastritis can also present like this. An antacid such as Digene, lansoprazole or ranitidine will be helpful in this case.3.

Thank You Marie Brown","Doctor":"Hi...Tantrums may happen when kids are tired, hungry, or uncomfortable; or because they can't get something (for example, an object or a parent) to do what they want. Learning to deal with frustration is a skill that children gain over time. Tantrums are common during the second year of life, a time when language skills are starting to develop. Because toddlers can't yet say what they want, feel, or need, a frustrating experience may cause a tantrum. As language skills improve, tantrums tend to decrease. This is what you can do to avoid or prevent tantrums - 1. Give plenty of positive attention2. Try to give toddlers some control over little things3. Keep off-limits objects out of sight and out of reach4. Distract your child5. Help kids learn new skills and succeed6. Consider the request carefully when your child wants something7.

Starting yesterday morning I began to have a sharp stabbing pain in my LUQ of my abdomen. I applied heat, took some tums and Tylenol . I also increased my water intake and started a probiotic . The pain has not resolved, it has actually gotten worse. The pain is now shooting up into my L shoulder . I had a large bowel movement this morning. I had minor pain when going to bathroom. The pain in my abdomen gets worse when I take a deep breath or rest my arm on my stomach. What are your suggestions?","Doctor":"hi vanessa, Pain in the abdomen radiating to the left shoulder suggests an intra-abdominal pathology which is obviously irritating your diaphragm,also as evidenced by the pain incresing on taking deep breaths. Hence you need a good clinical examination and radiological evaluation.Please do visit your surgeon without fail. all the best"},{"Patient":"hi , my son is 3yrs old , one week before we went on vacation to kashmir, at the same time and later on coming back , he suffering from loose motion like mucous in motion, already shown to  doctor, by not getting the good result.what to do ? pl. suggest.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Please advice which milk must I give her.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMCows’ milk  can  provide  an  important  source  of  energy, protein, vitamins  and minerals. If  your  child  is  not  able  to  tolerate  cows’ milk,  it  is  very  important  to replace  it  with  a  suitable  alternative.These are some of them which you may give him:-Ready-made  soya, pea  and  oat  or  other  milks  may  be  used  as  a  main  drink.-Rice  milk  is  not  suggested  for  use  below  41/2  years  of  age. -Try  to  use  a  brand  that  is  fortified  with  calcium. If  the  product  is  not fortified  with  calcium, or  your  child  will  only  take  a  small  amount  of  the fortified  milk,  it  is  likely  that  they  may  need  a  calcium supplement.You  may  also  find  it  helpful  to  request  a  review  from  a  Registered  Dietitian so  that  they  can  check  that  your  child  is  enjoying  a  balanced  diet  as  they may  benefit  from  additional  vitamin  and  mineral  supplements.Many milk  substitutes  have  a  very  different  taste  and  smell  compared  to breast  milk  or  cows’ milk.   Some  children  can  take  time  to  get  used  to  this when  they  are  first  started  on  a  new  product.   A  Registered  Dietitian  will  be able  to  give  you  advice  about  how  to  encourage  your  child  to  take  these milk  substitutes.Hopefully this will help you.

Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4.

Every rise in temperature of your child's body doesn't need a course of antibiotics.

Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4.

If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

It seems  she had minor nosebleed that has stopped,it may require no treatment at all.She formed a clot at the site of the bleeding that stopped any further bleeding.

Cauterization is most effective when the bleeding is coming from the very front part of the nose.In more complicated cases, a nasal packing may be required to stop the bleeding. The idea behind this is to put pressure from inside the nostril to halt the bleeding. Many different types of packings are available, ranging from petroleum (Vaseline) gauze to balloon packs to synthetic sponge packs that expand when moistened.

Poops of babies at this age may vary a lot in terms of frequency, colour, and consistency.

If she is on exclusive breastfeeding, than its very good as breast milk has antibodies which can fight many gut infections.  Continue regular feeds, she will be fine.2.

Do you know what causes this and if she should see a doctor? Will the red dot go away on its own?","Doctor":"I am pleasure to answer your question. The red spot you see is most likely a small blood vessel. In medical terms, it is called a subconjuntival hemmorhage. Small blood vessels lie underneath the conjunctiva, the clear coating that covers the sclera, the white part of the eye. But most often feel no pain, irritation or light sensitivity.A subconjunctival hemmorhage can occur if a person has too much pressure on the upper part of the body or head. Pressure can be created by straining too hard while lifting something very heavy or coughing or sneezing. Straining during constipation can also cause enough pressure to burst a blood vessel in the eye. Other causes are high blood pressure, diabetes, trauma or a high dosage of blood thinners, such as aspirin.If a red spot in your eye lasts for longer than a few days, you should schedule an eye exam. Your eye doctor will try to determine the cause of the subconjunctival hemmorhage.Hope it is helpful."},{"Patient":"My child 14 month old child spiked a temp of 39.1 and i gave him 10ml calpol and 5 mls of nerofen childrens liiquid....

A reduction or absence of bile salts can cause the stool to become yellow or pale. Bile salt production can be reduced due to liver disfunction. The passage of bile salts into the intestines can be prevented by blockages of the bile ducts due to inflammation, gallstones, or biliary dyskinesia. Pain, especially in the right upper abdomen, fever, nausea, itching, and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes can also occur with these conditions.  The pancreas also produces substances important for digestion, including the enzyme lipase, which breaks down fats. Excess fat in the stool can cause yellowish, bulky stool that floats, has an oily or greasy appearance, and smells foul.   I advice-give stool analysis and ultrasound of liver,pancreas for rule out following up symptoms."},{"Patient":"Dr. My Child is 4 years old and she is diagnosed pancreatitis on 18th may 2012. after 2 months she is diagnosed swealling in pancreas again .

I strongly recommend putting your child on a low-fat diet with plenty of fluids. This is less likely to irritate the pancreas and helps it to heal faster.Kids with a more severe case of pancreatitis who become dehydrated may need a short stay in the hospital. Treatment involves resting the pancreas by not eating or drinking, and receiving intravenous (IV) fluids and pain medication. Other medications may help to reduce the amount of acid in the body. For some kids, this is enough and they can go home after a few days of treatment  Your kid should stay on a low-fat diet to help heal the pancreas, which she should follow until their enzyme levels are back to normal. A follow-up blood test will probably be done to confirm normal enzyme levels.  For improving digestion you can use papaya, Earth apple, artichoke, Enzyme's syrup,probiotics-Darolac.

But the above medications are not antibiotics. But all the medications in syrup formulation will have a sugary syrupy base in them and this might cause osmotic diarrhea. I feel this is the reason for the loose stools rather than the medications.Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"HiMy Baby is 11 months old, having loose motions problem now.I generally give him Raagi with butter milk/curd daily.Can I give him same now as he is having problem of loose motions?PS: I am already giving him Sporlac for loose motions cure as Dr suggestedThanksSree","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMYour child seems to be suffering from a viral gastroenteritis episode.

Take the following measures to help her in future:1. Avoid peanuts completely in future  if you felt that the episode was triggered by it. 2. Use Syp.

With inspiration heart rate decreases and with expiration it increases. If your baby is otherwise asymptomatic then don't worry. If your baby is gaining weight, no history of repeated infection, and development with age then it is unlikely to be a underlying pathological condition. I will advise you to do ECG of the baby to know about the same. Hope this helps you.

It reduces the ongoing inflammation and hypersensitivity of airways and helps in healing. There are a few things you should follow  to have best results:1. Use a zerostat or spacer for delivery of MDI inhaler.2. Always make your child rince his mouth well after using it.3.

It may have been caused because of excessive strain on the abdominal muscles due to the planks you have performed. I would advise you to apply ice pack on the affected area to reduce the inflammation.Also, alternate it with applying heat to help in muscle relaxation. Take an over the counter painkiller like Advil or Naproxen drug to reduce pain and inflammation.After you recover from the pain you can perform abdominal muscle strengthening exercises like curl-ups and pelvic tilts which are good muscle therapies.

I have a pain sometimes on my right side near my appendix not very often but when it comes its severe enough for me to curl up and not move for ages. Please advise","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. The symptoms you have mentioned does not sound like a cancer. Bad smelly stools can be caused by pancreas disease, IBS or diet. Right lower abdominal pain if is severe can be caused by ovarian cyst or urinary tract inflammation. I suggest you to have some tests: abdominal ultrasound, urine analysis, full blood work with liver and pancreas tests, stool tests and transvaginal ultrasound. And you definitely should have colonoscopy repeated (it is advisable to have colonoscopy repeated after a 5 years of small polyp removal). If all tests will be negative, you may suffer from IBS. Therefore Rifaximine 400mg 3x1 during 7 days and Mebeverine 200 mg once a day can be helpful (should be prescribed by your doctor). Hope this will help.

Pain in daily starting Dull/achy to sharp and stabbing especially after meals. Should I take him to the ER?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome. Thanks for your query. The one symptom of pain after meals, is most commonly associated with peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Which is an ulcer found either in the duodenum (which is the first part of the intestine, that is connected to the stomach) or the stomach itself. The main differential factor is the duration or initiation of pain after a meal. In the presence of an ulcer in the stomach the pain usually starts 15-20 minutes after a meal, which is how much time the food takes to reach the stomach and irritate the ulcer. In the case of a duodenal ulcer, the pain starts around 2 hours after a meal, which is how much time the food takes to reach the duodenum after consumption. Other findings of a gastric ulcer are: -Vomiting helps in reducing the symptoms -Appetite is usually normal -Patient usually experiences loss of weight -In a complicated or bleeding stomach ulcer, we find traces of blood in the vomitus, and rarely black or dark brownish colored stools -More common in patients belonging to lower socio-economic status (lower middle class most common) Other findings of a duodenal ulcer are: - Higher socio-economic status patients -Normal or increased appetite -Normal or increased weight -Darkish brown stool is more common that bloody vomitus I hope these details at least help you in ruling out an ulcer. An endoscopy would also help in visualizing the ulcer, size and location, and can also take a biopsy (tissue sample) at the same time. Please discuss the details with your doctor. For any further clarifications, you can always write back to us.

Don't worry as they can be very well controlled now a days with new drugs. Children with family history of epilepsy are more likely to inherit this condition. Sodium valproate ( Epilex) is definitely a better drug as compared to the Carbamazepine (Tegrital) for most of the epileptic disorders in childhood. Just go for a liver function test before continuing epilex as it may affect the liver in some children. Also clobazam is a good antiepileptic to add on whenever she has high grade fever spikes because they may lead to break through seizures.I think this treatment plan is fine and you can continue it with full compliance.In case of any further information, you may always contact me.

She is completely on breast feed, & has gained only 100gms wt in 15 days.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI understand your concerns.If you're breastfeeding, green poo can be a sign that your baby is taking in too much lactose (the natural sugar found in milk). This can happen if she feeds often, but doesn't get the rich milk at the end of the feed to fill her up. Also it leads to poor weight gain. Make sure your baby finishes feeding from one breast before you offer her your other one.Too much lactose in feeds can lead to reducing substance positivity in stool examination. If pus cells in stool are less than 5,  it's normal.If you are breastfeeding your baby, she is less likely to suffer from diarrhoea. This is because your milk helps to prevent the growth of the bacteria that cause it.In my opinion, you should follow these measures:1. Breast feed regularly. Let her finish from1breast before you offer from the other breast.2. Start her on probiotic such as enterogermina once daily.If she has fever or her stools have pus cells more than 5 and the stool consistency and colour continues to worry you, you may contact me."},{"Patient":"Hi my little is 8 months and he has been getting nose bleeds since Saturday.

Could you please give me some advice. Thank you","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI understand your concerns. You child has intermittent epistaxis i.e.nose bleeds.Follow these guidelines to control a nosebleed:-Quietly comfort your child and make he or she is breathing normally.-Hold your baby upright against your chest, with his head leaning forward. This will prevent the blood from pooling in the throat. Keep a towel under the nose to absorb any blood.-Put gentle, continuous pressure on the soft part of the nose with your thumb and forefinger.      Continue the pressure for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the bleeding stops. Your child will be able to breathe through his mouth.-If bleeding doesn’t stop, continue putting pressure on the nose. Bring your baby to the emergency department.-Once the bleeding stops and a clot forms, discourage rubbing or blowing the nose for several days. This will allow the blood vessels to heal.-Wash your hands well with soap and warm water after taking care of your child’s nose.To prevent further  such episodes:-Use a nasal saline spray or ointment like petroleum jelly, especially in the winter months.-use a room vaporizer to add humidity to the air.Hopefully this will be of help. In case you have any further questions, you may contact me."},{"Patient":"My 2 yr old has red spots in the back of her throat and did have tiny red spots on her forearm and back of hands 2 days ago.

The pain was about 2 to the right of my belly button. I started getting dizzy as if I was going to pass out.. I took some Advil and laid down. After a couple of hours, the pain has decreased but has spread all across my stomach and has since moved to my left side as well as my back. It s not hurting as bad as this morning, but is still noticeable.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. I understand the pain you are going through. Any pain in abdomen should not be taken lightly. Pain killers may reduce the pain for sometime. But they are also masking the actual problem. You have also mentioned that pain has spread all over the abdomen though reduced in intensity. It shows that the problem still persists. Are you having fever? Is there any problem while passing urine? A lot of questions needs to be answered before finding the exact problem. I would suggest you to consult a gastroenterologist  at the earliest. Your condition needs to be examined properly. You might have to undergo ultrasonography of abdomen to pin point the cause of pain. Meanwhile, avoid spicy and oily food. Drink plenty of water. Hope I have been of some help to you. Let me know if I can assist you further. Thank you. Regards"},{"Patient":"My 14 month old has a rash on her arms and her cheeks. They look like tiny white or skin coloured raised dots.

Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do.

Usually oral cavity infections are caused by mixed infective organisms, and so if I were your doctor, I would advise you with a broad spectrum antibiotic along with an antibiotic against anaerobic organism.

An antiseptic gargle would be worth using for this condition.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Occasional changes in poops of infants occurs commonly when we change to complementary feeds. You should be concerned about the colour and consistency if:1. There is blood or mucous present which may occur when there is bacterial or parasitic infection of gut.It can also occur in some food allergies.2. Very loose wastooland frequent stools suggestive of diarrhoea.3. Persistent green coloured poops may be due to increased lactose or other sugars in the diet.4. If child has fever along with the changes in poops with poor appetite.At present, I would recommend a proper complementary diet such as mashed fruits, porridge, boiled and mashed pulses, cereal based formulas for complementary feeds.

Chalazions are chronic, painless, granulomatous inflammation of the meibomian glands present on eyelids which results from obstruction of the gland duct. Usually if it's having such a short history, in my opinion you can try the following measures:1. Warm compresses for 5-10 minutes, 4-5 times daily2.  A proper massage after warm compresses can encourage the cyst to drain. Do this gently, with a clean finger or cotton bud, in the direction of the eyelashes.3. Cleaning the eyelid twice per day removes grease and grime that may contribute to cysts forming. A weak solution of baby shampoo in warm water is ideal.If it's not associated with much discomfort then I would recommend you to wait and watch along with the above mentioned measures. Hopefully it will respond with out any need for surgery.For further questions, do contact us."},{"Patient":"Hi my 8 month old baby has had diareah for the last couple of days.

Should I be concerned? I'm still breastfeeding him and he has been eating mashed veggies and bananas for about 2 months now.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMIn my opinion your child seems to be suffering from an episode of viral gastroenteritis. In cases of  diarrhea, body of an infant may temporarily have trouble producing lactase, and he may have symptoms of lactose intolerance for a week or two.This seems to be the likely cause of your baby's poop change. Don't worry. You can take the following measures to help him:1. Hold milk and dairy products containing lactose for 1-2weeks. You can give him lactose free milk formulas for the time being.2. Keep him well hydrated during  these diarrhoea episodes by oral rehydration therapy such as lemonade, soups, Buttermilk or oral rehydration solution.3. Start a syrup zinc for next 2 weeks. Zinc help in regeneration of gut mucosa and early recovery from the diarrhoea. Also it gives immunity against similar episodes  for next 2-3months.4. Give him acetaminophen if fever occurs.5. Probiotics such as enterogermina will be helpful.If still the child doesn't respond, then do contact your pediatrician for proper clinical examination and laboratory work up if required.For further questions, do contact us."},{"Patient":"My nearly 15 month old son come up with tiny red spots on friday I took him emergency out of hours practise lady said too small at the moment to say chicken pox but definatly not measles,or german measles these spots are only on his arm and both legs but tonight he started vomiting violently what is this?","Doctor":"can not you post pictures of these lessions? is there any fever, iching ? chicken pox lession are more densely  and chest and abdomen.  give drop domstal baby 5 drops thrice day."},{"Patient":"weak, cold then start swettingmy 11 year old daughter started feeling weak and cold earlier with no feaver after afew hours she started sweating as if she was sweating off a feaver but again no feaver.

He head was to hot her back ,feet ,and stomach as well I checked her temperature and it seem normal. Her breath is hot and I was concern she could have internal body fever she's 9months old","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI completely understand your concerns. But don't worry. Most fevers are harmless and are caused by mild infections. Overdressing a child may even cause a rise in temperature.Fever is an important part of the body's defense against infection. Many older infants develop high fevers with even minor illnesses.If you feel that you are not getting a proper temperature by peripheral devices, I would recommend you to take her rectal temperature. Taking your baby's temperature rectally will give you the most accurate result, and the best tools for this are rectal thermometers, which are designed specifically for this purpose. Look for one with a flexible tip and a wide handle that won't let you insert the thermometer more than an inch. You can use a multipurpose digital thermometer as well but be careful and don't insert it more than 1inch.If the rectal temperature is more than 100.4degrees Fahrenheit, you can give her acetaminophen or ibuprofen for it. Also, sponging is useful to bring down the temperature.If fever continues for more than3days or if it's associated with any other symptoms, then do contact us or your  pediatrician.For further  questions, do contact us."},{"Patient":"My boy  yrs old is suffering from cold since a couple of days and has fever since yesterday..i met the doctor today and he prescribed amoxylin powder to be mixed with water to be given twice a day for 5 days..he gave crocin and alex a decongestant too..my boy likes milk and asks for it... i generally switch to isomil when he has episodes of diarrea..as i am not getting isomil can i use neusobee till his course of antibiotics or give him general milk...he has been prescribed anitibiotics for the first time","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI understand your concerns but don't worry about it. If your baby has had a severe case of diarrhea, his body may temporarily have trouble producing lactase, and he may have symptoms of lactose intolerance for a week or two.For respiratory tract infections, Syrup Amoxicillin, Alex and crocin are fine. a humidifier in the room will be of help.Antibiotic induced diarrhoea can occur in some children after long term use because of gut flora affection.

She was admited twice in NICU due to Diarrhea/low hemoglobin, doctor told she has lactogen intolerance, now she is having Lactogen-2. From last two days she got loose motions. Please suggest something.Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMTrue lactose intolerance usually shows up in the grade-school or teen years. While it's possible for symptoms to appear earlier, it's very unlikely that your baby is lactose intolerant.If your baby has had a severe case of diarrhea, his body may temporarily have trouble producing lactase, and he may have symptoms of lactose intolerance for a week or two.Some medications can also cause the body to produce lower levels of lactase, causing temporary lactose intolerance. People with long-term conditions that affect the intestines (like celiac disease or Crohn's disease) sometimes suffer from lactose intolerance as well.So in my opinion you may try  the following measures:1. Keep your child well hydrated during these episodes with oral rehydration therapy such as lemonade, soups, Buttermilk, curd or ORS.2. Hold lactose containing milk products for at least 1week.3. You can try  Syp. Emeset for vomiting episodes and Syp. Acetaminophen for fever episodes if they occurs.4. Start your child on zinc supplement. They are useful in early recovery and also prevent further episodes of diarrhoea.Consult your pediatrician if the child doesn't respond and the oral intake is very poor. For further questions, do contact us."},{"Patient":"My son had a T&A a few days after his second birthday a few days ago. He has been drinking fluids and eating regularly with little complaint. His cheeks are extremely flushed and he feels warm and clammy but has no fever. Should I be concerned about the flushed face?","Doctor":"Hi..this could occur due to ambient temperature changes also. I dont think this is related to the TA surgery he underwent. The other possibility is that he could be in the initial stages of a starting viral illness. If he develops fever, then I suggest you approach your pediatrician in this regard.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"a student of mine had severe right arm pain about 4 days ago and when he was in karate class he had severe chest pain and was winded and his right arm was in severe pain.

Azithromycin belongs to a completely different group of drugs, so it should be fine.2. Give her an antihistamine such as Syp. chlorpheniramine or Syp. Benadryl for allergic reaction.3.

In case she has difficulty in breathing, immediately contact ER at hospital as it might be an anaphylactic reaction.A rare possibility if the lesions are non itchy, is of staphylococcal infection.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea.

The most common cause of loose motion in this age is due to viral infection.The main aim of management is to give adequate amount of fluids to avoid dehydration.Antibiotic is needed only when there are other signs of infection(like pneumonia/meningitis) or stool is mixed with blood or mucus. If vomiting is persistent and oral acceptance is poor I would suggest you to consult a physician immediately.Regards"},{"Patient":"hello, my 3 month old's stool is a combination of mustard watery stool and dark gray firmer stool.  he is on both formula and breast milk (breast milk mainly).  nothing has changed regarding his diet.  this is the first time this has happened. is this normal or cause for concern?","Doctor":"HelloThe transient change in pattern and frequency of stool is normal in early infancy.I won't get worried if the baby is active,playful,accepting feeds well and passing urine at least 4-6 times a day.No treatment is needed as the stool pattern will get normal itself, within few days.I would suggest you to maintain proper hygiene and to avoid the use of feeding bottle for top feeding.The use of feeding bottle may cause nipple confusion and the baby might hurt your nipple leading to soreness.Continue the feeds and if the baby is getting lethargic/irritable or there is decrease in urinary frequency consult your physician."},{"Patient":"Hi, My 10 year old is taking ammocillin for strep and a severe middle ear infection.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello.

It can occur at this age because child tries to bite on anything in her reach leading to infections. You can take the following measures:1. Keep her well hydrated by regular oral rehydration therapy such as lemonade, Buttermilk, or oral rehydration solution available OTC.2. Give her acetaminophen if fever occurs.3. Start Syp. Zinc 20 mg once daily for next 2 weeks.4. Offer her regular feeds and take utmost care for hygiene. 5.

It seems to be due to the rare side effect of azithromycin which can occur sometimes. It occurs due to the release of histamines in body in response to the drug. If your child is not having any respiratory problems, then you can follow the following measures:1. Apply calamine lotion over lesions as they are itchy and uncomfortable for the child.2. Give him an antihistamine like Syp. Benadryl or chlorpheniramine.3. Cold compresses may also help to relieve itching.In case it worsens or the child develops breathing problems, then do contact your pediatrician immediately.Also avoid giving him Azithromycin for any ilness in future.For further questions, do contact us."},{"Patient":"My 5 1/2 month old daughter has a whitehead pimple lookin mark on her left nipple.

I am finding that I can now only eat pudding, soup very soft foods, or my pain inreases in my stomach greatly. What could be the problem? My surgeons say there is nothing more they can find. I still feel like there is something wrong.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. First of all it would be good to know the reason of the abscess creation. Usually there is no reason for abscess to create during the regular colon removal. Such abscess presence usually means that there is a leakage in the intestinal anastomosis (surgical connection between two parts of intestine previously detached). Such leakage results with stool leakage to the abdominal cavity. Such situation causes inflammatory process inside the abdominal cavity causing adhesions creation and anastomosis narrowing. Both adhesions and narrow anastomosis impedes stool passage and results with symptoms like yours. That is why you should have abdominal CT with oral contrast performed (so called enteroclysis) to see if are there any obstacles. Full blood work with CRP (inflammation marker) should be performed to see if there is no other abscess. If no findings in CT, you may have performed laparoscopy as very often adhesions can not be see in the CT. Hope this will help.

Doc said at checkup to discontinue use until released from cardiologist  doc also heard a heart murmur? Does this sound like something to be worried about and what effects will a heart murmur cause?","Doctor":"Hi, I'm doctor Suela!Thanks for asking HCM!More than half of all children have a heart murmur sometimes in their live and most of these heart murmurs don't mean that anything is wrong. Doctors call these \\"functional\\"normal murmur.They are caused by blood rushing through the valves in a normal heart.One common type of normal murmur is Still's murmur ,this murmur is most often heard in healthy kids 3 to 7 years old.A normal murmur can get louder when the blood flows faster through the heart, like when kids have a fever or run around. That's because  the activity makes the heart pump more blood.But even though most murmurs do not mean that anything is wrong, sometimes there is a heart problem that causes the murmur. The heart may have a hole in it, a heart valve may leak, or a valve may not open all the way.Your child has this heart pain that makes doctors suspect for a problem with the heart. So you will need to see a pediatric cardiologist.The pediatric cardiologist will ask your son questions about  short of breath,  chest pain, felt dizzy, or fainted. The doctor also will listen to his  heart with a stethoscope, check his pulse, and listen to his lungs.Sometimes he might want you to get a chest X-ray to see if the heart looks bigger than normal. You also might get an electrocardiogram (EKG), which measures electrical activity of the heart. None of these tests hurt.The heart murmur doesn't have any effect. But if this murmur is caused from a problem with the heart, it might have effects in the future for your child's heart leading to cardiac insuficiency! I hope my answer was helpful to you!

Finding enlarged appendix with 19k WBC and fever and sending you home is more that risky for you and for the doctor who did this. You obviously may be suffering from appendicitis and the only way to diagnose it is to rule all other possible reasons of such conditions. The lump in your belly button can be an umbilical hernia (if it has gotten stuck, may be causing such symptoms as well, and should be treated right away) or persisted urachus ( this is a connection between urinary bladder and umbilical cord which should disappear). Persisted urachus gives umbilicus discharge and urinary tract infections. It is advisable for you to go again to the doctor and have abdominal ultrasound with abdominal wall view, full blood work (CRP and WBC will tell either infection is rising or not), abdominal X-ray (stuck hernia can cause intestines obstruction), urine analysis.

Moving my right leg creates an unbearable pull in the groin area and the pain is so incredibly painful that I am walking hunched over and with a cane.

If you had an inguinal hernia (Small or incomplete), heavy lifting made it worse and you probably have a strangulated hernia. What that means is, there will be a defect in the lining of the lower abdominal muscle and a portion of your intestine protrudes through the defect and gets caught giving you intense pain, nausea, vomiting etc. If you see or feel a bulge in the area near the groin, you definitely have this. I recommend that  you see your doctor as soon as possible or go to the nearest medical facility for an accurate assessment and treatment. You may need surgical repair of the hernia.

Your doctor determines the specific cause of your elevated liver enzymes by reviewing your medications, your signs and symptoms and, in some cases, other tests and procedures. In my opinion it can occur due to Hepatitis, Long term paracetamol use, typhoid fever, pancreatitis, polymyositis, mononucleosis, Cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus infection in your child.As the levels are moderately raised and no other symptom apart from fever, typhoid is a more likely cause.

It is very important because, the many complications such as Neuropathy, Retinopathy, Nephropathy etc (Eye,Nerves,Kidney ) are more common if the diabetes is not well controlled. Your symptoms of abdominal bloating and watery diarrhea could be due to lack of digestive enzymes that your pancreas produces, a condition called \\"Pancreatic Insufficiency\\" . What you might want to do is to have your stool tested for the presence of fat (Fat Globules). This can be done by any good lab. As for Pancreatic cancer, symptoms can vary from absolutely none to weight loss (Unexplained), back pain, abdominal pain, yellow jaundice etc. If you have a very strong family history of cancers, including Pancreatic or esophageal or endometrial (Uterine) cancers, then you may need to have some screening tests.

Analysis:- The dull aching abdominal pain associated with bloating could have been caused by, A)Simple Indigestion // Dyspepsia //due to consumption of  unusual food habits- It coul be self limiting for which you can have a wait and watch policy for a day .If you have taken some unusual sea food/tinned or stored foods kindly always take freshly prepared food from now on.

Such process can last for about a year. During that time the tissues in such areas are getting rebuild so the final scar tissue can be created. Such process can occur as some kind of hardness, however it should not be painful. So if this places are getting also reddish, with some discharge, there might be some pathological process going on. After a month of surgery, it can be a surgical suture which causes inflammatory reaction. It is advisable for you to have that checked by a surgeon. Soft tissues of abdominal wall might be necessary.

Abdominal pain, fever, vomiting suggests something acute. You said the tenderness was over the area of the appendix.

I am not sure if your doctor did a complete blood count to see if you have an elevated white blood cell count which would confirm infection. You need this. Ultrasound can  show the gallbladder which is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Your location of the pain is in the right lower quadrant where your appendix is.

Bowles are fine, no nausea, no fever .","Doctor":"Hello, nschrader6, You stated that you had your gallbladder surgery 3 weeks ago. I am assuming this was done through a laparoscopic approach. Occasionally, during surgery, due to manipulation of the bile duct, the channel that carries the bile from the gallbladder into the intestine, a small stone can escape and plug the duct. If this happens, you will have lot of pain, fever,nausea, vomiting and even yellow jaundice. You don't seem to have those symptoms. The other possibility is a inflammation of the pancreas since it is in close proximity to the gallbladder. I have a feeling that your symptoms of pain under the rib cage and radiation to the back is suggestive of \\"Pancreatitis\\" , may be a mild case. You should talk to the surgeon who performed your surgery and ask him to send you for some blood tests for pancreas, like Serum Amylase, Serum Lipase, Blood count and also a repeat liver enzyme tests.

Left sided lower abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhea is suggestive of inflammation in the colon. Most likely a case of \\"Diverticulitis\\".

This is more common after the age of 40-50, although it can happen in younger individuals. You need to see your doctor or go to the nearest medical facility where they can perform blood tests, check the stool for hidden blood, and also do a CT-Scan of the abdomen and pelvis to make sure that you don't have any complications from diverticulitis such as abscess or rupture (Perforation) which is serious and requires hospitalization, surgical consultation, intravenous fluids, antibiotics etc. It appears you are dehydrated and your weight loss is of concern as well.

Since you have a history of previous cesarean and you have completed term (37 weeks), you should not ignore any kind of pain you perceive. Regular Pain of gradually increasing intensity in the abdomen associated with backache and hardening of the abdomen, mucoid discharge from the vagina are indications that you are starting your labor. The outcome of labor whether a cesarean or a normal delivery depends on the progress of your labor in terms of dilatation of cervix and contractions (pain) with descent of the baby. If everything goes normal, you can deliver vaginally even after a previous cesarean birth. You should visit your gynecologist for an internal examination to check if you are in labor. Also taking pains at home in previous cesarean is not good as at times the previous cesarean scar on uterus disrupts with pain. So monitoring by a doctor is a must. Wishing you all the best.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Both the domstal and aristozyme are safe. Domstal contains domperidone, and aristozyme is an appetite stimulant. I don't think aristozyme is needed. Vomiting in early infancy is mainly due to gastroesophageal reflux due to immaturity of the sphincters. Giving domstal helps as it increases the forward movement of intestine and thus prevents reflux. Domstal drops contains 1 mg/ml. Dose of domstal is 0.2 to 0 3 mg/kg/dose. Considering your baby's weight around 4 kgs the dose will be 1 ml/dose three times a day before feed. Giving acid reducing agent also helps in GER. Lansoprazole is one acid reducing agent. The dose is 0.5mg/kg/day single daily dose. Keep the baby upright after feed and burp well to release the gas.I hope this helps.

Generally, you can have your tonsils and adenoids removed without increasing your risk of infection.Swollen or enlarged adenoids are common in children. Causes include:-Infections with viruses or bacteria. Once an infection clears, the swelling often goes down but sometimes the adenoids remain enlarged.-Allergies.-Often there is no apparent cause.You can start an antibiotic such as Amoxicillin for 7-10 days along with chlorpheniramine for decongestant effect and acetaminophen if fever.In case, she doesn't respond, consult your ENT specialist.Surgery may be recommended if your child has one or more of the following:-difficulty breathing-sleep apnea-recurrent infections-ear infections, middle ear fluid, and hearing loss requiring a second or third set of ear tubesHaving your child's adenoids removed is especially important when repeated infections lead to sinus and ear infections. Badly swollen adenoids can interfere with the ability of the middle ear space to stay ventilated. This can sometimes lead to infections or middle ear fluid causing a temporary hearing loss. So kids whose infected adenoids cause frequent earaches and fluid buildup might also need an adenoidectomy at the time of their ear tube surgery.For further questions, do contact us."},{"Patient":"my daughter who is 12 years old has got chicken pox who is travelling with her schoolmates in excursion.she is far away from home and is unable to take a flight as the tickets are unavailable.my elder daughter who is recovering from chickenpox since a month.please suggest me to cure.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMChicken pox spots do not usually scar unless they are badly scratched.Some spots become infected with germs (bacteria) in some cases. This is the most common complication in children. If this occurs, the surrounding skin becomes red and sore. Antibiotics in the form of creams or medicine may then be needed.Inflammation of the lung (pneumonia) and inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) are rare complications.Vary rarely, other serious complications develop. Therefore, although serious complications are rare, it is best to be watchful. See a doctor if your child develops any worrying symptoms that you are unsure about such as:Breathing problems.Weakness such as a child becoming wobbly on his/her feet.Drowsiness.Fits (convulsions).Pains or headaches which become worse despite paracetamol.Being unable to take fluids, due to a severe rash in the mouth.A severe rash, or a rash which bruises or bleeds into the skin (haemorrhagic rash).Becoming generally more and more unwell.Treatment is mainly aimed at easing symptoms and trying to make your child as comfortable as possible whilst the immune system deals with the virus:Advice on dealing with a high temperature (fever) is detailed below.A soothing cream (emollient) may help the itch. Calamine lotion is useful.A sedating antihistamine (in a tablet or liquid medicine) may help with sleep if itch is a problem. Chlorphenamine (Piriton®) is the one most used.Keep fingernails cut short to stop deep scratching.Use acetaminophen for fever.For further questions,do contact us."},{"Patient":"Hello, My 16 yo son had surgery for fractured fibula 24 hours ago.

She has hep c from meth use. Also takes Percocet from back injury in Iraq. She keeps telling me the v.a. Can t find the reason why it reoccurs. My suspicion is from the hep c or meds. True?","Doctor":"HiIn my opinion, your child seems to be suffering from an allergic tendency. It doesn't seem to be due to medications or hepatitis C infection as it's not persistent. Hives occurs due to hypersensitivity to any substance in the surroundings which the body doesn't accept as does any normal individual.It could be due to any aeroallergen, food products, insects, etc.You should try to find out an allergens 1st. Also , go for IgE and AEC lab tests to help the diagnosis.Antihistamines are the first line of therapy for urticaria.Diphenhydramine (25 mg IV or 50 mg IM or PO) or hydroxyzine (50 mg IM or PO) should be administered if they are available.If any features of anaphylaxis (eg, hypotension, respiratory distress, stridor, gastrointestinal distress, swallowing problems, joint swelling, joint pain) are present, immediate medical intervention should occur.Acute urticaria may progress to life-threatening angioedema and/or anaphylactic shock in a very short time, although it usually presents as rapid-onset shock with no urticaria or angioedema.If associated angioedema is present, especially if laryngeal angioedema (eg, hoarseness, stridor) is suspected, prehospital administration of 0.3-0.5 mg of intramuscular [IM] epinephrine may be warranted. If associated bronchospasm is present, prehospital nebulized albuterol may be warranted.Other measures may be appropriate, such as continuous electrocardiography (ECG); blood pressure and pulse oximetry monitoring; administering IV crystalloids if the patient is hypotensive; and administering oxygen.

However, if they do occur, they can be serious.Complications due to the spread of the infection can occur early in the infection and may include the following:Ear infection (otitis media)Throat infection and collection of pus (abscess)Sinus infectionPneumoniaMeningitis and brain abscessLater complications can (rarely) occur a few weeks after the infection has cleared. These occur as a result of immune reactions in the tissues. These may include:Rheumatic fever (which can damage the heart)Kidney damage (glomerulonephritis)If your child has only cold and no other symptoms, you may give him chlorpheniramine . But in case he develops high fever or any other symptoms, do contact your physician."},{"Patient":"My 4 year old daughter's skin seems to scar very easily, even when they are fairly superficial scrapes or abrasions. She doesn't pick the scabs and she heals easily, however the scars are very dark. She has one scar on her arm that she got from a fall 3 years ago. I have noticed other children of a similar age have scars almost disappear entirely unless they are severe. Any ideas as to why and is there anything I can do to minimize them - the latest one is on her face.","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMIt can take up to 2 years for scars to heal completely. It is important to use scar management techniques on your child’s scar. This will help to make the scar more flat, smooth and flexible. The more flat, smooth and flexible a scar is the less painful and noticeable it is for your child.Scar management techniques are: scar massage, silicone application, and sunblock.TechniquesAfter your child’s sutures have been taken out or dissolved, his or her doctor will let you know when it is time to start scar massage (usually 2-3 weeks after surgery, after the scab on the incision has fallen off).For the first 2 to 4 weeks, you should gently rub the incision for 5 to 10 minutes twice daily along the same direction as the incision. You must use enough pressure to change the color of the incision from pink to pale.After about 4 weeks, you can begin to massage the scar using different motions.Massage in all directions: up, down, side to side, circular, pulling apart, pulling outward, folding together, and crisscross.Oils, such as vitamin E oil, gels such as, aloe vera, and lotions, such as Eucerine®,Aquaphor ®, or Mederma®, are moisturizing and can be used to help soften the scar and make scar massage easier.Your child may also be given special tape with silicone on it. Your child’s doctor will tell you how to use it.ALWAYS use sunblock SPF 30 or greater with UVA/UVB coverage on your child’s scar.For further questions,do contact us."},{"Patient":"My 2 1/2 year old son has had red, itchy palms for a couple of days now. This afternoon while taking his shoes and socks off I found redness on the sides of his soles, it does not seem to be itchy. He has been acting normal. No fever, no unusual behavior or acting sick. I have given him Benadryl when his hands are bothering him and that seems to help. Is it allergic or something else?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMIn my poinion, your child may have any of the following problems;Food Allergies - Some individuals are allergic to certain types of food. Milk, eggs, peanuts, seafood, and soy are popular sources of food allergens. Although food allergies result in several overt physical signs and abnormal systemic changes, integumentary (skin) changes may prove to be the most noticeable of them all. Itching of the palms and soles of the feet is one of the earliest signs of a food allergy.Eczema - This is a broad disease condition that has many subtypes that are mostly characterized by itchy palms, feet, and the skin in general. A less common type of eczema is known for its hallmark symptoms of itchy palms and soles of the feet. This condition is known as dyshidrosis or palmoplantar dermatitis. The digits (fingers) also itch on their sides. The itchiness worsens during nighttime and during warm weather conditions.Atopic dermatitis - This is just one subclass of eczema characterized by flaky, scaly, thick, very itchy, and reddened skin rashes. The cause of atopic dermatitis has been attributed to histamine intolerance and allergy, among other causes.Treatment for itchy palms will have to depend on what's causing it. The challenge, though, is that some doctors and dermatologists have a hard time diagnosing the exact condition. Nonetheless, treating the root cause of the itch will eventually halt the symptoms of itchy palms.For food allergies, you need to identify and avoid the allergen. Most forms of eczema have no real treatment. The management is just centered on relieving symptoms, most especially the itchiness felt. For atopic dermatitis, treatment is primarily centered on good skin care and the application of emollients that relieve swelling and allergic reactions. Antibiotics, antihistamines, and steroids are jointly used to relieve itchy palms and itchiness in general.For definitive diagnosis, I would advice a dermatologist opinion.For further questions, do contact us."},{"Patient":"hi, my boyfriend is having severe pains in the groin area. it alleviates when he walks. there is no swelling or redness.

I believe she partially snorted it from her throat up bc she is pulling at her nose too. She can breathe, eat and drink. When I look at her throat with a flashlight I see the noodle hanging vertical. I had cut the noodles so it's not too long.","Doctor":"HiGenerally, small pieces of food stuck in the throat will dissolve on their own by being exposed to saliva from the mouth. You can wait for this to happen if symptoms are not overly troublesome. Chewing gum or sucking on lozenges increase the amount of saliva produced and can help with this process.Sometimes the piece of food might be up so high that it actually has to come out your nose. That would take a lot of blowing or snorting, and having food come up through your nose feels really gross.If your child is fine, take some time. It will be fine.For further questions, do contact us."},{"Patient":"my 4 year old son keeps telling me that his stomach hurts and when I touch it he screams. it feels very hard or swollen almost like he is pregnant.

Zinconia/ Zn 20 5 ml once daily for next 14 days- For oral ulcers. If your baby's eating solid food, cold or frozen foods — such as ice pops — may do the trick. But don't give him hot, spicy food or citrus, which could make his mouth hurt more.You might try a teething gel or cream, but apply it carefully — touching the sore can hurt. For a home remedy, combine 1 part hydrogen peroxide and 1 part water. Dab (gently!) on the canker sore with a cotton swab. Follow by dabbing on a little milk of magnesia.

For bed bugs: declutter beds and vaccine clean all the stuff.

For heart trouble, management depends upon the diagnosis. You can consult a pediatric cardiologist for it.3. Asthma needs first and foremost removal of allergens in the surroundings of the kid. You can use steroids inhalers, beta 2 blockers, leukotriene antagonists depending on his clinical stage of asthma and response to treatment.4.

Approach your doctor, if:- Baby lethargic and not feeding well- watery stools, not improving in next 2 days- associated with fever, decreased urine output or any other symptom.At present, continue breastfeeding with proper burping.

After the stool has changed from black to another color, it should NEVER go back to black. The poop should also NEVER be red (like blood) or white (that means another medical problem altogether). Bottom line, as long as the poop isn’t black, red, or white, another color is acceptable. The most common colors are yellow, brown, orange, and green.Normal baby poop is anything from pretty watery with a few particles (like seeds) to thick mush or paste.

What do I do about her poop? She poops roughly 5 times a day","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to the HCMDuring infancy, you may observe different shades of poops and variable frequencies. There's a wide variety of normal pooping behavior among babies: Some poop after every meal and some only once or twice a week. What's most important is that your baby's poop is coming out reasonably soft. Once you start changing your baby's input to solid foods – rice cereal, pureed bananas, and so on – you'll almost instantly notice a change in her output, especially if she's breastfed. Green poops are usually due to increased lactogen and sugars in diet. As a general rule, if you see anything completely out of the ordinary in your baby's diaper, call the doctor. There are several variations on poop that suggest a serious problem:-Thick black poop made up mostly of digested blood (called melena). It's dark and tarry like meconium but a bit firmer and less sticky.-Poop consisting almost entirely of red blood, known as \\"currant jelly poop,\\" which indicates a severe intestinal problem.- Persistent Pale, chalky, clay-colored poop (acholic poop) that signals liver or gallbladder failure.

Could it be a food allergy?","Doctor":"HiIt seems your grand daughter has pimples developing in arms and back. Most pimples are caused by an accumulation of oil and bacteria which clog the pores. For this, a cream or wash containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide may be beneficial. Washing thoroughly, especially after sweating, is also recommended.Pimples are often caused by bacteria and naturally occurring bodily oils which can clog and cause a minor infection within the pores. The first step in avoiding this is to wash regularly, once or more per day, to cut down on oil. Some individuals may have an overproduction of oils, so products which contain salicylic acid are often beneficial because they help dry the skin and draw pus from infected pores.Sweat can also contribute to pimples and should be kept at bay. Those who sweat profusely may have to wash more often than others and wear an antiperspirant. It is important to note, however, that antiperspirants can also clog pores, making the problem worse. Choosing an hypoallergenic variety may help. Avoiding products with fragrances and other skin irritants may also reduce skin reactions.For further questions, do contact us."},{"Patient":"My wife, 35, is currently having sharp pains in her lower right abdomen .

It happens due to bleeding from emissary veins in space between aponeurosis and periosteum of skull. As it may lead to significant blood loss, an immediate physical exammination is needed.

Thanks!!","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to the HCMDuring infancy, you may observe different shades of poops and variable frequencies. There's a wide variety of normal pooping behavior among babies: Some poop after every meal and some only once or twice a week. What's most important is that your baby's poop is coming out reasonably soft. Once you start changing your baby's input to solid foods – rice cereal, pureed bananas, and so on – you'll almost instantly notice a change in her output, especially if she's breastfed.As a general rule, if you see anything completely out of the ordinary in your baby's diaper, call the doctor. There are several variations on poop that suggest a serious problem:-Thick black poop made up mostly of digested blood (called melena). It's dark and tarry like meconium but a bit firmer and less sticky.-Poop consisting almost entirely of red blood, known as \\"currant jelly poop,\\" which indicates a severe intestinal problem.- Persistent Pale, chalky, clay-colored poop (acholic poop) that signals liver or gallbladder failure.

This swallowed blood is not harmful to the baby.Meanwhile, to manage the pain and bleeding, try to lessen the engorgement by expressing some milk, either by hand expressing or with a breast pump, before the baby latches on to make it easier for him to latch on. You can also apply warm compresses or take a warm shower before nursing to soften the breasts. Alternate your positions for feedings, and until your breasts heal you might want to start with the breast that is the least sore and limit the time on that breast. You should continue to breastfeed frequently, 8 to 12 times per 24 hours, as this will prevent your baby from sucking too vigorously at each feeding due to hunger. To promote skin healing, clean your breasts gently with a mild soap during your daily shower and rinse well. Then apply a pea-sized portion of your breast milk or medical grade modified lanolin on your nipples to prevent dryness. Use non-plastic lined bras and/or bra pads, and change the pads frequently. Try some relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or listening to soothing music before and during feedings to ease the discomfort."},{"Patient":"my 4 yr old son has episodes where he takes a deep breath and then he get very tired causing him to fall asleep. the dr say that he is having an asthmia attack because his oxygen level was 95 and with a nebulizer treatment he went up to 98.

But if the child is drowsy and less responsive and you feel that the reflexes are not normal for him, then do go for an immediate pediatrician examination. A build up of carbon-dioxide in the blood due to obstruction in respiratory passages can lead to similar symptoms."},{"Patient":"Dear Docter my son 3yrs old he bite an sucked the thermometer with cover when I saw he is doing like this suddenly I took a thermometer from his mouth and I saw little bit of mercury when opened the cover and I gave mouth wash to him and didn t took him to doctor still now.it happened one week back.","Doctor":"Hello.

I m concerned about the 5yr old. She is not potty trained. Is this common with selective mutism? Also their mother is wanting to home school. Your opinion?What can I do to help as a grandparent? Thank you","Doctor":"HiIn selective mutism, it's important to understand that when the mutism happens, the child is not voluntarily refusing to speak but is literally unable to speak, feeling frozen. In time, they learn to anticipate the situations that provoke mutism and do all they can to avoid them.Experts believe SM is a phobia of talking. Most children will work their way through SM with sympathetic support, although they may remain reserved and anxious in social situations.With appropriate handling and treatment, most children overcome selective mutism – but the older they are, the longer it takes.They should gradually progress from relaxing in their school or nursery, to saying single words and sentences to one person, before eventually being able to speak freely to all people in all settings.Treatment does not focus on the speaking itself, but focuses on reducing the anxiety that your child has for speaking to and being overheard by people outside their immediate circle of family and friends.The need for individual treatment can be avoided if family and staff in early years settings work together to reduce this anxiety by creating a positive environment for the child. This means:-not letting the child know you are anxious-reassuring them that they'll be able to speak when they're ready-concentrating on having fun-praising all efforts the child makes to join in and interact with others (such as passing and taking toys, nodding, pointing)-showing no surprise when the child speaks, but responding warmly as you would to any other childAs well as these environmental changes, older children may need individual support to overcome their anxiety.The most effective forms of treatment are behavioural therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 48 year old female. A week ago experienced very strong pain in upper middle abdomen , couldn t walk stright, just was hunching over. The pain has gone in couple hours/resolved with ibuprofen .

The ultrasound findings state gallblader partially contracted with no convincing gallstones seen. I just wandering what can I do next, as frighten that the pain may come again, didn t like to experience it again. Many thanks!","Doctor":"Hi welcome to health care magic forum. It has some thing to do with the gall bladder only. The gall bladder will be constantly contracting to evacuate the bladder to allow the fresh bile to occupy the bladder. It could be physiological or pathological due to partial obstruction of the bile duct. Other possibility is the peptic ulcer. I advise you to consult a gastroenteralogist  for diagnosis and treatment. You may need to get the gastroscopy along with other routine tests for confermation of the disease and to prevent the further attacks of pain. Besides i advise you to follow some diet recommendations to prevent the pain bouts. Avoid taking more of spices, chillies, junk foods, and oily foods.

Despite its presence in hundreds of common products, the incidence of acetone poisoning is very low. This is because the liver is able to take acetone and break it down into chemicals usable by the body.The body is able to handle up to 200ml without serious consequences.Oral breathing is helpful for mild ingestion."},{"Patient":"My 20 month old fell and has a swollen right eye that looks as though it will go black plus a bump on her forehead. She does not seem to be in too much pain as it happened about 6 hours ago. What are the chances that there is bone damage. I didn't see the fall but stairs were involved.","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to the HCMFor a simple black eye that's nothing more than a  bruise, you can give your child the appropriate dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen if he's uncomfortable. If there's swelling and your child can tolerate it, you can apply an ice pack for 15-minute periods several times a day during the first 48 hours.The blue/black coloring of a black eye is caused by blood pooling under the thin skin of the eyelid and the area around the eye. This can happen after trauma to the eye area, and in this case you'll want to make sure that the eye hasn't been injured. But it can also happen because of trauma to the forehead.Check with your doctor to make sure that your child's black eye is simply a bruise, especially if you're not sure how it happened. If both of your child's eyes are black after a head injury – or if he has a nosebleed or bleeding in the white of his eye – his doctor will probably want to check him out.If your child is having vision problems, isn't able to move his eye normally, or is in severe pain, he needs immediate medical attention.

Tonight we noticed that her forehead is swollen and feels squishy as if it is filled with fluid. No temperature and feels fine part from the tireness. We are also only back from holiday in Dubai","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMIt seems that your child has developed an abscess over forehead. Make sure your child avoids touching, pushing, popping, or squeezing the abscess because that can spread the infection or push it deeper inside the body, making things worse. Prevent the spread of infection by not allowing your child to share clothes, towels, washcloths, sheets, or anything else that may have touched the abscess.To help the abscess open up and drain, try applying a warm compress. Do this a few times a day. Always wash your hands before and after touching the abscess.If the abscess opens on its own and drains and the infection seems to clear up in a couple of days, your child should be OK.If your child's abscess doesn't heal with home treatment or you notice any of the following symptoms, call your doctor:-The abscess becomes more painful, swollen, and red.-Red streaks develop around the infected area.-Your child develops a fever or chills.The doctor will examine the abscess to decide if it needs to be drained. This is done by making a small cut in the abscess that allows the pus to seep out. Medicine is given beforehand to numb the area. Then, gauze might be applied to absorb the fluid in the wound and help the area heal. If your child has this procedure, make sure to follow instructions regarding the cleaning and bandaging of the wound.The doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. If so, be sure your child takes all the medicine until it's gone — even if he or she starts feeling better.Call the doctor if the wound doesn't begin to heal after a few days, or if it comes back."},{"Patient":"My eighteen month old has bumps in her legs and arms at first I thought they were mosquito bites but she seems to have more today and I think I see one or two come out of now where as the day goes on.

They may bite any exposed areas of skin while an individual is sleeping. Common locations for bedbug bites are the face, neck, hands, and arms.A bedbug bite is painless and is generally not noticed. The bites may be mistaken for a rash of another cause. Small, flat, or raised bumps on the skin are the most common sign. Symptoms include redness, swelling, and itching.Typically, no treatment is required for bedbug bites. If itching is severe, steroid creams or oral antihistamines may be used for symptom relief."},{"Patient":"i have daughter age 11 years old and since she born can't stand up easily only by help she has weakness in lower part of her body and now her feet turnd to inside  and not normal both likes short  and Doctors in my country said there is no treatment in the world up to now for this sikness please help.thank you","Doctor":"Hi I did review your concern.I believe your child probably has cerebral palsy or some genetic muscular or neurological disorder, all of which right now have no breakthrough treatment available.

It is a hole in the abdominal wall through witch abdominal cavity contents are getting out of it. Usually some lump is present but as you have said you are overweight so the hernia may be hidden inside the fat tissue. The pain can come and go, can be triggered by coughing or lifting some heavy objects. If it is really hernia, there is a risk for intestines to get stuck in it and result with ischeamia and necrosis. That is why you should visit your doctor and do not neglect it. To rule hernia out, abdominal ultrasound should be performed.

Such symptoms can be caused due to diet causing bloating, diverticles or some other large intestine disease. It can be also caused by stress and can be not significant. However as in left abdominal area mostly large intestine is located it is advisable to have some diagnostics before diet change etc. Before upper GI endoscopy you should have abdominal ultrasound and full blood work, liver tests, pancreas tests, pregnancy test performed. After this tests, if no findings, colonoscopy might be necessary especially if you also suffer from constipations, blood or mucus in stool. Only after this tests you can explain your symptoms with bad diet. Beans, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, sprouts, onions and garlic can cause such feeling if large amount consumed.

You can give porridges,  rice with dal, idli, vegetable soups, fruit juices and boiled fruits like apple. Avoid sugar as much as possible. Can add ghee to the food. This is presuming that you are from India. If not most of what I said applies except  certain food items I mentioned.  All preparations made at home cleanly are best for the child.

In addition, you may also have a cough, high temperature (fever), headache, feel sick, feel tired, find swallowing painful, and have swollen neck glands. The tonsils may swell and become red. Pus may appear as white spots on the tonsils. Symptoms typically get worse over 2-3 days and then gradually go, usually within a week. All you need to do is start an antibiotic such as Amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate combination for 7-10 days.Continue antihistamine, decongestant, paracetamol also.In case of no relief even after 48 hrs of antibiotics, do go for an ENT check up.For further information on this,do contact us."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor I am having naturolax occasionally.

This has no side effects and is a remarkable medication for constipation.Since it has only fibre to add bulk to stools, and no associated drug, its completely safe if given for constipation even in kids.

Both the welt and the itchiness may last for several days.

Some take several days to have any noticeable effect. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose several times to get it to the level that helps most.•     Exercises: your child may be asked to 'practise the tics'. This means doing them deliberately, with your support, repeatedly. This method can help your child remain tic-free for longer.•     Sport: another method is to find a sport or extracurricular activity that helps. Precise and controlled activities, such as karate, have helped some children.•     Relaxation therapy: this can help your child, if tics are worse when he is under pressure. Simple exercises he can learn to do himself are best, such as breathing exercises to control stress.•     Behaviour treatments: there are a range of behavioural treatments aimed at helping your child to control tics more effectively. Some of these look promising in research.Getting support from other parents and families who have a child with Tourette’s can make life better for you.Children need help to make friends, and they will benefit from meeting other children with TS.Parents often note their child manages to hold on to some of his tics at school, but then ‘explodes’ at home with the build up.This can make life hard for everyone, including siblings, who also need help and support.Tourettes Action can offer information and details of local support."},{"Patient":"I am looking for possible insight as to my son s medical problems. At age 12(2 yrs ago) he had appendectomy for perforated appendix. Adhesions noted in surgeons report.

When the pain is the worst he hunches over, not able to stand straight. Recently tried anti-spasmotic bentyl, did not help pain at all. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

It looks like your son is suffering from partial bowel obstruction. And it seems he has been diagnosed but not treated. This condition is very probable due to abdominal adhesions. As this can be partial only, there are times when stools flows freely and times when it gets blocked. Such blocked stool keeps accumulating and causes increased pressure what will sooner or later cause its passage. Such condition is very hard to visualize with tests. In my opinion, when no other explanation has been found, you should contact a surgeon and ask him about laparoscopy. Laparoscopy is a kind of surgery where the camera and tools are inserted into abdominal cavity through small holes. Laparoscopy will tell if there are any adhesions (probably there is a lot of them)  and if so, surgeons will be able to remove this adhesions. Hope this will help.

Any child with stools that are large, hard, dry, and accompanied by painful bowel movements, soiling between bowel movements, or blood on the outside of the stool may have constipation.Constipation in toddlers isn't usually a sign of any serious disease. Most often it's caused by a problem that's easy to solve, like diet or ignoring the urge to go.When toddler constipation is a problem, you can try one of these remedies:Diet. To soften the stools and make them easier to pass, increase the amount of fluid and fiber your child gets each day. High-fiber foods include fruits and fruit juices that contain sorbitol (prune, mango, pear), vegetables (broccoli, peas), beans, and whole-grain breads and cereals. Limit foods that can increase constipation, such as fatty foods, banana that are low in fiber.Exercise. Make sure your toddler gets out to play for at least 30 to 60 minutes a day. Moving the body keeps the bowels moving, too.Improve bowel habits. Encourage your child to use the bathroom at regular times during the day, especially after meals and whenever he or she feels the urge to go. Let your toddler sit for at least 10 minutes at a time. Put a small stool under your child's feet -- the leverage will help him push. Reward your toddler for using the toilet with a special story or a sticker so it becomes a positive experience.Medicine: you can also give syp. Lactulose to treat constipation."},{"Patient":"My 4 year old daughter has 3 nickel-sized red spots on her inner thigh (perfectly round); none elsewhere.

When you are calm and focused, you are more likely to be able to connect with your child, helping him or her to be calm and focused as well.-Keep things in perspective. -Don’t sweat the small stuff and be willing to make some compromises. -Believe in your child. Think about or make a written list of everything that is positive, valuable, and unique about your child. Trust that your child can learn, change, mature, and succeed.-Follow a routine-Sign your child up for a sport, art class, or music. At home, organize simple activities that fill up your child’s time. These can be tasks like helping you cook, playing a board game with a sibling, or drawing a picture. Try not to over-rely on the television or computer/video games as time-fillers.

These five drug classes are mandated for testing by the Federal Government.Environmental contaminants are the big problem for hair testing. Microscopic amounts of smoke and powders cling to the hair shaft and wind up as a trace amount on a false-positive hair test. To make matters worse, contaminants cling to dark, coarse hair much more readily-making African-Americans, Latinos and Asians significantly more susceptible to a false-positive result. According to one report, people with dark hair are 10 to 50 times more likely to test positive for drug use from a hair-follicle drug test.So in my opinion, if your grandson is not exposed to any of the drugs, then it might be just a false positive report due to contamination.For further questions, do contact us."},{"Patient":"Hello, my Baby is 14 months old, has ear infection and started antibiotic 3 days ago.

How many days it will take to get ok. He is unable to sleep whole night crying a lot. pls help","Doctor":"HiAsthalin is the brand name of a medicine called salbutamol used in asthma. If the diagnosis is cold, then Asthalin is not required. It should be replaced with Sinarest Drops (0.2 ml) 2-3 times daily. If the nose is blocked I suggest you put one Sinarest Vapocaps in boiling water (steam) near the bed in the room where the infant sleeps. Also use nasal saline drops and nasal suction for blocked nose. Infants are unable to take milk if their nose is blocked and they cannot breathe. If steam inhalation with Sinarest Vapcaps solves the problem, there is no need to take any medicine by mouth.Also, if coughing is not resolving and is associated with fever and breathing problems, I would recommend a chest X Ray.Also , gastroesophageal reflux disease can be cause of coughing in an infant. So in my opinion, take following measures:-keep head end of your child slightly elevated while lying down.-burp him properly after every feed.For further information on this, do contact us."},{"Patient":"My 9 year old daughter has been diagnosed with CPP.

Because babies spend much more time in this deepest stage of sleep, they're more likely to sweat during the night than adults or even older children.Sweating is very common, but excessive sweating could mean that something isn't right. Excessive sweating – especially when eating – can be a sign of congenital heart disease, for example, as well as various infections and sleep apnea.Overheating is a risk factor for SIDS. The room your baby sleeps in should be warm – 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit – not hot.Dress your baby in the amount of clothing that you'd be comfortable sleeping in without covers. Resist the urge to bundle her up, and keep blankets, quilts, and comforters out of her crib.As a rule of thumb, remember that if you're too hot, your baby probably is too.

Feeling of incomplete evacuation, bloting and gas are all suggestive of this problem. When there is build up of gas this can make you nauseated and even bring on vomiting. Excercise should help movement of the gas in the intestine and give you the feeling to go to the bathroom. If you have had these symptoms for more than six months, you should really try to get on a regimen of high fiber diet, drink plenty of fluids and continue excercises. Whole grain ,fresh vegetables and fruits are very helpful. I also want you to look into an over the counter product called \\"Digestive Advantage-Irritable Bowel \\". Start taking one tablet everyday with a glass of water. This helps to regulate your system. If you are also having some acidity problem , taking an over the counter Omeprazole (Prilosec-OTC) 20 mg/day about one hour before your main meal of the day will be very helpful.

You said that you did have results after taking senokot. It is possible that the evacuation may not be complete. You might want to take stool softener like Surfak or Doxidan once a day for a few days. Main thing is, your dietary habits. I recommend that you go on a high fiber diet which includes whole grain cereal. fresh fruits and vegetables along with adequate amounts of water. Also regular excercise program, like walking 2-3 miles/day three times a week will be helpful. Any kind of infection of the intestine usually causes dirrhea and even fever and chills. In your case that is unlikely. Sometimes, laxative tablet itself can irritate the lining and give some aches and pains. Hope this helps.

Sometimes the food tends to move upwards through the esophagus instead of downwards towards the stomach which leads to hiccups and vomiting too.

The main treatment is to give your child lots to drink; this may be by giving special rehydration drinks i.e.oral rehydration solution (ORS).Since its more than a week now, start giving probiotics like enterogermina sachets twice daily.Hold lactose i.e. milk and milk products.Start Sup.

I m 21 years old. i was admitted last Mar 31,2012 due to abdominal cramps, they thought it was appendicitis but it is not bouncing pain and my appendix was not visualized in the ultrasound. so it was ruled out as UTI.

Especially if the doctor who has performed the ultrasound didn't find the appendix. It simply means that your appendix could not be found with ultrasound. So if it was not found, it\`s inflammation cannot be ruled out. Moreover about 50% of appendicitis is treated with antibiotics with very good response. But such inflammation can recur. So it is possible that you have the appendicitis again. This  should be checked as soon as possible. So you should have abdominal ultrasound and fool blood work, liver and pancreas tests, urine analysis. Such symptoms can be also caused by mentioned by you uti or kidney stones, ovarian inflammation, ovarian cyst rupture, pregnancy or even endometriosis. It is strongly advisable for you to visit gynecologist and have transvaginal ultrasound performed. Hope this will help.

Most bleeding is minor and you may only see a little coating of blood on the tongue.If your child has bleeding:Small amount of bleeding: -Have your child drink ice water and sit down and rest.Large amount of bleeding or bleeding that does not stop: Bring your child to the emergency department immediately .Prevent bleeding: Do the following to prevent or reduce the risk of bleeding from your child's tonsil areas:Do not smoke around your child, or take him to smoky areas after surgery.Do not let your child do rough or active play activities. No wrestling, running, or yelling.Use ice and ice packs on your child. Put ice in a plastic bag and wrap the bag in a towel. Have your child hold it to the front of his neck or use as directed.Avoid letting your child drink liquids or eat foods that are hot, spicy, or have sharp edges (such as chips).Help him brush his teeth gently. Help him rinse his mouth gently to remove blood and mucus. He must avoid harsh gargling or tooth brushing.Tell your child not to cough, clear his throat, or blow his nose."},{"Patient":"Hi,My 10 month old son has had serious projectile vomit twice in the past 4 days, and that was after eating dinner.

Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"HiWelcome to HCMWhile it’s common for kids under three to vomit, the causes for upchucking can vary.Vomiting after dinner if occurred twice in past 4 days seems unlikely to be due to any serious problem.In my opinion it can be due to reasons such as over eating, or mild gastritis. I don't advice any anti emetic treatment for this.

She has developed a nappy rash , which doesn't seem to get cured with common creams available for  nappy rash (bepanthene , sudo)...  I have also applied fucicort (corticosteroid ) . It showed improvement on the first day but again it's the same.. Please suggest","Doctor":"HiWelcome to HCMMost cases of nappy rashes are due to a reaction of the skin to urine and poo (faeces, stools, or motions). Non response of your child to common nappy rash cream can be due to associated bacterial or fungal infection.A fungus called candida commonly thrives on the inflamed skin. (This is the germ that causes thrush.) Candida can cause a more inflamed rash which may include darker red spots spreading around the nappy area ('nappy thrush').I would suggest creams having barrier properties along with anti fungal and anti bacterial properties.Also take following measures to prevent further damage;-Leave the nappy off as much as possible-Change nappy often.-Wipes are as effective as water. -After washing, make sure the baby's bottom is properly dry.-Do not use powder such as talcum powder.-Rub on a thin layer of barrier cream or ointment just before putting on each nappy. Do not apply too much, as this may reduce the 'breathability' of the nappy.-Don't use tight-fitting plastic pants over nappies."},{"Patient":"Hi .

Left lower abdominal pain can be caused by diverticulitis, left urinary tract infection, ovarian inflammation or ovarian cyst or pregnancy. In some cases left inguinal hernia might occur with such symptoms. Middle stomach pain can be caused by peptic ulcer, gall stones, pancreas disease. As you can see it is quite a lot of possibilities. That is why you should have some tests to find out what is wrong. It is advisable for you to have abdominal ultrasound, fool blood work with liver and pancreas enzymes, urine and stool tests. If you find this tests negative, upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy might be necessary. Hope this will help.

It might be an aeroallergen.Since allergic reactions can recur, so it's important to be careful and try to identify and then avoid the things from which your child is allergic.Where possible, breast feed your child for at least 6 months. Breastfeeding provides a nutritious and balanced food source for your baby, reduces the risk of gastrointestinal tract infections and may also reduce the risk of developing allergic disease in early life.Delay the introduction of solid foods until the child is 4-6 months of age. Thereafter, foods can be introduced, with a new food introduced every 2-3 days. Introduce one new food at a time so that any reactions can be readily identified. If he suffers again, try using anti histamines. If it doesn't respond, do go for your clinician advice after a proper examination.In case of further questions, do call back"},{"Patient":"Hi Sir..this is priyankaI would request you to suggest me which formula can i use for my 3month old baby boy.he is having cleft lip.hence breast feed is not happenning.present i am using farex formula1.but since 20days he has no weight gain.can i switch to other formula which u suggest...please advisethanks in advance!!!","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to the HCMInfants with cleft lip can usually be fed by breast or regular bottle. Some help from the nurses or infant-feeding specialists may be needed to ensure that the infant can get a tight seal around the nipple.For breastfeeding babies, the soft breast tissue often will fill the opening in the lip and/or gum line well, sealing off the mouth and allowing the baby to create adequate suction. Sometimes it is helpful for the mother to hold a finger across the cleft during feeding.Swallowing noises and a bowel movement after feeding are signs that breast-feeding is going well. If the baby is \\"noisy\\" with feeding, making clicking or kissing noises, suction may not be adequate.Mothers who choose to bottle-feed their babies with cleft lip should try using nipples with a wider base, or their infants may need specialty bottles or nipples.When starting a feeding, hold the baby in a slightly upright position. Touch the baby's lower lip with the nipple. When the baby latches on, direct the nipple slightly downwards.Try to keep the nipple in the center of the baby's mouth. Do not let it slip up into the cleft.In my opinion, you may go for corrective surgery of the cleft lip as your child is already 3 months old.Formula milk like NanPro 1 and Lactogen 1 are advisable. They should be properly constituted ( every scoop per 30 ml water.For further information, do call back."},{"Patient":"my two and a half year old has a very sore throat - red, no white blotches i can see.

Points in favour of bacterial infection are:-high temperature-white pus-filled spots on the tonsils-no cough-swollen and tender lymph nodes (glands)There's no specific treatment for tonsillitis, but there are several things that can help alleviate the symptoms.

Now she has even severe cold.as it s been 2 weeks I am worried a lot.. Please help","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMThe breastfed baby's stools may change in color, and baby may even have an occasional green stool. Consistently green stools, however, may indicate a problem, such as imbalance in foremilk/hindmilk, or sensitivity to something in mom's diet, such as dairy. Green stools do not always indicate a problem.If your babies activity and weight gain is normal, it is very unlikely to have green poops due to some infection. So in my opinion there is no need for any medical treatment. Only check if he is properly breastfed and is getting hind milk properly.Whether your child has a cough, a cold, or the flu, you can try these gentle, effective, and safe home remedies:1.Have a humidifier or a cool-mist vaporizer going in your child's bedroom when she's sleeping, resting, or playing in the room.2. Saline nasal Drops easily available help clear the nose when kids are too young to blow their nose. For babies, a bulb syringe really comes in handy if a stuffy nose interferes with breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. Try using it about 15 minutes beforehand.3. Vapor rubs.If still child continues to have cold, try phenargan syrup 2.5 ml twice daily for3-5 days.In case of any further questions, do call back."},{"Patient":"i have a son who's 6 years old he has always been have suffer from convulsion since he was 2 yrs old..he's doctor gave him  valprois acid, depakene which is anti covulsion. his doctor advise me to get his cbc and sgpt/alt the result is 50.7 but the normal is 41.how was it is he safe?","Doctor":"hi As you are using valproate for your kid, it is right thing to get the periodic Liver function tests done and your report is not abnormal as it is high normal only.No need to worry for now ,you can safely continue valproate."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor My kid is one year  old.N she is suffering from some viral infection .Frequent fever n loose motions are going on since last one week.

If I were your doctor, after a general physical examination, I would advise you to avoid food from outside to prevent any kind of intestinal infections causing the cramping. I would also go for a routine blood test like a CBC, and a routine stool and urine test to rule out any parasitic infections and/or a UTI respectively and treat it if positive. In addition, an ultrasound of abdomen would rule out any other intra-abdominal pathology.

Not painful to touch, just constant dull/achey pain in that one localized area. No fever , vomiting , etc!","Doctor":"Hello, suzanna, This is little difficult guess work for that area of the abdomen. Atleast you don't have, fever,vomiting etc. Also you don't mention diarrhea or constipation. The symptoms started rather sudden and of short duration. Spleen is located under the left rib cage. Also, part of the large bowel called \\"Splenic flexure\\" is there. Part of the stomach area if herniated can be there as well. I am not sure if the problem started after any kind of strenuous activity . Also, we have to know if there was any kind of trauma or injury to that area. Heavy lifting or bending can bring on small hernias or rupture. You also state the bulge is not painful to touch, that rules out any kind of inflammation related lump. If you feel any gas moving in that bulge, then we have to think about a small hernia or even trapped gas in that splenic flexure of the bowel. Make sure you are not constipated and if you are you can take a laxative such as Dulcolax  tablet or suppository. Keep a close watch on the swelling and if it seems to be enlarging, you do need to see a physician for a good exam.

Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever?If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing and I suggest you meet a paediatric pulmonologist who is near your place.

I wanted to know if i am right about it. Is it harmful for my infant in any way to get her nails painted?","Doctor":"Hello! Infants have tendency to put fingers in their mouth and these nail polishes may contain hazardous chemicals, so its better that exposure to foreign bodies be minimal."},{"Patient":"hi, my son lost his front upper teeth due to fall in june 2012.now its around 4 month  and no sign of permanent tooth. he is 5.9 yr old.

She repeats the same words over and over and makes alot of gestures. Could these br signs of delay","Doctor":"hi ! i understood your query , every child has  slightly varied development stages , some children may start walking at the age of 10 months  and some may walk at around 16 months. , need not worry , walking is not the only parameter to judge the development delay. Did the child have any history of delay in crying just after birth etc.? Is sitting to standing problem to her? As far as speech development, you need to talk to the child more. More the stimulus more is the development ."},{"Patient":"hi, my baby is 25 days old, he was crying a lot so we gave him colimex drops, 6 drops, and now i find that he is sleeping a lot and not even getting up for feed since 4 hours. i find reduced reflexes .... is it possible? ...... what r the probable side effects and remedy...","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to healthcaremagic. A baby of 25days old knows only one language to express his or her feelings. That is crying. Usually, the newborns sleep for lot of time throughout the day and they only cry when they are hungry. All babies of this age usually get hungry every 2-3hours. Other reaason of crying will be not able to sleep due to some abnormality like pain. The drug colimex is given when there is colicky pain in the abdomen because of abnormal motility of the intestines which is rarely seen in newborns until something is grossly wrong. Also, the side effect of this medicine is drowsiness and excess sleep. I would advice you not to give this medicine to the newborn kid. Only breast milk at regular intervals should be given. From each breast, the milk has to be given for at least 20-25 min before switching to the other breast. If after that also child is crying, please show the child to a neonatologist or a paediatrician, they will help you. Motherhood is a hard but very special gift. Take care of your kid."},{"Patient":"Hi, when I recently gave birth my baby had a sticky eye, the midwife said it was a blocked tear duct. It eventually got worse and I took him to the doctors, they did a swab and I was told it was staphylococcus infection? Did I give him this during childbirth and if so whats wrong with me? Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to healthcaremagic. Baby with sticky eye at birth means that the child congenital conjunctivitis which might have achieved from the mother while passing from the birth canal. Everyone has some bacteria or other micro-organisms in the body which is called normal body flora. Staphylococcus is one of the bacteria from that flora. The newborns are weak in immunity, so that is the reason why, the baby has got eye infection. Proper application of appropriate eye drops and eye ointment will do the needful. Please contact an ophthalmologist for the same. Hope your child gets well soon."},{"Patient":"once i used to clean my nipples with dettol just a drop mixed with water using cloth before i feed my baby. i noticed my baby's lips became dark weeks later. i was thinking it might be the dettol is the cause because i'm breastfeeding. now my baby is 1month old and his lips is stil dark. is that true? tnks a lot !","Doctor":"Hi,welcome to healthcaremagic. Using dettol to clean the nipples does not causes darkening of the lips of child. Just don't use concentrated dettol for cleaing the nipples or any body part. It should be diluted adequately before use. Second, wash the dettol properly after application."},{"Patient":"Started having abdominal pain a couple days ago. It was sudden and severe. At first I was concerned for appendicitis but it subsided. Now it is just a dull ache when still but can be more painful when I walk, sit down or push my lower muscles. The area of pain seems to be central lower groin . I thought it was a bit more on the right slightly. I am 46, have had 2 children, I don t nomally have heavy cycles and am due to start today or tomorrow. I have never had cramping before with cycles. But am wondering if this could just be due to my cycle or a cyst . I have had no blood in stool or urine either. Also, I have no insurance or I would have gone to a doctor by now. This is why I am trying to be certain about where I seek help. A regular doctor where I pay out of pocket would likely send me to OBGYN and then I would have to seek a 2nd doctor. My husband and older son are upset that I m not going, but I don t feel compelled to just run out to see someone just yet. Although the pain was quite severe a couple days ago, it is bareable right now.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Pain located in the groin, aggravating when walking, pushing abdominal cavity or coughing is characteristic for inguinal hernia. This is the condition where contents of the abdominal cavity are getting out through weak place in the abdominal wall. You can perform a simple test: stand, put hand on the place where the pain is strongest and try to caught. If you find something is moving under your finger, the hernia it is. You should visit surgeon if the hernia is visible or have groin ultrasound if you are not sure. Of course such symptoms can be caused by ovarian cyst as well as appendicitis, urinary tract infection or stones (even if the blood is not visible in urine). To rule this out abdominal ultrasound with fool blood work and urine analysis needs to be done. Hope this will help.

This had been ongoing for 3 years now & I am struggling to cope ... Do you know what this could be, sorry I forgot to mention I have also lost quite a bit of weight.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. It is very common that gall bladder is getting removed as a reason of pains and it turns that it was not the reason. What are you suffering from is probably peptic ulcer (it causes pain after 1-2 hour of meal, loss of weight, but does not cause diarrhea). However some other conditions should be checked. As you are after gall bladder removal, sometimes it happen that some small stone gets into the bile ducts and gives a lot of pain. Upper GI endoscopy is a good idea as it will rule peptic ulcer and stomach cancer out. But before it is advisable to have fool blood work with liver tests (AST,ALT and GGTP), pancreas tests(amylase), urine analysis and abdominal ultrasound. After this tests upper GI endoscopy should be performed and if GGTP elevated, during this test ERCP should be done as well. If you find all this tests negative, stool tests and colonoscopy should be performed as well. Such symptoms may be also present when partial intestines obstruction appears due to colon cancer.

If severe and at the suspicion of bacterial infection, antibiotics are advisable to treat them. Many a times they may take around 2weeks to clear up.

If it's at the folds as well, it might be a case of nappy rash.Petroleum jelly is good if applied with frequent change of damp diapers in such cases.Some barrier creams are available easily in the market which are medicated having antiseptic action.

I am going to be having a referral to Gygn locally. I feel very weak, shaky and bit lightheaded, and it feels like my heart is beating heaver than usual as I am more aware of it- all my obs in the hospital once I had had fluids were withing normal limits, CRP less than 1, bloods unremarkable.] How long will I feel like this??","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. As you have mentioned, right sided abdominal pain should be always checked with appendicitis. And the appendicitis diagnostic is as hard as hell. Nowadays in the edge of CT scans and MRIs we still can not find a way of ruling our appendicitis other than surgery. So if your abdomen ultrasound tells that no appendix was found, it does not meant that you do not suffer from appendicitis. It just means that the doctor couldn't find it at all. If you were treated with antibiotics during the hospitalization, there is a chance that this antibiotic treated your appendicitis for a while. In 50% of appendicitis antibiotics therapy will give positive response. But it does not treat the appendicitis permanently. So the conclusion is, if all others possible reasons of your pain were ruled out, and the pain is not gone or the pain is recurring, there is a time for surgery to remove your appendix. And by all others diseases I understand: pregnancy, urinary tract infection, urinary tract stones, ovarian infection, ovarian cyst. And if its about your blood work results, if an antibiotic is given, CRP and WBC will be low. So it does not rule appendicitis out either. Hope this will help.

But in most cases, the diagnosis remains the same."},{"Patient":"hi my name is Melissai was just woundering what could happen if my 3yr old drank a bottle of alcohol free grip water??is it harmful??should i take her to the hospital? shes been crabby,sleeping on and off, waking up crying..im a little worried and would really appericate an answer thank you","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question.There is nothing in gripe water that would be considered toxic. At worst, it can cause some abdominal pain if too much is taken. That is most likely what your daughter is experiencing. With a little time, the pain will resolve and she will be fine."},{"Patient":"My son is 7 1/2 months old, and is almost exclusively breastfed--other than a very little bit of solid food that I am introducing.  His pee smells like breast-fed baby poop, sometime so strong that I think he has a dirty diaper.  He's not a big eater, but his diapers are usually nice and wet (I don't fear that he is dehydrated).  Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"HiMy opinion is that you should not be worried for smelly poop at present. It's normal to observe a change in smell of baby's poop when complementary feeds are introduced. If baby's activity is good and he is gaining weight at a normal pace then this should be a cause of concern at all."},{"Patient":"My son is 4years old and we just found out that he has an inlarged blood visel that goes to his hart.

Teethers can be used to satisfy their urge of biting in these days. Emeset is a drug useful to treat vomiting and doesn't help in acidity.Lanzol junior 15 mg can be given in case acidity is obvious on clinical examination."},{"Patient":"Hi.

It often takes time for these bruises to heal."},{"Patient":"My daughter is nine and she has quite a fatty mons pubis which she says is quite painful in particular the mornings. It has always been quite large for her age but has steadily gotten bigger. What do you think may be causing the appearance and the pain?","Doctor":"HiFatty mons pubis is usually due to fat deposition over bone which doesn't respond to exercise. It's  a genetic make of the body which should not be an actual cause of pain in your daughter.It's important to rule out other reasons such as urinary tract infection or menstruation related pains ( if a case of early puberty). Also check for any local site infection.Procedures like liposuction and surgery not recommended for this condition usually."},{"Patient":"Today we went to Burger King and my daughter was in her car seat when the lady at the counter put our fries on the tray they tipped over into her car seat flamming hot she screamed the fries burned her little neck skin came off what should I put on it to help her with the redness :(","Doctor":"HiDon't worry. It seems that your child has suffered 1st degree burn which can be easily treated by a cream containing silver sulfadiazine or mafenide acetate. Also, Honey can be used over the scald if you are home and do not get above creams.These do not leave long term scars."},{"Patient":"My 13 year old daughter has little red marks on,the lower of her buttcrack. she says it stings so bad when she walks and sits down. When she used the bathroom she says it doesn't sting as bad.

Yersterday i had a regular low scan after that my abdominal pain started and had tablet Dolo 650. But still my pain is persisting. i dont know what is the reason. can i have metal spas tablet for pain relief under these conditions by not disturbing the conceive process","Doctor":"Hello there. Abdominal pain in UTI can be due cystitis (bladder infection). You should keep taking plenty of fluids atleast 8 glasses per day. It is the best to clear and prevent urine infection. You can continue with ceftum antibiotic since you have started it. If your pain does not get relieved then get a urine culture done. Sometimes the infecting bacteria is not sensitive to the antibiotic you are using. Culture helps to know the bacteria involved and the various antibiotics it is sensitive to. You can use meftal spas for pain. It wont affect your chances of conceiving. take care."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir/Madam, My baby is 3months old femal (pre term).

The trick of the management is keeping the skin moist and never allowing it to be dry. For this oil massage and lotions like Oilatum will help. Regarding cure options - eczema is a sort of allergy...allergies can only be controlled and can never be cured. But usually kids grow out of it...that is as the age progresses, they become better starting from 6 months.But...kin conditions are best diagnosed only after seeing directly.

Because of differential blood supply, to the skin, the stomach region and the head and scalp will be very hot and the hands and feet will be cold. During fever the kids will not be eating well. Do not worry. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my5 year old son just started having nasal congestion,snoring and mouth breathing persisting for 3 weeks ago which was absent since he was one year old.he has a family history of allergic rhinitis.his symptoms have not responded to otrivin nasal drops,aristo betN NASAL drops and i just started him on zaditine with no difference.what is your advice?","Doctor":"Thank you for following up.
