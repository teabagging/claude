Replace a and b with their respective expressions in terms of sin using the Law of Sines, a = frac{sin A}{sin B} and b = frac{sin B}{sin A}, and simplify:   [   sin Acos C + left(2sin B + sin Cright)cos A = 0   ]2. Apply the sum-to-product identities:   [   sin(A+C) + sin(A-C) = -2sin Bcos A   ]3. Since A + C + B = pi, we know sin(A+C) = sin(pi - B) = sin B, simplifying the equation to:   [   sin B + sin(A-C) = -2sin Bcos A   ]4. Given that sin B > 0, we can isolate cos A:   [   cos A = -frac{1}{2}   ]5.

By AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean – Geometric Mean inequality), for any positive numbers: frac{a + b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}, we have sqrt{ab} leq frac{a + b}{2} = frac{6}{2} = 3. Squaring both sides gives us: ab leq 9. Equality in the AM-GM inequality holds when a = b. Therefore, the maximum value of ab subject to a + b = 6 and a, b > 0 is when a = b = 3.Hence, the maximum value of ab is boxed{9}."},{"problem":"4.47 Let x be a natural number.

We prove that frac{x_{i}}{x_{i-1}} must be a prime number (i=1,2, cdots, t).In fact, if there exists i(1 leqslant i leqslant t) such that frac{x_{i}}{x_{i-1}} is not a prime, we can assumefrac{x_{i}}{x_{i-1}}=q_{1} q_{2},where q_{1}, q_{2} are positive integers greater than 1, thenleft{x_{0}, x_{1}, cdots, x_{i-1}, q_{1} x_{i-1}, x_{i}, x_{i+1}, cdots, x_{t}right}is also a factor chain of x.This contradicts the fact that left{x_{0}, x_{1}, cdots, x_{i-1}, x_{i}, cdots, x_{t}right} is the longest factor chain.Therefore, for any 1 leqslant i leqslant t, frac{x_{i}}{x_{i-1}} must be a prime factor of x, thust=L(x)=alpha_{1}+alpha_{2}+cdots+alpha_{n}.Conversely, ifleft{x_{0}, quad x_{1}, cdots, x_{m}right}is a factor chain of x, and for any 1 leqslant i leqslant m, frac{x_{i}}{x_{i-1}} is a prime, by the definition of a factor chain we havem=alpha_{1}+alpha_{2}+cdots+alpha_{n}=L(x).Thus, left{x_{0}, x_{1}, cdots, x_{m}right} must be a longest factor chain.Therefore, starting from 1 and multiplying a prime factor of x step by step until reaching x, we get a longest factor chain of x, and different orders of multiplying different prime factors result in different longest factor chains, henceR(x)=frac{left(alpha_{1}+cdots+alpha_{n}right)!}{alpha_{1}!cdots alpha_{n}!}.Forbegin{aligned}x & =5^{k} cdot 31^{m} cdot 1990^{n} & =2^{n} cdot 5^{k+n} cdot 31^{m} cdot 199^{n}.end{aligned}thenbegin{aligned}L(x) & =3 n+k+m, R(x) & =frac{(3 n+k+m)!}{(n!)^{2} m!(k+n)!}.end{aligned}"},{"problem":"A group of women working together at the same rate can build a wall in 45 hours.

Once at work, each one stayed till the work was complete. If the first woman worked 5 times as many hours as the last woman, for how many hours did the first woman work?","solution":"1. Let the work done in 1 hour by 1 woman be ( k ), and let the number of women be ( y ).2. Let the interval after each woman arrives be ( t ), and let the time for which all of them work together be ( eta ).3. The total work ( W ) can be expressed as the sum of the work done by each woman. The first woman works for ((y-1)t + eta) hours, the second woman works for ((y-2)t + eta) hours, and so on, until the last woman who works for (eta) hours.4. Therefore, the total work ( W ) is given by:   [   W = k left( (y-1)t + eta right) + k left( (y-2)t + eta right) + cdots + k eta   ]5. This can be simplified using the sum of an arithmetic series:   [   W = k left( sum_{i=0}^{y-1} ((y-1-i)t + eta) right)   ]6. The sum inside the parentheses is:   [   sum_{i=0}^{y-1} ((y-1-i)t + eta) = sum_{i=0}^{y-1} (y-1-i)t + sum_{i=0}^{y-1} eta   ]7. The first sum is the sum of the first ( y ) terms of an arithmetic series with the first term ( (y-1)t ) and the last term ( 0 ):   [   sum_{i=0}^{y-1} (y-1-i)t = t sum_{i=0}^{y-1} (y-1-i) = t sum_{i=0}^{y-1} i = t cdot frac{(y-1)y}{2}   ]8. The second sum is simply ( y eta ):   [   sum_{i=0}^{y-1} eta = y eta   ]9. Therefore, the total work ( W ) is:   [   W = k left( t cdot frac{(y-1)y}{2} + y eta right)   ]10. We know that ( ky = frac{W}{45} ), so:    [    W = 45ky    ]11. Equating the two expressions for ( W ):    [    k left( t cdot frac{(y-1)y}{2} + y eta right) = 45ky    ]12. Dividing both sides by ( ky ):    [    t cdot frac{(y-1)}{2} + eta = 45    ]13. We also know that the first woman worked 5 times as many hours as the last woman, so:    [    (y-1)t + eta = 5eta    ]14. Simplifying this, we get:    [    (y-1)t = 4eta    ]15. Substituting ( (y-1)t = 4eta ) into ( t cdot frac{(y-1)}{2} + eta = 45 ):    [    4eta cdot frac{1}{2} + eta = 45    ]16. Simplifying, we get:    [    2eta + eta = 45    ]    [    3eta = 45    ]    [    eta = 15    ]17.

Construct D^{prime} diametrically opposed to D, so that angle D F D^{prime} and angle D E D^{prime} are right, and note that P lies on D D^{prime}.

Therefore, the circumcircle of triangle ABD and the circumcircle of triangle AEC intersect at points A and E.Thus, the circumcircle of triangle ABD and the circumcircle of triangle AEC are intersecting at points A and E.(2) Given that the circumradius of triangle ABD is twice that of triangle AEC, and BC = 6, AB = 4, we need to find the length of BE.Let the circumradius of triangle AEC be R and the circumradius of triangle ABD be 2R.Using the circumradius formula for a triangle:[ R = frac{abc}{4K} ]where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle and K is the area of the triangle.For triangle AEC:[ R = frac{AE cdot AC cdot EC}{4K_{AEC}} ]For triangle ABD:[ 2R = frac{AB cdot AD cdot BD}{4K_{ABD}} ]Since AB = 4 and BC = 6, let BE = x and EC = 6 - x.Using the fact that the circumradius of triangle ABD is twice that of triangle AEC, we can set up the following relationship:[ 2 left( frac{AE cdot AC cdot EC}{4K_{AEC}} right) = frac{4 cdot AD cdot BD}{4K_{ABD}} ]Simplifying, we get:[ 2 left( frac{AE cdot AC cdot (6 - x)}{4K_{AEC}} right) = frac{4 cdot AD cdot (x + 4)}{4K_{ABD}} ]Since the areas K_{AEC} and K_{ABD} are proportional to the product of the sides, we can simplify further:[ 2 left( frac{AE cdot AC cdot (6 - x)}{4K_{AEC}} right) = frac{4 cdot AD cdot (x + 4)}{4K_{ABD}} ]Given that the circumradius relationship holds, we can solve for x:[ 2 left( frac{AE cdot AC cdot (6 - x)}{4K_{AEC}} right) = frac{4 cdot AD cdot (x + 4)}{4K_{ABD}} ]Since the areas are proportional, we can simplify to:[ 2(6 - x) = x + 4 ]Solving for x:[ 12 - 2x = x + 4 ][ 12 - 4 = 3x ][ 8 = 3x ][ x = frac{8}{3} ]Thus, the length of BE is:[ boxed{frac{8}{3}} ]","solution":"15. 8 (1) Draw the tangent AH of odot ABD such that angle DAE = angle DAH + angle HAE, then angle CAF = angle B + angle C = angle DAH + angle C, therefore angle HAE = angle C, AH is also the tangent of odot AEC.

Thus, if r is real and non-zero, |2r^3+r|>r, so f(x) has infinitely many roots. Since f(x) is a polynomial (thus of finite degree) and f(0) is nonzero, f(x) has no real roots.Note that f(x) is not constant. We then find two complex roots: r = pm i. We find that f(i)f(-2) = f(-i), and that f(-i)f(-2) = f(i). This means that f(i)f(-i)f(-2)^2 = f(i)f(-i) Longrightarrow f(i)f(-i)(f(-2)^2 - 1) = 0.

Since f(x) has no real roots, the degree must be even.  Consider g(x)= f(x)/f(-x).  Then since f is non-zero, g(x)=g(2x^3+x). Now the function 2x^3+x applied repeatedly from some real starting value of x becomes arbitrarily large, and the limit of g(x) as |x| approaches infinity is 1, so g(x)=1 for all x, or f(x)=f(-x).

All possible outcomes of the experiment considered in this problem consist in the first person arriving at some moment of time x between 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock and the second person arriving at another moment of time y within the same interval.

Considering these numbers as coordinates of a point on the plane, we can represent the set of all outcomes as the set of points of the square O A B C with side 1 (Fig. 79). Since x and y are chosen randomly between 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock, the probability that x (respectively y) falls within any interval on the x-axis (respectively y-axis) is equal to the length of this interval (recall that in our case O A=O C=1). Therefore, the probability that the point (x, y) falls within any rectangle inside O A B C is equal to the area of this rectangle.

Next, we need to determine the highest power of ( 3 ) that divides ( 2014^{100!} - 2011^{100!} ). To do this, we use the Lifting The Exponent Lemma (LTE). The LTE states that for odd primes ( p ) and integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( p mid x - y ), the highest power of ( p ) dividing ( x^n - y^n ) is given by:   [   v_p(x^n - y^n) = v_p(x - y) + v_p(n).   ]   Here, ( p = 3 ), ( x = 2014 ), ( y = 2011 ), and ( n = 100! ).4.

Therefore, the largest ( n ) such that ( 3^n ) divides ( 2014^{100!} - 2011^{100!} ) is ( n = 49 ).8. Finally, we need to compute the remainder when ( 3^{49} ) is divided by ( 1000 ).

For example, ( D_1 = |1| ), ( D_2 = begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1  1 & 3 end{vmatrix} ), and ( D_3 = begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1  1 & 3 & 3  1 & 3 & 5 end{vmatrix} ).2. To simplify the calculation of ( D_n ), we perform row operations. Specifically, we subtract the first row from all subsequent rows. This operation does not change the determinant of the matrix.3. After subtracting the first row from all other rows, the matrix ( D_n ) transforms into an upper triangular matrix. The first row remains as ( [1, 1, 1, ldots, 1] ), and the remaining rows will have the form ( [0, 2, 2, ldots, 2] ), ( [0, 0, 2, ldots, 2] ), and so on.4. Next, we subtract the second row from all rows below it, then the third row from all rows below it, and so forth. This results in a matrix where the diagonal entries are all 2s, and all entries above the diagonal are also 2s.5. The resulting matrix is an upper triangular matrix with 1s in the first row and 2s on and above the diagonal in all other rows. The determinant of an upper triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries.6. Therefore, the determinant ( D_n ) is given by:   [   D_n = 2^{n-1}   ]7.

Note that if we change only the last digit of the birth year, the sum of the digits will increase, while the age will decrease (and vice versa) by the same amount.

Suppose ( a, b geq 0 ) and ( a + b = 2t geq 1 ) then we have[ a^k + b^k - ab geq min left((2t)^k, 2t^k - t^2right) ]Indeed, WLOG assume that ( a geq b ).

How many spheres exist that touch all the faces of the given triangular pyramid T?","solution":"3. The task is to determine how many points (centers of the sought spheres) are equidistant from the four faces of the pyramid.The geometric locus of points equidistant from the faces of a given dihedral angle is a plane passing through the edge of the dihedral angle and bisecting this angle — the bisector plane of the dihedral angle.Since two intersecting planes form two pairs of vertical dihedral angles, the geometric locus of points equidistant from two intersecting planes consists of two planes passing through the line of intersection of the first two planes.The geometric locus of points equidistant from the faces of a trihedral angle is the line of intersection of the bisector planes of the three dihedral angles of the trihedral angle — the bisector line of the trihedral angle.Since three intersecting planes form four pairs of vertical trihedral angles, the geometric locus of points equidistant from three intersecting planes consists of four lines passing through the point of intersection of the three planes.Let mathrm{II}_{1}, mathrm{II}_{2}, mathrm{II}_{3}, and mathrm{II}_{4} be the planes of the faces of the pyramid. Consider the trihedral angle of the pyramid formed by the planes mathrm{II}_{1}, mathrm{II}_{2}, and mathrm{II}_{3}. The geometric locus of points equidistant from the three faces of this angle consists of four lines beta_{1}, beta_{2}, beta_{3}, and beta_{4}. Further, the geometric locus of points equidistant from the planes mathrm{II}_{1} and mathrm{II}_{4} consists of two planes B_{1} and B_{2}. It is clear that each of the points of intersection of one of the lines beta_{1}, beta_{2}, beta_{3}, and beta_{4} with one of the planes B_{1} and B_{2} (and only these points) will be equidistant from the planes mathrm{II}_{1}, mathrm{II}_{2}, mathrm{II}_{3}, and mathrm{II}_{4}. Thus, in general, we obtain eight points equidistant from the planes of the faces of the pyramid, and consequently, eight spheres tangent to these faces. It is not difficult to see that out of these eight spheres, one is enclosed inside the pyramid (the inscribed sphere; Fig. 35, a), four are located outside the pyramid, one inside each of its trihedral angles (the \\"exscribed\\" spheres; Fig. 35, b), and three are located inside the dihedral angles of the pyramid and inside the angles vertical to the opposite dihedral angles (Fig. 35, c).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_68334347b64402497ba5g-097.jpg?height=847&width=788&top_left_y=841&top_left_x=526)a)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_68334347b64402497ba5g-097.jpg?height=852&width=753&top_left_y=805&top_left_x=1359)b)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_68334347b64402497ba5g-097.jpg?height=845&width=986&top_left_y=1832&top_left_x=827)c:Fig. 35.Note that in special cases, a tetrahedral pyramid may have fewer than eight spheres tangent to the planes of all its faces. For example, a regular tetrahedron has only five such spheres (spheres of only the types shown in Fig. 35, a and b). This is because in some cases, some of the lines beta_{1}, beta_{2}, beta_{3}, and beta_{4} may be parallel to some of the planes B_{1} and B_{2}.Remark. It can be shown that if the sum of the areas of two faces of a triangular pyramid is equal to the sum of the areas of the other two faces, then there are only 7 spheres tangent to the planes of all the faces; if the areas of the faces are pairwise equal, then there are 6 such spheres; finally, if all the faces of the pyramid are equal in area (and therefore equal; see, for example, problem 29 in the book by D.

Any three of them form a triangle, the angles of which in degrees are expressed by natural numbers. For what largest N is this possible?","solution":"Answer: 180.First solution. Example. First, we show that for N=180, the required condition is possible. Mark 180 points on a circle, dividing it into 180 equal arcs, each 2^{circ}. The measure of any arc with endpoints at two of the marked points is expressed as an even number of degrees, so the measure of any inscribed angle in the circle, formed by three marked points, is a natural number of degrees. Therefore, 180 marked points satisfy the condition of the problem.Estimate. It remains to prove that N leqslant 180. Any three marked points form a triangle, so they cannot lie on the same line. Assuming the marked points are located on a coordinate plane, let A be any of them with the maximum ordinate. Among the remaining points, choose points B and C such that the angle B A C is maximized.From the condition of the problem, it follows that in triangle A B C, the measures of angles A B C and A C B are at least 1^{circ}, so the measure of angle B A C is at most 178^{circ}. Due to the choice of points B and C, the remaining N-3 marked points lie strictly inside angle B A C, and each ray starting from point A contains no more than one of them. By drawing a ray through each marked point inside angle B A C with the origin at point A, we obtain N-3 distinct rays, dividing angle B A C into N-2 angles. If N-2>178, then at least one of these angles has a measure less than 1^{circ} and is an angle of some triangle with vertices at three marked points, which contradicts the condition of the problem. Therefore, N-2 leqslant 178, that is, N leqslant 180, which was to be proved.Remark 1. The choice of the point A used in the solution can also be described in the following ways."},{"problem":"2.

Define the set and the problem:   Consider the set ( A = {1, 2, 3, ldots, 2008} ). We need to determine which of the classes ( X_r ) (where ( r in {0, 1, 2} )) is the largest. A set is of type ( r ) if the sum of its elements gives the remainder ( r ) when divided by 3.2. Symmetry and Initial Observations:   By symmetry, we can initially assume that the sizes of ( X_1 ) and ( X_2 ) are equal. We will use induction to show that ( X_1 ) is the largest for the set ( A ).3. Base Case:   Consider the set ( B = {1, 2, 3} ):   - The subsets of ( B ) are: ({1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}).   - The sums of these subsets modulo 3 are: (1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0).   - Therefore, ( |X_0| = 3 ), ( |X_1| = 2 ), and ( |X_2| = 2 ).4. Inductive Step:   Assume for a set ( B = {1, 2, ldots, 3k} ), the sizes of ( X_0 ), ( X_1 ), and ( X_2 ) are such that ( |X_0| ) is the largest. Now consider adding the next three elements ( 3k+1, 3k+2, 3k+3 ) to form the set ( B' = {1, 2, ldots, 3k+3} ).5. Adding New Elements:   - Adding ( 3k+1 ) shifts the sums of subsets of ( B ) by 1 modulo 3.   - Adding ( 3k+2 ) shifts the sums of subsets of ( B ) by 2 modulo 3.   - Adding ( 3k+3 ) does not change the sums modulo 3.6. Counting New Subsets:   - Each new element ( 3k+1, 3k+2, 3k+3 ) will create new subsets that shift the sums of the original subsets.   - The new subsets will be counted as follows:     - Subsets including ( 3k+1 ) will contribute to ( X_1 ).     - Subsets including ( 3k+2 ) will contribute to ( X_2 ).     - Subsets including ( 3k+3 ) will contribute to ( X_0 ).7. Conclusion for Larger Sets:   - For the set ( C = {1, 2, ldots, 3k+1} ), the largest class will be ( X_1 ) because the addition of ( 3k+1 ) shifts the sums of subsets of ( B ) by 1 modulo 3, increasing the count of ( X_1 ).8. Final Set Analysis:   - Since ( 2008 = 2007 + 1 = 3 cdot 669 + 1 ), the set ( A ) is of the form ( {1, 2, ldots, 3k+1} ).   - By our previous analysis, ( X_1 ) will be the largest class for the set ( A ).The final answer is ( boxed{ X_1 } ) is the largest."},{"problem":"Question 15: Let the set M={1,2, ldots, 100} be a 100-element set.

This is because a set of vectors that cannot span three-dimensional space must be confined to a plane, thus being coplanar. Proposition ① is correctly identified as true based on the principles of vector spaces.Conclusion:Propositions ① and ② are true based on the principles of vector spaces and the definitions concerning collinearity and coplanarity. Errors in analyzing the other propositions lead to incorrect conclusions about their validity. Therefore, the number of true propositions is indeed 2.Final answer: boxed{C}."},{"problem":"The positional relationship between the line 3x+4y-13=0 and the circle (x-2)^2+(y-3)^2=1 is (　　)  A: Separate  B: Intersect  C: Tangent  D: Indeterminable","solution":"Solution: From the equation of the circle, we get the coordinates of the center of the circle as (2,3), and the radius r=1.  Therefore, the distance d from the center of the circle to the line 3x+4y-13=0 is d= frac {|6+12-13|}{5}=1=r.  Thus, the positional relationship between the line and the circle is tangent.

By finding the coordinates of the center of the circle and the radius r from the equation of the circle, and then using the formula for the distance from a point to a line to calculate the distance d from the center of the circle to the given line, we find that d=r, hence the line and the circle are tangent.

It mainly tests the knowledge of the area formula of a triangle and solving triangles using the sine and cosine theorems, which is considered a medium-level problem.According to the cosine theorem (b^2=a^2+c^2-2accos B), combined with the given data, we can calculate that (c=3). Thus, we can find the area of (triangle ABC), (S= frac{1}{2}acsin B= frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}).

FIRST METHOD.Let n^{2}+2015 n=m^{2}. Denote d= GCD (n, 2015), n=d nu, 2015=d r. Then nu and r are coprime, andd^{2} nu(nu+r)=m^{2}Since nu and nu+r are coprime, each of them must be a square of a natural number, i.e., nu=a^{2}, nu+r=b^{2}. Then r=(b-a)(b+a).a) To obtain some values of n, we can choose d, a, b according to the above scheme. The number d is a divisor of the number 2015=5 cdot 13 cdot 31. For example, let's choose d=1. Then r=2015=(b-a)(b+a). Let b-a=1, b+a=2015. Then b=1008, a=1007, and we get the first value n=a^{2} d=1007^{2}.Now let's take d=31. Then r=65=(b-a)(b+a). Let b-a=5, b+a=13. Then b=9, a=4, n=a^{2} d=496.b) From the above reasoning, it follows that this scheme gives all solutions. Moreover, since d is not divisible by the square of a prime number, different d, a will correspond to different n. Let's count how many different n can be obtained. The number d is a divisor of the number 2015=5 cdot 13 cdot 31. Consider 4 cases:- d=1. Then r=2015=(b-a)(b+a). The number 2015 has 8 different divisors, and thus can be represented in 4 ways as 2015=(b-a)(b+a). (Considering that b-a<b+a). For each such representation, both numbers b-a, b+a are odd, and thus a, b are uniquely determined. Knowing a, b, d, we can uniquely find n=d cdot a^{2}. Thus, in this case, we have 4 different numbers n.- d=5,13 or 31. Then r is the product of two prime numbers and can be represented in the form r=(b-a)(b+a) in two ways. Thus, we have 3 cdot 2=6 answers.- d=65,155 or 403. Then r is a prime number, and can be represented in the form r=(b-a)(b+a) in a unique way. Thus, we have 3 more answers.- d=2015. Then r=1, and the equation r=(b-a)(b+a) is impossible, since a, b are natural numbers.In total, 4+6+3=13 different numbers n.## SECOND METHOD.Let n^{2}+2015 n=m^{2}. Multiplying by 4 and completing the square on the left side, we transform the equation to(2 n+2015)^{2}=4 m^{2}+2015^{2} Rightarrow(2 n-4 m+2015)(2 n+4 m+2015)=2015^{2}Denoting 2 n-4 m+2015=a, 2 n+4 m+2015=b, we get that all sought values of n are determined by the conditionsa<b, a b=2015^{2}, quad n=frac{a+b-2 cdot 2015}{4}a) To obtain some specific values of n, we can take specific factorizations a b=2015^{2}=5^{2} cdot 13^{2} cdot 31^{2}. For example, if a=1, b=2015^{2}, then n=4060226. If a=25 cdot 31, b=169 cdot 31, then n=496.b) Note that for any factorization 2015^{2}=a b, the number n, determined by the equation n=frac{a+b-2 cdot 2015}{4}, is an integer. This follows from the fact that a b=2015^{2} equiv 1(bmod 4), so either a equiv b equiv 1(bmod 4) or a equiv b equiv 3(bmod 4). In both cases, a+b equiv 2 equiv 2 cdot 2015(bmod 4). Thus, the number of sought numbers n is equal to the number of factorizations a b=2015^{2}, a<b. The number 2015^{2} has exactly 27 different divisors. One of them is 2015, and the rest form pairs (a, b), a<b, a b=2015^{2}. Therefore, the number of such pairs is frac{27-1}{2}=13.Criteria.## (-)(-.)

This can be written as:   [   n = 167 cdot tau(n)   ]   where ( tau(n) ) denotes the number of positive divisors of ( n ).2. Since ( 167 ) is a prime number, ( 167 ) must divide ( n ). Let us express ( n ) in the form:   [   n = 167^a prod_{i=1}^ell p_i^{e_i}   ]   where ( p_i ) are primes different from 167, and ( e_i ) are their respective exponents.3. The number of divisors ( tau(n) ) of ( n ) is given by:   [   tau(n) = (a+1) prod_{i=1}^ell (e_i + 1)   ]   Substituting this into the original equation, we get:   [   167^a prod_{i=1}^ell p_i^{e_i} = 167 cdot (a+1) cdot prod_{i=1}^ell (e_i + 1)   ]4.

This is impractical for large ( a ), so we consider ( a = 1 ):   [   167^0 prod_{i=1}^ell p_i^{e_i} = 2 prod_{i=1}^ell (e_i + 1)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   prod_{i=1}^ell p_i^{e_i} = 2 prod_{i=1}^ell (e_i + 1)   ]6. We now need to solve ( m = 2 tau(m) ) for ( m ), where ( m = prod_{i=1}^ell p_i^{e_i} ). We know that ( p nmid m ) for ( p > 5 ), as otherwise ( m > 2 tau(m) ).7.

Note that angle X M A=angle X D C and angle X A M=angle X C D (since they are alternate angles between parallel lines), so triangles X C D and X A M are similar. Since D C=2 A M, the area of X C D is 1 times 2^{2}=4 square units.Say the area of triangle D A X is x square units. Then, since the area of A C D is twice the area of A M D (they are triangles with equal heights and one base half that of the other), we have 2 times(1+x)=4+x, which gives x=2 square units.The area of A B C D is twice that of A C D, which is 12 square units.The area of M B C X is 12-(4+2+1)=5 square units.So the desired ratio is 5: 12.Solution 2Note that angle X M A=angle X D C and angle X A M=angle X C D (since they are alternate angles between parallel lines), so triangles X C D and X A M are similar. Since D C=2 A M, the perpendicular from D C to X is twice the perpendicular from A M to X.Hence the perpendicular height of the triangle A M X is one third of the perpendicular height of the parallelogram. Hence the area of A M X is frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{3}=frac{1}{12} of the area of the parallelogram.The area of triangle A B C is clearly half of the area of the parallelogram, so the area of M B C X is frac{1}{2}-frac{1}{12}=frac{5}{12} of the area of the whole parallelogram.Hence the desired ratio is 5: 12."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively, and satisfy bcos A - asin B = 0.1.

Therefore, by the geometric probability model, the probability that the inequality a^{2}+b^{2} leqslant 1 holds is frac{pi}{4}, so this is correct;2. Given that the random variable xi follows a normal distribution N(3,sigma^{2}), the graph is symmetric about x=3. Since P(xi leqslant 5) = m, then P(xi leqslant 1) = P(xi geqslant 5) = 1-m, hence this is correct;3. The general term of the expansion of (sqrt{x}+ frac{1}{2sqrt{x}})^{8} is T_{r+1} = C_{8}^{r} cdot 2^{-r} cdot x^{4-r}. Setting 4-r=0, then r=4, we can obtain the constant term as frac{35}{8}, hence this is correct;Therefore, the number of correct conclusions is 3.

Show that for some constant k, f(x) = k x for all x.","solution":"Notice first that if f(x) = kx, then f(f(x)) = k 2 x, so k 2 x = akx + bx and hence k is a root of the quadratic t 2 - at - b = 0. If f(x) = f(y), then f(f(x)) = f(f(y)), so x = ( f(f(x)) - a f(x) )/b = ( f(f(y)) - a f(y) )/b = y. In other words, f is one-to-one. Since it is continuous, it must be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. It cannot be bounded as x tends to plus infinity, otherwise f(f(x)) would be bounded, but a f(x) + b x would be unbounded. Similarly as x tends to minus infinity. So f must be onto and hence invertible. Let h, k be the roots of t 2 = a t + b. Evidently one root, say h, is positive and the other negative. Moreover both must have absolute value less than 1. This is where we need 0  k > -h. Now given x, take p, q so that x = p + q, f(x) = ph + qk. It is easy to see that this can be done: p = (f(x) - kx)/(h - k), q = (hx - f(x) )/(h - k). It is also easy to see that denoting f 2 (x) = f(f(x)), f 3 (x) = f(f 2 (x)) etc, we have f n (x) = ph n + qk n . Indeed this must also be true for n negative, where f -1 denotes the inverse of f. Now suppose f is increasing. Suppose for some particular x we have q non-zero. Then for n sufficiently large, qk -n dominates ph -n , so f -n (x) alternate in sign but increases in absolute value as n increases. For suitable N we will have f -N-2 (x) > f -N (x) > 0, but f -N-1 (x)  B, but f(A)  f N (x) > f N+1 (x) > f N+2 (x) > 0, in which case A > B but f(A) > f(B) (with A = f N-1 (x), B = f N+1 (x) ), or we have N with f N-1 (x) < f N (x) < f N+1 (x) < f N+2 (x) < 0, in which case A < B but f(A) < f(B) (with A = f N-1 (x), B = f N+1 (x) ). In either case we contradict f decreasing. So if f is decreasing we must have p zero for all x and hence f(x) = kx for all x. 62nd Putnam 2001 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 16 Dec 2001"},{"problem":"x,y are real numbers such that x^2+y^2=1    ,  20x^3-15x=3Find the value of |20y^3-15y|.(K. Tyshchuk)","solution":"1. Given the equations:   [   x^2 + y^2 = 1   ]   and   [   20x^3 - 15x = 3   ]   we need to find the value of ( |20y^3 - 15y| ).2. We can use the trigonometric identities by setting ( x = cos alpha ) and ( y = sin alpha ). This substitution is valid because ( x^2 + y^2 = 1 ) is the equation of a unit circle, and any point on the unit circle can be represented as ( (cos alpha, sin alpha) ).3. Substituting ( x = cos alpha ) into the second equation:   [   20 (cos alpha)^3 - 15 cos alpha = 3   ]   Using the triple angle formula for cosine, ( cos 3alpha = 4 cos^3 alpha - 3 cos alpha ), we can rewrite the equation as:   [   20 cos^3 alpha - 15 cos alpha = 3   ]   Dividing the entire equation by 5:   [   4 cos^3 alpha - 3 cos alpha = frac{3}{5}   ]   Therefore:   [   cos 3alpha = frac{3}{5}   ]4. Next, we need to find ( sin 3alpha ).

Now, we need to find ( |20y^3 - 15y| ). Recall that ( y = sin alpha ). Using the triple angle formula for sine, ( sin 3alpha = 3 sin alpha - 4 sin^3 alpha ), we can write:   [   sin 3alpha = 3y - 4y^3   ]   Given that ( sin 3alpha = pm frac{4}{5} ), we have:   [   3y - 4y^3 = pm frac{4}{5}   ]6.

Finding the range of ( k ):   - We need ( 1 le m le 5000 ).   - For ( k^2 le 5000 ), the maximum value of ( k ) is ( lfloor sqrt{5000} rfloor = 70 ).   - For ( k^2 + 2k - 124 ge 1 ), solving ( k^2 + 2k - 125 ge 0 ) gives:     [     k^2 + 2k - 125 = 0 implies k = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 500}}{2} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{504}}{2} = frac{-2 pm 2sqrt{126}}{2} = -1 pm sqrt{126}     ]     Since ( k ) must be an integer, we take the positive root:     [     k ge lceil sqrt{126} - 1 rceil = lceil 11.225 - 1 rceil = 11     ]   - Therefore, the range for ( k ) is ( 63 le k le 70 ).5. Counting the number of valid ( m ) values for each ( k ):   - For each ( k ) in the range ( 63 le k le 70 ), the number of valid ( m ) values is:     [     (k^2 + 2k - 124) - k^2 = 2k - 124     ]   - Summing these values from ( k = 63 ) to ( k = 70 ):     [     sum_{k=63}^{70} (2k - 124)     ]6. Calculating the sum:   - The sum of an arithmetic series ( sum_{k=63}^{70} (2k - 124) ) can be calculated as:     [     sum_{k=63}^{70} (2k - 124) = sum_{k=63}^{70} 2k - sum_{k=63}^{70} 124     ]   - The first sum is:     [     2 sum_{k=63}^{70} k = 2 left( frac{70 cdot 71}{2} - frac{62 cdot 63}{2} right) = 2 left( 2485 - 1953 right) = 2 cdot 532 = 1064     ]   - The second sum is:     [     124 cdot 8 = 992     ]   - Therefore, the total sum is:     [     1064 - 992 = 72     ]Conclusion:[boxed{72}]"},{"problem":"Around the outside of a 4 by 4 square, construct four semicircles (as shown in the figure) with the four sides of the square as their diameters.

We start with the number ( N ) which is composed of ( k ) ones. We can express ( N ) in terms of powers of 10. Specifically, ( N ) can be written as:   [   N_k = frac{10^{2k} - 1}{99}   ]   This is because ( N ) is a repunit number in base 10, and the formula for a repunit number with ( k ) ones is ( frac{10^k - 1}{9} ). Since ( N ) has ( k ) ones followed by ( k ) zeros and then another one, it can be expressed as ( frac{10^{2k} - 1}{99} ).2. We need to determine for which values of ( k ) the number ( N_k ) is prime. We first consider the case when ( k ) is odd. If ( k ) is odd, we can factorize ( 10^{2k} - 1 ) as follows:   [   10^{2k} - 1 = (10^k - 1)(10^k + 1)   ]   Therefore,   [   N_k = frac{10^{2k} - 1}{99} = frac{(10^k - 1)(10^k + 1)}{99}   ]   Since ( 10^k - 1 ) and ( 10^k + 1 ) are both greater than 1 for ( k > 1 ), ( N_k ) is not prime because it is a product of two numbers greater than 1.3. Next, we consider the case when ( k ) is even. Let ( k = 2^a l ) where ( a ge 1 ) and ( l ) is odd. We can write:   [   10^{2k} - 1 = 10^{2^{a+1}l} - 1   ]   This can be factored using the difference of squares repeatedly:   [   10^{2^{a+1}l} - 1 = (10^{2^a l} - 1)(10^{2^a l} + 1)   ]   Continuing this factorization, we get:   [   10^{2^{a+1}l} - 1 = (10^l - 1)(10^l + 1)(10^{2l} + 1) cdots (10^{2^a l} + 1)   ]   Dividing by 99, we get:   [   N_k = frac{10^{2k} - 1}{99} = frac{(10^l - 1)(10^l + 1)(10^{2l} + 1) cdots (10^{2^a l} + 1)}{99}   ]   For ( N_k ) to be prime, the expression must reduce to a single prime factor. This can only happen if ( l = 1 ) and ( a = 1 ), which implies ( k = 2 ).4. For ( k = 2 ), we have:   [   N = 101   ]   We check if 101 is prime.

The sum of the geometric sequence's first n terms is given by S_n = frac{a_1(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}, where r is the common ratio. For the sum of every other term starting from the first term, we can consider it as a new geometric sequence with the first term a_1 and a common ratio of r^2.

Upper Bound Analysis:   - Lemma 2: The upper index ( x ) must be greater than 1999.     - Proof: If ( x leq 1999 ), then (binom{x}{y}) cannot be divisible by 1999, as 1999 is a prime factor of 1999000.6. Lower Bound Analysis:   - Lemma 3: When ( 3 leq y leq 1000 ), ( x < 1999 ).     - Proof: (binom{1999}{3} > 1999000), so ( x ) must be less than 1999 for the combination to equal 1999000.7. Symmetry and Further Analysis:   - Using the symmetry property (binom{x}{y} = binom{x}{x-y}), we extend the argument to ( 3 leq y leq 1996 ).   - For ( y = 1997 ), (binom{1999}{1997} leq 1999000 leq binom{2000}{1997}), so it does not work.   - For ( y = 1998 ), (binom{2000}{1998} = 1999000), which works.   - For ( y = 1999 ), (binom{2000}{1999} leq 1999000 leq binom{2001}{1999}), so it does not work.8.

Next, consider the triangle ( BCE ):   - The line segment ( overline{BC} ) has slope (frac{s}{r-1}) and midpoint (left(frac{r+1}{2}, frac{s}{2}right)).   - The perpendicular bisector of ( overline{BC} ) has slope (-frac{r-1}{s}) and passes through (left(frac{r+1}{2}, frac{s}{2}right)). Its equation is:     [     frac{y - frac{s}{2}}{x - frac{r+1}{2}} = -frac{r-1}{s} implies y = -frac{r-1}{s}x + frac{r^2 - 1}{2s} + frac{s}{2}     ]   - The perpendicular bisector of ( overline{BE} ) is ( x = frac{k+1}{2} ).   - Substituting ( x = frac{k+1}{2} ) into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of ( overline{BC} ), we get:     [     y = -frac{r-1}{s} cdot frac{k+1}{2} + frac{r^2 - 1}{2s} + frac{s}{2}     ]   - Therefore, the coordinates of ( O_2 ) are:     [     O_2 = left( frac{k+1}{2}, -frac{r-1}{2s}(k+1) + frac{r^2 - 1}{2s} + frac{s}{2} right)     ]4. We wish for ( P = (x, y) ) to lie on the radical axis of the circumcircles of ( triangle ADE ) and ( triangle BCE ).

The first player can ensure that there are no more than three equations with two distinct roots on the board. This result cannot be improved. Solution. To create two equations without roots, the first player needs to use the first two moves to write the smallest of the numbers not yet written in the coefficient of x in an \\"equation\\" where no numbers have been written yet. This is possible because if no more than two pairs of moves have been made, then at least one coefficient has been written in no more than four \\"equations\\".

We first describe Player A's strategy to achieve 75 points.Player A only places balls in boxes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. For Player B, the optimal strategy is always to take the box with the most balls. Player A starts by placing balls as evenly as possible in these boxes, ensuring that the difference in the number of balls in each box does not exceed 1. If Player B takes no more than 24 balls from one box, Player A will replace the same number of balls and distribute the others evenly. After one round, if the initial number of balls is ( y leq 95 ), the total number of balls will increase by ( 25 - leftlceil frac{y + 25}{5} rightrceil geq 1 ) per round. Therefore, Player A can repeat this step until the total number of balls in all five boxes reaches 121, i.e., the five boxes will have 25, 24, 24, 24, and 24 balls respectively. (6 points)Next, Player B will obviously take the box with 25 balls. In the following rounds:1: Player A places 6 balls in each of the remaining 4 boxes, and Player B takes one box, leaving 30 balls in the remaining three boxes.2: Player A places 8 balls in each of the remaining 3 boxes, and Player B takes one box, leaving 38 balls in the remaining two boxes.3: Player A places 12 balls in each of the remaining 2 boxes, and Player B takes one box, leaving 50 balls in the remaining one box.At this point, Player A places 25 more balls, bringing the total in this box to 75 balls. (9 points)Next, we describe Player B's strategy to ensure that Player A cannot achieve 76 points. Divide the boxes into five groups: 12, 34, 56, 78, and 9. When no box has more than 25 balls, Player B takes the group with the most total balls. (12 points)When a box has at least 25 balls, Player B takes the group containing the box with the most balls. (15 points)Under this strategy, if Player B performs the second operation, the total number of balls does not increase. When performing the first operation, if the initial number of balls is ( y ), the number of balls after one round is at most ( y + 25 - leftlceil frac{y + 25}{5} rightrceil ). This means that Player B can always keep the total number of balls below 121. (18 points) If Player A achieves 76 points in round ( n ), then at the beginning of this round, the box must have at least 51 balls.In round ( n-1 ), Player B must have taken a box with at least 51 balls, so the total number of balls in these two boxes at the beginning of the round must be at least 77, and the box with the most balls must have at least 39 balls.In round ( n-2 ), Player B must have taken a box with at least 39 balls, so the total number of balls in these three boxes at the beginning of the round must be at least 91, and the box with the most balls must have at least 31 balls.In round ( n-3 ), Player B must have taken a box with at least 31 balls, so the total number of balls at the midpoint of this round must be at least 122, which is a contradiction. (21 points) Therefore, by executing this strategy, Player B can ensure that Player A can never achieve 76 points, indicating that 75 is the maximum score Player A can achieve.【Comment: 3 points for the answer, 6 points for Player A's strategy, and the description of Player B's strategy is more challenging.

Therefore, ( x_n ) is bounded:   [   k_1 le x_n le k_2.   ]2. Limit Calculation:   We need to calculate the limit:   [   lim_{n to infty} frac{n! cdot (-1)^{1+n} cdot x_n^2}{n^n}.   ]   Since ( x_n ) is bounded, there exists a constant ( M ) such that ( |x_n| le M ) for all ( n ). Therefore, ( x_n^2 le M^2 ).   Consider the expression:   [   left| frac{n! cdot (-1)^{1+n} cdot x_n^2}{n^n} right| = frac{n! cdot x_n^2}{n^n}.   ]   Using the bound ( x_n^2 le M^2 ), we get:   [   left| frac{n! cdot x_n^2}{n^n} right| le frac{n! cdot M^2}{n^n}.   ]   We know from Stirling's approximation that ( n! approx sqrt{2 pi n} left( frac{n}{e} right)^n ). Thus,   [   frac{n!}{n^n} approx frac{sqrt{2 pi n} left( frac{n}{e} right)^n}{n^n} = sqrt{2 pi n} left( frac{1}{e} right)^n.   ]   As ( n to infty ), ( left( frac{1}{e} right)^n ) approaches 0 exponentially fast. Therefore,   [   lim_{n to infty} frac{n!}{n^n} = 0.   ]   Consequently,   [   lim_{n to infty} frac{n! cdot M^2}{n^n} = 0.   ]   Since ( left| frac{n! cdot x_n^2}{n^n} right| le frac{n! cdot M^2}{n^n} ) and the right-hand side tends to 0, by the squeeze theorem, we have:   [   lim_{n to infty} frac{n! cdot x_n^2}{n^n} = 0.   ]The final answer is (boxed{0})."},{"problem":"Given the hyperbola dfrac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = 1, find the equations of its asymptotes and its eccentricity.","solution":"The standard form of the hyperbola equation is given: dfrac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = 1.Thus, a = 2 and b = 1.Now, we calculate c:c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 5, so c = sqrt{5}.The equations of the asymptotes are then y = pm dfrac{1}{2}x.The eccentricity is: dfrac{sqrt{5}}{2}.Therefore, the answer is: y = pm dfrac{1}{2}x and boxed{dfrac{sqrt{5}}{2}}.By using the standard form of the hyperbola equation, we can find a, b, and c, which in turn allows us to determine the geometric properties of the hyperbola.

Determine the angles of triangle A B C.","solution":"## Solution to Exercise 10![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_8ce8798f2c48d3d66a92g-17.jpg?height=1028&width=717&top_left_y=377&top_left_x=675)Let alpha = widehat{ABD}. Let's examine the different angles in the figure and try to express them in terms of alpha. Since the line (BD) is the bisector of the angle widehat{CBA}, we know that widehat{ABD} = widehat{DBC}, and therefore widehat{ABC} = 2 widehat{ABD} = 2alpha. Since DB = DA, triangle ADB is isosceles at D, which means widehat{BAD} = widehat{ABD}, so widehat{BAC} = widehat{DAB} = alpha. Finally, triangle ABC is isosceles at A, which means widehat{ACB} = widehat{ABC} = 2 widehat{ABD} = 2alpha. Since the sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180^circ, we find180^circ = widehat{ABC} + widehat{ACB} + widehat{BAC} = 2alpha + 2alpha + alpha = 5alphaThus, alpha = frac{180^circ}{5} = 36^circ. This means that widehat{ABC} = widehat{ACB} = 72^circ and widehat{BAC} = 36^circ.Grader's Comment: The exercise relied on the fact that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal. A vast majority of students solved the exercise completely. Nevertheless, a significant number made errors such as confusing bisector and altitude, bisector and median, or getting the vertex of the bisector wrong. It is worth noting that a large number of students did not submit a figure with the exercise. We would like to emphasize the importance of the figure in a geometry problem; it is the main tool for working! Some students might have avoided some errors by drawing a neat figure."},{"problem":"Given x gt 0, y gt 0, and x+4y-2xy=0.

Therefore, the number of angles not exceeding 120^{circ} is mathrm{C}_{91}^{2} - e = 4095 - e.

Indeed, b c-b-c=(b-1)(c-1)-1, which is non-negative for b and c greater than one.Third, if there is a number 1 in the set, then we can replace any number a and 1 with a+1, thereby increasing the product of these numbers by 1.Thus, any set can be transformed into a set of twos and threes without decreasing the product of its numbers.Furthermore, if there are at least three twos, their product is 8. If we replace three twos with two threes, the sum of the numbers does not change, but the product becomes 9, which is again an increase. Thus, we can ensure that the number of twos is no more than two.Since 199=65 cdot 3+2 cdot 2, the final set will contain exactly two twos.Therefore, any set of natural numbers with a sum not exceeding 199 can be transformed into a set of 65 threes and two twos, and the product of the numbers in the set will not decrease.

Thus the blackboard will show 1 after 0 steps; 2 after 1 step; 1,3 after 2 steps; 2, 2, 4 after 3 steps, and so on. How many numbers will there be on the blackboard after n steps?","solution":"Solution I. Let S be a set of different numbers, all of them less than 2^{n-1}, and create two new sets as follows: S_{1}, consisting of all the numbers in S exceptthe smallest one, and S_{2}, with elements the smallest element of S and all the numbers we get by adding 2^{n-1} to each number in S. Note that if the number of elements in S is a, then S_{1} has a-1 elements, and S_{2} has a+1 elements. This corresponds to the operations we are allowed to perform on the blackboard, if we throw away all empty sets. If we now operate simultaneously on the sets and on the numbers, then after n steps the number of sets will be exactly equal to the number of numbers on the blackboard.Let us see what the set operations look like. We must start with a set, consisting only of the number 0 . Next we get an empty set (thrown away), and the set {0,1}; next the sets {1} and {0,2,3}; next again (an empty set and) {1,5},{2,3},{0,4,6,7}, etc.It is now fairly easy to prove by induction that after n steps(1) each number less than 2^{n} appears in exactly one set;(2) the number of elements in the sets corresponds exactly to the numbers on the blackboard;(3) if the numbers in each set are written in increasing order, then the difference between two neighbours is a power of 2 ; thus the binary representations of two neighbours differ in exactly one position (in the binary system the example above looks like this: {0} ;{0,1} ;{01},{00,10,11} ;{001,101},{010,011}, {000,100,110,111}) ;(4) if k is the number of ones in the binary code of the smallest number of a set, and l the number of ones in the largest number of the same set, then k+l=n; (5) each set contains exactly one number with leftlfloorfrac{n}{2}rightrfloor ones.The last property tells us that the number of sets after n steps is equal to the number of numbers such that their binary representation contains exactly leftlfloorfrac{n}{2}rightrfloor ones out of n digits, i.e. the number of numbers on the blackboard after n steps will be equal to binom{n}{leftlfloorfrac{n}{2}rightrfloor}."},{"problem":"Given f(x)= begin{cases} log_{3}x & ,x>0  2^{-x} & ,xleq 0 end{cases}, then fleft( frac {1}{9}right)+fleft(log_{2}^{ frac {1}{6}}right) equals to （　　）A: - frac {11}{6}B: -8C: 4D: 8","solution":"Given f(x)= begin{cases} log_{3}x & ,x>0  2^{-x} & ,xleq 0 end{cases},  then fleft( frac {1}{9}right)+fleft(log_{2}^{ frac {1}{6}}right) equals to log_{3} frac {1}{9} + 2^{-log_{2} frac {1}{6}} = -2 + 6 = 4.

Similarly, the first friend must have been correct as well, since he alone did not mention the Rodin Museum. Now, notice that the Bois de Boulogne was mentioned only by friend 3. This means that among the remaining, two must have been mistaken, since only three could have not visited the cathedral, and thus the third friend must have been correct.

Thus, the number 0 is a solution to equation (8).If x geqslant 1, then |x|=x and sqrt{x^{2}(x-1)}=x sqrt{x-1}; therefore, equation (8) takes the form x sqrt{x-1}=x.

The parabolas open outward along the radii of the circle and are tangent to each other in a cyclic manner.2. Equation of the Parabolas:   The given parabola is ( y = frac{x^2}{16} ). For a general parabola ( y = frac{x^2}{4p} ), we have ( 4p = 16 ), so ( p = 4 ). This means the focus of each parabola is at ( (0, 4) ).3. Vertices of the Parabolas:   The vertices of the parabolas are evenly spaced around a circle. Let the radius of the circle be ( R ). The vertices form a regular hexagon, so the distance between consecutive vertices (which is also the side length of the hexagon) is ( R ).4. Tangency Condition:   For two parabolas to be tangent to each other, the distance between their vertices must be such that their tangents at the points of tangency are equal. The tangents of the parabolas must meet at the center of the hexagon.5. Slope of the Tangent:   The slope of the tangent to the parabola ( y = frac{x^2}{16} ) at any point ( (x, y) ) is given by the derivative:   [   frac{dy}{dx} = frac{x}{8}   ]   We need the slope to be ( sqrt{3} ) (since the tangents form ( 30^circ ) angles with the radii of the circle):   [   frac{x}{8} = sqrt{3} implies x = 8sqrt{3}   ]6. Coordinates of the Tangent Point:   Substituting ( x = 8sqrt{3} ) into the parabola equation:   [   y = frac{(8sqrt{3})^2}{16} = frac{192}{16} = 12   ]   So, the point of tangency is ( (8sqrt{3}, 12) ).7. Center of the Circle:   The center of the circle must be directly below this point of tangency by the distance equal to the y-coordinate of the point of tangency (since the parabola is symmetric about the x-axis). Thus, the center of the circle is at ( (8sqrt{3}, -12) ).8. Radius of the Circle:   The radius of the circle is the distance from the center to the vertex of the parabola, which is ( 12 ).9.

Construct a regular hexagon inscribed in the large circle O, and then, with the midpoints of each side of the hexagon and point O as centers, and frac{r}{2} as the radius, draw 7 small circles. These will cover the entire large circular surface (see the figure below).In fact, connect O A, O B, O C. Let the midpoints of O B and O C be M and L, respectively. Then O B = O C = r, O M = M B = O L = L C = frac{r}{2}. Connect H M, M G, then triangle B H M and triangle B M G are both equilateral triangles, so H M = M G = frac{r}{2}, which means point M is exactly the intersection of circles H, G, and the small circle O. Similarly, point L is the intersection of circles H, I, and the small circle O. It is evident that the sector O B C is covered by circles H and O. Therefore, the entire large circular surface is completely covered by 7 small circular discs.(2) Below is the proof that any 6 small circular discs with radius frac{r}{2} cannot completely cover a large circular surface with radius r.Divide the circumference of the large circle into 48 equal parts, obtaining 48 points. Consider these 48 points and the center O, making a total of 49 points. Clearly, when two points are separated by 8 arcs, the distance between the two points is r. Therefore, a small circular disc with radius frac{r}{2} can cover at most 9 of the 48 points. Additionally, the distance from the center O to any point is r, so a small circular disc covering point O can cover at most 1 point. Therefore, no matter how the 6 small circular discs with radius frac{r}{2} are placed, they cannot cover all 49 points.In summary, at least 7 small circular discs are required to completely cover the large circular surface."},{"problem":"6.

The section of the sphere circumscribed around the pyramid is a circle of radius R, circumscribed around the isosceles triangle A P D. Extend the height P H to intersect this circle at point Q. Then D H = a is the height of the right triangle P D Q, drawn from the vertex of the right angle P D Q.

We need:   [   1990 = 2 cdot 5 cdot 199   ]   This means ( 2n ) must be of the form ( 2^a cdot 5^b cdot 199^c ) where ( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 1990 ).4. Prime Factorization:   Since ( 2n ) must have exactly three prime factors (2, 5, and 199), and ( n ) must be odd, ( n ) must be of the form:   [   n = 5^b cdot 199^c   ]   where ( (b+1)(c+1) = 1990 ).5. Possible Values:   The possible values for ( b ) and ( c ) that satisfy ( (b+1)(c+1) = 1990 ) are:   [   b+1 = 10 quad text{and} quad c+1 = 199 quad text{or} quad b+1 = 199 quad text{and} quad c+1 = 10   ]   Thus, ( b = 9 ) and ( c = 198 ) or ( b = 198 ) and ( c = 9 ).

C_{2003}^{2}+1=2005004.Consider a 9 times n grid, where the integers from 1 to n are each filled in 9 times, and the difference between the numbers in each column does not exceed 3. We will prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the numbers in the first row is not less than C_{n-1}^{2}+1.When n leqslant 4, the conclusion is obvious. Because each cell contains a number not less than 1, and when n leqslant 4, we have n geqslant C_{n-1}^{2}+1.Next, we perform the inductive step. If necessary, we can rearrange the columns so that the numbers in the first row are in non-decreasing order. Therefore, we can assume that the numbers in the first row are already in non-decreasing order. Let S_{i} denote the number of numbers in the first row that are not less than i, and let D_{i}=n-S_{i}. Thus, S_{1}=n, D_{1}=0, and the sum of the numbers in the first row isS=S_{1}+S_{2}+cdots+S_{n}.Rewriting the above, we getbegin{array}{l}S=left(n-D_{1}right)+left(n-D_{2}right)+cdots+left(n-D_{n}right) geqslant n(n-3)-left(D_{1}+D_{2}+cdots+D_{n-3}right).end{array}If for any i leqslant n-3, we have D_{1} leqslant i+1, thenbegin{array}{l}S geqslant n(n-3)-[0+3+4+cdots+(n-2)] =frac{n^{2}-3 n+4}{2}.end{array}This is what we need to prove.Assume there exists some k leqslant n-3 such that D_{k} geqslant k+2. In this case, k geqslant 2, so k+2 geqslant 4. Since the first row contains at least k+2 numbers less than k, all such numbers are in the first k+2 columns. This means that all numbers in the first k+2 columns do not exceed k+2. Therefore, all numbers in the remaining columns are not less than k+3. Now, we divide the entire grid into two parts: the first part consists of the first k+2 columns, and the rest form the second part. Since n-1 geqslant k+2 geqslant 4, the sum of the numbers in the first row of the first part is not less than mathrm{C}_{k+1}^{2}+1. If we subtract k+2 from each number in the second part, we get a grid with n-(k+2) geqslant 1 columns that satisfies the problem's conditions.

Given the functional inequality:   [   f(3x-2) leq f(x) leq f(2x-1)   ]   for every real ( x ), we need to find all continuous functions ( f(x) ) that satisfy this inequality.2. We start by considering the inequality ( f(3x-2) leq f(x) leq f(2x-1) ). To explore the behavior of ( f ), we will use induction to show that:   [   fleft(frac{x}{2^n}right) leq f(x) leq fleft(frac{x}{3^n}right)   ]   for all ( x in mathbb{R} ) and ( n in mathbb{N} ).3. Base Case: For ( n = 1 ), we have:   [   fleft(frac{x}{2}right) leq f(x) leq fleft(frac{x}{3}right)   ]   This follows directly from the given inequality by substituting ( x ) with ( frac{x}{2} ) and ( frac{x}{3} ).4. Inductive Step: Assume that for some ( n in mathbb{N} ), the inequality holds:   [   fleft(frac{x}{2^n}right) leq f(x) leq fleft(frac{x}{3^n}right)   ]   We need to show that it holds for ( n+1 ):   [   fleft(frac{x}{2^{n+1}}right) leq f(x) leq fleft(frac{x}{3^{n+1}}right)   ]5.

Determine all positive integers that cannot be written as frac{a}{b}+frac{a+1}{b+1} with a, b positive and integer.","solution":"Solution. It holds thatfrac{a}{b}+frac{a+1}{b+1}=frac{2 a b+a+b}{b(b+1)}Assume that this is equal to an integer n. Then b mid 2 a b+a+b and b+1 mid 2 a b+a+b. From the first, it follows that b mid a and thus also b mid a-b. From the second, it follows that b+1 mid (2 a b+a+b) - (b+1) cdot 2a = -a + b, so also b+1 mid a-b. Since the greatest common divisor of b and b+1 is 1, we can conclude that b(b+1) mid a-b. We can thus write a as a = b(b+1) cdot k + b. Since a must be positive, k must be a non-negative integer. Substituting this in, we get:begin{aligned}n & =frac{2 a b+a+b}{b(b+1)} & =frac{2 cdot (b(b+1) cdot k + b) cdot b + (b(b+1) cdot k + b) + b}{b(b+1)} & =frac{b(b+1) cdot (2 k b + k) + 2 b^2 + 2 b}{b(b+1)} & =(2 b + 1) k + 2.end{aligned}Thus, n is of the form n = (2 b + 1) k + 2. From this, we see that n geq 2 (since k geq 0) and that n-2 must be divisible by an odd number greater than 1 (namely 2 b + 1 geq 3).Conversely, suppose that for a number n it holds that n geq 2 and n-2 is divisible by an odd number greater than 1, say by 2 b + 1 with b geq 1 and integer. Then there is a k geq 0 such that n = (2 b + 1) k + 2. Choose now a = b(b+1) cdot k + b, then a is a positive integer and it holds thatfrac{a}{b}+frac{a+1}{b+1} = ((b+1) k + 1) + (b k + 1) = (2 b + 1) k + 2 = n.We can now conclude that the numbers that can be written as frac{a}{b}+frac{a+1}{b+1} with a and b positive integers are exactly the numbers n geq 2 for which n-2 is divisible by an odd number greater than 1. The numbers that cannot be written in this way are thus exactly 1 and the numbers n geq 2 for which n-2 has no odd divisor greater than 1, i.e., for which n-2 is a power of two 2^m with m geq 0.We conclude that the numbers that cannot be written as frac{a}{b}+frac{a+1}{b+1} are exactly 1 and the numbers of the form 2^m + 2 with m geq 0."},{"problem":"Example 6.

Initial Consideration:   - We start by noting that ( n = 1 ) trivially satisfies the condition since there are no positive integers less than or equal to 1 that are not relatively prime to 1.   - For ( n geq 2 ), we need to ensure that all positive integers less than or equal to ( n ) and relatively prime to ( n ) are pairwise coprime.2. Smallest Prime Not Dividing ( n ):   - Let ( p ) be the smallest prime that does not divide ( n ). If ( p geq 11 ), then the primes ( 2, 3, 5, ) and ( 7 ) must all divide ( n ). This implies:     [     n geq 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 = 210     ]   - However, if ( p geq 11 ), then ( p^2 < n ) (since ( p^2 < 121 ) and ( n geq 210 )). This means ( p ) and ( p^2 ) are not relatively prime, which contradicts our condition. Therefore, ( p ) must be one of ( {2, 3, 5, 7} ).3. Case Analysis:   - Case ( p = 2 ):     - If ( p = 2 ), then ( n ) must be odd (since 2 does not divide ( n )). The only odd numbers less than 4 are 1 and 3. Thus, ( n = 3 ) is a valid solution.      - Case ( p = 3 ):     - If ( p = 3 ), then ( n ) must be even (since 2 divides ( n )). Additionally, ( n < 9 ). The even numbers less than 9 are 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Additionally, ( n < 25 ). The multiples of 6 less than 25 are 6, 12, 18, and 24. We need to check which of these satisfy the condition:       - ( n = 6 ): The numbers less than or equal to 6 and relatively prime to 6 are {1, 5}, which are pairwise coprime.       - ( n = 12 ): The numbers less than or equal to 12 and relatively prime to 12 are {1, 5, 7, 11}, which are pairwise coprime.       - ( n = 18 ): The numbers less than or equal to 18 and relatively prime to 18 are {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}, which are pairwise coprime.       - ( n = 24 ): The numbers less than or equal to 24 and relatively prime to 24 are {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23}, which are pairwise coprime.      - Case ( p = 7 ):     - If ( p = 7 ), then ( n ) must be divisible by 30 (since 2, 3, and 5 divide ( n )). Additionally, ( n < 49 ). The only multiple of 30 less than 49 is 30. We need to check if it satisfies the condition:       - ( n = 30 ): The numbers less than or equal to 30 and relatively prime to 30 are {1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}, which are pairwise coprime.4.

We begin with the given inequality that x^2 > 0. This is true for all real x except x = 0.2. We are interested in finding the minimum value of the expression x^2 + frac{1}{x^2}. To approach this, we use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality), which states that for any non-negative real numbers a and b, the following holds: frac{a+b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}3. Applying the AM-GM inequality to our expression, we let a = x^2 and b = frac{1}{x^2}.

The equality in AM-GM holds if and only if a = b. In our case, this means x^2 = frac{1}{x^2}. Solving for x, we find that x^4 = 1, which implies x^2 = 1 and hence x = pm 1.5.

Let X be the sum of the distances of the points from the rightmost point. If a move does not change the rightmost point, then it reduces X. If it moves the rightmost point a distance z to the right, then it reduces X by at least z/k - (N-1)z = k 0 z. X cannot be reduced below nil. So the total distance moved by the rightmost point is at most X 0 /k 0 , where X 0 is the initial value of X. Conversely, suppose k ≥ 1/(N-1), so that k 1 = (N-1) - 1/k ≥ 0. We always move the leftmost point. This has the effect of moving the rightmost point z > 0 and increasing X by (N-1)z - z/k = k 1 z ≥ 0. So X is never decreased. But z ≥ k X/(N-1) ≥ k X 0 /(N-1) > 0.

How many pairs (a, b) of triangular numbers are there such that b-a=2007? (It is recalled that 223 is a prime number).SOLUTION","solution":"17. There are 6 pairs of triangular numbers that satisfy the required condition. The problem is equivalent to finding pairs of positive integers (n, m) such thatfrac{n(n+1)}{2}-frac{m(m+1)}{2}=2007.Indeed, since different values of n determine different values of frac{n(n+1)}{2}, determining the triangular numbers a and b is equivalent to determining the values of n and m that generate them.By removing the denominators and factoring, the equation becomes(n-m)(n+m+1)=2 cdot 2007=2 cdot 3^{2} cdot 223.Since n>0, m>0, and therefore n+m+1>0, n-m must also be positive. The equation (4) then represents a way to write 2 cdot 2007 as a product of two positive integers. But the only ways to break down 2 cdot 3^{2} cdot 223 as a product of two positive integers are obtained by \\"distributing\\" all possible ways of its prime factors between the two integers, explicitly:- 1 and 2 cdot 3 cdot 3 cdot 223;- 2 and 3 cdot 3 cdot 223;- 3 and 2 cdot 3 cdot 223;- 2 cdot 3 and 3 cdot 223;- 3 cdot 3 and 2 cdot 223;- 2 cdot 3 cdot 3 and 223Since (n+m+1)-(n-m)=2 m+1>0, n-m is always the smaller of the two factors in the pair ^{1}. Let u=n+m+1 and v=n-m, then we must be in one of the following cases:- v=1, u=2 cdot 3 cdot 3 cdot 223;- v=2, u=3 cdot 3 cdot 223;- v=3, u=2 cdot 3 cdot 223;- v=2 cdot 3, u=3 cdot 223;- v=3 cdot 3, u=2 cdot 223;- v=2 cdot 3 cdot 3, u=223.[^0]Now solving the systemleft{begin{array}{l}n+m+1=u n-m=vend{array}right.for the unknowns n and m we getleft{begin{array}{l}n=frac{u+v-1}{2} m=frac{u-v-1}{2}.end{array}right.Note that substituting the six values of (u, v) corresponding to the six possible cases into equations (5) always yields an acceptable pair of values (n, m) (i.e., integers and positive: indeed, it is always u-v>1, and since 2 cdot 2007 has only one factor of 2, in all cases exactly one of u and v is even, and therefore u+v-1 and u-v-1 are always even). For all six of these pairs, as they were obtained, (n+m+1)(n-m)=2 cdot 2007 holds, and thus all are solutions to the original equation. Moreover, the six cases presented exhaust all possibilities, so there are no other solutions.

We need to check combinations of the two-digit very prime numbers:   - pq = 23: pqrs = 2373, but 2373 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits 2+3+7+3=15 is divisible by 3).   - pq = 37: pqrs = 3737, but 3737 is divisible by 37.   - pq = 53: pqrs = 5373, but 5373 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits 5+3+7+3=18 is divisible by 3).   - pq = 73: pqrs = 7373, but 7373 is divisible by 73.   Since none of these combinations result in a very prime number, there are no very prime numbers with 4 or more digits.4. Check for very prime numbers with 3 digits: Assume pqr is the largest very prime number. We need to check combinations of the two-digit very prime numbers:   - pq = 73: pqr = 737, but 737 is divisible by 11.   - pq = 53: pqr = 537, but 537 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits 5+3+7=15 is divisible by 3).   - pq = 37: pqr = 373, and we need to check if 373 is prime.5. Check if 373 is prime:   - 373 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).   - 373 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits 3+7+3=13 is not divisible by 3).   - 373 is not divisible by 5 (it does not end in 0 or 5).   - 373 is not divisible by 7 (perform division: 373 div 7 approx 53.2857).   - 373 is not divisible by 11 (alternating sum of digits 3-7+3=-1 is not divisible by 11).   - 373 is not divisible by 13 (perform division: 373 div 13 approx 28.6923).   - 373 is not divisible by 17 (perform division: 373 div 17 approx 21.9412).   - 373 is not divisible by 19 (perform division: 373 div 19 approx 19.6316).   Since 373 is not divisible by any prime number up to its square root (approximately 19.3), 373 is a prime number.6. Conclusion: Since 373 is a prime number and all its consecutive digits (3, 7, 3, 37, 73, and 373) are prime, 373 is a very prime number.The final answer is boxed{373}."},{"problem":"Given that the eccentricity of the ellipse mx^{2}+ny^{2}=1 with foci on the x-axis is frac{1}{2}, determine the value of frac{m}{n}.","solution":"In the ellipse mx^{2}+ny^{2}=1 with foci on the x-axis:- a^{2}=frac{1}{m}- b^{2}=frac{1}{n}- e^{2}=1-frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}=1-frac{m}{n}=frac{1}{4}Thus, frac{m}{n}=frac{3}{4}.Therefore, the answer is boxed{frac{3}{4}}.In the ellipse mx^{2}+ny^{2}=1 with foci on the x-axis, we can derive the ratio of m:n.

What is the minimum value of the sum of distances from an arbitrary point in space to the vertices of this tetrahedron?","solution":"11.13. a) Let's draw planes through the vertices of a regular tetrahedron (ABCD) parallel to the opposite faces. These planes also form a regular tetrahedron. It follows that the sum of the distances from any internal point (X) of the tetrahedron (ABCD) to these planes is constant (Problem 8.1, a). The distance from point (X) to such a plane does not exceed the distance from point (X) to the corresponding vertex of the tetrahedron, and the sum of the distances from point (X) to the vertices of the tetrahedron equals the sum of the distances from point (X) to these planes only if (X) is the center of the tetrahedron.b) Let in the tetrahedron (ABCD) the edges (AB) and (CD) be equal to (b) and (c), and the other edges be equal to (a).

In this case, we obtain an isosceles trapezoid (ABCD) with bases (b) and (c) and height (MN = sqrt{a^2 - (b^2 + c^2) / 4}). For any convex quadrilateral, the sum of distances to the vertices reaches its minimum value at the point of intersection of the diagonals; in this case, it is equal to the sum of the lengths of the diagonals.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the number of sequences of words starting from a single letter and ending with the word \\"CCAMT\\". Each subsequent word in the sequence is formed by inserting a letter into the previous word.2. Counting the Sequences:   To form the word \\"CCAMT\\", we start with one letter and add one letter at a time until we have all five letters. The order in which we add the letters matters, but the position within the word can vary.3. Permutations with Repetition:   The word \\"CCAMT\\" contains 5 letters where 'C' appears twice. The number of distinct permutations of the letters in \\"CCAMT\\" is given by the formula for permutations of a multiset:   [   frac{n!}{n_1! cdot n_2! cdot ldots cdot n_k!}   ]   where ( n ) is the total number of items to arrange, and ( n_1, n_2, ldots, n_k ) are the frequencies of the distinct items.4. Applying the Formula:   Here, ( n = 5 ) (total letters), and the frequencies are ( 2 ) for 'C' and ( 1 ) for 'A', 'M', and 'T'. Thus, the number of distinct sequences is:   [   frac{5!}{2! cdot 1! cdot 1! cdot 1!} = frac{120}{2} = 60   ]5.

Prove that m = n = 6 and find the angles of triangle ABC.","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to use complex numbers and properties of regular polygons. We will show that ( m = n = 6 ) and find the angles of (triangle ABC).1. Setup and Notation:   - Let ( A, B, C ) be the vertices of the triangle ( triangle ABC ) in counterclockwise order.   - Construct a square on ( AB ), a regular ( m )-gon on ( BC ), and a regular ( n )-gon on ( CA ) externally.   - Identify the plane with the complex plane (mathbb{C}), and let ( a, b, c ) be the complex numbers corresponding to the vertices ( A, B, C ) respectively.   - Let (zeta_m = e^{2pi i/m}) and (zeta_n = e^{2pi i/n}) be the primitive roots of unity for the ( m )-gon and ( n )-gon respectively.   - Let (omega = e^{pi i/3}) be the primitive 6th root of unity corresponding to a rotation by (60^circ).2. Centers of the Polygons:   - The center of the square on ( AB ) is at ( frac{a+b}{2} + ifrac{b-a}{2} ).   - The center of the regular ( m )-gon on ( BC ) is at ( frac{b+c}{2} + frac{b-c}{2} zeta_m ).   - The center of the regular ( n )-gon on ( CA ) is at ( frac{c+a}{2} + frac{c-a}{2} zeta_n ).3. Condition for Regular Triangle:   - The centers of these polygons form a regular triangle, which means the distances between these centers are equal and the angles between them are (120^circ).   - This implies that the ratio of the distances and the angles between the centers must satisfy the properties of a regular triangle.4. Equating the Centers:   - We need to equate the distances and angles between the centers to form a regular triangle.   - Using the given condition, we have:     [     frac{b-c}{b-a} + icdotfrac{c-a}{b-a} = frac{omega + izeta_n}{omegacdotzeta_m + 1}     ]   - Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:     [     frac{cosleft(pi/n + pi/12right)}{cosleft(pi/m + pi/6right)}cdot e^{pi i(2/3 +1/n+1/m)}     ]5. Solving for ( m ) and ( n ):   - Since the centers form a regular triangle, the only possible values for ( m ) and ( n ) that satisfy the condition are ( m = n = 6 ).   - This is because a regular hexagon (6-gon) is the only polygon that can form a regular triangle with its centers when combined with a square.6. Angles of (triangle ABC):   - Since ( m = n = 6 ), the angles of (triangle ABC) must be such that the external polygons form a regular triangle.   - The angles of (triangle ABC) are (60^circ), (60^circ), and (60^circ), making it an equilateral triangle.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ m = n = 6 } ) and the angles of (triangle ABC) are (60^circ), (60^circ), and (60^circ)."},{"problem":"Given f(x)=x^2+2xf'(- frac{1}{3} ), find f'(- frac{1}{3})= ____________.","solution":"First, we find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, which is f'(x)=2x+2f'(- frac{1}{3} ).

Extend the grid to (2 times n):   Reflect the (2 times 3) grid over the rightmost edge repeatedly to form a (2 times n) grid:   [   begin{matrix}   1 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & cdots    3 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 1 & cdots    end{matrix}   ]4.

Verify the conditions:   - Each cell in the grid has the same number of neighboring cells of the two other colors.   - Each corner cell has no neighboring cells of its color.6. Generalize the construction:   The construction works for (m times n) grids where (2 mid m) and (3 mid n). Similarly, we can construct a good coloring for (m times n) grids where (3 mid m) and (2 mid n).7. Prove the necessity:   Assume the top-left corner is colored (1), the cell to its right is (2), and the cell below is (3):   [   begin{matrix}   1 & 2 & cdots    3 & x & cdots    . & . & .    . & . & .    . & . & .    end{matrix}   ]   - If (x = 2), then the pattern forces (2 mid m) and (3 mid n).   - If (x = 3), then the pattern forces (2 mid n) and (3 mid m).8. Conclusion:   The only pairs ((m, n)) for which there exists a good coloring of an (m times n) table are those where either (2 mid m) and (3 mid n) or (2 mid n) and (3 mid m).The final answer is ( boxed{ (m, n) } ) such that either (2 mid m) and (3 mid n) or (2 mid n) and (3 mid m)."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, if sin A = 2sin Ccos B, then this triangle is a(n) __________.A: Equilateral triangleB: Acute triangleC: Isosceles triangleD: Right triangle","solution":"Since A + B + C = pi, we have A = pi - (B + C).

For what smallest k can a series of such moves result in a configuration where each chip is shifted one position clockwise relative to its initial position?(S. Berlov)","solution":"# Answer: 50.Solution. Example. The chip 50 is sequentially exchanged 99 times with the next one counterclockwise. We get the required arrangement.There are several ways to prove the estimate, below we provide two of them.The first way. Suppose that for some k<50 the required arrangement is obtained.At any moment, we consider the arc from chip 100 to chip 1 clockwise to be painted. Since chips 100 and 1 cannot be swapped in one move, each specific chip m (2 leqslant m leqslant 99) could only enter the painted arc or leave the painted arc by swapping with one of the chips 1 or 100.Since initially and at the end, chip m was not on the painted arc, it made an equal number of entries onto the painted arc and exits from the painted arc. For m leqslant 50, chip m could not swap with chip 100, so it could only enter or exit by swapping with chip 1. Upon entry, chip 1 moves 1 position clockwise, and upon exit, 1 position counterclockwise. We conduct similar reasoning for chips m geqslant 51, which cannot swap with chip 1.Thus, we obtain that chips 1 and 100 will make an equal number of moves clockwise and counterclockwise, so they will remain in their positions. Contradiction.The second way. We will count the shifts of the chips relative to their initial position, with a shift clockwise being counted as positive and a shift counterclockwise as negative. Then, when two chips are swapped, +1 is added to the shift of one of them, and -1 to the other. Therefore, the sum of the shifts after the operations will be 0.We reason by contradiction: suppose that for k<50 each chip i is finally shifted one position clockwise, i.e., its shift is 1+100 t_{i} (here t_{i} is the integer \\"number of rotations\\" clockwise, in particular, if t_{i}<0, chip i made left|t_{i}right| rotations counterclockwise). Then the total shift of all 100 chips is 100left(t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{100}right)+100. Since it must equal 0, we have t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{100}=-1.Since k<50, chips with numbers i and j, where j geqslant i+50, could not swap places, so their shifts at any moment are definitely less than 100 apart, meaning the \\"number of rotations\\" t_{i} and t_{j} are equal for j geqslant i+50. Hence, we have t_{1}=t_{51}, t_{2}=t_{52}, ldots, t_{50}=t_{100}. Then the sum t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{100}=2left(t_{1}+right. left.+t_{2}+ldots+t_{50}right) is even, and thus cannot equal -1. Contradiction.Remark 1. The last reasoning can be modified as follows.From this, t_{1}=t_{51}, t_{1}=t_{52}, ldots, t_{1}=t_{100}, t_{2}=t_{100}, t_{3}=t_{100}, ldots, t_{50}=t_{100}, thus all t_{i} are equal to t_{1}. Then t_{1}+t_{2}+ +ldots+t_{100}=100 t_{1} neq-1.Remark 2. The proof can be completed by contradiction in another way, replacing the last paragraph of the solution with the following reasoning.We will paint chips red for which t_{i} geqslant 0, and blue for which t_{i}<0. Clearly, at some point, a blue and a red chip must swap, since the difference in their shifts is at least 100. Since k<50, the pair of chips 1 and 51 are of the same color, similarly pairs of chips 1 and 52, ldots, 1 and 100, 2 and 100, 3 and 100, ldots, 50 and 100- are of the same color. Thus, all chips are of the same color. We know that t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{100}=-1, so among the numbers t_{1}, ldots, t_{100} there are both non-negative and negative ones, i.e., there are both red and blue chips - contradiction.Comment.

Distinct Positive Integers: Since the ( n^2 ) positive integers in the grid are pairwise distinct, the smallest possible set of these integers is ( {1, 2, 3, ldots, n^2} ).2. Maximum Value: The maximum value in this set is ( n^2 ).3. GCD Conditions: For each row and each column, we compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the ( n ) numbers in that row/column, and we obtain ( 2n ) different outcomes.4. Minimum GCD Values: The smallest possible distinct GCD values for ( 2n ) different outcomes are ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, 2n ).5. Number of Distinct GCDs: Since there are ( 2n ) distinct GCDs, and each GCD must be a divisor of some number in the grid, the numbers in the grid must be large enough to accommodate these GCDs.6.

In numbers, this givesL_{min }>L_{-}=frac{pi}{2}+sqrt{10}>frac{3.14}{2}+3.15>4.7 text{. Therefore, the rope will not be enough. }In variants 2 and 3, the rope is sufficient.

Note that since each of r, m and n includes at most one factor of 5 and at most one factor of 7 and each of r, m and n cannot contain both a factor of 5 and a factor of 7 , then y+z is at most 3 .Case 1: y=3If r m n includes 3 factors of 5 , then r=m=n=5 and so r m n=5^{3}.This means that there is only one possible value for r m n.Case 2: z=3Here, it must be the case that r m n=7^{3} and so there is only one possible value for r m n.Case 3: y=2 and z=1Here, it must be the case that two of r, m, n are 5 and the other is 7 .In other words, r m n must equal 5^{2} times 7.This means that there is only one possible value for mathrm{rmn}.Case 4: y=1 and z=2Here, r m n must equal 5 times 7^{2}.This means that there is only one possible value for r m n.Case 5: y=2 and z=0Here, two of r, m, n must equal 5 and the third cannot be 5 or 7 .This means that the possible values for the third of these are 2,3,4,6,8,9.This means that there are 6 possible values for r m n in this case.Case 6: y=0 and z=2As in Case 5, there are 6 possible values for r m n.Case 7: y=1 and z=1Here, one of r, m, n equals 5 , one equals 7 , and the other must be one of 2,3,4,6,8,9. This means that there are 6 possible values for r m n in this case.Case 8: y=1 and z=0Here, one of r, m, n equals 5 and none of these equal 7. Suppose that r=5.Each of m and n equals one of 2,3,4,6,8,9.We make a multiplication table to determine the possible values of m n :| times | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 9 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 18 || 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 27 || 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 24 | 32 | 36 || 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 36 | 48 | 54 || 8 | 16 | 24 | 32 | 48 | 64 | 72 || 9 | 18 | 27 | 36 | 54 | 72 | 81 |The different values in this table are4,6,8,9,12,16,18,24,27,32,36,48,54,64,72,81of which there are 16 .Therefore, there are 16 possible values of r m n in this case.Case 9: y=0 and z=1As in Case 8, there are 16 possible values of r m n.Case 10: y=0 and z=0Here, none of r, m, n is 5 or 7 .This means that each of r, m, n equals one of 2,3,4,6,8,9.This means that the only possible prime factors of r m n are 2 and 3 .Each of 2,3,4,6,8,9 includes at most 2 factors of 3 and only 9 includes 2 factors of 3 .This means that r m n contains at most 6 factors of 3 .Let w be the number of factors of 3 in r m n.- If w=6, then r=m=n=9 and so r m n=9^{3}. There is one value of r m n here.- If w=5, then two of r, m, n equal 9 and the third is 3 or 6 . This means that r m n=9^{2} times 3 or r m n=9^{2} times 6. There are two values of r m n here.- If w=4, then either two of r, m, n equal 9 and the third does not include a factor of 3 , or one of r, m, n equals 9 and the second and third are each 3 or 6 .Thus, r m n can equal 9^{2} times 2,9^{2} times 4,9^{2} times 8,9 times 3 times 3,9 times 3 times 6, or 9 times 6 times 6.There is duplication in this list and so the values of mathrm{rmn} are 9^{2}, 9^{2} times 2,9^{2} times 4,9^{2} times 8. There are four values of r m n here.- If w=3, we can have one of r, m, n equal to 9 , one equal to 3 or 6 , and the last equal to 2,4 or 8 , or we can have each of r, m, n equal to 3 or 6 .In the first situation, r m n can be 9 times 3 times 2,9 times 3 times 4,9 times 3 times 8,9 times 6 times 2,9 times 6 times 4, 9 times 6 times 8.These can be written as 27 times 2^{1}, 27 times 2^{2}, 27 times 2^{3}, 27 times 2^{4}.In the second situation, rmn can be 3 times 3 times 3,3 times 3 times 6,3 times 6 times 6,6 times 6 times 6.These equal 27,27 times 2^{1}, 27 times 2^{2}, 27 times 2^{3}.Combining lists, we get 27,27 times 2^{1}, 27 times 2^{2}, 27 times 2^{3}, 27 times 2^{4}.Therefore, in this case there are 5 possible values for r m n.- If w=2, then either one of r, m, n equals 9 or two of r, m, n equal 3 or 6 .In the first situation, the other two of r, m, n equal 2,4 or 8 .Note that 2=2^{1} and 4=2^{2} and 8=2^{3}.Thus r m n contains at least 2 factors of 2 (for example, r m n=9 times 2 times 2 ) and contains at most 6 factors of 2(r m n=9 times 8 times 8).If two of r, m, n equal 3 or 6 , then the third equals 2,4 or 8 .Thus, r m n contains at least 1 factor of 2(r m n=3 times 3 times 2) and at most 5 factors of 2 (r m n=6 times 6 times 8).Combining these possibilities, r m n can equal 9 times 2,9 times 2^{2}, ldots, 9 times 2^{6}, and so there are 6 possible values of r m n in this case.- If w=1, then one of r, m, n equals 3 or 6 , and the other two equal 2,4 or 8 .Thus, r m n can contain at most 7 factors of 2(r m n=6 times 8 times 8) and must contain at least 2 factors of 2(r m n=3 times 2 times 2).Each of the number of factors of 2 between 2 and 7, inclusive, is possible, so there are 6 possible values of r m n.- If w=0, then none of r, m, n can equal 3,6 or 9 .Thus, each of r, m, n equals 2^{1}, 2^{2} or 2^{3}.Thus, rmn must be a power of 2 and includes at least 3 and no more than 9 factors of 2 . Each of these is possible, so there are 7 possible values of r m n.In total, the number of possible values of r m n (and hence of r s t ) is2 times 1+2 times 1+2 times 6+6+2 times 16+(1+2+4+5+6+6+7)which equals 85 .ANSWER: (A)"},{"problem":"6.113. left{begin{array}{l}sqrt{frac{x+a}{y}}+sqrt{frac{y}{x+a}}=2,  x+y=x y+a .end{array}right.","solution":"## Solution.Domain of definition: frac{x+a}{y}>0.Let sqrt{frac{x+a}{y}}=t, where t>0.

But if he cut off one tail, two would grow back; if he cut off two tails, a head would grow back; if he cut off a head, a new head would grow back, and if he cut off two heads, nothing would grow back. How should Ivan the Tsarevich act to cut off all the heads and all the tails of the Zmey as quickly as possible","solution":"We need to ensure that Zmey Gorynych has an even number of heads and no tails. To achieve this, we first need to reach a certain number of tails.## SolutionNotice that cutting off one head is meaningless. There are three types of strikes left: with the first, the number of tails increases by 1; with the second, the number of tails decreases by 2, but the number of heads increases by 1; with the third, the number of heads decreases by 2.Each strike of the second type (and only it) changes the parity of the number of heads. Since the number of heads is initially odd, and in the end, it should become an even number (0), the number of strikes of the second type must be odd. However, one such strike is insufficient—it will not be enough to cut off all the tails, and strikes of other types only increase the number of tails. Therefore, there must be at least three strikes of the second type.With this, at least three additional heads will grow, and to cut off all the heads, at least three strikes of the third type will be required.Moreover, three strikes of the second type will cut off six tails, so at least three additional tails need to grow, which will require at least three strikes of the first type. In total, at least nine strikes are needed. And they are sufficient. For example, Ivan can first deliver three strikes of the first type (increasing the number of tails to six), then cut off all the tails with three strikes of the second type (resulting in six heads), and finally, cut off these six heads with three strikes of the third type."},{"problem":"Table tennis, known as the \\"national ball\\" of China.

Determine the possible outcomes for the number of games played: Since the match is a best-of-five format, the match can end after 3, 4, or 5 games. This gives us three possible outcomes for X, the actual number of games played: X=3, X=4, and X=5.2. Calculate the probability of the match ending in three games:   - The match can end in three games if either player A wins all three games or player B wins all three games. The probability of player A winning all three games is p^3, and the probability of player B winning all three games is (1-p)^3.   - Therefore, P(X=3) = p^3 + (1-p)^3.3. Calculate the probability of the match ending in four games:   - The match can end in four games in two scenarios: player A wins three games and loses one, or player B wins three games and loses one. The number of ways player A can win three out of four games is C_3^1 = 3, and similarly for player B. Therefore, the probability for this scenario is 3p^3(1-p) + 3p(1-p)^3.   - Hence, P(X=4) = 3p^3(1-p) + 3p(1-p)^3.4. Calculate the probability of the match ending in five games:   - The match ends in five games only when each player wins two of the first four games. The number of ways this can happen is C_4^2 = 6.   - Therefore, P(X=5) = 6p^2(1-p)^2.5. Calculate the expected number of games played, f(p):   - Using the probabilities calculated, the expected number of games is f(p) = 3P(X=3) + 4P(X=4) + 5P(X=5).   - Substituting the probabilities, we get f(p) = 3[p^3 + (1-p)^3] + 4[3p^3(1-p) + 3p(1-p)^3] + 5[6p^2(1-p)^2].   - Simplifying, f(p) = 6p^4 - 12p^3 + 3p^2 + 3p + 3.6. Analyze the constant term of f(p):   - By evaluating f(p), we see that the constant term is 3. Therefore, statement B is correct.7. Evaluate f(frac{1}{2}):   - Substituting p = frac{1}{2} into f(p), we get f(frac{1}{2}) = 6(frac{1}{16}) - 12(frac{1}{8}) + 3(frac{1}{4}) + frac{3}{2} + 3 = frac{33}{8}.   - Therefore, statement D is correct.8. Analyze the monotonicity of f(p):   - The derivative of f(p), f'(p) = 24p^3 - 36p^2 + 6p + 3, can be factored as 3(2p-1)(4p^2-4p-1).   - Since 4p^2-4p-1 = (2p-1)^2 - 2 < 0 for 0 leqslant p leqslant 1, the function f(p) is monotonically increasing on (0, frac{1}{2}) and decreasing on (frac{1}{2}, 1).   - Therefore, statement C is incorrect because it claims f(p) is monotonically decreasing on (0, frac{1}{2}).Given the analysis, the correct statements are A, B, and D.

The divisors of this (since in our problem a and b are relatively prime, as b is prime and not a divisor of a) are the divisors of b and a^{2}. However, b has no common divisor greater than 1 with a^{2}+a b+b^{2}, because a is a divisor of b and b^{2}, but a^{2} is not divisible by any divisor of b greater than 1, and a^{2} has no common divisor greater than 1 with a^{2}+a b+b^{2}, because the sum of the last two terms is b(a+b), where b is prime and a+b is relatively prime to b, to a, and thus to a^{2}.Accordingly, the greatest common divisor of A and C is a^{2}-a b+b^{2}=177^{2}-30621+173^{2}=30637, and this is also the greatest common divisor of the pair B, C based on the aforementioned (swap) relationship between A and B, since swapping a and b does not change a^{2}+a b+b^{2}, and the reasoning applied to a^{2} b can essentially be repeated for b^{2} a."},{"problem":"Find all triples of natural numbers a, b, c such that a<b<c and the value of the fraction frac{1}{7}(44-a b c) is a natural number.(Bird's)","solution":"Let's denote the numerator of the fraction, i.e., the expression 44 - a b c as p.

The eccentricity of the hyperbola Γ is ( )A: sqrt{7}B: sqrt{5}C: sqrt{3}D: sqrt{2}","solution":"To solve this problem, we start by analyzing the given conditions and applying geometric properties and definitions related to hyperbolas.1. Given that overrightarrow{CB}=3overrightarrow{F_{2}A}, we can infer that triangles triangle F_{1}AF_{2} and triangle F_{1}BC are similar. This is because the vector condition implies a scaling factor between corresponding sides of the triangles.2. Let |F_{1}F_{2}|=2c, which is a standard notation for the distance between the foci of a hyperbola. Given this, we can deduce that |F_{2}C|=4c due to the similarity and scaling factor between the triangles.3. If we let |AF_{1}|=t, then by the properties of similar triangles and the given vector relationship, |BF_{1}|=3t and consequently, |AB|=2t.4. Given that BF_{2} bisects angle F_{1}BC, by the angle bisector theorem, we have:   [   frac{|BF_1|}{|BC|}=frac{|F_1F_2|}{|F_2C|}=frac{2c}{4c}=frac{1}{2}   ]   This implies that |BC|=2|BF_{1}|=6t, and therefore, |AF_2|=frac{1}{3}|BC|=2t.5. According to the definition of a hyperbola, the difference in distances from any point on the hyperbola to the foci is constant and equal to 2a. Thus, from |AF_{2}|-|AF_{1}|=2a, we get 2t-t=2a, leading to t=2a.6. Also, from |BF_{1}|-|BF_{2}|=2a, we find that |BF_{2}|=3t-2a=2t. This implies that |BF_{2}|=|AB|=|AF_{2}|=2t, showing that triangle ABF_{2} is an equilateral triangle, and hence, angle F_{2}BC=angle ABF_{2}=60^{circ}.7. In triangle F_{1}BF_{2}, applying the law of cosines to angle F_1BF_2, we have:   [   cosangle F_1BF_2=frac{|BF_1|^2+|BF_2|^2-|F_1F_2|^2}{2cdot|BF_1|cdot|BF_2|}=frac{4t^2+9t^2-4c^2}{2cdot2tcdot3t}=frac{1}{2}   ]   Simplifying this equation gives us 7t^{2}=4c^{2}.8. Substituting t=2a (from step 5) into the equation 7t^{2}=4c^{2}, we find the relationship between c and a, which defines the eccentricity e of the hyperbola as e=frac{c}{a}=sqrt{7}.Therefore, the eccentricity of the hyperbola Gamma is boxed{sqrt{7}}.

According to the given information, (a neq b) are two natural numbers and there is a prime (p) and a natural number (k) satisfying:   [   a^2 + b mid b^2 + a   ]   and   [   b^2 + a = p^k.   ]2. Combining these conditions, we obtain:   [   a^2 + b mid p^k,   ]   implying there is a natural number (m leq k) such that:   [   a^2 + b = p^m.   ]3. Subtracting the equation (a^2 + b = p^m) from (b^2 + a = p^k), we get:   [   (b - a)(b + a - 1) = p^m(p^{k-m} - 1).   ]4. From the above equation, we infer (a < b) and (m < k).5. Assume (p^m mid b - a) or (p^m mid b + a - 1). Consequently, since (b + a - 1 > b - a), we have:   [   p^m leq b + a - 1,   ]   which according to (a^2 + b = p^m) yields:   [   b + a - 1 geq a^2 + b,   ]   i.e.,   [   a^2 - a + 1 leq 0,   ]   which is impossible since (a geq 1). This contradiction combined with the equation ((b - a)(b + a - 1) = p^m(p^{k-m} - 1)) gives us:   [   p mid b - a,   ]   and   [   p mid b + a - 1.   ]6. Subtracting and adding these two results, we obtain:   [   p mid 2a - 1,   ]   and   [   p mid 2b - 1.   ]   Hence, (p) is odd, which according to (b^2 + a = p^k) gives us:   [   0 equiv 4p^k = (2b)^2 + 2 cdot (2a) equiv 1^2 + 2 cdot 1 = 1 + 2 = 3 pmod{p},   ]   i.e.,   [   3 mid p.   ]   Therefore, (p = 3).7. Substituting (p = 3) into the equations, we get:   [   b^2 + a = 3^k,   ]   and   [   a^2 + b = 3^m.   ]8. Observe that (3^k = b^2 + a geq 2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 > 3), yielding (k geq 2).9. Next, assume (9 mid b - a) and (9 mid b + a - 1). Hence, (9 mid (b + a - 1) pm (b - a)), which means (9 mid 2a - 1) and (9 mid 2b - 1). Thus, we have (a equiv b equiv 5 pmod{9}), which according to (b^2 + a = 3^k) (since (k geq 2)) yields:   [   0 equiv 3^k = b^2 + a equiv 5^2 + 5 = 25 + 5 = 30 equiv 3 pmod{9},   ]   a contradiction implying (9 nmid b - a) or (9 nmid b + a - 1). Hence, by the equation ((b - a)(b + a - 1) = 3^m(3^{k-m} - 1)), we obtain:   [   3^{m-1} mid b - a,   ]   or   [   3^{m-1} mid b + a - 1.   ]10. Thus, there are two natural numbers (s) and (t) such that:   [   b - a = 3^{m-1}s,   ]   or   [   b + a - 1 = 3^{m-1}t,   ]   where (s, t in {1, 2}) (we know that (b - a < b + a - 1 < p^m = 3^m)).11. Case 1: (b - a = 3^{m-1}s). If (s = 2), then (b - a) is even, yielding (a^2 + b) is even, contradicting (a^2 + b = 3^m). Consequently, (s = 1), which gives us (b - a = 3^{m-1}), which combined with (a^2 + b = 3^m) yields:   [   3(b - a) = 3^m = a^2 + b.   ]   This means:   [   2b = a^2 + 3a,   ]   which according to (a^2 + b = 3^m) results in:   [   2 cdot 3^m = 2a^2 + 2b = 2a^2 + (a^2 + 3a) = 3a(a + 1),   ]   i.e.,   [   a(a + 1) = 2 cdot 3^{m-1}.   ]   Therefore, since (gcd(a, a + 1) = 1), we have (3^{m-1} mid a) or (3^{m-1} mid a + 1), which combined with (a(a + 1) = 2 cdot 3^{m-1}) yields (a leq 2). Thus, we obtain (3^{m-1} = 1) when (a = 1) and (3^{m-1} = 3) when (a = 2). In other words, since (2b = a^2 + 3a), we obtain ((a, b, m) = (1, 2, 1)) or ((a, b, m) = (2, 5, 2)), yielding (b^2 + a = 2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5) and (b^2 + a = 5^2 + 2 = 25 + 2 = 27 = 3^3). Hence, by (b^2 + a = 3^k), the only solution of the equations is ((a, b, m, k) = (2, 5, 2, 3)).12. Case 2: (b + a - 1 = 3^{m-1}t). Then according to (a^2 + b = 3^m):   [   (a^2 + b)t = 3^m cdot t = 3(b + a - 1),   ]   i.e.,   [   (3 - t)b = ta^2 - 3a + 3.   ]   If (t = 1), then (a^2 - 3a + 3) is even, which is impossible since (a^2 - 3a) is even. Consequently, (t = 2) by contradiction, which inserted in the equation gives us:   [   b = 2a^2 - 3a + 3.   ]   Combining (a^2 + b = 3^m) and (b = 2a^2 - 3a + 3), we find that:   [   3^m = a^2 + b = a^2 + (2a^2 - 3a + 3) = 3(a^2 - a + 1),   ]   i.e.,   [   a^2 - a + 1 = 3^{m-1}.   ]   The fact that (9 nmid a^2 - a + 1) combined with (a^2 - a + 1 = 3^{m-1}) yields (m leq 2). Thus, ((a, b) = (1, 2)) or ((a, b) = (2, 5)) by the equations. From Case 1, we know that the only solution is ((a, b) = (2, 5)) with ((k, m) = (3, 2)).Conclusion:The only pair of distinct natural numbers ((a, b)) satisfying the conditions is ((a, b) = (2, 5)).The final answer is ( boxed{ (a, b) = (2, 5) } )."},{"problem":"To prove \\"If a^{2}+b^{2}=0, then a and b are both zero (a,binmathbb{R})\\" using the method of contradiction, we should first assume thatA: a and b are not both zeroB: Only one of a and b is not zeroC: Both a and b are not zeroD: Only one of a and b is zero","solution":"Since the negation of the proposition \\"If a^{2}+b^{2}=0, then a and b are both zero (a,binmathbb{R})\\" is \\"a and b are not both zero\\", to prove the proposition \\"If a^{2}+b^{2}=0, then a and b are both zero (a,binmathbb{R})\\" using the method of contradiction,  we should assume that a and b are not both zero,  therefore, the correct choice is: boxed{A}.

Barry has the remaining 40 hectares.Since the land is covered by corn and peas in the ratio 7: 3, then frac{7}{10} of the 100 hectares (that is, 70 hectares) is covered with corn and the remaining 30 hectares with peas.On Angela's land, the ratio is 4: 1 so frac{4}{5} of her 60 hectares, or 48 hectares, is covered with corn and the remaining 12 hectares with peas.Since there are 70 hectares of corn in total, then Barry has 70-48=22 hectares of corn.Since there are 30 hectares of peas in total, then Barry has 30-12=18 hectares of peas.Therefore, the ratio of corn to peas on Barry's land is 22: 18=11: 9.## Solution 2Suppose that the total combined area of land is x.Since the ratio of the area of Angela's land to the area of Barry's land is 3: 2, then Angela has frac{3}{5} of the land, or frac{3}{5} x, while Barry has the remaining frac{2}{5} x.Since the land is covered by corn and peas in the ratio 7: 3, then frac{7}{10} x is covered with corn and the remaining frac{3}{10} x with peas.On Angela's land, the ratio is 4: 1 so frac{4}{5} of her frac{3}{5} x, or frac{4}{5}left(frac{3}{5} xright)=frac{12}{25} x, is covered with corn and the remaining frac{3}{5} x-frac{12}{25} x=frac{3}{25} x with peas.Since the area of corn is frac{7}{10} x in total, then Barry's area of corn is frac{7}{10} x-frac{12}{25} x=frac{35}{50} x-frac{24}{50} x=frac{11}{50} x.

For this, we number the cells of one diagonal with the numbers 1,2, ldots, n, and number the other cells arbitrarily. Then one chip will not be able to visit two cells of this diagonal: if a chip lands on one of its cells, then the next move it must go to a cell with a number greater than n, and therefore, after that, it will not be able to return to the diagonal.
