Proof of the Lemma:   By a *chain* we mean any array ( (S_i)_{i geq 0} ) of subsets of ( S ) such that ( S_i subset S_{i+1} ) for each ( i ). Obviously, the maximal chain has ( n+1 ) elements, and there are ( n! ) maximal chains. Fix an ( overline{S} in mathcal{S} ). There are ( |S|!(n-|S|)! ) maximal chains that contain ( overline{S} ), because we start from the empty set, add one element at a time till we get to ( overline{S} ) in ( |S|! ) ways, and then add the rest ( n-|S| ) elements in ( (n-|S|)! ) ways. Also note that it is impossible that two elements ( A, B ) from ( mathcal{S} ) are in the same chain, because that would mean ( A subset B ) or ( B subset A ). Therefore:   [   sum_{i=0}^{n} s_i i!(n-i)! = sum_{overline{S} in mathcal{S}} |S|!(n-|S|)! leq n! quad ()   ]   and the lemma follows by dividing by ( n! ) (note that ( binom{n}{i} = frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!} )). ( blacksquare )5. Finding Families for Which Equality Holds:   Note that we have equality if and only if there is equality in both (*) and (). For even ( n ), it is easy: we note from (*) that the equality is attained if all sets are of size ( frac{n}{2} ). For odd ( n ), it holds that    [   binom{n}{lfloor frac{n}{2} rfloor} = binom{n}{lceil frac{n}{2} rceil}   ]   and we shall prove that the equality holds if and only if all the elements of ( mathcal{S} ) are simultaneously either of cardinality ( lfloor frac{n}{2} rfloor ) or ( lceil frac{n}{2} rceil ).6. Proof for Odd ( n ):   Let the equality in Sperner's Theorem be obtained. Therefore, each element of ( mathcal{S} ) corresponds to one and only one chain, as described in the proof of the Lemma.   - (1): If a ( lfloor frac{n}{2} rfloor )-element subset of ( S ) is *not* in ( mathcal{S} ), then when we add any of the remaining elements, we shall always get a subset which is in ( mathcal{S} ), because otherwise no element of ( mathcal{S} ) will correspond to the chain which begins with the elements of the \\"missing\\" set.   - (2): Moreover, if a ( lceil frac{n}{2} rceil )-element subset of ( S ) is in ( mathcal{S} ), it is obvious that there is no ( lfloor frac{n}{2} rfloor )-element subset of that set in ( mathcal{S} ).   Suppose that there is at least one ( lceil frac{n}{2} rceil )-element set in ( mathcal{S} ), and that there is at least one ( lceil frac{n}{2} rceil )-element set which is *not* in ( mathcal{S} ).

In order to form ( P_{i+1} ) from ( Q_i ), we shall choose an element from ( P' setminus left( bigcup_{j=1}^{i} P_j right) ). This is possible by (1) and (2). However, it is obvious that, by this procedure, the train will \\"arrive\\" at ( P' ). Contradiction, which completes the proof.

Since the condition \\"must be a quadratic function\\" implies that the function is always quadratic regardless of the values of a, b, and c, and this condition is not met when a=0, option B does not necessarily always represent a quadratic function.- Option C: y=2x^{2}-2x+1This function is of the form y=ax^{2}+bx+c with a=2, b=-2, and c=1. Since a neq 0, this function is always a quadratic function. Therefore, option C meets the requirement of being a quadratic function.- Option D: y=frac{1}{{x}^{2}}This function represents a reciprocal of a quadratic term, which is not a polynomial function. A quadratic function is a second-degree polynomial, and since this function does not fit that description, it is not a quadratic function. Therefore, option D does not meet the criteria for a quadratic function.Based on the analysis, the only option that must be a quadratic function is:boxed{C}"},{"problem":"The converse of the proposition \\"If x=1, then x^2 = 1\\" is ______.","solution":"The converse of the proposition \\"If x=1, then x^2 = 1\\" is: \\"If x^2 = 1, then x=1\\".To derive the converse of a given proposition, one has to switch the hypothesis with the conclusion of the original statement.

Substituting k = 60 and N = 8, we get:    [  P_{60} = frac{60}{100} times 8 = 0.6 times 8 = 4.8  ]    Since the position 4.8 falls between the 4th and 5th position, we round up to the nearest whole number, leading to the 5th position in the sorted data set.

The value of r ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear correlation, 0 indicates no linear correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive linear correlation.

Symmetry about the line x=2π: This implies that the function is periodic with a period of 4π. In other words, f(x) = f(x + 4π).   Since f(x)=sin (ωx+ frac{π}{6})-cos ωx, we have f(x + 4π)=sin (ω(x + 4π)+ frac{π}{6})-cos ω(x + 4π).   For the function to be periodic with a period of 4π, we must have ω(x + 4π)=ωx+2πn for some integer n. This simplifies to ω=frac{nπ}{2}.2.

Therefore, the sum ( a ) can be written as:   [   a = 0.9 left( (10^2 - 1) + (10^3 - 1) + (10^4 - 1) + cdots + (10^{102} - 1) right)   ]4.

Since the system has a unique solution, these solutions must coincide. Therefore, y_{0}=-y_{0}, which implies y_{0}=0.

In stratified sampling, the proportion of each subgroup in the sample should be the same as the proportion in the total population. Therefore, the number of individuals selected from each subgroup (males and females, in this case) should be proportional to the size of that subgroup within the whole population.Let's calculate the ratio of male athletes to the total number of athletes: text{Ratio of male athletes} = frac{text{Number of male athletes}}{text{Total number of athletes}} = frac{56}{56 + 42} = frac{56}{98}. Now, let's calculate the ratio of female athletes to the total number of athletes: text{Ratio of female athletes} = frac{text{Number of female athletes}}{text{Total number of athletes}} = frac{42}{98}. Since 8 male athletes are selected, we can set up a proportion to find out the number of female athletes that should be selected: frac{8}{56} = frac{x}{42}, where x is the number of female athletes to be selected.Cross multiplying gives: 8 times 42 = 56 times x,  336 = 56x,  x = frac{336}{56},  x = 6.

Evdokimov) In each of the 16 compartments of a 4 times 4 box lies a gold coin. The collector remembers that some two adjacent coins (adjacent by side) weigh 9 grams each, while the others weigh 10 grams each. What is the minimum number of weighings on scales that show the total weight in grams required to determine these two coins?","solution":"Answer. In three weighings.Solution. Note that weighing any group of coins can result in one of three outcomes: 0, 1, or 2 light coins among the weighed ones. Indeed, these outcomes correspond to the scales showing 10k, 10k-1, and 10k-2 grams, where k is the number of coins on the scales, and the scales cannot show anything else when weighing k coins.Now let's prove that it is impossible to determine the light coins with fewer than three weighings. There are 24 pairs of coins that could be light: 3 pairs of adjacent coins in each row and each column. Since one weighing can result in three different outcomes, two weighings can yield only 3^2 = 9 different outcomes.We will show how to determine the light coins in three weighings.First weighing. Divide the coins into two groups as shown in the figure, and weigh one of them. Since the groups are symmetrical, there are two different cases: the light coins are in one group, or the light coins are in different groups.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_89d73d034ee0bef24fcbg-5.jpg?height=315&width=322&top_left_y=288&top_left_x=867)1) First case (light coins in one group), second weighing. Leave only the coins that could be light on the figure, divide them into two groups, and number them. Weigh one of the groups. Here, there are three cases: both light coins are in group A, both light coins are in group B, or one light coin is in each group.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_89d73d034ee0bef24fcbg-5.jpg?height=148&width=226&top_left_y=939&top_left_x=892)Although the groups in this weighing are not symmetrical, the situations with both coins in one group are handled similarly. The possible pairs of light coins are left(X_1, X_2right), left(X_2, X_3right), and left(X_3, X_4right) in the corresponding group, where X is the group with the light coins. Therefore, the third weighing will weigh coins X_1 and X_2. If they are both light, we have found them. If one is light, then the light coins are X_2 and X_3. If none are light, then the light coins are X_3 and X_4.If the light coins are in different groups, they could be the \\"horizontal\\" pairs left(A_1, B_2right), left(A_2, B_3right), or left(A_3, B_4right). Then the third weighing will weigh coins A_1, B_2, and A_2. If two are light, they are A_1 and B_2. If one is light, the light coins are A_2 and B_3. If none are light, the light coins are A_3 and B_4.2) Second case (light coins in different groups), second weighing. Leave only the coins that could be light on the figure, divide them into two groups, and number them. Weigh one of the groups.

To find the light coins, the third weighing is sufficient to weigh one of these pairs.Comment. Let's provide some considerations that allow constructing the algorithm. One weighing, since it has three different outcomes, can determine a pair of light coins from three suspicious pairs—what interests us first is not the total number of coins but the total number of pairs of coins that could be light. Similarly, two weighings can determine a pair of light coins from no more than nine suspicious pairs. This means that after the first weighing, there should be no more than nine suspicious pairs of coins. In the provided algorithm, there are exactly 9 pairs if the coins are in one group, and 6 pairs if they are in different groups."},{"problem":"A train approaching at a speed of 20 mathrm{~m} / mathrm{s} sounded its horn at the railway crossing.

Find all monic polynomials fin mathbb{Z}[X], of degree n, such that f(a) divides f(2a^k) for ain mathbb{Z} with f(a)neq 0.","solution":"1. Expressing the given condition in polynomial form:   We start with the condition that ( f(a) ) divides ( f(2a^k) ) for all ( a in mathbb{Z} ) such that ( f(a) neq 0 ). This can be written as:   [   f(2a^k) = g(a) f(a)   ]   for some polynomial ( g(a) in mathbb{Z}[X] ).2. Considering the polynomial division:   Let ( f(2a^k) = g(a) f(a) + h(a) ) where the degree of ( h(a) ) is less than the degree of ( f(a) ), or ( h(a) ) is the zero polynomial. Since ( f(a) ) divides ( f(2a^k) ), we have:   [   f(a) mid h(a)   ]   for all ( a in mathbb{Z} ) such that ( f(a) neq 0 ).3. Analyzing the polynomial ( h(a) ):   If ( h(a) ) is not the zero polynomial, then the degree of ( h(a) ) is less than the degree of ( f(a) ). For sufficiently large ( a ), both ( f(a) ) and ( h(a) ) are non-zero, and ( |f(a)| > |h(a)| ). This implies that ( f(a) mid h(a) ) does not hold, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( h(a) ) must be the zero polynomial.4. Simplifying the equation:   Since ( h(a) ) is the zero polynomial, we have:   [   f(2a^k) = g(a) f(a)   ]   This implies that if ( alpha ) is a root of ( f ), then ( 2alpha^k ) is also a root of ( f ).5. Considering the sequence of roots:   Define the sequence ( x_1 = alpha ) and ( x_{m+1} = 2(x_m)^k ) for all positive integers ( m ). Clearly, ( x_1, x_2, ldots ) are all roots of ( f ).6. Analyzing the magnitude of ( alpha ):   - Case 1: ( |alpha| = 0 ). Then ( alpha = 0 ).   - Case 2: ( |alpha| > 0.5^{frac{1}{k-1}} ). Then ( |x_1| < |x_2| < cdots ), so ( x_i ) are pairwise distinct, implying that ( f ) has infinitely many roots. Thus, ( f ) must be the zero polynomial, which is a contradiction since ( f ) is monic.   - Case 3: ( |alpha| < 0.5^{frac{1}{k-1}} ). Then ( |x_1| > |x_2| > cdots ), so ( x_i ) are pairwise distinct, implying that ( f ) has infinitely many roots. Thus, ( f ) must be the zero polynomial, which is a contradiction since ( f ) is monic.   - Case 4: ( |alpha| = 0.5^{frac{1}{k-1}} ). This case is potentially possible.7. Summarizing the cases:   Summing up, ( alpha = 0 ) or ( |alpha| = 0.5^{frac{1}{k-1}} ). If ( f ) has at least one root ( alpha ) such that ( |alpha| = 0.5^{frac{1}{k-1}} ), the modulus of the coefficient of the power, that is the lowest power with a nonzero coefficient, must be a positive integer multiple of ( 0.5^{frac{1}{k-1}} ). However, this can never be an integer, leading to a contradiction.8.

Therefore, each team in group A must score at least 2 points more and have at least 2 fewer wins than any team in group C, which means each team in group A must have at least 8 draws, each team in group C must have at least 6 losses, and team B must have at least 3 losses, 4 draws, and 1 win. Thus, the last 3 teams must have at least 15 losses in total. The last 3 teams play 3 matches among themselves, with at most 3 losses, so the teams in group A must have at least 12 wins.

The 8 teams in group A play C_{8}^{2}=28 matches among themselves. Even if all matches end in draws, there are only 56 draws within the group. However, it has been pointed out that each team in group A must have at least 8 draws, so the 8 teams in group A must have at least 64 draws in total. The 8 teams in group A must draw at least 8 matches with the last 3 teams. By the pigeonhole principle, either team B has 6 draws or a team in group C has 2 draws, which would lead to a team in group A having 2 wins and 10 draws, contradicting n=11.Assume n=12, then group A has 9 teams. From the first argument, a team in group A must have 2 wins. Therefore, each team in group A must have 2 wins. Otherwise, a team in group A with 1 win must have 3 more draws, leading to a contradiction. If each team in group A has 2 wins and 8 draws, team B has 3 wins, 4 draws, and 3 losses, and each team in group C has 4 wins and 6 losses, then there are a total of 29 wins and 15 losses. At this point, each team plays 11 matches, and each team in group C has at most 7 losses, and team B has at most 4 losses, so the last 3 teams have at most 18 losses. Thus, the teams in group A must have at least 11 losses. By the pigeonhole principle, a team in group A must have 2 losses. Therefore, this team must have 2 wins, 8 draws, and 2 losses, totaling 12 matches, which is impossible.When n=13, group A has 10 teams. If each team in group A has 2 wins, 9 draws, and 1 loss, team B has 3 wins, 4 draws, and 5 losses, and each team in group C has 4 wins and 8 losses, then the requirements are exactly met.

However, if we try to continue the process described above, a problem arises: the central strip 7 times 1 will remain without a pair. This problem can be solved as follows: leave the longest strip of length 13 alone, and group the remaining strips in the same way (the shortest with the longest, etc.): 13, 1+12, 2+11, 3+10, 4+9, 5+8, 6+7.

Let ( k = frac{m}{n} ) where ( m ) and ( n ) are coprime integers. Then, ( cos(kpi) = cosleft(frac{mpi}{n}right) ).3. Consider the primitive ( n )-th roots of unity, ( zeta = e^{frac{2pi i m}{n}} ). These roots have an algebraic degree of ( varphi(n) ), where ( varphi ) is the Euler's totient function.4. Using the identity ( cosleft(frac{mpi}{n}right) = frac{zeta + zeta^{-1}}{2} ), we can express ( 2 cosleft(frac{mpi}{n}right) = zeta + zeta^{-1} ).5. The number ( zeta ) is a root of the polynomial ( x^2 - 2cosleft(frac{mpi}{n}right)x + 1 = 0 ). This polynomial has rational coefficients if and only if ( cosleft(frac{mpi}{n}right) ) is rational.6. The degree of the field extension (mathbb{Q}(zeta) / mathbb{Q}(cosleft(frac{mpi}{n}right))) is either 1 or 2. If ( n > 2 ), then ( zeta ) is non-real, but ( cosleft(frac{mpi}{n}right) ) is real, implying that the degree is 2.7. Therefore, the algebraic degree of ( cosleft(frac{mpi}{n}right) ) is (frac{varphi(n)}{2}) if ( n geq 3 ). For ( cosleft(frac{mpi}{n}right) ) to be rational, (frac{varphi(n)}{2}) must be 1, which implies (varphi(n) = 2).8. The values of ( n ) for which (varphi(n) = 2) are ( n = 3, 4, 6 ).

We start with the equation (4n^3 - 3n) and assume it is the product of two consecutive odd integers. Let these integers be (2m - 1) and (2m + 1).

Rearranging the equation, we get:   [   4n^3 - 3n + 1 = 4m^2   ]   We can rewrite this as:   [   (n+1)(2n-1)^2 = 4m^2   ]3. For the equation ((n+1)(2n-1)^2 = 4m^2) to hold, ((n+1)) must be a perfect square. Let (n + 1 = k^2) for some integer (k). Therefore:   [   n = k^2 - 1   ]4. We also need (n equiv 3 pmod{4}).

Divisibility and bounds:   From the first equation, we observe that (3 f(n)) must divide (f(2n)) because it cannot divide (1 + 3 f(n)). Given the second condition (f(2n) < 6 f(n)), we deduce:   [   f(2n) = 3 f(n)   ]   and   [   f(2n+1) = 3 f(n) + 1   ]3.

Base case and induction:   We know (f(1) = 1). Using the recursive relations:   [   f(2) = 3 f(1) = 3   ]   By induction, we can show:   [   f(2^r) = 3^r   ]   and   [   f(2^r (2s+1)) = 3^r (3 f(s) + 1)   ]   for (r, s geq 0).5.

We denote the integer part of ( r ) by ( [r] ) and the fractional part of ( r ) by ( {r} ).2. Since ( [r] ) is a positive integer, let ( [r] = k ) where ( k ) is a positive integer. Then, ( 25{r} ) must also be an integer because ( 25{r} = 125 - k ).3. Let ( 25{r} = m ) where ( m ) is an integer. Then, ( {r} = frac{m}{25} ).4. Substituting ( {r} ) back into the equation, we get:   [   25 left( frac{m}{25} right) + k = 125 implies m + k = 125   ]5. Since ( {r} ) is the fractional part, ( 0 leq {r} < 1 ) implies ( 0 leq frac{m}{25} < 1 ). Therefore, ( 0 leq m < 25 ).6. For each integer ( m ) from 0 to 24, there is a corresponding integer ( k = 125 - m ). Thus, there are 25 possible pairs ((k, m)).7. The corresponding values of ( r ) are:   [   r = k + {r} = k + frac{m}{25} = (125 - m) + frac{m}{25}   ]8.

Case when a=0:   - The equation simplifies to 2x+1=0.   - Solving for x, we get x=-frac{1}{2}, which is a negative real root.   - Thus, when a=0, the condition is satisfied.2. Case when aneq 0:   - The discriminant Delta of the equation is crucial for determining the nature of the roots.   - For ax^{2}+2x+1=0, Delta = 4-4a.   - For real roots, we require Delta geqslant 0, which simplifies to 4-4a geqslant 0.   - Solving for a, we find a leqslant 1.3. Analysis of the roots:   - The equation does not have a root equal to zero since ax^{2}+2x+1=0 cannot be zero for x=0.   - If the equation has two distinct real roots of opposite signs, then their product, given by frac{1}{a}, must be less than 0, implying a < 0.   - If the equation has two negative real roots, then both the sum of the roots, -frac{2}{a} < 0, and the axis of symmetry, x = -frac{1}{a} < 0, must hold, alongside Delta = 4-4a geqslant 0. This implies 0 < a leqslant 1.4. Conclusion:   - Combining the conditions, for the equation to have at least one negative real root, we find a leqslant 1.   - Conversely, if a leqslant 1, the equation is guaranteed to have at least one negative real root.Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for the equation ax^{2}+2x+1=0 to have at least one negative real root is aleqslant 1.

It is not difficult to understand that M is the union of four sectors (the central angle of all sectors is less than 180^{circ}):- sector P A T of the circle with center at point A and radius A P,- sector Q B R of the circle with center at point B and radius B Q,- sector P C Q of the circle with center at point C and radius C P,- sector R D T of the circle with center at point D and radius D T.Note that the first two sectors intersect along the rhombus A C B D, and there are no other intersections between the sectors. At the same time, the first two sectors are equal to each other, and the last two sectors are also equal to each other.

Determine the minimum value the sum of such numbers can take.","solution":"1. First, we need to factorize (2006^2):   [   2006 = 2 times 17 times 59   ]   Therefore,   [   2006^2 = (2 times 17 times 59)^2 = 2^2 times 17^2 times 59^2   ]2. To find the minimum sum of distinct positive integers whose product is divisible by (2006^2), we need to ensure that the product includes at least (2^2), (17^2), and (59^2).3. We need to distribute these factors among distinct integers. Let's consider the smallest possible distinct integers that can include these factors:   - We need at least two distinct integers to include (17^2), so we can use (17) and (34) (since (34 = 2 times 17)).   - Similarly, we need at least two distinct integers to include (59^2), so we can use (59) and (118) (since (118 = 2 times 59)).4. Now, we sum these integers:   [   17 + 34 + 59 + 118   ]5. Calculating the sum:   [   17 + 34 = 51   ]   [   51 + 59 = 110   ]   [   110 + 118 = 228   ]6. To confirm that this is the minimum sum, we note that any other combination of distinct integers that includes the necessary factors (2^2), (17^2), and (59^2) would either repeat factors or result in a larger sum. For example, using (17^2) directly would already exceed 228, and any other distribution would involve larger integers or additional terms, increasing the sum.Therefore, the minimum sum of such distinct integers is:[boxed{228}]"},{"problem":".

Condition 1: ( f(m) = 1 iff m = 1 )   - This condition tells us that the function ( f ) maps 1 to 1 and no other natural number to 1. In other words, ( f(m) = 1 ) if and only if ( m = 1 ).2. Condition 2: If ( d = gcd(m, n) ), then ( f(mn) = frac{f(m) f(n)}{f(d)} )   - This condition relates the function values of ( m ), ( n ), and their greatest common divisor ( d ). We will use this property to derive more information about ( f ).3.

Since ( f ) is a permutation (from Condition 3), ( f(p) ) must be ( p ).3. Analyzing ( f(p^k) ) for a prime ( p ) and integer ( k ):   - We use induction on ( k ).   - Base case ( k = 1 ): ( f(p) = p ) (from the previous step).   - Inductive step: Assume ( f(p^k) = p^k ). For ( k+1 ):     [     f(p^{k+1}) = f(p cdot p^k) = frac{f(p) f(p^k)}{f(p)} = frac{p cdot p^k}{p} = p^{k+1}     ]   - By induction, ( f(p^k) = p^k ) for all ( k ).4.

The radius of curve E is found by understanding that x^{2}+y^{2}=4 represents a circle centered at the origin (0,0) with radius 2. Thus, |OC|=|OD|=2.2. Given angle OCD=30^{circ}, we can calculate the perpendicular distance from the origin O to the line CD (which is the same as the distance to line l) using the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its base and height. The area of triangle OCD can also be expressed as frac{1}{2}absin C, where a and b are the sides enclosing angle C. Here, a=b=2 and C=30^{circ}, leading to the perpendicular distance being 1.3.

Then the set of all possible values for the last digits of ( l_1 + l_2 ) is ( {0, 1, dots, 9} ) since ( l_1 + l_2 equiv n pmod{10} ).   Assume for the sake of contradiction that ( |S| = 4 ), and let ( S = {a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4} ). Then ( l_1 + l_2 = a_i + a_j ) for ( i, j in {1, 2, 3, 4} ). Since there are ( binom{4}{2} + 4 = 10 ) ways to choose the sum ( a_i + a_j ) (including the cases where ( i = j )), and they map bijectively to ( {0, 1, dots, 9} ) modulo 10, it follows that none of them are equal modulo 10. So there should be exactly 5 even numbers out of the 10 sums.    Since ( a_1 + a_1 ), ( a_2 + a_2 ), ( a_3 + a_3 ), and ( a_4 + a_4 ) are all even, exactly one of ( a_i + a_j ) where ( i neq j ) must be even. Without loss of generality, assume ( a_1 + a_2 ) is even. Then ( a_1 + a_3 ) and ( a_2 + a_4 ) are odd. But then ( a_3 + a_4 ) becomes even, a contradiction.

Any digit can be made from these 5 numbers without any carries, so choosing ( N = 9 ), for any ( n > N ), and going from the right to left, for any digit ( d ) in ( n ), we can find ( a_1, a_2 in S ) such that ( a_1 + a_2 = d ), put ( a_1 ) in ( a ) and ( a_2 ) in ( b ), and continue like this to get ( a + b = n ).   In case we end up with one of ( a, b ) being zero, then ( n ) must consist of only ( 0, 1 ), and ( 3 ). In this case, if ( n ) has more than one non-zero digit, then we can put two of them in ( a, b ) each, so that ( a, b ) are both non-zero. The other possibilities are if ( n = 1000 dots 0 ) or ( n = 3000 dots 0 ). Let ( d(x) ) be the number of digits of ( x ). In the first case, take ( a = 999 dots 9 ) and ( b = 1 ), with ( d(a) = d(n) - 1 ). In the second case take ( a = 909090 dots 0909 ) and ( b = 2090909 dots 9091 ) with ( d(a) + 1 = d(b) = d(n) ).

As long as you master the following part, there is no point in knowing this one in all its details.Definition 7 (Implication).Let A and B be two sentences, which can be true or false (also called propositions). We say that A implies B (denoted A Longrightarrow B) if whenever A is true, B is also true.Example 8. If A is the sentence \\"I killed Bob\\" and B is the sentence \\"Bob is dead\\", we have A implies B: if I killed Bob, Bob is necessarily dead.A slightly more mathematical example might be: if x geqslant 1, then x geqslant 0.In general, we spot an implication (for example in a statement) by the presence of an \\"if\\", often followed by a \\"then\\".## Example 9.Let a, b>0. Show that if a+b=2, then a b leqslant 1.Definition 10 (Equivalence).We can see from all these examples that B can be true without A being true: just because Bob is dead doesn't mean I killed him!Sometimes we want A to be true exactly when B is true: we want A Longrightarrow B and B Longrightarrow A. We call this an equivalence, denoted A Longleftrightarrow B, we then say that A is equivalent to B, or that A and B are equivalent, or A if and only if B.## Example 11.If A is the sentence x geqslant 0 and B is the sentence x^{3} geqslant 0, we have A Longleftrightarrow B.(Yes, the first example is a mathematical example, try to find two equivalent sentences from everyday life that are not simply a basic reformulation of each other)Definition 12 (Negation).If we are given a proposition A (so a sentence that can be true or false), the negation of A is the opposite of A, denoted neg A.Put in more complicated terms, neg A is such that \\"A is true\\" Longleftrightarrow \\" neg A is false\\".## Example 13.If A is the proposition \\"Bob is dead\\", its negation is \\"Bob is alive\\".If A is \\"For all x>0, x^{2}+2 x-3>0\\", its negation is \\"There exists x>0 such that x^{2}+2 x-3 leqslant 0\\".These definitions are not very interesting in themselves, but they allow solving many problems if they are used in complex and constructed reasoning.Definition 14 (Proof by Contradiction).Proof by contradiction is a method that allows proving that a statement is true by showing that its opposite is false. It relies on the logical rule that:If \\"not P\\" is false, then P is true. In other words, the idea is to assume neg A and arrive at a contradiction, something that is always false (like 0>1). This means that neg A is necessarily false, so A is true.## Example 15.Let's show that sqrt{2} cannot be written as a ratio of two integers, we say that sqrt{2} is irrational.Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that sqrt{2} is rational, so there exist integers a, b such that sqrt{2}=frac{a}{b}. Then we have frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}=2, or a^{2}=2 b^{2}. At this point, we notice that a^{2} is even, so a is even, and it can be written as a=2 a^{prime}.We substitute our new expression for a into the initial equation, and we find b^{2}=2 a^{prime 2}. Thus, b^{2} is even, and we have b=2 b^{prime}. Substituting, we get a^{prime 2}=2 b^{prime 2}. This solution looks a lot like the initial solution, since we also have sqrt{2}=frac{a^{prime}}{b^{prime}}. Moreover, the solution is strictly smaller than before. If we continue this way, we will find a solution that gets smaller and smaller while remaining in the integers, which is not possible since a geqslant 1 and b geqslant 1, at some point this will no longer be the case.We call such a reasoning an infinite descent."},{"problem":"5.

Thus, every number in question can be uniquely associated with a sequence of natural numbers of length n, where the sum of the elements is 8.We need to determine how many ways there are to decompose 8 into the sum of n non-negative integers, considering different decompositions even if they only differ in the order of the terms.Let's actually try to create such a decomposition: if an 8-unit long rod is divided into n parts by n-1 cuts that pass through all the integer points, then the elements of the sequence are obtained as the lengths of the consecutive segments. Multiple cuts can pass through the same division point, which represents 0-valued elements at the corresponding positions in the sequence.Since 0 can also appear at the beginning and end of the sequence, cuts passing through the 0 and 8-unit points are also allowed. The task is thus to determine how many ways there are to choose (n-1) points from 9 division points, where the same division point can be chosen multiple times.As is known, these selections are precisely the 9-element (n-1)-class combinations with repetition, and their number is binom{9+n-2}{n-1}=binom{n+7}{n-1}. This means that there are binom{n+7}{n-1} n-digit numbers where the sum of the digits is 9n-8.Tóth 370 Ágnes (Hajdúszoboszló, Hógyes E. Gymn., 11th grade)Remarks. 1. The number of n-length sequences with a sum of 8 can also be determined by other clever reasoning. Paulin Dániel (Fazekas M. Gymn., 9th grade) performed the total 8-unit reduction one by one, specifically by position. According to his reasoning, out of the n positions, one must be chosen 8 times, and the same position can naturally be chosen multiple times. The possibilities are now the 8-class combinations with repetition of n elements, and their number is binom{n+8-1}{8}=binom{n+7}{8}, which is naturally the same as before.2. Deák Péter (Fazekas M. Gymn., 9th grade) also counted these selections directly, essentially proving the formula for the number of combinations with repetition. He reasoned as follows: at every position except the last, two actions can be taken: reduce the number at that position by 1, or move to the next position. (When reaching the last position, there is no choice.) Thus, we have a total of (n-1)+8=n+7 decision points, and we need to choose 8 of them where we reduce. This can clearly be done in binom{n+7}{8} ways. (Or, equivalently, binom{n+7}{n-1} ways to choose the (n-1) moves forward.)"},{"problem":"1+ dfrac{1}{1+2}+ dfrac{1}{1+2+3}+ldots+ dfrac{1}{1+2+3+ldots+n}=__________．","solution":"AnalysisThis problem mainly examines the method of term cancellation in series summation.

Let:   [   A = begin{pmatrix}   0 & 1    -1 & 0   end{pmatrix}   ]   Then,   [   A^2 = begin{pmatrix}   0 & 1    -1 & 0   end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix}   0 & 1    -1 & 0   end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix}   -1 & 0    0 & -1   end{pmatrix} = -I   ]   and   [   A^3 = A cdot A^2 = begin{pmatrix}   0 & 1    -1 & 0   end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix}   -1 & 0    0 & -1   end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix}   0 & -1    1 & 0   end{pmatrix} = A   ]   Therefore,   [   A^3 = A + I   ]   This shows that for ( n = 2 ), such a matrix ( A ) exists. For higher dimensions, we can construct block diagonal matrices with blocks of the form above to satisfy the condition ( A^3 = A + I ). Part (b)2. Determinant of Matrix ( A ) satisfying ( A^3 = A + I ):   We need to show that ( det(A) > 0 ) for all matrices ( A ) that satisfy ( A^3 = A + I ).   Given ( A^3 = A + I ), we can write the characteristic polynomial of ( A ) as:   [   P(lambda) = lambda^3 - lambda - 1   ]   The roots of this polynomial are the eigenvalues of ( A ). Let ( lambda_1, lambda_2, lambda_3 ) be the eigenvalues of ( A ). Then,   [   lambda_1^3 = lambda_1 + 1, quad lambda_2^3 = lambda_2 + 1, quad lambda_3^3 = lambda_3 + 1   ]   This implies that each eigenvalue ( lambda_i ) satisfies the equation ( lambda_i^3 - lambda_i - 1 = 0 ).   To find the determinant of ( A ), we use the fact that the determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues:   [   det(A) = lambda_1 lambda_2 lambda_3   ]   Since the polynomial ( lambda^3 - lambda - 1 = 0 ) has one real root and two complex conjugate roots (by the nature of cubic polynomials with real coefficients), we can denote the real root by ( lambda_1 ) and the complex conjugate roots by ( lambda_2 ) and ( lambda_3 ).   The product of the roots of the polynomial ( lambda^3 - lambda - 1 = 0 ) is given by the constant term (up to sign), which is ( -1 ). Therefore,   [   lambda_1 lambda_2 lambda_3 = -1   ]   However, since ( lambda_2 ) and ( lambda_3 ) are complex conjugates, their product is positive. Thus, the product of all three eigenvalues must be positive:   [   det(A) = lambda_1 lambda_2 lambda_3 > 0   ]   Therefore, ( det(A) > 0 ) for all matrices ( A ) that satisfy ( A^3 = A + I ).The final answer is ( boxed{det(A) > 0} )"},{"problem":"The line passing through point A (2, b) and point B (3, -2) has a slope of -1.

Understanding the Domain of the Function:   - The function given is f(x) = ln(x + a). The domain of a logarithmic function ln(x) is (0, +infty). Therefore, for f(x) = ln(x + a), the input to the logarithm, x + a, must be greater than 0. This gives us the domain of f(x) as (-a, +infty).2. Determining the Relationship Between a and 1:   - Since the function is defined at x = 1, we know that 1 > -a. This implies a > -1.3. Finding the Derivative of the Function:   - The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}[ln(x + a)] = frac{1}{x + a}.4. Evaluating the Derivative at x = 1:   - Substituting x = 1 into the derivative gives us f'(1) = frac{1}{1 + a}.5. Comparing the Slope of the Tangent to the Given Line:   - The tangent line at x = 1 is parallel to the line y = frac{x}{2} + 1. The slope of this line is frac{1}{2}. Since parallel lines have equal slopes, the slope of the tangent line, which is f'(1), must also be frac{1}{2}. Therefore, we set frac{1}{1 + a} = frac{1}{2}.6.

A factorization into a linear and a cubic polynomial with real coefficients does not exist, because otherwise P(x) would have a real root, and one of the factors in the found factorization would also have a root. However, the discriminant of both factors is negative, so neither has a real root.2. It is clear that, with the choice q=1, the only other factorization into two quadratic polynomials with real coefficients that can be obtained is one where one factor is multiplied by a non-zero constant c and the other by 1/c. However, if we start from the equation q-p q-p=0, then (2) gives a quartic equation in p, which can be factored into quadratics by completing the square, but one of these quadratics has no real roots. Thus, there is no essentially different factorization into quadratic polynomials with real coefficients.II. Solution. The polynomial can be rearranged in terms of powers of x^{2}+1:P(x)=x^{4}+1+xleft(x^{2}+1right)+x^{2}=left(x^{2}+1right)^{2}+xleft(x^{2}+1right)-x^{2}Complete the square with the first two terms to get a difference of squares, which can then be factored:P(x)=left(x^{2}+1+frac{1}{2} xright)^{2}-frac{5}{4} x^{2}=left(x^{2}+frac{1+sqrt{5}}{2} x+1right) cdotleft(x^{2}+frac{1-sqrt{5}}{2} x+1right)Remarks. 1. This method is generally applicable to polynomials of the form x^{4}+a x^{3}+b x^{2}+a x+1, known as symmetric polynomials, and does not differ significantly from the usual method, which involves expressing the polynomial as frac{1}{x^{2}} times a new variable y=x+frac{1}{x}.Following this path, we always arrive at a factorization into two quadratic polynomials with real coefficients if a^{2}-4 b+8 geqq 0.2. The thought process of the first solution can also be applied to the more general case mentioned, and it leads to the goal regardless of the values of the coefficients."},{"problem":"1.

Sum of Numbers with a Given Order:   - We need to determine the sum of numbers with a specific order ( k ).   - We will use properties of polynomials and Vieta's formulas to find these sums.4. Case Analysis:   - Case 1: ( k = 1 ):     - The only number with order 1 is 1 itself.     - Sum of numbers with order 1 is ( 1 ).   - Case 2: ( k ) has one prime factor:     - Numbers with order ( k ) must be roots of ( x^k equiv 1 pmod{211} ).     - The sum of all roots of ( x^k equiv 1 pmod{211} ) is 0 by Vieta's formulas.     - Since the sum of numbers with order 1 is 1, the sum of numbers with order ( k ) is ( -1 ).   - Case 3: ( k ) has two prime factors:     - Let ( k = ab ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are primes.     - The sum of numbers with order ( k ) is ( 0 - (text{sum of numbers with order } 1) - (text{sum of numbers with order } a) - (text{sum of numbers with order } b) ).     - By previous cases, this sum is ( 0 - 1 - (-1) - (-1) = 1 ).   - General Case:     - If ( k ) has ( n ) prime factors, the sum of numbers with order ( k ) is ( (-1)^n ).5.

Is there an n for which the number of trailing zeros in n! is 1972? (By n! we mean the product of natural numbers from n down to 1.)","solution":"An integer N has s zeros at the end of its decimal representation - and a non-zero digit before them - if and only if the number is divisible by the s-th power of 10=2 cdot 5, but not by the (s+1)-th power. This means that if we express N as a product of prime powers - in a well-known phrase: factorize it into prime factors - then the smaller of the exponents of 2 and 5 is exactly s, and the other is at least s. We will see that taking N in the form of n!, it will be enough to achieve that the exponent of the prime factor 5 is 1971 or 1972.The factors of n! in increasing order, starting from 1, every 5th factor is divisible by 5, thus it brings 1 mathrm{db} 5-factor into the prime factorization of n!, every 25th factor is divisible by 25=5^{2}, thus it brings 1 more 5, every 125=5^{3}, every 5^{4}, 5^{5} indexed factor brings 1 more 5, and so on. For example, up to n=8000, the number of factors divisible by 5, 5^{2}, 5^{3}, 5^{4}, 5^{5} are respectivelyfrac{8000}{5}=1600, quad frac{8000}{25}=frac{1600}{5}=320, quad frac{320}{5}=64, quad frac{64}{5}=12, ldots, quad frac{12}{5}=2, ldotsin the last two divisions, we only wrote down the integer part of the quotient, since the number divisible by 5, 5^{2}, ... is always at the end of the sequence of factors 5,5^{2}, ldots. ( 5^{6}>8000, so no factor brings in 6 5s.) Thus, the number of zeros at the end of 8000! is 1600+320+64+12+2=1998, indeed the number of 2-factors is larger than this, as the number of even factors is 4000.The result 1998 is slightly more, by 27, than the desired number 1971, so let's try to go back, for example, by 100, to n=7900. This way we leave out 100: 5=20 mathrm{db} 5-divisible numbers, 20: 5=4 mathrm{db} 25-divisible numbers, and since 8000 itself is divisible by 5^{3} but not by 5^{4}, the number of zeros at the end of 7900! is 20+4+1=25 less, that is 1973, which is only 2, or 1, less than the required number. If we also leave out the 7900, which is divisible by 5^{2}, the number of zeros decreases by 2, to 1971, and we get answers to both questions:1971 is the number of zeros if n=7899,7898,7897,7896,7895, since stepping back to 7894 also decreases the number by 1, and there is no n for which the number of zeros at the end of n! is 1972.Looking back, the exponent of the 2-factor in n! is the smallest for the found n values up to 7895, and with [ ] denoting the integer part of the number:left[frac{7895}{2}right]=3947>1971Sarolta Máthé (Budapest, Apáczai Csere J. Gyak. Gimn., II. o. t.) Mária Kanyó (Szeged, Ságvári E. Gyak. Gimn., I. o. t.)Remarks. 1. We outline a path that leads us to the result with fewer trials. According to the above reasoning, taking n as the k-th positive integer power of 5, the number of 5-factors (and trailing zero digits) in n! can be expressed with k:frac{5^{k}}{5}+frac{5^{k}}{5^{2}}+frac{5^{k}}{5^{3}}+ldots+frac{5^{k}}{5^{k}}=frac{5^{k}-1}{4}this can be easily proven by complete induction.After 5^{k}, the above reasoning starts from the beginning with each sequence of 5,5^{2}, ldots, 5^{k} consecutive factors, so it is natural - we leave the proof to the reader - to think of n written in the base 5 number system:n=j_{m} cdot 5^{m}+j_{m-1} cdot 5^{m-1}+ldots+j_{1} cdot 5+j_{0}where we denoted the digits with j_{i}, 1 leq j_{m} leq 4, and for 0 leq i leq m-1, 0 leq j_{i} leq 4. Then the exponent of 5 in n! can be expressed with n and the sum of the j digits, applying (1) with k taking the values m, m-1, ldots, 1,0.2.

Express the first digit after the decimal point:   The first digit after the decimal point of ((n+1)sqrt{n}) can be found by considering (10(n+1)sqrt{n}) and taking the floor function:   [   N = lfloor 10(n+1)sqrt{n} rfloor   ]   Let (N = 10k + r), where (k) is an integer and (0 leq r < 10).3.

Analyze the inequality:   From the inequality, we can see that the value of (r) (the first digit after the decimal point) depends on the value of (n) and (k). By trial and error, we can find that all values of (r) from 0 to 9 are achievable by suitable choices of (n) and (k).Conclusion:The first digit after the decimal point in the decimal expression of (sqrt{n^3 + 2n^2 + n}) can be any digit from 0 to 9.The final answer is (boxed{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9})."},{"problem":"1.

Since 3a + b + c = 28 + a > 28, 2a + 2b + c = 28 + b > 28 and 2a + b + 2c = 28 + c > 28, we conclude that the following cases are possible: a + 2b + 2c = 21, a + 3b + c = 21 or a + b + 3c = 21.If a + 2b + 2c = 21, then from 2a + b + c = 28 it follows that 3(a + b + c) = 49, which is not possible since 49 is not divisible by 3.If a + 3b + c = 21, then from 2a + b + c = 28 it follows that a - 2b = 7, i.e., a = 2b + 7. According to this, the number a is odd and is greater than or equal to 9. Now for a = 9, we get b = 1 and therefore c = 9, which is not possible, since a, b, c are different natural numbers.

Since any of the planes drawn contains one of the segments connecting the midpoints of opposite edges of the tetrahedron, all planes pass through the point of intersection of these segments, which lies inside the tetrahedron (see Theorem 92).

On the other hand, no two faces of the tetrahedron can serve as the boundary of the same part, since any two of its faces are separated from each other by a plane passing through their common edge. Thus, the number of parts of the tetrahedron is equal to the number of parts into which its surface is divided, and since each face of the tetrahedron is divided into 6 parts (medians are drawn in it), there are a total of 6 times 4 = 24 parts.

We will consider the games that have not been played. The condition means that there will be no three teams that have not played against each other at all. We will prove by induction on k that for 2k teams, the maximum number of unplayed games is no more than k^2.Base case: k=1 (the estimate is obvious).Inductive step: Suppose it is proven for k, we will prove for k+1. If there are no unplayed games, then everything is proven. Otherwise, select any teams A and B that have not played against each other. Note that the number of unplayed games involving teams A or B is no more than 2k (not counting the game between A and B), because for any team C, at least one of the games AC or BC has been played. Now consider all teams except A and B and apply the inductive hypothesis - among them, no more than k^2 games have not been played. Therefore, the total number of unplayed games is no more than k^2 + (2k + 1) = (k+1)^2, which is what we needed to prove.Substituting k=8 gives that the number of unplayed games is no more than 64, and the total number of possible games is frac{16 cdot 15}{2} = 120, so the number of played games is no less than 120 - 64 = 56.The estimate is achieved if the teams are divided into two equal groups, all matches are played within each group, and no matches are played between the groups."},{"problem":"(11) (25 points) The sum of n positive integers x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n} is 2009.

If two groups A_{i} and B_{j} have two common terms x_{r} and x_{t}, then these two numbers can be combined into one term x_{r} + x_{t}, which would reduce the value of n. Therefore, we can assume that each pair of A_{i} and B_{j} has at most one common term.Now, use points u_{1}, u_{2}, cdots, u_{41} to represent A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{41}, and points v_{1}, v_{2}, cdots, v_{49} to represent B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{49}.

Thus, each A-type group can consist of one 41 and one 8, or one 41 and a pair of terms that sum to 8. This results in 41 A-type groups, each with a sum of 49. To obtain 49 B-type groups with a sum of 41, we can make x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{41} each a group, and the remaining numbers can be combined into eight B-type groups: four groups of {8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1}, two groups of {8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 2}, one group of {8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 3}, and one group of {8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 5}.

Then the smallest number of lines leading out of one city is one, and all numbers from 1 to 46 are encountered without gaps (cities excluding Lake City - 46). The city with one bus line cannot be connected to Lake City, as its only line must lead to the city with 46 lines (otherwise, the 46th pair would not be found). We have organized the pair 1-46. Now consider the city with 45 lines. We will match it with the city with two lines. Note that the city with two lines cannot be connected to Lake City. Continuing this reasoning, we will organize pairs 3-44, 4-43, and so on, up to the pair 23-24. The city with the smaller number of lines in each pair is not connected to Lake City. Note that Lake City does not enter these pairs, as a connection with Lake City is necessary for a larger number of lines in each pair.

Since it is equal to the square of the sum of the digits of A, the sum of the digits of A is less than 36^{1 / 2}=6, that is, less than or equal to 5.

Let S(n) denote the sum of the digits of the number n. Note that when adding two numbers \\"vertically,\\" the only possible carry is a one to the higher place, and each such carry reduces the sum of the digits by 9. Therefore, the sum of the digits of the sum of any number of addends does not exceed the sum of the digits of the addends. As a consequence, S(n) leq n, since n=1+1+ldots+1 (n ones), and equality is achieved only for single-digit numbers, because when adding another one to the sum of nine ones, a carry will already occur. Additionally, appending a zero to the right does not change the sum of the digits, that is, S(10 n)=S(n).Let the desired two-digit number A=underline{a b}=10 a+b. ThenSleft(A^{2}right)=Sleft((10 a+b)^{2}right)=Sleft(100 a^{2}+10 * 2 a b+b^{2}right) leqleq Sleft(100 a^{2}right)+S(10 * 2 a b)+Sleft(b^{2}right)=Sleft(a^{2}right)+S(2 a b)+Sleft(b^{2}right) leqleq a^{2}+2 a b+b^{2}=(a+b)^{2}=(S(A))^{2}, and equality is achieved if and only if a^{2}, 2 a b, and b^{2} are single-digit numbers (if this is the case, then when adding 100 a^{2}, 10 * 2 a b, and b^{2}, no carries occur, as they contain all their non-zero digits in different places). Therefore, it is necessary and sufficient that the numbers a^{2}, b^{2}, and 2 a b be less than 10, that is, 1 leq a leq 3,0 leq b leq 3 and a b leq 4.From this, we find all the options listed in the answer."},{"problem":"Consider a computer system that can only execute one task at a time, and the next task can only start after the completion of the current one.

Answer: 25 min.Let (v) be the pedestrian's speed, (V) be the car's speed, and (T) be the waiting time for the car. (We will measure speed in km/h and time in hours.) If walking, the time required for 1.2 km and 3 km would be (1 / v), (2 / v), and (3 / v) hours, respectively, and if traveling by car, it would be (T+frac{1}{V}), (T+frac{2}{V}), and (T+frac{3}{V}) hours. Suppose that walking 2 km is no slower than traveling by car, i.e., (T+frac{2}{V} geqslant frac{2}{v}). Then (T+frac{1}{V} geqslant frac{T}{2}+frac{1}{V} geqslant frac{1}{v}), meaning that 1 km can also be walked. However, if 1 km and 2 km can be walked, then the time spent on 2 km would be exactly twice that of 1 km, which is not the case according to the problem. Therefore, (T+frac{2}{V} leqslant frac{2}{v}), and thus (T+frac{3}{V} leqslant frac{3}{2}left(T+frac{2}{V}right) leqslant frac{3}{v}).

There are R_{0}=2 of these in each case, so 2 times R_{0}=4 possible sequences.If red appears elsewhere, then either side of it we must have sub-sequences which contain no red lights. This means for each possible position of the colour red we have R_{0} choices for each of the two sub-sequences, and so R_{0} times R_{0}=4 possible sequences of length n. As there are n-2 positions (which are not first or last) this gives 4(n-2) possible sequences.This means that R_{1_{n}}=4+4(n-2)=4 n-4.Finally, we have that the number of possible sequences containing at least two red lights is T_{n}-R_{0}-R_{1_{n}}=3 times 2^{n-1}-2-(4 n-4) which simplifies to 3 times 2^{n-1}-4 n+2."},{"problem":"After the graph of the function y=2sinleft(2x+frac{pi}{6}right) is shifted to the right by frac{pi}{4} units, the corresponding function of the resulting graph is ( ).A: y=2sinleft(2x+frac{5pi}{12}right)B: y=2sinleft(2x+frac{pi}{3}right)C: y=2sinleft(2x-frac{pi}{12}right)D: y=2sinleft(2x-frac{pi}{3}right)","solution":"To solve the problem of finding the new function after the graph of y=2sinleft(2x+frac{pi}{6}right) is shifted to the right by frac{pi}{4} units, we follow these steps:1.

The rest of the matches were lost by the teams.c) One example that meets the condition is as follows: the first team won against the fourth, fifth, and sixth teams, the second team won against the first and third teams, the third team won against the first and sixth teams, the fourth team won against the second and third teams, the fifth team won against the fourth team, and the sixth team won against the fourth team. In addition, the fifth team drew with the sixth, third, and second teams, and the sixth and second teams also drew with each other.Solution. a) Let n be the number of points awarded for a win in a match. There were a total of 15 matches played in the tournament, of which x ended in a win for one of the teams, and the remaining 15-x ended in draws. In drawn matches, the participants collectively score 2 points, while in the others, they score n points, so the total number of points scored by all teams in the tournament is n x + 2(15-x) = (n-2)x + 30 = 12 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 52 points, from which (n-2)x = 22. There were a total of 15 games, so x can be 1, 2, or 11. In the first two cases, n equals 24 or 13, which exceeds the maximum number of points scored by the teams, which is impossible because a win in a match would then be impossible in principle, meaning all matches would end in draws, which contradicts the assumption about x. In the remaining case, x equals 11, then n equals 4, which is the number of points awarded for a win.b) We will find the number of wins, draws, and losses for each team. There were a total of four draws and 11 matches that ended in a win for one of the teams. Each team played five games, so it was impossible to score 6 or more points solely from draws, meaning the sixth and fifth teams each won once and drew two and three times, respectively.If the fourth team had won no more than once, it would have had at least four draws, together with the fifth and sixth teams, there would already be at least (2+3+4)/2 = 4.5 draws, which exceeds the total of 4. Therefore, the fourth team won twice and lost three times.For the same reasons, the third team had two wins and one draw, and the second team had two wins and two draws. For all teams except the first, there are at least (2+3+1+2)/2 = 4 draws, which equals their total number. Therefore, the first team had three wins and two losses.c) Let's provide an example of a corresponding tournament. The fifth team drew three times, while the first and fourth teams had no draws. Therefore, the fifth team drew with the sixth, third, and second teams. In addition to these draws, the sixth and second teams each had one draw, so they drew with each other. All draws are thus uniquely determined. However, the decisive matches cannot be uniquely determined. One example that meets the condition is as follows: the first team won against the fourth, fifth, and sixth teams, the second team won against the first and third teams, the third team won against the first and sixth teams, the fourth team won against the second and third teams, the fifth team won against the fourth team, and the sixth team won against the fourth team.Grading criteria.

Determine all cozy palindromes.","solution":"1. Identify the structure of the palindrome:   Since ABCDEF is a palindrome, it must be written identically forwards and backwards. Therefore, D = C, E = B, and F = A. This means the number can be written as ABCCBA.2. Check the cozy condition:   For the number ABCCBA to be cozy, the following conditions must be satisfied:   - AB divides CD   - CD divides EF3. Simplify the conditions:   Since D = C, E = B, and F = A, the number ABCCBA simplifies to ABCCBA = ABCCBA. Therefore, we need to check:   - CC divides BA   - BA divides CC4. Analyze the divisibility:   - CC is a two-digit number where both digits are the same, i.e., CC = 11c (since CC can be written as 10c + c = 11c).   - BA is a two-digit number, i.e., BA = 10b + a.   For CC to divide BA, we need 11c to divide 10b + a. Since 11c is a multiple of 11, 10b + a must also be a multiple of 11. This implies that 10b + a equiv 0 pmod{11}.5. Check the divisibility of BA by 11:   Since 10b + a equiv 0 pmod{11}, BA must be a multiple of 11. Therefore, BA can be written as 11k for some integer k.6. Check the divisibility of CC by BA:   Since CC = 11c and BA = 11k, for 11c to divide 11k, c must divide k. Therefore, c = k.7.

Assertion and Initial Condition:   Let ( P(x, y) ) be the assertion of the given functional equation:   [   f(xf(y) - yf(x)) = f(xy) - xy   ]   First, consider ( P(x, 0) ):   [   f(xf(0)) = f(0)   ]   This implies that ( f(0) ) is a fixed point. If ( f(0) neq 0 ), then for any ( x in mathbb{R} ), we would have ( f(xf(0)) = f(0) ). This would imply that ( f ) is a constant function, which contradicts the original equation unless ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x ). Therefore, we must have:   [   f(0) = 0   ]2.

Considering ( f(a) = 0 ):   Let ( a ) be such that ( f(a) = 0 ). Consider ( P(a, y) ):   [   f(af(y) - yf(a)) = f(ay) - ay   ]   Since ( f(a) = 0 ), this simplifies to:   [   f(af(y)) = f(ay) - ay   ]   For ( y ) such that ( ay geq 0 ), we have ( f(ay) = ay ) (since ( ay geq 0 )). Thus:   [   f(af(y)) = ay - ay = 0   ]   This implies ( af(y) = 0 ). Since ( f(y) neq 0 ) for ( y neq 0 ) (as shown earlier), we must have ( a = 0 ).

Let ( x = -1 ):   [   f(-1f(y) - yf(-1)) = f(-y) - (-y)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   f(-f(y) - yf(-1)) = f(-y) + y   ]   Let ( c = f(-1) ). Then:   [   f(-f(y) - yc) = f(-y) + y   ]   If ( y < 0 ), then ( f(y) = -cy ).

Given the quartic polynomial function ( y = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e ) and the line ( y = px + q ), we know that they touch at ( x = alpha ) and ( x = beta ) where ( alpha < beta ).

Find the range of the parameter a.","solution":"To ensure f(x) geq 1 for all x in the interval [-1, 1], we must consider the minimum value of f(x) on this interval. We know that for a quadratic function f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, the vertex occurs at x = -frac{b}{2a}, and the function has a minimum value there when a > 0.1. Check the coefficient of x^2: The coefficient of x^2 in f(x) is 1, which is positive. So, the function opens upwards and has a minimum value at the vertex.   2. Find the vertex: The vertex of f(x) is at x = -frac{2a}{2} = -a. We need to consider three cases: -a leq -1, -1 < -a < 1, and -a geq 1. These correspond to the vertex being to the left of the interval, within the interval, and to the right of the interval, respectively.   - Case 1: -a leq -1       This means a geq 1. For the case when x = -1, f(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2a(-1) + 2a + 1 = 1 - 2a + 2a + 1 = 2, which is already greater than or equal to 1. So, for a geq 1, the condition is satisfied.      - Case 2: -1 < -a < 1       Here, the vertex is within the interval. We check the value at the vertex, which gives us f(-a) = (-a)^2 + 2a(-a) + 2a + 1 = a^2 - 2a^2 + 2a + 1 = 1 - a^2 + 2a.       For this to be greater than or equal to 1, we need 1 - a^2 + 2a geq 1, simplifying to 2a - a^2 geq 0, or a(2 - a) geq 0. This inequality is true for 0 leq a < 2. Since we are also given -1 < -a, that condition translates to a < 1. Hence, in this case, 0 leq a < 1.      - Case 3: -a geq 1       This case cannot occur, as it would imply a leq -1, which is outside the interval [-1, 1] where f(x) must be greater than or equal to 1.Combining the results from Case 1 and Case 2, we get that a must be greater than or equal to 0 and there is no upper bounding condition from these cases.3. Alternative Approach via Function Analysis: Instead of case-wise analysis, we can analyze the function f(x) over the interval [-1, 1]. If f(x) geq 1 is to hold for this entire interval, we require that the coefficient 2a in the term 2ax must ensure that the linear and constant terms combined do not lower the value of f(x) below 1.Upon setting y = g(x) = frac{-x^2}{x + 1}, we find that the maximum value of y on the interval (-1, 1] is 0, implying that we must have 2a geq 0. This analysis again confirms that a must be greater than or equal to 0.Therefore, combining both methods, we conclude that the range for a is [0, +infty).boxed{a in [0, +infty)}"},{"problem":"7 cdot 75 A state issues license plates consisting of 6 digits (made up of the digits 0-9), and stipulates that any two license plates must differ in at least two digits (thus, the plate numbers 027592 and 020592 cannot both be used).

First, consider the number divisible by 2168=2^{3} cdot 271. We use the (1) decomposition. Since we are dealing with a real difference and left|a_{i}-a_{j}right|<10, the difference can only be divisible by 271 if i=j+5, i.e., i=5, j=0. In this case, however, 8 mid a_{i}-a_{j}, which is possible in the following cases left(a_{0} neq a_{5}right., because we are considering non-zero differences, and a_{5} neq 0, because we are looking for a real six-digit number):overline{8 a_{4} a_{3} a_{2} a_{1} 0}, quad overline{9 a_{4} a_{3} a_{2} a_{1} 1}, quad overline{1 a_{4} a_{3} a_{2} a_{1} 9}Now let's consider 2525=5^{2} cdot 101: divisibility by 101 can only come from 1111, so according to (2), i=j+4. For i=4, j=0, 25 mid a_{i}-a_{j} would need to hold, which is impossible, so i=5, j=1 and 5 mid a_{1}-a_{5}. The possibilities are:overline{8 a_{4} a_{3} a_{2} 30}, quad overline{9 a_{4} a_{3} a_{2} 41}, quad overline{1 a_{4} a_{3} a_{2} 69}For 6875=5^{4} cdot 11, only j geq 3 is possible, since a_{i}-a_{j} can be divisible by at most the first power of 5. For divisibility by 11, i-j=2 or 4, which together with j geq 3 leads to the case i=5, j=3. In this case, 5 mid a_{3}-a_{5} is also necessary, so the numbers are:overline{8 a_{4} 3 a_{2} 30}, quad overline{9 a_{4} 4 a_{2} 41}, quad overline{1 a_{4} 6 a_{2} 69}When examining 4375=7 cdot 5^{4}, similarly to the previous case, j geq 3 is obtained. Since 7 can only divide a_{i}-a_{j}, j=3 can be ruled out: in this case, 35 mid a_{i}-a_{j} would need to hold.The remaining case is j=4, i=5, and 7 mid a_{4}-a_{5}:overline{813 a_{2} 30}, quad overline{924 a_{2} 41}, quad overline{186 a_{2} 69}We also know that the number has a 7 as one of its digits, which in all three cases can only be a_{2}. The divisibility by 9 is satisfied only by the number 924741, so this is the only possible number.

The problem asks for the ratio of volume ( C ) to the sum of the other two volumes:   [   text{Ratio} = frac{C}{A + B} = frac{C}{frac{7C}{23} + frac{5C}{23}} = frac{C}{frac{12C}{23}} = frac{C cdot 23}{12C} = frac{23}{12}   ]10. The ratio is (frac{23}{12}), and since (m) and (n) are relatively prime, we have (m = 23) and (n = 12).11.

Find every positive integer M for which S(Mk)=S(M) holds for all integers 1le kle M.","solution":"1. Define the digital sum function ( S(n) ):   The digital sum ( S(n) ) of a positive integer ( n ) is the sum of its digits when represented in the decimal system. For example, ( S(123) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 ).2. Express ( M ) in its decimal form:   Let ( M = sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i cdot 10^i ), where ( 0 le a_i le 9 ) for all ( i in {0, 1, 2, ldots, n} ) and ( a_n neq 0 ).3. Consider the condition ( S(Mk) = S(M) ) for all ( 1 le k le M ):   We need to find all positive integers ( M ) such that the digital sum of ( Mk ) is equal to the digital sum of ( M ) for all ( k ) in the range ( 1 le k le M ).4. Analyze the form of ( M ):   Let's consider ( M ) of the form ( 10^l - 1 ) for some positive integer ( l ). This means ( M = 999ldots9 ) (with ( l ) nines).5. Verify the condition for ( M = 10^l - 1 ):   - For ( M = 10^l - 1 ), we have ( S(M) = 9l ) because the sum of the digits of ( 999ldots9 ) (with ( l ) nines) is ( 9 times l ).   - Consider ( Mk ) where ( 1 le k le M ). We need to show that ( S(Mk) = 9l ).6. Calculate ( S(Mk) ):   - Let ( t = k ). Then ( Mk = t(10^l - 1) = t cdot 10^l - t ).   - The number ( t cdot 10^l ) has the same digits as ( t ) followed by ( l ) zeros.   - Subtracting ( t ) from ( t cdot 10^l ) results in a number where the digits of ( t ) are repeated ( l ) times.   - The sum of the digits of ( t(10^l - 1) ) is ( l ) times the sum of the digits of ( t ).7. Check the sum of digits:   - Since ( t le 10^l - 1 ), the sum of the digits of ( t ) is at most ( 9l ).   - Therefore, the sum of the digits of ( t(10^l - 1) ) is ( l times ) (sum of the digits of ( t )).   - For ( S(Mk) = S(M) ) to hold, the sum of the digits of ( t ) must be ( 9 ), and since ( t ) can be any number from ( 1 ) to ( 10^l - 1 ), this condition is satisfied.8. Conclusion:   - The only ( M ) that satisfies ( S(Mk) = S(M) ) for all ( 1 le k le M ) is of the form ( 10^l - 1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ M = 10^l - 1 } ) for ( l in mathbb{N} )."},{"problem":"7.

The standard form of a hyperbola centered at the origin is frac{{y}^{2}}{a^{2}} - frac{{x}^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1, where the distance between the center and each focus along the y-axis is sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}.

Thus, the equation of the parabola C can be either x^{2} = 8y or x^{2} = -8y.

Understanding the Problem:   We have a complete graph ( K_{23} ) where each vertex represents a student and each edge represents a movie watched by the pair of students connected by that edge. We need to determine the minimum number of different movie collections among the students.2. Graph Theory Application:   In ( K_{23} ), each vertex has a degree of ( 22 ) because each student has watched a movie with every other student. We need to color the edges such that no two edges incident to the same vertex share the same color. This is equivalent to finding an edge coloring of the graph.3. Edge Coloring Theorem:   According to Vizing's Theorem, the chromatic index (the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of a graph such that no two edges incident to the same vertex share the same color) of a simple graph ( G ) is either ( Delta(G) ) or ( Delta(G) + 1 ), where ( Delta(G) ) is the maximum degree of the graph.4. Applying Vizing's Theorem:   For ( K_{23} ), the maximum degree ( Delta(G) ) is ( 22 ). Therefore, the chromatic index is either ( 22 ) or ( 23 ). Since ( K_{23} ) is a complete graph, it falls into the category of graphs where the chromatic index is ( Delta(G) + 1 ). Thus, the chromatic index is ( 23 ).5. Interpreting the Result:   This means we need at least ( 23 ) different colors to color the edges of ( K_{23} ). Each color represents a different movie. Therefore, there are at least ( 23 ) different movies.6. Movie Collections:   Each student has watched ( 22 ) movies, and each movie collection is unique to each student.

At what speed were they traveling?","solution":"Solution. Method 1. In 42 minutes from 12:00 to 12:42, the car traveled no more than 100 km, and in the remaining 18 minutes, it traveled even less (in 42 / 18=7 / 3) times. Therefore, by 13:00, the car had not reached the sign with the number 200. Then X=1. In this case, regardless of the number Y, the car traveled 90 km from 12 to 1 o'clock, and its speed is 90 km/h. It remains to show that at such a speed, the described situation is possible, that is, that the problem's condition is not contradictory. Indeed: in 42 minutes (which is 7 / 10 of an hour), the car traveled 63 km. And with Y=8 (incidentally, such a Y is unique), it will be exactly opposite the sign with the number 63+18=81. In the remaining 18 minutes until 1 o'clock (which is 3 / 10 of an hour), the car will travel another 27 km and will be opposite the sign with the number 81+2=108.Method 2. From the sign with the number Y X=10 Y+X to the sign with the number X Y=10 X+Y, there are exactly overline{(10 Y+X)}-(10 X+Y)=9(Y-X) km. Similarly, between the signs with the numbers X O Y and Y X, there are exactly 9(11 X-Y) km. The constant speed of the car means that the segments of the path it has traveled are proportional to the time spent overcoming them. In other words, we have the equation frac{9(Y-X)}{9(11 X-Y)}=frac{42}{60-42}. After solving the obtained proportion, we get the equality Y=8 X. This equality has two solutions in digits: X=Y=0, which is impossible because the first digit on the kilometer sign is different from zero, and X=1, Y=8, which is what happened.

ON THE FUNCTION pi(n)Prime numbers have long been of particular interest to mathematicians. One of the most interesting functions related to prime numbers is the function pi(n) - the number of prime numbers not exceeding the number n.Problem. Prove that pi(n) geqslant frac{ln n}{ln 4}.","solution":"Solution. The outstanding Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős found the following elementary solution to this problem.Let m be some natural number. Suppose that k^{2} is the largest square that is a divisor of the number m, i.e., m=k^{2} v. Then v cannot have repeated factors, otherwise a full square larger than k^{2} would be a divisor of the number m. (The number v is called the \\"square-free\\" part of the number m.)Now, fix a natural number n and consider the natural numbers m leqslant n. Let each of the numbers m=1,2, ldots, n be represented in the form m=k^{2} v, where the number v does not have repeated factors. Since in each case we have that k^{2} leqslant m leqslant n, then k must be one of the numbers 1,2,3, ldots,[sqrt{n}], where [sqrt{n}] denotes the largest integer not exceeding the number sqrt{n}. Since 0 leqslant m leqslant n, all prime divisors of the number v must belong to the set of prime numbers not exceeding n, namely, p_{1}, p_{2}, ldots, p_{pi(n)}. Being a product of some prime numbers from this set, the number v must be one of the numbers of the formp_{1}^{alpha_{1}} cdot p_{2}^{alpha_{2}} cdots p_{pi(n)}^{alpha_{pi(n)}}where each of the exponents alpha_{i} is 0 or 1 (the number v does not have repeated factors). Since each of the numbers alpha_{i} can be either 0 or 1, there are 2^{pi(n)} different numbers of this form.Summarizing what has been said. For each number m=k^{2} v, where the number v does not have repeated factors, k belongs to the set of [sqrt{n}] numbersX=(1,2, ldots,[sqrt{n}])and v must belong to the set of 2^{pi(n)} numbersY=left(p_{1}^{alpha_{1}} cdot p_{2}^{alpha_{2}} cdots p_{pi(n)}^{alpha_{pi(n)}}, alpha_{i}=0 text { or } 1right)Now, to each number m=1,2, ldots, n correspond a number k from X and a number v from Y such that m=k^{2} v. And conversely, by choosing the corresponding numbers k from the set X and v from the set Y, we can obtain any of the numbers 1,2, ldots, n in the form k^{2} v. Therefore, by choosing numbers k from X and numbers v from Y in all possible ways and forming numbers k^{2} v, we can form a set of numbers that includes all n numbers 1,2,3, ldots, n. But in this way, a total of[sqrt{n}] cdot 2^{pi(n)} text { numbers. }are formed. Accordingly, we have[sqrt{n}] cdot 2^{pi(n)} geqslant nBut sqrt{n} geqslant[sqrt{n}] by definition, and thereforebegin{gathered}sqrt{n} 2^{pi(n)} geqslant n, quad 2^{pi(n)} geqslant sqrt{n} pi(n) ln 2 geqslant frac{1}{2} ln n, quad pi(n) geqslant frac{ln n}{2 ln 2}=frac{ln n}{ln 4}end{gathered}In the 19th century, the Russian mathematician P. Chebyshev proved a stronger theorem:pi(n)>frac{n}{12 ln n}A short problem about the function pi(n) was proposed by Paul Erdős in the journal \\"American Mathematical Monthly\\" in 1944 and solved by Whitney Schobre.Prove that if alpha_{1}<alpha_{2}<ldots<alpha_{k} leqslant n is an arbitrary sequence of natural numbers such that no alpha_{i} is a divisor of the product of the others, then k leqslant pi(n).Solution. Each number alpha_{i} leqslant n and therefore has a factorization into prime factorsalpha_{i}=p_{1}^{q_{1}} p_{2}^{q_{2}} cdots p_{pi(n)}^{q_{pi(n)}}For a number a_{i} not to be a divisor of the product of the other numbers, it must contain some prime factor p_{i} inleft(p_{1}, p_{2}, ldots, p_{pi(n)}right) in a power greater than the sum of the powers of p_{i} in all the other numbers alpha. Thus, the number alpha_{i} must contain this p_{i} in a power greater than each other separate alpha. Each alpha_{i} has such a number p_{i} and it is clear that no two numbers alpha can be associated with the same number p_{i} in this way. Therefore, you cannot have more numbers alpha than there are prime numbers in the set (p_{1}, p_{2}, ldots, p_{pi(n)}), and thus, k leqslant pi(n)."},{"problem":"1.

We can think of the 3 consecutive students from Class 1 as \\"being tied together\\" into a single entity. Hence, we can treat this bundle and the remaining 7 individual students (5 from other classes + 2 from Class 2) as 8 separate entities.

Considering ( a ) as a Perfect Square:   - Let ( a = 4 ):     - If ( p = 2 ):       [ frac{4^2 - 4}{2} = frac{16 - 4}{2} = frac{12}{2} = 6 quad text{(not a perfect square)}. ]     - If ( p ge 3 ):       [ 4(a^{p-1} - 1) = pb^2. ]       - Let ( b = 2t ):         [ 4^{p-1} - 1 = pt^2. ]         - Factorize:           [ (2^{p-1} - 1)(2^{p-1} + 1) = pt^2. ]           - The factors on the left are coprime, so one must be ( p ) and the other ( t^2 ), but this leads to no solution.5. Conclusion:   - The smallest ( a ) that works is ( a = 9 ), as shown in the initial example.The final answer is ( boxed{9} )."},{"problem":"Two students went to an organization for a job interview together.

There are four distinct packaging methods, which can be arranged as follows:   - 10a times b times c   - a times 10b times c   - a times b times 10c   - a times 2b times 5c2. The surface area S for each of the arrangements can be calculated with the following algebraic expressions:   - For 10a times b times c:      S = 2 times (10ab + bc + 10ac)   - For a times 10b times c:      S = 2 times (ab + 10bc + 10ac)   - For a times b times 10c:      S = 2 times (ab + bc + 10ac + 10bc)   - For a times 2b times 5c:      S = 2 times (2ab + 5bc + 10ac)3. To find the packaging method with the smallest surface area, we compare the surface areas.

Let n' be the number obtained by inserting the 0. n must also divide 10n and hence 10n - n'. If the last digit of n is d, then 10n - n' = 9d. So n must divide 9d. In particular, n must be a 2 digit number. For example if d = 9, we need a two digit number ending in 9 that divides 81. There are none. Similarly, we check d = 8 giving n = 18, d = 7 no solutions, d = 6, no solutions, d = 5 giving n = 15 or 45, d = 4 so solutions, d = 3 no solutions, d = 2 no solutions, d = 1 no solutions.

Find lim a→∞ a 4 exp(-a 3 ) ∫ T exp(x 3 +y 3 ) dx dy. Solution","solution":": 2/9. The corresponding indefinite integral is obviously intractable and the definite integral clearly diverges. But exp(a 3 )/a 4 also diverges. So we have the ratio of two divergent quantities. This calls for l'Hôpital's rule: to evaluate lim f(a)/g(a) we take lim f'(a)/g'(a). The first step is to rearrange the integral so that a only occurs as an integration limit for one of the variables (thus making it easier to differentiate with respect to it). After a little experimentation we take s = x + y, t = x - y. The Jacobian is 1/2 and so we get 1/2 ∫ s=0 a ∫ -s s exp(s 3 /4 + 3s t 2 /4) dt ds. Differentiating wrt a, we get 1/2 ∫ -a a exp( a 3 /4 + 3a/4 t 2 ) dt = 1/2 exp(a 3 /4) ∫ -a a exp( 3a/4 t 2 ) dt. Similarly, differentiating the denominator gives (3/a 2 - 4/a 5 ) exp(a 3 ). We can cancel out the exp(a 3 /4) to get 1/2 ∫ -a a exp( 3a/4 t 2 ) dt and (3/a 2 - 4/a 5 ) exp(3a 3 /4), but both these still diverge. Accordingly, we must apply the rule again. We would like to eliminate the a in the integrand to make differentiation simpler. This can be achieved by setting s = a 1/2 t. Notice that the integrand has the same value for t and -t (or s and -s) so we can further simplify by taking the integration from 0 to a and doubling. Thus we get for the numerator a -1/2 ∫ 0 a√a exp(3s 2 /4) ds. We can cancel the a -1/2 . Now differentiating the numerator gives exp(3a 3 4) 3a 1/2 /2. Differentiating the denominator gives (27a 1/2 /4 + lower powers of a ) exp(3a 3 /4).

However, each combination of weights must be used exactly once.Notice that half of the watermelons have an odd mass. Let k be the number of weights with an odd mass, and (5-k) be the number of weights with an even mass. Then the number of ways to weigh a watermelon with an odd mass is exactly k+k(5-k)=6k-k^2. However, for no k=0 ; 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 ; 5 does this expression equal 10 (this can be verified either by substitution or by solving the quadratic equation 6k-k^2=10).Therefore, the seller could not have recorded fewer than 6 numbers.## Grading criteria:+ a complete and well-reasoned solution is providedpm a generally correct solution is provided, containing minor gaps or inaccuraciespm it is proven that fewer than six numbers could not have been recorded, a correct set of six weights is indicated, but it is not shown how exactly to weigh the watermelonsdry it is only proven that five weights are insufficientҒ it is not proven that five weights are insufficient, but a correct set of six weights is provided (regardless of whether it is shown how exactly to weigh the watermelons)- only the answer is provided- the problem is not solved or is solved incorrectly"},{"problem":"A shopping mall estimated that in 2018, the demand f(x) for a certain product in the x-th month is approximately related to x as follows: f(x) = -3x^2 + 40x (where x in mathbb{N}^*, 1 leq x leq 12).

Let the distance of one of the points from the closer parallel side be d. We can calculate this by subtracting half the length of the common chord of the two circles from m / 2.

We need to find all ( n in mathbb{N} ) such that ( n + m(n) ) is a power of 10, i.e., ( n + m(n) = 10^k ) for some ( k in mathbb{N} ).2. Note that ( n geq 2 ) because the smallest natural number ( n ) is 1, and its greatest proper divisor is 0, which does not satisfy the condition ( n + m(n) = 10^k ).3. Consider the case where ( n ) is even. If ( n ) is even, then ( m(n) = frac{n}{2} ). Substituting this into the equation, we get:   [   n + frac{n}{2} = 10^k implies frac{3n}{2} = 10^k implies 3n = 2 cdot 10^k   ]   Since ( 2 cdot 10^k ) is even, ( 3n ) must be even, which implies ( n ) must be even. However, ( 3n = 2 cdot 10^k ) implies ( n = frac{2 cdot 10^k}{3} ), which is not an integer unless ( 10^k ) is divisible by 3. This is a contradiction because ( 10^k ) is never divisible by 3. Therefore, ( n ) cannot be even.4. Now consider the case where ( n ) is odd. Let ( n = l cdot m(n) ) where ( l in mathbb{N} ) and ( l geq 2 ).

If ( l > 5 ), then ( m(n) ) would not be the greatest proper divisor of ( n ). Therefore, ( l leq 5 ). This implies ( 2^a cdot 5^b leq 6 ).

Suppose n numbers are arranged in a circle, and the specified operations are performed. Let the last remaining number be denoted as T_{n}. The following table lists the initial cases:Carefully observing, it is not difficult to find that the values of T do not include even numbers (in fact, all even numbers are eliminated in the first round). When n=1,2,4,8,16, the values of T are all 1. It is also not difficult to notice an interesting phenomenon: when 2^{k}<n<2^{k+1}, the values of T_{n} form an arithmetic sequence of odd numbers: 3, 5, 7, ... Thus, we can reasonably conjecture that when m is a natural number less than 2^{k-1}, T_{n}=2m+1.(Conjectures (I) and (II) are not difficult to prove; please verify them yourself.)When n=1989, since 1989=2^{10}+965, we have m=965, thus T_{n}=2m+1=1931. Therefore, the last remaining number is 1931.From these two examples, we can see that for complex problems, one can start with simpler cases to identify patterns, providing clues and a good start for solving more complex original problems."},{"problem":"14.

The sequence satisfies a_{3}=3, which translates to a_{3}=a_{1}+2d=3.Additionally, it's given that a_{2}, a_{4}, and a_{8} form a geometric sequence.

B received 1 more than A, so B_{1} received 1 less than A_{1}.

We compute each part of the integral separately:   [   int_0^a (cos x - kx) , dx = int_0^a cos x , dx - k int_0^a x , dx   ]   [   = sin a - k frac{a^2}{2}   ]   [   int_a^{frac{pi}{2}} (kx - cos x) , dx = k int_a^{frac{pi}{2}} x , dx - int_a^{frac{pi}{2}} cos x , dx   ]   [   = k left[ frac{x^2}{2} right]_a^{frac{pi}{2}} - left[ sin x right]_a^{frac{pi}{2}}   ]   [   = k left( frac{pi^2}{8} - frac{a^2}{2} right) - (1 - sin a)   ]4. Combining these results, we get:   [   int_0^{frac{pi}{2}} |cos x - kx| , dx = left( sin a - k frac{a^2}{2} right) + left( k frac{pi^2}{8} - k frac{a^2}{2} - 1 + sin a right)   ]   [   = 2 sin a - k a^2 + k frac{pi^2}{8} - 1   ]5. Given ( cos a = ka ), we substitute ( k = frac{cos a}{a} ) into the expression:   [   f(a) = 2 sin a - a cos a + frac{pi^2}{8} cdot frac{cos a}{a} - 1   ]   [   = 2 sin a - a cos a + frac{pi^2 cos a}{8a} - 1   ]6. To minimize ( f(a) ), we take the derivative ( f'(a) ) and set it to zero:   [   f'(a) = cos a + a sin a - frac{pi^2}{8a^2} (cos a + a sin a)   ]   [   = (cos a + a sin a) left( 1 - frac{pi^2}{8a^2} right)   ]7.

Three positive integers have sum 25 and product 360 . Find all possible triples of these integers.","solution":"SolutionLet the integers be a, b, c. Then a+b+c=25 and a b c=360=2^{3} times 3^{2} times 5. We must split this factorised product up into parts so that the sum of the resulting numbers is 25 .It is possible, of course, to make a list of all the different ways of doing this, but there are 32 possibilities and ensuring that no alternatives are missing is difficult. Such an approach depends on the list being exhaustive and so omissions result in it being invalid. However, there are several methods which avoid making such a list.Method 1 :This focuses on the fact that one of the three numbers is divisible by 5 . Without loss of generality, take this to be a. It is either 5,10,15 or 20 , since 25 is too large to obtain the required sum.If a=5, then b+c=20 and b c=72. It is possible to list all the factorisations of 72 and show that none of them produce a sum of 20 . However, a better approach is to consider the quadratic x^{2}-20 x+72=0. The sum of its roots is 20 and the product is 72 , so the roots will be b and c. However, the discriminant of this quadratic is negative, so there are no real roots.This approach is useful in checking all such cases.If a=10, the quadratic is x^{2}-15 x+36=0, which has roots 3 and 12 . Hence there is a solution 10,3,12.If a=15, the quadratic is x^{2}-10 x+24=0, which has roots 4 and 6 , and so there is a solution 15,4,6.If a=20, the quadratic is x^{2}-15 x+18=0, and again the discriminant is negative and there are no roots.Hence there are exactly two triples of numbers, namely 4,6,15 and 3,10,12.Method 2:This focuses on the largest number of the three. Since their sum is 25 , this is greater than 8 and smaller than 24 . Since it is also a factor of 360 , the only possible values are 9,10 , 12, 15, 18 and 20. The approach in Method 1 can now be used to eliminate 9,18 and 20. The values 10 and 12 result in the same triple.Method 3:This focuses on the 2 mathrm{~s} in the factorisation of 360 . Since a+b+c=25, they cannot be all even, nor can two be odd and one even, and since a b c=360, they cannot be all odd. It follows that two are even and one is odd. The factor of 8 is split between the two even numbers.Without loss of generality, let a=2 a_{1} and b=4 b_{1}, with a_{1}, b_{1}, c formed from the factors 3,3 and 5 . Now b_{1} is not a multiple of 5 or 9 , since the sum would be greater than 25 , so it is either 1 or 3 .If b_{1}=1, then b=4 and 2 a_{1}+c=21. Using the factors 3,3 and 5 , the only possibility is a_{1}=3, c=15 and so a=6.If b_{1}=3, then b=12 and 2 a_{1}+c=13. Using the factors 3 and 5 , the only possibility is a_{1}=5, c=3 and so a=10.Hence there are two triples of numbers, namely 4,6,15 and 3,10,12."},{"problem":"Given a convex polygon M invariant under a 90^circ rotation, show that there exist two circles, the ratio of whose radii is sqrt2, one containing M and the other contained in M.[i]A. Khrabrov[/i]","solution":"1. Identify the center of rotation:   Since the polygon ( M ) is invariant under a ( 90^circ ) rotation, there exists a point ( O ) such that ( M ) coincides with its image after a ( 90^circ ) rotation about ( O ).2. Consider the bounding circle:   Let ( R ) be the radius of the smallest circle centered at ( O ) that contains the polygon ( M ). This circle is called the circumscribed circle of ( M ).3. Consider the inscribed circle:   Let ( r ) be the radius of the largest circle centered at ( O ) that is contained within the polygon ( M ). This circle is called the inscribed circle of ( M ).4. Analyze the symmetry:   Due to the ( 90^circ ) rotational symmetry, the distances from ( O ) to the vertices of ( M ) are symmetric. This symmetry implies that the polygon ( M ) can be inscribed in a circle of radius ( R ) and can circumscribe a circle of radius ( r ).5. Relate the radii:   The key observation is that the ( 90^circ ) rotation symmetry implies that the polygon ( M ) must be symmetric in such a way that the ratio of the radii of the circumscribed and inscribed circles is ( sqrt{2} ).6. Prove the ratio:   - Consider a point ( P ) on the boundary of the polygon ( M ). After a ( 90^circ ) rotation, this point moves to a new position ( P' ) which is also on the boundary of ( M ).   - The distance from ( O ) to ( P ) is ( R ), and the distance from ( O ) to ( P' ) is also ( R ).   - The inscribed circle touches the sides of the polygon at points that are equidistant from ( O ). The distance from ( O ) to these points is ( r ).7. Geometric interpretation:   - The ( 90^circ ) rotation symmetry implies that the polygon ( M ) can be divided into four quadrants, each of which is a scaled-down version of the whole polygon.   - The distance from ( O ) to the midpoint of a side of the polygon is ( r ), and the distance from ( O ) to a vertex is ( R ).8. Calculate the ratio:   - Since the polygon is symmetric under ( 90^circ ) rotation, the distance from ( O ) to a vertex (which is ( R )) is ( sqrt{2} ) times the distance from ( O ) to the midpoint of a side (which is ( r )).   - Therefore, ( R = sqrt{2} cdot r ).Conclusion:Thus, we have shown that there exist two circles, one containing ( M ) and the other contained in ( M ), with the ratio of their radii being ( sqrt{2} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ sqrt{2} } )."},{"problem":"A company has a total of 150 employees, among which there are 15 senior titles, 45 intermediate titles, and 90 junior titles.

And in all jars, there are no less than 11+12+ldots+20=155 beetles. Contradiction. Therefore, the first jar contains no more than 10 beetles.In the tenth jar, there are at least 9 more beetles than in the first jar, which means 9 beetles are no more than half the number of beetles in the tenth jar, so the first jar must contain no fewer than 9 beetles. If there are 9, then the tenth jar can only have 18. But 9+10+ldots+18=135. Contradiction. Therefore, the first jar contains exactly 10 beetles, and the tenth jar contains a maximum of 20. Since there are eleven numbers from 10 to 20 and 10+11+ldots+20=165, the variant with 15 beetles in a jar is missing, and the following are present: 10,11,12,13,14,16,17,18,19,20.

(Note: this justifies the fact that E H and C M intersect as implied by the problem statement.)We will answer the question before proving the two facts.To start, we will show that the altitude of tetrahedron A B C D is 5 times that of E B C P.Let K be the point where the line through D P intersects triangle A B C and let L be the point in triangle A B C so that D L is perpendicular to triangle A B C, and let V be the point on triangle A B C so that P V is perpendicular to triangle A B C.By construction, D L is the altitude of A B C D from A to triangle A B C and P V is the altitude of E B C P from P to triangle E B C.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_54c374478de6843636d1g-19.jpg?height=498&width=290&top_left_y=171&top_left_x=972)By Fact 2, M is on D E so that M D=2 E M and H is on D C so that H D=2 C H by assumption.By Fact 1, K D=5 K P.Since triangle K P V and triangle K D L share an angle at K and both have a right angle, the triangles are similar.This means frac{P V}{D L}=frac{K P}{K D}=frac{1}{5}.Thus, the length of the altitude of A B C D is five times that of E B C P.Since E is the midpoint of A B, the area of triangle E B C is half that of triangle A B C.Thus, the base area of tetrahedron E B C P is half that of tetrahedron A B C D, while the heights are in ratio 1: 5, which means that the volumes are in the ratio 1: 10.Now for the proofs of the facts.Proof of Fact 1We will first show that the height of triangle Q Z S from Z is one fifth the height of triangle Q R S from R.Suppose triangle Q Z S has height h_{1} from Z and triangle Q R S has height h_{2} from R. The first goal is to show that frac{h_{1}}{h_{2}}=frac{1}{5}.The area of triangle Q Z S is frac{1}{2}(Q S) h_{1} and the area of triangle Q R S is frac{1}{2}(Q S) h_{2}.Thus, if we take the ratio of their areas we getfrac{frac{1}{2}(Q S) h_{1}}{frac{1}{2}(Q S) h_{2}}=frac{h_{1}}{h_{2}}and so the ratio of their heights is the same as the ratio of their areas.This means we can show that frac{h_{1}}{h_{2}}=frac{1}{5} by showing that the area of triangle Q R S is 5 times the area of triangle Q Z S.To do this, draw a line from R to Z and label the areas of triangle Q X Z, triangle R X Z, triangle R Y Z, triangle S Y Z, and triangle Q Z S by A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4} and A_{5}, respectively.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_54c374478de6843636d1g-19.jpg?height=385&width=526&top_left_y=2228&top_left_x=859)We will now make several observations about the areas A_{1} through A_{5}.Since triangle Q X Z and triangle R X Z have the same altitude from Z to Q R and their bases satisfy X R=2 Q X, we get thatA_{2}=2 A_{1}By similar reasoning, we also get the equationsbegin{aligned}A_{3} & =2 A_{4} A_{2}+A_{3}+A_{4} & =2left(A_{1}+A_{5}right)=2 A_{1}+2 A_{5} A_{1}+A_{2}+A_{3} & =2left(A_{4}+A_{5}right)=2 A_{4}+2 A_{5}end{aligned}Substituting Equation (1) into Equation (3) gives A_{2}+A_{3}+A_{4}=A_{2}+2 A_{5} which simplifies to A_{3}+A_{4}=2 A_{5}.Substituting Equation (2) into Equation (4) gives A_{1}+A_{2}+A_{3}=A_{3}+2 A_{5} which simplifies to A_{1}+A_{2}=2 A_{5}.Adding A_{3}+A_{4}=2 A_{5} and A_{1}+A_{2}=2 A_{5} gives A_{1}+A_{2}+A_{3}+A_{4}=4 A_{5}.Adding A_{5} to both sides gives A_{1}+A_{2}+A_{3}+A_{4}+A_{5}=5 A_{5}, which exactly says that the area of triangle Q R S is five times that of triangle Q Z S.We will now let T be the point on Q S so that R T is perpendicular to Q S and let U be on W T so that Z U is perpendicular to R W.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_54c374478de6843636d1g-20.jpg?height=496&width=290&top_left_y=1259&top_left_x=972)Note that Z U is the height of triangle Q Z S from Z and R T is the height of triangle Q R S from R, so we know that R T=5 Z U.Since angle W U Z=angle W T R=90^{circ} and angle Z W U=angle R W T, triangle Z W U is similar to triangle R W T.Since frac{Z U}{R T}=frac{1}{5}, we get that frac{W Z}{W R}=frac{1}{5}, which proves the fact.## Proof of Fact 2Consider triangle A D B and triangle F D G.

From the first inequality, we have ( x^{2n} > x + |y|^{2n} ). This implies:   [   x^{2n} - |y|^{2n} > x   ]   which is consistent with the given inequality.8. From the second inequality, we have ( |y|^{2n} > x^{2n} - |y| ). This implies:   [   |y|^{2n} - x^{2n} > -|y|   ]   which is also consistent with the given inequality.9. However, combining both inequalities, we get:   [   x^{2n} > x + |y|^{2n} quad text{and} quad |y|^{2n} > x^{2n} - |y|   ]   This leads to a contradiction because ( x^{2n} ) cannot be simultaneously greater than ( x + |y|^{2n} ) and less than ( |y|^{2n} ).Therefore, the assumption that ( xy < 0 ) leads to a contradiction.

How many ways are there to queue so that everyone can buy their tickets smoothly without encountering any difficulty in giving change?","solution":"In the Cartesian coordinate system, let O(0,0) and point B(2 n, 0) represent the \\"start of ticket sales\\" and \\"end of ticket sales,\\" respectively. Buying a ticket with a 5 yuan note is represented by a segment of a broken line with a slope of 1, and buying a ticket with a 10 yuan note is represented by a segment of a broken line with a slope of -1. Thus, for the ticket sales to proceed smoothly, the broken line must remain above the x-axis (it can touch but not cross the x-axis). From Theorem 1, the number of broken lines from (0,0) to (2 n, 0) is C_{2 n}^{n}. To find the number of broken lines that meet the condition, we need to subtract the number of broken lines that cross the x-axis. Clearly, each broken line that crosses the x-axis must intersect the line y=-1 at some point. As shown in Figure 1-7, let the first intersection point from left to right be A. By reflecting the segment of the broken line l from O to A across the line y=-1 and leaving the rest unchanged, we obtain a broken line l^{prime} from O^{prime}(0,-2) through A to B(2 n, 0). Thus, we let l correspond to l^{prime}, which is clearly a one-to-one correspondence. Therefore, the number of broken lines that cross the x-axis is equal to the number of broken lines from O^{prime}(0,-2) to B(2 n, 0), which is C_{2 n}^{n+1}. Hence, the number of broken lines that remain above the x-axis (or touch it) is C_{2 n}^{n}-C_{2 n}^{n+1} = frac{(2 n)!}{n!(n+1)!}.

Since f(x+1) = -f(x) for x geq 0, we have:   f(x+2) = -f(x+1).   This implies that f(x) = f(x+2) for x geq 0, indicating that the period of f(x) for non-negative x is T=2.
