I had done MRI brain a few months back and the report was normal. But after I again start worrying that I have got a brain tumor after MRI. I cannot concentrate on my studies. I am anytime worrying. Please convey me that how much time is needed for a brain tumor to grow. Does it grow in a few months? I have spent a lot of money on the scan reports. Everything is normal. Please convey me.","Doctor":"Hello. Your brain MRI is perfectly normal, so we can completely exclude any possible brain tumor. In my opinion, your symptoms are compatible with a tension-type headache, which is a benign type of headache related to psychological stress. I recommend performing yoga and regular physical activity."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had unprotected sex with my partner. I am not sure about ejaculation. She took I-pill within three to four hours after having sex. She had her previous period before 20 days. Is she safe from pregnancy and how to confirm it? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. If she has taken I-pill (Levonorgestrel) in a proper advised dosage, within 48 to 72 hours of unprotected penetrative sex, then she will have an interruption in her normal menstrual cycle to prevent ovulation or fertilization and even conception to have a pregnancy. Within one to two weeks after taking medicine, she starts to have bleeding that is a withdrawal bleed. The regular menstrual cycle will get disturbed for some time until the body gets out of the effects of the externally induced hormones (I-pill). Then it will become normal gradually."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother is 64 years old. She has a fibroid above the uterus. The doctor has advised removing the uterus. She has a low level of hemoglobin, and she is given injections to increase the range. But it got increased from 10 g/dL to 10.4 g/dL. But the doctor advises my mother to have hemoglobin to be at 11 g/dL. The doctor recommends for a blood transfusion, and he ordered 350 ml blood from the blood bank. He plans for a uterus removal operation a couple of days later. Is this advisable and a routine procedure?","Doctor":"Hi. As your mother is 64 years old, it is better to have uterus removal and removal of fibroid along with it. Please mention about the symptoms faced by her. Please send the ultrasound report to guide you further. For increasing the range of Hb (hemoglobin), iron injections alone will not give quick results. So the doctor has decided for transfusion of blood before or after surgery. Depending on the location of the fibroid, there will be excessive bleeding, and it is better to have a blood transfusion soon."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

As I was near my ovulation period, Is there any chance for me to get pregnant? What can I do to avoid pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi. Chances of getting pregnant are extremely low. As there is no ejaculation done and as you have taken pills, these are highly effective in preventing pregnancy. So pregnancy is very unlikely to occur. At present, you do not need action, and nothing can be done. You should wait until you get your periods, which may get delayed due to the pill. If the periods get delayed, then do a urine pregnancy test to be on a safer side. Overall, the chances of getting pregnant are very less."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 56 years old female. I have heavy bleeding, and my endometrium is bulky. It is 15 mm. I have placed Mirena before four years, and I have removed it before two months. My doctor did a biopsy, and the report came as hyperplasia without atypia. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Please say whether you had any menopausal or perimenopausal symptoms. Please mention whether you had irregular bleeding or scanty periods or whether there is a stoppage of periods. You have placed Mirena before four years. You can also have side effects. The side effects should be subsided. Hormonal effects can also cause heavy bleeding or unscheduled irregular bleeding. Mirena is advised in endometrial hyperplasia with atypia. It usually gives scanty cycles, and there is a reduction in menstrual flow in some patients. In some patients, there is an increase in endometrial size after a long time due to a hormonal effect. In this age, it is better to have a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of ovaries due to a risk of ovarian cancer). Please mention the history regarding obesity, family history of cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. All the factors should be followed when you are planning to have a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Please give a detailed history. For symptomatic relief, I suggest you take cyclic Norethisterone 10 mg from 4th day to 25th day for three cycles. You can take it for six cycles. You can have this for heavy periods and during unscheduled bleeding. For pain, you can take tablet Ponstan 500 (Mefenamic acid) for eight hours from the second day to the fifth day. If the bleeding is heavy, you can also take tablet Tranexamic acid 500 mg for eight hours along with Ponstan from the second day to the fifth day. Both these tablets can be stopped if you are asymptomatic. Check your complete blood count and thyroid function test also. Please decide for having surgery soon as you cannot take hormones for more than six months. Have a healthy diet and iron supplements. Have a walk daily and maintain a healthy BMI (body mass index)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 27-year-old male. I met a girl recently. We both did deep kissing and fingering many times. I do not know about her HIV status. Recently, I read about HIV, and I am worried. I do not remember whether I had any cut in my finger. Can I have HIV through the cuts in the finger or sores in the mouth? Please assess my risk factor. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Fingering alone will not cause HIV transmission. For transmission, the virus needs to enter the bloodstream. Regarding the cut, there should be a fresh lesion for having an active transfer. As far as deep kissing is concerned, there is no possibility to have HIV transmission through the saliva and if it is mixed with blood, there can be a possibility. If you have any doubt about the exposure, you can do a test at four weeks of the exposure, and if the result is negative, you can do another test at three months of the last exposure. It will reduce your fear soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is having loose motion since last four days. Our doctor gave Rantac, Nutrolin B, and Cyclopam.

I have tired a few medicines for the same and I got a laser treatment once.

I suggest you use a potent topical steroid like Tenovate-Gn (Clobetasol propionate and Neomycin) cream or Halovate-F cream (Ulobetasol and Fusidic acid), twice daily. In addition, I suggest you take an oral antihistamine like Cetirizine 10 mg tablet once a day for a few days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS).

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is 11 months old. By mistake, I gave expired Vitazyme drops to her. After giving the dose she vomited immediately.

Before actually going to the causes of physical problems, I need to know if there are any psychological issue bothering you. Start taking capsule Omeprazole 20 mg every night half an hour before your dinner for two weeks and observe the response (this is an antacid medication and not a sleeping pill). You had mentioned about your shoulder surgery. Are you on any medications for that? Or any other pain medicines?  Also, you can ask your doctor for a prescription of tablet Zolpidem 10 mg every night which will give you a good sleep. But again, this is a temporary fix. We need to find the root cause to cure it.

Vulval pain (vulvodynia) or irritation is very common. You need not be worried as it usually resolves with just proper hygienic precautions and minor treatment. The reasons for this could be due to a condition called friction-induced skin infection or skin tag or other skin conditions like lichen sclerosis.

This should be done 2 to 3 times a day thoroughly. Nasal glucocorticoid sprays (Budesonide, Fluticasone propionate, Mometasone Furoate). One or two sprays once daily. Antihistamines may be helpful if your chronic sinus has an allergic component."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a growth near my anus, I think it grew bigger so I checked it the other night. I see there is a tiny lesion that might be caused by the use of toilet paper but not sure. The growth has the same color all around but it is a bit lighter where the lesion is. Lately, I have been placing a Kleenex to keep it dry and help the healing process but it looks the same, no improvement but it does not get worse either. The other day I pressed it and a clear liquid came out of the tiny hole, not much though, it looked like sweat. What could it be? I suffered from hemorroids and IBS so I figured the growth was caused by either but not sure anymore. I will send you some pictures. I took them right after a shower so the growth turned bright pink.","Doctor":"Hi. The images suggest you have external hemorrhoids (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This has blood clot inside and that is causing it to be enlarged. These usually settle with time. You need to keep the area dry. Avoid constipation by dietary measures to prevent progression of hemorrhoids. Keep a close watch for any new signs in the area."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, We are both 18 years old and we were wondering if you could answer some of our questions for school. We are required to consult with a psychiatrist, but we do not have money to consult with any. Our topic is psychopathy and how psychopaths are developed. The questions are as follows. How do you diagnose someone as a psychopath? What kind of therapy is needed to aid the brain condition of a psychopath? Is psychopathy a genetic condition? Are sociopaths and psychopaths developed the same way? What kind of environment is the most likely to form psychopaths? Are psychopaths more self-sufficient compared to an average person? If psychopaths are unable to feel strong emotions, what are their goals or aspirations in life? What are the signs of a psychopath targeting you? Do psychopaths lack the concept of sexuality since they are unable to form deep emotional connections? If a psychopath is able to form a family, what would be the effect on his or her children?","Doctor":"Hi. I would be happy to help you. What you are referring to as a psychopath is known as antisocial personality disorder in psychiatry. It is diagnosed using certain standard guidelines and criteria. These people show a persistent disregard for laws and the rights of others. Such people do not generally seek professional help unless it is for comorbid problems like substance use or mood disorder or they are in prison and brought by the police. These people have impulsive traits and extreme irritability which can be reduced with the help of psychiatric medication. Therapy may be helpful but more often than not. There is no permanent treatment because many of them do not follow up and majority do not feel there is anything wrong with them. People who have first degree relatives with psychopathy have higher chances of the same but social, economic and cultural factors also play a role. Sociopaths can be best described as a milder form of antisocial personality disorder. Psychopaths are highly intelligent but they lack empathy. So they do not generally have long lasting relationships or gain satisfaction from interpersonal relations."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My sperm count is 50 M/ml, 3 ml ejaculate, 55 % motility, 45 % prog motility, grade 1 to 10, grade 2 to 10, grade 3 to 10, grade 15, normomorphs 20 %, no antibodies, colour and viscosity normal, pH 8.5. Diagnosed with teratospermia. Given two months course of Fertisure M and retest semen analysis. How serious is that? The doctor says if the report is repeated, she will plan for IUI as my wife reports are totally normal. Am I infertile?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? I do not see any abnormalities in the report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are super fertile. As per WHO guidelines, the minimum count is 15 million/ml, minimum motility is progressive 32 %, minimum normal morphology 4 %. As you are above all these criteria, you have nothing to worry. Hope wife's blood evaluation and scan are normal.  One test usually forgotten is the evaluation of tubal patency, with X-ray or HSG. The tube is bridge connecting uterus and ovaries. It cannot be seen on scan or examination. Its inner diameter is 1 mm. If blocked, no matter how good the egg and sperm are, they will not meet. If not done, better do it. Not costly or invasive. Can be done on day 7 to 10 of periods. Do not worry, you will get a positive result."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a cavity in my lower front tooth. I filled it and placed a crown over it. After a month, I started to have pain and sensitivity. The X-ray was normal. Yesterday, I had pain again. The X-ray was quite fine and healthy. I also have soreness in my gums and pain in the chin. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Yes, it looks like stress related periapical periodontitis. You may need to readjust the crown if you feel muscle heaviness on the same side or opposite side. Please upload a picture of your X-ray so that I can guide you further. To prevent the further spread of infection, you need a course of antibiotics."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Nowadays, I am getting a migraine for every three days alternatively. Before few days, I usually get a migraine once in 20 days. Often, I have a visual problem and aura symptoms. It relieves after taking Zerodol. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. A migraine has two types of treatment. When the duration of the attack is more than 24 hours, we need to use both abortive and prophylactic medicine. In your case, you must use both the treatments. You can use Methysergide with Fluoxetine and Gabapentin as a preventive drug along with an abortive one. Make a daily diary to sort out the triggering factors such as lack of sleep, fatigue, stress, certain foods, and vasodilators. Avoid it soon."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother has BP in an unstable condition. She was taking Paroxee Cr, Etizola, and Covance 50. After taking these tablets, she had frequent urination, and her BP was fine. When she consulted the doctor for the problem of frequent urination, the doctor changed Covance 50 to Ctd 6.25 mg for blood pressure. After that, urination got controlled, but BP became unstable. She has a feeling of nausea. Her creatinine level is fine, and she does not have diabetes. She has a TSH of 8.9 mIU/L. Her hemoglobin is below 7 g/dL. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. She suffers from anxiety and depression, and so she is taking antidepressants. TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level is raised which suggests that she has an under-working thyroid gland. Though she is taking Ctd tablet (Chlorthalidone), her blood pressure is not under control. Hence we need to try some other antihypertensive for her. Do CBC (complete blood count), thyroid profile, fasting lipid profile, renal function test, electrolytes, and ECG (electrocardiography). After doing these tests, you can consult a general physician for examination. Her HB (hemoglobin) is 7 g/dL which means that she is severely anemic. She can take Amlodipine or Valsartan 5 by 80 mg daily in the morning for controlling BP. She can take Ferrous sulfate 200 mg three times a day for anemia. Follow the same medications for depression."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am writing to you about my partner. She has had swollen lymph nodes for the past two years. Only other symptoms are high CPR and very slightly higher eosinophils. She had an ultrasound of her right side of the neck today, and I would like to know if you can see anything unusual. Also, I would like to know what the other two pictures say, that are 2 cm lymph node or the marked submandibular gland which was operated on. On two pictures, I see three small circles around a big circle, and on one of the pictures, some of the small circles have something inside of them. Obviously doctors are investigating possible lymphoma, so I would really appreciate your help and if you could take a good look at everything and tell us an opinion about the features of the examined organs.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me start with the right neck lymph nodes seen on the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). They have a fusiform shape which is a good sign. They are mildly enlarged, the index one short axis measures 6 mm. Image 1: Lymph node with Doppler box, showing center blood supply which is again a good sign. Image 2: Couple of mildly enlarged lymph nodes. Image 3: Submandibular gland and mildly enlarged lymph nodes with a white center, fatty hilum, normal. Image 4: Index lymph node measurement long x short axis 21 x 6 mm. I would favor benign pathology versus lymphoma due to fusiform shape, central blood supply, preserved normal fatty hilum, and mild enlargement. This can also represent systemic inflammatory diseases. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Can an ulcer develop whilst taking Lansoprazole? I am also having minor pain under the right ribcage. Can an ulcer develop or worsen whilst taking a PPI?","Doctor":"Hello. Peptic ulcer disease is mostly related to the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection (a bacteria that is transmitted via saliva and is present in around 70 % of adults). The first step of the treatment is actually PPI. When this stops working (yes, you may develop more serious symptoms. Whilst taking PPI's) you have some options like add antiacids whenever you have symptoms like Magaldrate-Simethicone 3 to 4 times a day. Add H1 blockers (Ranitidine 150 mg tablets) every 2 to 3 times a day. Avoid over-the-counter pain-killers (with some exceptions such as COX2 inhibitors).  If symptoms continue despite this, you need to do an H.pylori testing, if positive you need to take the medication for its eradication (it includes two antibiotics). This usually improves very much the symptoms for months or years."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had unprotected sex a week back and took an I-pill within 24 hours.

Please advise if I need to take an Ipill again and if it is safe.","Doctor":"Hello. If you have taken Ipill after first intercourse activity and it was taken properly, in proper dose and timings without vomiting, then actually ovulation or fertilization would have stopped already for this cycle. By rule, no need to take another pill if still, no bleeding is there after the previous pill.

But it generally disappears after a few days. There are other possibilities also. The first cause can be periodontitis. It is the inflammation of the periodontal ligament or the structure supporting the gums. Bad breath can also occur due to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) because of chronic acidity. Infections in tonsils or other areas of the throat can also cause bad breath. Food impaction around the teeth also causes bad breath. You can consult a dentist for a checkup and try to rule out periodontitis. Try to see the presence of calculus and do scaling. After ruling out periodontitis, you can see a physician for other health-related problems."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old. I had a symtoms of piles.

It does not seem you have complicated piles since this presents with sudden and intense local pain (in which case you should go to a surgeon). It seems you have a mild disease. There are various recommendations for this problem. You should poop without difficulty. I recommend Psyllium Plantago (oral powder) one spoon in a glass of water every morning. Sitz bath with warm (not too warm) water two times a day (for 20 to 30 minutes). Diltiazem ointment, place a small amount in the affected área two times a day (after you do sitz bath).

In fact, all oral contraceptives are not a very good option as contraceptives. Bloating, weight gain, irregular spotting, are a few side effects. Larger and other bad side effects are marked suppression of ovulation leading to suppression of the biological clock of females. It changes the vaginal environment and therefore causes the growth of multiple bacteria. It is also known to cause obesity, diabetes, HT (hypertension), and breast lumps. The best is condoms by the partner and vaginal tablet to be inserted at the time of contact. Kindly stop taking that tablet. Take capsule Primosa 1000 mg once daily. Also, take supplement of antioxidants like grape seed extract and multivitamins. Stop taking pills."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I used to have itching and pimples or boils in my inside of the butt cheeks. Even after cleaning there thourougly it continued with no relief. I recently started applying ample moisturizer there after showers and can feel a significant improvement. However, there are many marks and dead black skin over there. Can you please advise how to get rid of it?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case. You need to follow strictly a few pieces of advice. Check your blood sugar level, fasting and random, because boils occur repeatedly in it. Apply Fucidin cream two times a day on the pimple. Apply Canesten (Clotrimazole) cream in your all black area.

She is suffering from high-grade fever and cold. So we are giving Tylenol. What is the problem?","Doctor":"Hi. SGOT (aspartate aminotransferase) is a liver enzyme, which increases due to multiple causes. One of the reason can be a viral infection. These mild rise in titer are very nonspecific and do not to worry. When the disease gets controlled, it becomes normal. Maintain good hydration.

I am depressed in the evenings daily, and I have lost a lot of joy in my life with feelings. I am thinking about the psychological disorders every day. Please suggest some medication or counseling.","Doctor":"Hi. Psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia do not follow a direct mendelian inheritance, and they have multifactorial etiologies. If your mother has schizophrenia, then you have an increased risk of having schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders. But that risk is not very high. So stop remaining anxious. You are repeatedly thinking about psychiatric disorders, and it is due to anxiety. You do not have schizophrenia.

My ANA was negative but I noticed two markers out of range. I was wondering if you could give any insight into these blood test results?","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your post and investigations (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there are two things which I presume you think are abnormal. CK (creatine kinase), it is an enzyme produced by heart muscle and skeletal muscle. So, is elevated in people with muscle or heart disease but low levels have no significance and are common in people with a sedentary lifestyle who do not exert much. Anti-histone antibodies are seen in people with drug-induced lupus so if one does not have other features of lupus as in your case the hearing loss is not a criterion for lupus (ACR criteria for SLE). It has little or no importance. I think there is a possibility of Meniere's disease for which you should get investigated that can cause sudden temporary hearing loss."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have to sit nine hours per day at work. Due to long time sitting, there is a pain in my neck. What should I do to get rid of this pain?","Doctor":"Hello. A very common issue with people working on the desk. Long hours at a stretch spent in poor posture and bad ergonomic position leads to the symptoms you describe. I will recommend reading about the correct office or desk posture and making changes to your laptop screen height, chair height and distance from the screen, etc., online. Isometric neck exercises to strengthen the neck muscles and a stint of physiotherapy will help in the long run. Also, to note that at a stretch do not spend time on the desk for more than 25 to 30 minutes.

Some white liquid is leaking and some symptoms make me to feel like I am pregnant. What should I do? I am confused because the kit shows negative. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have gone through your query. As the urine pregnancy test is negative, you are definitely not pregnant right now. Sometimes the premenstrual symptoms can also be similar to pregnancy because of similar hormones acting in both the situations. Some amount of menstrual disturbances are known side effects of the emergency contraceptive pill. So if you still have a doubt you can recheck it again after three to four days with an early morning sample. If still negative, you can be sure you are not pregnant. Just wait for a week for periods to come. Please use a better and consistent method of birth control in the future like oral contraceptive pills or condoms, and repeated emergency contraceptive pill can take a toll on your hormonal balance. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Two days later, I visited the same restaurant and had the same food. But there was no similar material that I found two days ago. After that event, I have been thinking if that substance is fatal to health. Of course, that seems very unrealistic since I am still alive. I am very confused. If I eat some toxic chemical substances which have toxins, is it possible for that substance to act later or very slowly (maybe two to five months later) ? I know that our body has the function of detoxifying the toxins. Even then I am scared our body might fail to detoxify. If I know what material it was, I do not need to worry. But, since I do not know the toxic material, I am very curious and scared. Please explain to me in detail. Sorry to ask such an odd question.","Doctor":"Hi. I would like to give a scientific explanation of food/chemical toxicity. The ingredients used to prepare fast food may not always be the same. The cook may use different brands, different batch of the same manufacturer, or different item itself. The procedure of cooking is also subjective. Hence the taste what we get once may be different from the second time. A difference in the taste or missing something second time compared to the previous time also happens due to consumer psychology (who eats the food), the level of hunger or mood or the environment. And you are healthy in other words alive after eating that food which means it is not fatal to you.  There are many dangerous or toxic foodstuff which we use commonly. It includes vegetables exposed to pesticides, meat exposed to antibiotics/hormones during farming, preservatives, flavors, taste enhancers (including some chemicals which make you addicted to using it again). Our body can detoxify and excrete a few of these toxins.  It is possible for a toxin to act in the body or show its bad effect for a maximum of one week. The washout period for any chemical is 14 days. It means after 14 days, any type of toxin gets excreted out of the body. Hence it cannot show its effect after one month.  Consuming the same chemical daily through food or exposure to chemical hazards continuously can produce some amount of visible bad effects on the body organs such as liver or kidney. It will not happen with a single dose. If the single dose is high, then the side effects appear immediately and go off gradually after few days. The amount of toxins deposited within the body gets detoxified slowly and will be excreted over a period of time. Thus, the amount/volume of toxin in the body will be definitely lesser than earlier.  One-time exposure will never cause late effects in the body. Either it shows its bad effect immediately or as early as possible. No later effect is possible. Long time exposure to chemicals will affect the liver or kidney, and they get altered in their microscopic structure. Because of this structural alteration, the function of that organ gets affected. This can be clinically seen with some symptoms. There are laboratory investigations to check the damage caused to any particular organ. This will tell you if the liver/kidney is affected or not. But, such a damage will never happen with single exposure to toxins in food."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My conditions are serious from a few days.

Tablet Cefixime 200 mg two times daily after food for five days. Tablet Chlorpheniramine maleate and Phenylephrine, Paracetamol (fixed dose combination) three times daily for three days after food.

I recently started new birth control (after not taking any sort of birth control for three months) called Drospirenone and Ethinyl tablets, USP (3mg/0.02mg) and I am now on day 22 of taking the pills. I had unprotected sex within the first week of taking the pill. However, I have always had a really light period and rarely got a period when I was previously taking birth control. The last day, I had unproductive sex was exactly 19 days ago. However, about five days ago, I started to have more intense cramps on the same side and I am also bleeding. This is what it felt like last year before I took a test, just way less severe. I looked online and learned that I can take a pregnancy test at least 19 days after intercourse, so I just took one, and it came back negative. I am not sure if I am having an ectopic pregnancy or it is just too early to tell if this could be a side effect of the new birth control? Or if this is just my regular period (despite it starting in the middle of my pack)?","Doctor":"Hello. You have to know that contraceptive pills will prevent a future pregnancy if you have taken the pills for seven days. After that, you can have unprotected sexual intercourse. So before that you have to use another form of contraception. Also, if you have had sexual intercourse not in your ovulatory day (that means at first day of your cycle), the possibility of a pregnancy is low. The urinary test has a high acurracy, if you perform that after a week of menstrual delay. I read that you have experienced a rupture ectopic pregnancy last year. The typical symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy are missed period, abdominal pain, cramps, and spotting. I recommend you a b-HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) blood test. You can repeat that every 48 hours to detect a future pregnancy. It will double its value in an intrauterine pregnancy, meanwhile, the rise of b-HCG value in an ectopic pregnancy has another pattern less than a normal pregnancy. Also, the COC and the medication that you take can affect your cycle. I would recommend b-HCG blood test at first. If you have the bleeding within your expected date without delay, it would be your cycle that has come."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A guy penetrates my vagina without protection and I do not know his status.

Consult orthopedic surgeon. Is there any issue with my health?","Doctor":"Hello. Your report does not show your laboratory test (attachment removed to protect patient identity). What we have in the abdominal ultrasound is that you have fatty liver. This is a common problem in patients with metabolic syndrome (overweight, high triglycerides, and low HDL, high blood pressure). This is why you are suggested to reduce body weight and have a low-calorie diet. The Thyronorm is prescribed whenever your thyroid hormones are low (this is called hypothyroidism and it a very common disease). I guess (since I do not know your laboratory results) this is what resulted from your tests. Also, when your thyroid hormones are low you usually gain weight, are constipated, and your triglycerides and cholesterol get higher than usual. You need to take the medication 75 mcg, at least 30 to 40 min before breakfast (in order to be absorbed well by your body), every day and recheck your blood thyroid hormones in 6 to 8 weeks (12 weeks is more than recommended in medical articles).

I suggest you check your blood sugar, complete hemogram and serum electrolytes (calcium, potassium, magnesium).

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I would like to have a second opening regarding my daughter's case. She is just 2 years old and she was having some seizures at night while asleep. For 10-15 days, we started to observe that she is having jerking movements, stiffening of the body, and sometimes teeth grinding for about 15-30 seconds. I am attaching her consultation and lab report for details.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, your two years baby has been suffering from seizure which lasts for 15-30 seconds. Anything that interrupts the normal connection between nerve cells in the brain can cause a seizure. This includes high fever, high or low blood sugar, drug withdrawal, or brain injury. There is various type of seizures like absence seizure, tonic-clonic seizure, atonic seizure, clonic seizure, tonic seizure, myoclonic seizure, etc. By CBC, EEG, and MRI of brain, we can detect the type of seizure and then treat them accordingly. As soon as you know your child is starting to have a seizure, you should gently try to get your baby in a position where your baby is safe. Stay with ur child. Do not put anything in your child's mouth. Do not try to stop or restrain the child's movement. Children often foam at the mouth during a seizure, wash that carefully."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having some weakness issue and pain in limbs. I am diabetic for the last five years. My current fasting blood glucose level is 200 and PP is 278. HbA1c is 8.5. Current medicines are Galvus Met 50/1000 twice daily. Diamicron XR 60 two tablets. Pioglit 30 once during dinner. Supradyne once before food.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the details given, including the laboratory reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your blood glucose (both fasting and PP) are high. Fasting is particularly much higher. HbA1c % is also fairly high, both these suggest there is improper control of diabetes. This itself can be the cause of weakness. Ideally in well-controlled diabetes fasting glucose should be <100 mg, PP 150 to 160 mg and HbA1c % < 6.8. Therefore, looking at this situation there is a need for upgrading the treatment with some additional drugs plus there has to be a closer look given to your diet and exercise schedule. So, I would like to know your diet pattern and extent of daily exercise being done. I suggest an addition of tablet Teneligliptin 20 mg plus Metformin daily once just after lunch. I am enclosing the prescription."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, There is pain near the lower back portion above the tailbone in the right side, little swelling too. There is no problem in walking but sometimes it pains too much on some jerk or stretch.","Doctor":"Hi. This seems like coccydynia, pain of coccyx bone or near to it. Did you have a fall on your tailbone a week back? Also, if you had lifted something heavy, this kind of pain may come to lower back and may get radiated to buttocks or lower. Do hot pack for 3 to 4 minutes and ice pack 1 to 2 minutes, at least two sessions in a day. If you have any local pain relief cream, please apply it locally. Those painkillers will not work for this pain. Let me know in five days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I removed IUD recently as I was not sexually active.

I took five tablets in the afternoon, another five tablets after eight hours and again five tablets after six hours. I got my last period before a month, and it was delayed for two days when I had unprotected sex. Can I have a chance to become pregnant even after taking Yasmin?","Doctor":"Hi.

I am taking antibiotic eye drops, prescribed yesterday by a general doctor. The drops are named Ofloxacin.","Doctor":"Hi. Good that you are taking antibiotics, in addition to it, take anti-inflammatory drops like Flurbiprofen eye drops.

I think he has rhinitis allergies. But I am not sure.","Doctor":"Hi. Please continue giving honey to the child as one tablespoon twice a day. You can also give the honey in warm milk to provide a soothing effect. You can give Panadol for the fever. However, with regards to the child falling ill recurrently with a cough, cold and fever, it seems more so like a hyperreactive airway disease. We may need to start the child on Montelukast for a few months and see the change."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 20-year-old woman. Today morning, when I woke up, I had an intense itching inside my vagina. I was unable to resist it and scratched it with my fingers inside. Now I am having a burning sensation in my vagina. The burning got reduced after I took a bath. But it is still burning very intensely. I have got my periods a few days back. I do not have periods now. I have never faced this issue. Is it something serious?","Doctor":"Hi. The most common cause of vaginal itching is due to a fungal infection. It usually gets reddish and irritated in and around the vagina. Sometimes a little white fluid is present. Often, it does not present with a foul smell. For this, there are several treatment options available. You can use Clotrimazole 2 % cream over the affected area daily for three days. You can also use Miconazole 4 % cream daily for three days. For the pain due to scratching, you can take a painkiller such as Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen and EMLA (Lidocaine with Prilocaine) cream. Apply it to the affected area for every four to six hours. Be careful of the scratches for two to three days. Maintain good hygiene with soap and water. Avoid having sex as you have scratches. It can increase the infection rate."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have the condition of enlargement of the prostate for the last over five years. I am 53 years old. I am taking capsule Urimax 40 mg once in a day and I am able to manage the condition. However, it seems that of late, my libido is negative and the sex life is absolutely zero. Though sex at this age is not important but sometimes for the sake of feeling that you are not 70 years male one desires to feel with a certain enthusiasm. So could you please let me know that whether the prostate enlargement and the Urimax is having a fallout on my libido and poor sex life? Is there any mild medicine for the treatment of this condition which is not having any side effect and is not habit forming and has no withdrawal symptoms if the medicine is discontinued after use?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. The symptoms of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), if severe can have a negative impact on the sexual drive of the person. The medication that you are currently taking, does not have any effect on libido but itself. That said the most likely reason in your case must be reduced testosterone levels, which can be checked. If reduced, you can be given supplemental testosterone. Also, if your symptoms of BPH are not very severe, there are medications that improve erectile function which are effective for early BPH as well. You can consult with your treating urologist for changing your medication and see if there is an improvement."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 24 years old and have been wearing glasses for myopia for six years.

Kindly advise. It takes more than two and a half hour to evacuate my bowels. I take a lot of water, papaya and do yoga exercises but constipation is unabated.","Doctor":"Hi. Chronic constipation needs laxatives and life style modification. Some of the people may not be able to tolerate lactulose. Do not worry. We have another kind of laxatives that will not produce gases. Take Peglec one packet (big one) in two liters of water over 3 to 4 hours. It will help to clear your intestine in one go.

At first, it was light but today I noticed that the bleeding seems more severe. It dripped a lot and covered the majority of the toilet paper. The stool itself was not red, just light brown and regular as always. I do not think I have any external cuts or wounds because I do not feel any pain or stinging sensation as I wipe. If it were an external wound, it would have healed by now. I have been wiping gently or dabbing to stop the bleeding. Although I feel fine (no external or internal pain), I am anxious and nervous about this development. My rectum does bulge out when I pass stools, so the obvious is hemorrhoids. But the bleeding seems like something from inside.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, I do agree, you are likely having bleeding from hemorrhoids. My recommendation for you will be: 1. Avoid constipation, take Ispaghol husk 2 tablespoons in a glass of water. Keep it for a good four hours and take it. 2. Take tablet Daflon (Flavonoid) 500 mg 1-0-1 for five days. Do not worry, it will settle. I hope this helps. Constipation, excessive straining, venous insufficiency, increased venous pressure. Hemorrhoids. Take plenty of water. Chew food well. Take a lot of vegetable and fruits."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I experienced bad cramping and heavy bleeding last month and it has been a month since then and now I have only experienced ovarian pain and brown discharge. I am not sure what this means.","Doctor":"Hello. As you mentioned, it is a known side effect of Depo shot to have irregular spotting or occasional bleeding too.

The present experience of heavy bleeding and cramps may not be related to your Depo shots, it may be due to some underlying cause. So, I would like to know why was Depo shot advised for you? Was it only for contraception (birth control) or was it for any complaints like excessive bleeding and cramps during your periods (which may indicate a process called endometriosis)? Irregular bleeding may indicate some underlying hormonal disturbances which need to be evaluated. I would also like to know if you have any recent weight gain, excess unwanted facial hair, acne problems, scalp hair loss, headaches, visual disturbances, etc.?

White blood cells are a type of blood cells which are majorly involved in fighting infection in the body and are usually increased in amounts when the body is fighting against an infection and occasionally in certain other conditions. Though 12,000 count is a definitely increased number, it need not be considered very high if there are no associated symptoms or any other medical history. But before that, we need to look into the differential count of white blood cells which means the percentage of various different kinds of white blood cells which are elevated in different kinds of infections and other values in your blood picture report. I need you to answer me questions regarding certain symptoms. Though white blood cells are increased in certain types of blood cancers, the numbers are usually higher than your value.

So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

No sugar in tea, no sugary juices ice cream or chocolates. Exercise at least 40 minutes daily even if it’s just a walk. If u will not change lifestyle no medication can control ur sugar. With the time ur all body can be then affected with diabetes. It’s a dietary disease and treatment is with diet only. Medication help when u change ur lifestyle. If ur planning to be pregnant u need to be on insulin and u need to have HBA1c less than 6.5. In pregnancy. U know where ur right now. I don’t think ur taking good drugs right now either. These will increase ur weight and that will lead u to have more sugar. Did u try glucophage before ? If yes why u had to stop. Did u try Sitagliptin? Jardiance is a good drug as well.

I have reviewed your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and here is my advise. Your platelet count is constantly reducing according to provided history.

Aspirin, Ibuprofen like drug intake also can lead to reduced platelet count. So history regarding intake of this drug should be taken. Your urea, creatinine is within range, so uremia is not the cause. I suggest you investigate with serum ANA estimation to rule out any autoimmune disorder if present. If still, no cause is evident, then platelet function analysis study can be done. If still needed than your doctor might suggest you bone marrow aspiration examination study to rule out ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura).  I suggest you consult a nearby hematologist for examination and discuss all these. Meanwhile, take the following precautions. Avoid intake of Aspirin and Ibuprofen without doctor advice.

Now, he is treated with fluid replacement, Doxycycline, Paracetomal, and tablet Ursocol.","Doctor":"Hi. Your friend appears to have severe dengue. Kindly do blood cultures for typhoid fever. Blood culture helps us to identify the presence of salmonella, and it guides the choice of antibiotic therapy. The petechiae can occur due to low platelet count. The bluish lips or cyanosis should be evaluated further. You have to do chest X-ray and arterial blood gas test soon. I suggest you do an holo-abdominal ultrasound and a plain abdominal X-ray. Elevation in liver function tests are seen in dengue or typhoid, and the liver can be enlarged in dengue. But intestinal perforation is the catastrophic complication of typhoid fever. I would recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation. If there is any sign of severe bleeding or unstable vital signs, a blood transfusion can be given with fresh whole blood or fresh packed red blood cells.

The bleed that you are confusing with your menses is likely to be darkish brown in color unlike normal menses and likely to be an implantation bleed post pregnancy.

Left is 10, 5, 15, 20, 25, 20 (air conduction), left is n/a, 10, 10, 20, 25, n/a (bone conduction). Right is 15, 10, 15, 15, 30, 15 (air conduction). So my direct questions are would you agree that this is a mild case of hearing loss and there should not be anything to worry about at this stage provided I look after my hearing and ensure I am not exposed to loud sounds too often? Is it likely that this will not worsen (excluding any age-related hearing loss as I get older)? Are my audiologist's comments that it may even reverse itself accurate? How severe is this level of hearing loss and what implications will it mean?","Doctor":"Hello. According to the reports indicated (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there is a dip at 4k which indicated a noise-induced hearing loss. Many people suggest that it is not a thing to be worried about, however, we cannot neglect it completely. There are various kinds of hearing loss having various reasons. In this kind of audiogram, it is clear that you have exposed yourself to loud sounds. Now as you have clarified you use headphones for 1 or 2 hours. Let me inform a headphone noise can have a different effect on different people. Some people are more susceptible to hearing loss. Check your work environment if it is noisy you may suffer from hearing loss too. It is not much likely to increase if you are careful. Your audiologist comments are not entirely accurate. The 4k dip is likely to reverse when the 4k area in the organ of corti get enough of blood supply to reverse the damage. The loss is not that severe which will affect your quality of life. But we need to be careful."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Bladder biopsy shows eosinophilic cystitis with prominent eosinophil infiltration in the lamina propria with a mild lymphomonocytic cell. Urothelium shows atrophic change.","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your post well. Eosinophilic cystitis has been mentioned in the case reports because of its rarety. No clinical trials have been conducted on the condition, it is treated with a course of steroids or NSAIDS and occasionally with resection of the lesion by either open or transurethral resection. Before starting any treatment you need to be investigated for any parasites. As a course of steroids for a week settles the symptoms that will help in confirming the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had a dull intermittent stinging pain in the lower right side of my stomach. I have had it for more than two weeks now. I am worried about appendicitis, kidney or ureter or bladder stone, hernia, abdominal aortic aneurysm.","Doctor":"Hello. There is no hernia (attachment removed to protect patient identity). However, there is a tiny appendicolith within the lumen of the appendix and the appendix is dilated approximately 10 mm in diameter. This could be due to subtle appendicitis. No evidence or renal or ureteric or vesical calculus disease seen. Rest of the solid organs appear normal."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 27 years old, 247 lb male. I have been having a problem with blood in stool for two years now. Sometimes, I have blood in stool for two or three days and sometimes goes away for months with no blood. For three months, I did not have blood in the stool. Now I started to drive a truck 12 to 14 hours a day sitting on the truck and I started having blood again. I am very scared. I may have colon cancer. My doctor did a blood test on me one month ago including vitamins and minerals and everything came back 100 %. I told her I am scared that I may have colon cancer she said no you do not and you do not need a colonoscopy. How does she know? I have blood in stool for two years now and not in normal shape.","Doctor":"Hi. See it is difficult to say what is the reason for blood in your stools. But definitely, this is not a normal thing. You could be having piles.Actually, piles are the most common cause of blood in stools. That is why your physician must have in general told you to relieve your stress. My recommendations would be to take a soft, and a blended diet. Take plenty of fluids. Make sure you do not strain during stools. If you still have the blood while you are not straining in stools and you are not constipated, you would definitely require a colonoscopy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

But we have a one and half-month-old baby girl who is continuing breastfeeding. Is that Zocef CV 500 safe for breastfeeding? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Though the low level of Cefuroxime (Zocef) is being secreted in breast milk and postulated possible side effects are a change of intestinal flora of the baby and may lead to diarrhea. But the prospective studies failed to show such kind of the side effects in the study population (there was no difference in cases and controls). Hence, this medication is considered safe in lactating women. And the lady should continue breastfeeding as usual.On the top, she should take antibiotics only if there is an indication."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been suffering from hormonal acne for almost nine years now. I do not have any other medical problems nor I am on any medications currently. I did some investigations to rule out what my problem is exactly, testosterone, DHEA, FSH, LH, progesterone, TFT, RBS and the results of all of them were within the normal range, except for prolactin that was slightly high. I could not do the DHT test. Am I hyperestrogenic? I do not know, but I can request for estradiol from my GP. I do not have the symptoms of excess estrogen though except for breast pain sometimes. I am breaking out 7 to 10 days prior to my periods each and every month, my periods are regular, so I thought that as in these days, the estrogen is the one which drops and the testosterone remain there and have a chance to cause more acne. I might be sensitive to testosterone? Although it is within the normal range as I have other symptoms of high testosterone like thick hair under my chin, on my chest, above my lips and hair shedding (I feel it is more than usual as I have thin hair) and of course oily skin. So that is why I was thinking of taking (Dim) for its anti-androgenic effects. Or shall I ask for Spironolactone? Will they prescribe it for me? Then is it better to check with a dermatologist or an endocrinologist?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that you have acne. Usually, it is not recommended to do estradiol test for acne. However, you can visit your gynecologist for ruling out polycystic ovarian syndrome because that can give rise to acne given the history you have mentioned. If your PCOS is controlled well by a gynecologist, then no need to take any anti-androgen drugs like Spironolactone. It is an off label prescription for acne anyways. Yes, a dermatologist will also be beneficial once your gynecologist takes care of issues as well for your hair fall and acne."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am an 18-year-old girl. Two weeks before I had an intercourse. From that day I started feeling pain when I urinate. I felt it is normal due to friction. But now the problem is getting worse.

I have to go to washroom frequently because drop by drop urine comes out and I feel severe pain. Can you mention what disease I have and possible treatment for that?","Doctor":"Hi. Seems like you have some vaginal or urinary infection which is causing the problem. Please get yourself checked by a gynecologist internally and get a vaginal swab test and complete urine examination. Avoid having sex till then. Wear cotton panties and loose lowers. Maintain personal hygiene and take plenty of fluids. Wash your private parts with normal tap water every time you use the washroom. Avoid using vaginal douches and creams. Do get back to me with reports so that I can guide you further.

My sugar and BP are normal. Testosterone 0.972 ng/ml, LH 2.09, FSH 1.38.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the reports and the reports are fine but the testosterone levels are low. This should be evaluated properly. If you are obese then high weight could be the cause of low levels. This might be contributing to poor erection. Testosterone injections are one option for improving the levels. You can talk with your doctor about that. Drugs like Sildenafil or Tadalafil can be used on SOS basis to improve the erection and can help you. Exercise daily and have healthy balanced food. Get your levels done again after a couple of months and this should come normally."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My periods were from 13 to 17th of this month. I had sex on 20th night with a condom but there was a time when it went inside me without a condom once for a second. I am wondering if that will result into pregnancy and if I should have a contraceptive pill. Also I was wondering if it was the safe period. Could you tell me if sex without condom immediately after end of periods is likely to result into pregnancy? I had taken a contraceptive pill last month so my period cycle had changed as per last month but it was a normal 28 to 30 days cycle.","Doctor":"Hi. The days of your menstrual cycle start counting at day one of menstruation. So, you were on day 8 that night. Fertile days are considered from 11 to 16th in a regular menstrual cycle (this means you always have your period every 28 to 32 days). You have a very low probability of being pregnant, but not a zero probability. My suggestion at this point is to wait for day 5 to 7 from the day you had your encounter to take a urine pregnancy test since right know it is not useful taking any medication such as the day after pill and doing a pregnancy test before day seven can be falsely negative."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Is there any problem if syrup Vitcofol is given along with syrup Zincovit to 1-year-old baby?","Doctor":"Hello. There is no harm in giving these both medications because both of them have a different mode of action but the important point to consider is that try to give one medicine at lunchtime and another one at dinner.

You can take sugar in its natural form (fruits), kindly avoid fruit juices (packed or fresh), eat the fruits in their natural form. If you are eating too much rice, you can try to reduce intake, but there is no need to avoid rice completely. Try to eat three portions of vegetables for one portion of rice in every meal. You can measure this out using cups. Drink lots of water to avoid confusing thirst signals for hunger. Exercise daily. Do whatever type of exercise you like walking, jogging, yoga, gym, aerobics, dance, any exercise is good. But do it for 45 minutes at a stretch for at least five days in a week. Eat lots of raw vegetables in the form of salads. Regulate meal times, eat at the same time every day. Finish dinner two hours before you sleep. Regulate sleep time.

Sore throat and lymph nodes: If they are less than 1 cm in diameter, hurt when you move them and are not growing, you could have had a viral infection. Another important thing here is to know if you have been having fever, night sweats or lost some weight. If you have one of these we might need some laboratory tests. Lower back pain: the most common cause of this is having a bad posture while working or studying. Another cause might be you lifted a heavy object or made an abnormal or quick move involving your back. For this you can take an analgesic with a muscle relaxant (for example Methocarbamol with Ibuprofen) three times a day for five days in a row. Weak feet: How long does this last in the morning? Seconds, minutes, hours? This may be caused by a lesion in you back. Let's see if it gets better with the treatment for back pain I just told you about. Fever, weight loss or night sweats? Infectious, allergic. Metocabamol 500 mg, Ibuprofen 400 mg, three times a day for five days. Observate lymph nodes since they should get smaller in less than a month. If symptoms continue or get worse we need to take a look at those nodes and the weakness on legs in order to decide if you need laboratory tests."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an 18-year-old medical student and I enjoy playing rugby at a high level. I have already ruptured my ACL twice on my left leg (twice reconstruction surgery) and I am now very sure I have ruptured my right ACL as well. Would it be possible for me to carry on playing rugby in the near future when I regain strength in my right leg and the swelling subsides, if I use a brace or strap it up when I train and play?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your concern. It will not be comfortable for you to play with an ACL brace if you have grade 3 ACL tear as twisting and turning will not be quick and comfortable to the level game demands. If you have kind of grade 2 then you can strengthen and then have a support and play (again depends on the level of involvement of the fibers, more than 50 % then you should consider surgical reconstruction option as you will always be at risk of progressing it to complete tear. In either case, start your rehabilitation exercises. Can use brace while training. There is a risk of loading certain areas of the joint leading to early bony erosion. It may not be a very good idea."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a doubt regarding the HIV rapid tests. I want to know whether the tests cover the O type and another rare type of antigen or they only cover M type. I underwent a RNA PCR, two Duo combo and two antibody tests after a risky exposure. All were non-reactive. What is haunting me is are the tests missing out any rare type? Do they even check for O type? Secondly, most testing kits as I saw on the net are using gp41and gp120 for the antigen. Is gp41 also common for O type or is it for M type only? How to rule out O type infection? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advise. As far as HIV infection is concerned, M strain variant of HIV1 is a common type. O subtype is very rare. However, let us move onto your question. Rapid diagnostic test and CMIA usually detect M strain of HIV effectively. However, depending on manufacture, a final comment can be given. But RT PCR usually detects all strain for HIV. Kindly mention after how much time of exposure you have investigated with RT PCR?

Three days later, her mother and I noticed that her right leg was not as active as the left one. Although she was not complaining from pain, it was very clear that she tried to avoid moving her right leg. She is 6.5 months old. We took her to the hospital and the doctor's first impression was that she is fine, but just in case she will do her an X-ray. The X-ray showed she has got a greenstick fracture in the femur bone, right above the knee. The orthopedic specialist in the hospital advised that a cast around both of her legs and her stomach to ensure maximum immobilization, and a general anesthesia must be done to her in order to do the cast. Kindly advise me according to the X-ray whether it is a must to put a full cast or a splint could be an option and is there a way to avoid the general anesthesia as she is only 6.5 months old or is it also a must to do a general anesthesia before doing the cast?","Doctor":"Hi. Your daughter has greenstick fracture of the distal femur. The cast which your doctor is asking to apply is hip spica. First of all, ideally hip spica should be applied under anesthesia to facilitate reduction of bone fragments but in this case, since no reduction is required, so no need to apply it under anesthesia. Secondly, since the fracture is around the knee, that is in the distal part of the femur bone, so a high above knee good cast will also do. No need to extend it to other leg and abdomen."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am male, 36 years old. I have eye powers 3.75 in my right eye and 2.75 in left eye both high cylinder.

In the morning, I can read without glasses but in the evening I cannot read even with glasses. There is a lot of strain in the eyes when I try to read the fine print. I did not have glasses till two years back. With my left eye, I can read the normal texts without glasses so I did not get it tested. I do not want to go for LASIK surgery because numbers are not stable. Please guide me by alternative treatment to reduce and stabilize prescription number.","Doctor":"Hi. By going through your query I could understand that you are not able to tolerate your glasses. Glasses even though they correct your vision, the muscle balance can be achieved only after a few weeks of adjustment. During this period the glasses are to be continuously worn even though that is causing discomfort. Eye drops HPMC (Hypromellose) can be used frequently as and when needed. Reading should be done under bright light. The minimum distance between eyes and book should be 33 cm for the eyes to be comfortable. I would be able to suggest the feasibility of contact lenses after I see your glasses prescription paper."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I was once prescribed Pari 10 mg, which did work to some extent but I discontinued it as it was making me feel drowsy and out of sorts. Can you recommend a fast-acting medicine which can be taken just before sex? A friend of mine told me to take Dapoxetine 60 mg, which I did one to two hours before sex and it really worked. Is it fine to continue the same as long as I take it like once or twice a week? I do not suffer from erectile dysfunction, but I hear that Dapoxetine with Cialis would really help my cause. So is it fine to take Dapoxetine 60 mg with Cialis, maybe couple of hours before sex? I will limit this to around once a week. I am 37 years old around 75 kg and 5'9''. I am generally in good health and fit. I do have cholesterol but do not take medicines, managing with exercise and diet.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your problem. Premature ejaculation is a common condition among many males even though they do not really seek advice. First of all please note that there is no such medication proven to correct it 100 % or to act quickly. Non-Drug therapy including behavioral techniques helps to overcome it in 90 % of cases. One such method is stop-start technique. In which you or preferably your partner should stimulate your genital organ and when you feel like ejaculating, stimulation should be stopped for about 30 seconds or the till the passing feeling disappears. This should be done on regular basis before sex. Another method is the Squeeze Technique. It works the same way as the start and stop method. But, when you feel like you are reaching ejaculation, you or your partner squeeze the head of your penis until you lose the erection. Repeat this a few times before ejaculating. Some males find that if they think of something else during sex they can last longer. Drugs including Dapoxetine blocks serotonin levels in the brain and known to be beneficial in some patients as you have already experienced. But these drugs have many troublesome side effects with long-term use like gastric disturbances, headaches, and poor sleep. There are common modifiable reasons for this problem. Psychological stress, performance anxiety about sex, depression, and relationship problems with the partner can result in this. Therefore try to identify any underlying cause for that. May I know whether you have multiple partners or a single? If you have multiple do you experience the same problem with all partners? Since you are otherwise healthy please be reassured that you do not have any significant problems with your sexual functions. This issue is fairly common in the society. If you are still experiencing after trying above behavioral techniques you may consult a consultant psychiatrist. But before that try to identify any psychological disturbances and try those behavioral techniques as drugs play a little role and cause unwanted side effects in the long run.

I have reviewed your query and can well understand your worries. Normal levels of testosterone range from 300 to 1200 mg/dL and can vary a bit with different laboratories. Yours is not that low but is on lower side for sure. Keeping in view all the symptoms you described, low-T can be suspected if not otherwise ruled out. Just for general knowledge, signs, and symptoms of low testosterone include a change in sleep patterns that may be insomnia or sleep pattern disturbances. Physical changes like increased body fat and reduced muscle mass or bulk. Sexual changes like reduced sexual desire, sexual dysfunction, or infertility. Emotional changes like decreased motivation, depression, lethargic. Worsening of sleep apnea if a patient already has it or if there are risk factors the patient will get sleep apnea possibly. Worsening of congestive heart failure in cardiac patients. Many of your symptoms overlap with low-T. You need further probing in this matter. Your treating physician would help you in this regard.

SSRI as a class has side effects of delayed ejaculation so this side effect is used here as a therapeutic one. I suggest you can either try Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, or Sertraline once a day.  Also, Dapoxetine can be used on an as and when required basis at least one hour before the sexual activity. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the above medicines.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My doctor has advised taking Adava stat F tablet to reduce cholesterol. I have type 2 diabetes and my cholesterol 175.6, triglycerides 297, and HDL 24.5. So, do I need to take this and how long I need to take? The doctor said only three months or lifelong.","Doctor":"Hi. We can say you have mix dyslipidemia with your results. This means you have a lipid disorder but at this point, you do not need medication. Medication for an increase in triglycerides should be taken when greater than 450 to 600 mg/dL or cholesterol LDL is greater than 130 and you have increased cardiovascular risk (which is not your case). DM (diabetes mellitus) 2 increases your heart risk so it is important you meet your goals of control. Treatment at this point includes exercise 30 min/day for five days per week with a low carbohydrate diet (150 to 200 g of carbohydrate per day). Follow up with new laboratory test (including HbA1c, fasting glucose, and new lipid profile). The other thing to consider is to check your blood pressure sporadically since this can also increase your cardiovascular risk."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 22 years old, 5.4 feet and 75 kg man suffering from a repeated urge to urinate in every one hour. This problem is occurring from childhood and is the same till date. No changes in this time interval.","Doctor":"Hello. You are having repeated urination problem. For that, you need to investigate as follows. Serum random blood sugar estimation to rule out diabetes, urine routine microscopic examination to rule out any infection, if present, ultrasonography pelvis to look interior of bladder and kidney, if no cause identified then urodynamic flow study can be done. You can consult a urologist for examination and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a heavy gas problem with heaviness on head and neck.

I got it removed, and then I got married. I have a child now. I am having pain in the left iliac fossa. It is diagnosed as follicular cyst and PID. What can I do now?","Doctor":"Hi. You have pain in the left iliac fossa, and it is diagnosed as PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) and follicular cyst. But several other issues can also cause this condition. It can be due to colitis or constipation. You should take your kind attention to this problem. You should take anti-inflammatory and anti-lipidemic treatment. Take Hyponid charak (Yashad bhasma with purified asphaltum) two tablets twice a day with warm water after meals. Take Yogaraja Guggulu (Yavani with Jeeraka) two tablets twice a day with warm water after meals. Take Prawalpanchamrita one tablet twice a day with warm water after meals. Take Sarivadyasava 15 ml (Sariva with Amla) twice a day with an equal amount of water after meals. Use Nirgundi oil for external application only. Have a check over your thyroid profile and go for USG (ultrasound) abdomen after following these medicines. You should avoid eating spicy foods and fried junk foods.

I am in my fourth month of pregnancy with TSH- 0.07, T4- 161, T3- 2.34. What are the complications with this? Is it good for me to take PTU.","Doctor":"Hi. Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is usually treated with Propylthiouracil 50-100 mg/day. Generally, treatment is withdrawn four weeks prior to delivery after which normal doses may be resumed. Your hormone levels are still very high, you need to increase your dose. Pregnancies complicated by uncontrolled hyperthyroidism may result in higher incidences of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), preterm labor, low birth-weight babies, or stillbirths. Complications of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia (a condition associated with hypertension, low blood platelet count, protein in the urine, and mental changes) may also occur. So please increase your dosage. Another thing I want to highlight is that you should do TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) receptor antibodies and to see what is the cause of your hyperthyroidism. Is it Graves’ disease. These antibodies can enter from the mother's blood to the baby's blood and stimulate the baby's thyroid gland. These antibodies should be measured in the mother during her second trimester of pregnancy because the values that are greater than five times normal have been associated with hyperthyroidism in the baby at birth."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My left eye developed a black wavy line that moves around every time I try to focus, at times obstructing my vision. After consulting a doctor and after an eye dilution test, she confirmed that bleeding had occurred in my eye around two weeks ago and the black line I could see was the blood that had spilled. She sent me to a retina doctor who said he had to inject me in the eye. He did not explain the reason why and was a bit unwelcoming to the point that he did not give me a chance to inquire. He prescribed two drugs (Maxidex sterile ophthalmic ointment) and Ceprolen-D eye, ear drops). I have been using these medications since I did not have money for the injection. I can see little improvement but I am afraid it is not cleared yet.All I want to inquire is, what could be wrong with me? I underwent many blood tests and passed them all. I have never been in accident. All I have had is little sensitivity to light. Also I had been working long hours in front of the computer without anti-glare glasses before my problem started. Do I need the injection or is there a medicine that is more appropriate? I am 21 years old..Please help me out. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi. You seem to have vasculitis which is inflammation of blood vessels in your eye which makes your blood vessels leaky. Injections of an anti-VEGF compound are indicated in this but before this, you need laser therapy in your eye along with a course of steroids. You need to undergo fundus fluorescein angiography to locate the area of leaky vessels and we have to laser it. You also need to get a blood investigation to rule out infections like tuberculosis. After that is ruled out, we have to start steroids. Anti-VEGF injections come after that. Kindly do not delay it if this process continues. The visual prognosis becomes poorer if not done in time. You may need surgery which would be more costly."},{"Patient":"Hi docor, Can I take Arjunarishta? I have high cholesterol and am using Rozavel 5 mg.","Doctor":"Hello sir, I just read your query. Arjunarishta is advised in conditions like high cholesterol level. As you have this problem, you can take it along with your current medicine. But keep some gap between your allopathic medicine and Arjunarishta. Arjunarishta is not advised in diabetic patients. So, if your sugar levels are controlled you can take it in the following dose. Take 10 ml of Arjunarishta with an equal amount of water two times a day after food for one month. Consult me or a nearby Ayurveda physician after one month regarding improvement and for further management. Hopefully, you will feel better results within a month. Poor eating habits and improper lifestyle. Lipid profile test after one month."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a problem with my shoulder. I have a pain between my shoulder and neck. I had treatment for it. It was good for three months. Again, I started to have pain between my shoulder. I do not know the reason. What to do?","Doctor":"Hi. You have soreness, and it triggers the trigger points. There is nothing to worry. Try to do a lot of icing and mild rolling with a foam roller in your neck and back. Once the pain gets reduced, try to do a lot of stretches for neck and chest muscles. Try to strengthen your neck muscles. Drink plenty of water."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 21-year-old male. I have hair fall problem for more than a year. When I am not taking a head bath a day, my hair becomes oily, and I start to have itching. How can I manage this condition?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The condition is known as androgenetic alopecia (AGA). It is also known as male pattern hair loss. It is genetic, and it occurs due to hormonal changes. It is a progressive condition. If you have a positive family history, then there can be a fast progression. Medications can control it. You can use topical Minoxidil 5 % solution. Apply one ml to the scalp in the morning after washing the scalp and apply one ml at night. It has long-term treatment. Take Androanagen (Biotin with Calcium pantothenate) tablet. It is a hair nutrient. Take one tablet in the morning after breakfast. Use Anaphase shampoo (Glyceryl laurate with Sodium laureth sulfate) to wash the scalp every day. Stop smoking if you have the habit. Nicotine decreases the blood supply to the hair roots. Do regular physical exercise every day for 40 minutes. It keeps the hormones under control. Take protein rich diet which includes egg, chicken, fish, milk, curd, and lentils. Hair is made up of a protein called keratin. So there is more requirement of protein in the diet. Wash your scalp every day. Do not use oil over your hair as you have sufficient oil in your scalp coming from the sebaceous glands of the scalp. Excess oil makes the scalp prone to dandruff."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My partner is 62 years old. She has diabetes. Her fasting sugar is 138 mg/dL, and PPBS is normal. Her TSH is usual at present. The HbA1c test is standard with 5.5 %. We did hemogram along with a sugar testing last week. It showed some aberration. The WBC was normal. Total WBC was marginally high. Her hemoglobin was 14.4 g/dL, and her hematocrit was normal. But the red cell distribution width was marginally high. Her platelet count was 164,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Her platelet distribution width, mean platelet volume, and platelet to large cell ratio were higher than normal. Her lipid profile was normal. She does not have any obvious abnormal symptoms. She takes Vysov-M 50 by 500 mg for diabetes and Thyrox 50 for thyroid.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The RBC (red blood cells) count is normal. The red cell distribution width indicates the variation in the size of the RBCs. It is usually seen in iron deficiency anemia where the RBCs become smaller in size. The hemoglobin is normal, and the elevation is only marginal. There is nothing to worry. The platelet distribution width indicates the variation in the size of the platelets. It is seen generally. Sometimes, the rate of production of platelets is accelerated in bone marrow, and it results in larger sized platelets in the blood. There is nothing to worry."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

These episodes definitely worsen around my period, so might a vitamin B supplement help? I am 35 years old. So far I have been managing this with breathing techniques, mindfulness, etc., but I really cannot carry on like this anymore. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. See, just because Prozac did not work for you, does not mean that you will not respond to other medicines. There are at least 15-20 types of antidepressants. Depression and anxiety are very common and a lot of people have it. It basically happens when some neurotransmitters such as serotonin reduce in your brain leading to a problem with handling the day to day stresses of life. Medicines are usually given for two to four months and then tapered off slowly and stopped. Things like St Johns wort, Eltroxin, etc., will only add to the effect of the primary antidepressant. It will never be a substitute for the medicines. Still, if you wish to try these, you can take St Johns wort twice a day, and also take L-Theanine 200 mg once or twice a day. L-Theanine is also an over the counter dietary supplement which shows good results for anxiety. If you have sleeping issues, you can take Melatonin 5 mg over the counter supplement at night. Yes, taking a probiotic compound along with Vitamin B will also help also.

Do I have the skin color due to drinking soda? How can I clear it? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have beautiful brown shade. There is no connection between a soda and skin color. But alcohol can increase the activity of sebaceous glands, and it makes the skin more oily. Your chest color is lighter than your face. It is normal as the face is always exposed more to sunlight when compared to the chest. You have seborrheic melanosis around your mouth. Seborrheic melanosis is due to excessive oil production from the sebaceous glands of the face. You can use topical Elidel 1 % cream (Pimecrolimus). Apply it to the dark area around the mouth at night. You can use a good sunscreen with SPF (sun protection factor) 50. Apply it to the face before 30 minutes when you are going out. Use Salicylic acid face wash to wash the excess oil present in the face."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have destructive behavior. I break things, and I kick them when I am in anger.

What is your best possible advice to get rid off allergic nasal polyp?","Doctor":"Hi. First, we need a clinical examination, radiology, and endoscopy. The treatment options are surgery and medical management along with environmental control. Surgery involves endoscopic sinus surgery, and medical management includes control of allergy and inflammation. It is necessary to find the allergen, and it is better to avoid it. It is the step followed under environmental control. Long-term allergy control involves immunotherapy.

Could I still be pregnant? Please let me know I am desperate for help.","Doctor":"Hello. If your prime concern is pregnancy alone, then you can get a serum beta hCG test done which is the gold standard and conclusive. If the hCG levels are less than 5 mIY then you are surely not pregnant and the delay of menses could be stress induced as in most women. You can then opt for a withdrawal bleed with Progesterones. The other most common causes of oligomenorrhoea are PCOS, hypothyroidism, and hyperprolactinemia. So you may get a hormonal profile to get these levels checked as well and an ultrasound pelvis to rule out polycystic ovaries which are again very common in young women."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have crooked teeth, four up and four down.

You may marry with girls concern. Deafness and mutism in the next generation are due to so many factors. So deafness of father should not be criteria for rejection of daughter for marriage.

Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

What can I do to get my mouth to open wider? I cannot eat a burger.","Doctor":"Hello. As per your query, I have gone through it and I came to a provisional diagnosis of trismus (inability to open mouth). This is the diagnosis based on your query and it may not be right. You just need to visit the dentist who removed your molars and you need to go through a clinical examination for your diagnosis. If this might be the case then you need to go through different type of physiotherapy exercises according to the severity of trismus. The cause for trismus is the injury to a muscle or muscle sheath. It is treatable. You need not worry about it. Physiotherapy exercise, heat therapy, muscle relaxant Benzodiazepine."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My HbA1c is around 6.0 %. Several years ago, it was used to be at 5.2 %. Can you recommend some supplements to reduce HbA1c?","Doctor":"Hi. HbA1c level (glycated hemoglobin) goes up when your body is unable to control glucose accurately and when the insulin sensitivity is low. You have not mentioned the treatment taken for diabetes. I assume that you are prediabetic and I am giving the following instructions. You have to change your lifestyle and diet. Or else you will become prone to diabetic. Please follow these instructions to increase the sensitivity to insulin and to decrease your HbA1c. Daily exercise improves your glycemic control and insulin resistance. You should do both strength training exercise and aerobic exercise. It helps you to reduce body fat and improves the skeletal muscle mass and strength. You should have a low GI (glycemic index) diet. You should focus on eating foods with a GI less than 55 and take fiber-rich foods such as apples, grapefruit, legumes, onions and garlic, dense, grainy bread and wholegrain cereals such as whole oats. Try to reduce taking sugary foods, processed foods, and concentrated carbohydrates. Take a fiber-rich diet. Consume soluble fiber at least 40 grams per day. Take good sources of soluble fibers such as vegetables, oats, whole grain rice and legumes. Dietary fibers are also beneficial. Reduce taking saturated fat and increase the consumption of omega 3 rich foods and monounsaturated foods. Eat antioxidant-rich foods containing vitamin B, vitamin C, and vitamin E. Eat foods that contain low GI, bioflavonoid and anthocyanin-rich foods such as blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, citrus fruits, and onion. Take cinnamon regularly in the diet. It helps to lower the postprandial glucose. Take 50 to 100 ml bitter melon juice containing 100-gram fruit in 100 ml. It reduces the fasting and postprandial glucose levels. Reduce taking tea and coffee. Instead, drink plenty of water. Tea and coffee inhibit the absorption of essential nutrients especially when consumed close to the meals. Take Chromium 200 microgram per day. It helps us to have glucose control. Take Magnesium 400 mg per day. Magnesium deficiency aggravates insulin resistance. Taking a good quantity of vitamins, minerals and antioxidant supplement provide essential micronutrients. Take omega 3 fish oil 1000 mg three times a day. Take vitamin E 500 IU daily. Take Alpha-lipoic acid 600 micrograms in divided doses."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How likely is a CAT scan to show a lung cancer if a pleural effusion is present? My husband has a pleural effusion and has had four CT scans, none of which show any suspicious mass. Cytology records are inconclusive. I am wondering if the presence of the pleural effusion limits the visibility of a potential tumor? What about in the presence of a middle lobe collapse, could that be hiding a tumor? He has right side pain, short of breath, and was admitted to hospital and fluid drained.","Doctor":"Hi. Detection of tumor on CAT (computed tomography) scan has nearly 85 to 90 percent efficacy which further increases to 95 percent in post-contrast studies. The pleasurable effusion can be due to numerous causes and in your case due to mucous plugging causing lung lobe collapse-tumor need to be the cause always so do not be apprehensive about that.

Current medications are Encorate Chrono 500 mg twice daily, Thyronorm 50 mg. Current problems are weight loss, severe hair fall, less appetite, weakness, not able to eat or smell non-veg items, no hunger.","Doctor":"Hi. The biopsy report and MRI findings are suggesting astrocytoma which is kind of cancerous brain tumor. Post operation MRI is showing that the tumor is not fully removed in surgery. That usually happens in these kinds of tumors because it is sometimes not possible to remove the whole tumor. Please consult with a good radiation oncologist to decide radiotherapy if not yet given. Hair loss is because of Encorate. Restoring the symptoms should be taken seriously and a repeat MRI should be considered after consulting with the neurosurgeon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 29-year-old male, weigh 90 kg, height is 182, non-smoker, non-alcohol drinker.

It occurs earlier in myopes or people using minus power glasses. They are a matter of concern only if you see a sudden shower of floaters.

Within a year, the plasmacytoma has progressed to MGUS which resulted in multiple myeloma with severe bone involvement. She got a heart attack at the onset of multiple myeloma. I know that deletion of 17p and mutations of TP53 are associated with worse prognosis. My mother has not undergone cytogenetic testing. My two sons carry a germline (not somatic) deletion of seven genes on 17p13.2. This deletion does not include TP53, but it includes MYBBP1A which is known to regulate TP53 and deletion. It is implicated in some cancers. If my mother has this deletion, what will be her treatment? She is getting ideal treatment for 17p deletion. She takes Velcade, Revlimid, and Dex with Zometa. Germline mutation makes an autologous transplant less likely to help. Can allogeneic transplantation help her? What does a germline mutation mean?","Doctor":"Hi. The advantage of allogeneic stem cell transplant is that the donor stem cells make their own immune cells. They help to destroy the cancer cells that remain after high-dose treatment. It is called as a graft-versus-cancer effect. Autologous stem cell transplant does not offer the benefits of graft versus tumor (GVL) effect when healthy donor cells attack cancer cells, and they do not carry the risk of transplantation rejection due to graft versus host reaction. They are relatively safe procedures, with low rates of complications and infections compared with allogeneic transplants. Deaths due to the transplant are approximately 2 % to 3 % in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma. In theory, one disadvantage of autologous stem cell transplant is that the transplant can potentially get contaminated with tumor cells when patient stem cells are used. However, recent studies indicate that this is not a significant problem and it is not a significant cause of myeloma relapse."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have body irritation and irritation in the penile area.

Also, my husband’s semen interferes with my pH balance and makes my vagina have a terrible smell. My husband has these knot-like bumps in his groin area. They appear to be raised or badly infected hair bumps or keloids. Similar bumps are seen around his beard towards the neck area. I am trying to conceive. Is this possible? I had undergone tests for STDs and those screening tests are all normal. I use deodorant right under my belly to try and control the irritating smell. I have also tried waxing or removing the hair in the pubic area, but nothing helps. I lose my bladder even after I just emptied it. I continue to get UTI and yeast infections. I have a pus pocket on my tonsils that stays infected. Another issue I am having is that I am overweight for my height. And I feel extremely tired and fatigue. I have been having headaches. My memory is also slipping away. Vitamin B12 is not helping. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. It looks like you are struggling with a lot of medical conditions. But the good news is that all of these are easily treatable. Do not worry. PCOS is treated depending on the symptoms. If you are overweight you need to stick to a diet plan, exercise and manage stress to keep this condition under check. It may be a good idea to check your thyroid and prolactin along with sugar and lipid levels. Anything that is prescribed to control your unwanted hair will interfere with pregnancy except Metformin which can help reduce weight, help you conceive and help reduce unwanted hair. Using deodorant directly on the pubic area is not safe. Every woman has a specific odor. You cannot completely take away that odor. For yeast infections, you need local creams/pessaries and if recurrent fungal infection persists, you may have to take oral antifungal medications. If your partner has similar symptoms, he needs treatment as well. Same applies to UTI (urinary tract infection). Your husband needs to get his groin and beard swellings checked. Attach photographs of the swelling for further follow up regarding the swellings. It is better to avoid sex until all these infections are completely cleared. Later on, you can use a water-basedlubricant for dryness of the vagina. UTI may be a reason for poor bladder control, so wait till the UTI is cleared. You can learn to do pelvic floor exercises for bladder control. If your periods are regular you can try for pregnancy naturally after three months. For tonsil infection, you need to take antibiotics.

An ultrasonography of the neck can be done to locate that. You should go back to the hospital and ask for an ultrasound. Are there any other symptoms like bad breath, excess or decreased saliva, dysphagia?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Bone marrow aspiration cytology was done for my father who is 77 years old and the report shows the presence of 11 percent of blast cells (about two months ago). Kindly advice the next line of management. His ninth chemotherapy was completed three months back. Now lab report is showing that his Hb is 6.5 gm percent and platelet 20,000. No chemotherapy was used after that but six units of blood were transfused till a week back. Rest of the parameters are within normal limits. Waiting for your kind response at the earliest for the second opinion. What to do? Whether we should restart Azacytidine and continue or take only supportive measures to increase the quality of life? Lab tests showed severe anemia with thrombocytopenia due to AML-M2.","Doctor":"Hello. You have not achieved complete remission from chemotherapy. Usually. complete remission can be considered only when blast cells in bone marrow are less than 5 % and platelet count more than one lakh. So, you can go for combination chemotherapy to achieve that target. After you achieve remission, consolidation chemotherapy also can be given. No doubt, chemotherapy has its own side effects but chemotherapy under observation can be given to achieve remission. Usually, the prognosis is good in AML M2. I suggest you consult hematooncologist for your detailed examination and treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Is it right to have unprotected sex without a condom? Can I take an emergency contraceptive pill after it?","Doctor":"Hi. An emergency pill is meant only for emergency and during accidental contacts. It should not be used for a routine purpose. It is better to go for a consistent method of contraception like condoms and oral contraceptive pills. Cyclical oral contraceptive pills have very less failure rate when compared to emergency pills. Emergency pills have high doses of hormones, and it causes delayed or irregular bleeding."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My brother has fever and pain in all the joints. All types of RA TEST showed a negative result, and ANTICCP is negative. He did a Widal test. The Widal test showed a positive result. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Your brother has a typhoid infection. He can take Ciplox 500 mg (Ciprofloxacin) twice a day, Rantac 150 mg before a meal and Multivitamin A to Z twice daily for 15 days. Take boiled water and light food which are easily digestible. Avoid eating raw vegetables. After 15 days, redo the Widal test again. If everything is normal, then stop taking antibiotics. But continue taking Multivitamin for three months. Follow the same diet plan for three months."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have periods for more than ten days. For a few days, I usually have light bleeding. It will be dark brown with a little hint of blood. I will have like this for eight to ten days. Then, I will have a heavy period until it stops. I usually have periods for 10 to 17 days. I will not have periods for two and a half weeks. I always have irregular periods nowadays. I had a miscarriage last year and after this, my periods have become irregular. What can I do now?","Doctor":"Hi. Ongoing through your history, you can have PCOD (polycystic ovaries). It is a congenital condition. It is genetical. You can get it from your parents. When you have a sudden gain in weight, the cholesterol is converted into estrogen hormone. When there is fat in the body more than average, it is converted to hormones. FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) stimulates follicle from the ovary. When the follicle is ready to ovulate, the FSH is suppressed by the estrogen hormone from the ovary. When the estrogen hormone comes from fat, the brain becomes confused, and the follicle growth stops at a smaller follicular size, and it will not rupture. On the next scan, you will see these follicles as polycystic ovaries. It is usually associated with obesity, irregular menstrual cycles, absence of periods for a few months and later there can be a heavy period with clots and fleshy masses or spotting on off and off. There can be a thyroid abnormality and prolactin problem indirectly. You will develop an extra pad of fat around the mid-segment of the body, especially in waist, thighs, and breast. There will be an absence of fat below elbows and knees. There will be an excessive hair growth, hair fall, a dark shade over the lower half of the face, acne, oily face, black skin over the back of the neck, inner thighs and undersurface of the breast. You may have a family history of diabetes. Regular ovulation will not occur during this problem, and you cannot get pregnant until it is treated. It increases the chance of early pregnancy abortions. But there is a solution. Your weight has to be weight (kilograms) = height (in centimeters) - 100. When you have a reduction of weight to normal range, then there is no requirement of medicines to get periods or to get pregnant, and pregnancy will be healthy. Avoid eating junk foods, fast foods, and red meat. Reduce taking snacks in between meals. Have a low-calorie diet with high proteins. Do regular exercise (especially for waist and hip area), aerobics, yoga, and brisk walking. Try to reduce two to four kilograms per month. When there is a loss of weight of five kilograms, you can see changes. You will not require medications and the problems during periods will resolve soon without medications. If you want to have regular periods till you reduce weight, you can have birth control pills cyclically from the first day of the periods for three to six cycles. It will regularize your hormones and periods."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been diagnosed with a herniated disc at L5-S1 and bulge at L4-L5. I have some lower back pain, but I also have pain in the groin area which seems to move also in the testicle. My question is, could the pain in the groin area and in testicles be caused by this herniated disc?","Doctor":"Hello. Well, the pain of L5-S1 disc herniation typically is pain on the backside of the thigh and radiates down to the leg on the outer aspect and to the foot. The nerves of the groin region are more below. But, as in your case, if the disc prolapse is big then it can also compress nerves of the groin region and can cause pain. Do you have any bladder issues or any numbness in your private parts?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best. For further queries consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My friend aged 30 had two drops of phenol mistaking for milk.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Please also tell about detecting condom breakage or leakage, as we could not find any visible hole in the condoms after intercourse. If anything serious, please suggest about taking I-pills as 72 hours are not yet completed.","Doctor":"Hello. It is not possible to say so early if one could be pregnant from your history. If you have doubts about condom breakage, I would advise considering an emergency contraceptive pill that is I-pill. The symptoms she has could be due to urinary tract infection. So she can get a urine analysis and culture to look for infection. Syrup Citralka (Disodium hydrogen citrate) and plenty of fluids."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is 77 years old and suffering some cardiac issues from the last 8 to 10 years. But recently he has faced some tremendous issue and admitted in the nursing home for thrice. He was suffering from a breathing issue. I am sharing all the latest report which I have received from the nursing home. The nursing doctor told me the different issue at a different time. Sometimes they told me there is a major heart failure and sometimes told there is an issue with high sugar (diabetic). Also, they told me that he was suffering from a bacterial infection. I am puzzled with their comments. Could you please help me and suggest an actual issue with my father?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The likely cause for his shortness of breath is heart failure only. However, the infection, high BP may precipitate this heart failure and leads to accumulation of fluid within lungs and shortness of breath. Also, elevated blood sugar is an incidental finding and will come to know on the blood test and will not cause shortness of breath directly. So, the infection may precipitate heart failure in susceptible patients. So, both infection and heart failure needs to be treated. For infection, he needs to be on antibiotics and for heart failure, he has to be on multiple medications including medicines which will increase urination. So, in the treatment chart which you have attached, the diuretics and beta blockers which are two important medicines in his case are not there, so need to discuss with the local doctor regarding these if not having. Also, antibiotic for infection is not mentioned so discuss regarding this if course is not completed.  Next thing, he should have an echo done to look for heart function if not done recently. He needs to have cardiologist consultation for assessment for angiography after his shortness of breath is resolved and an optimization of medicines. So, overall, the treatment he is having is fine but he will need some more medicines for heart failure or ECGabnormalities and will need an echo."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got my tonsils removed four days ago. I wanted to know if it is okay to smoke one cigarette and some weed.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to iciniq.com. No, you should not. It is just four days and healing takes at least 15 days. The area where the tonsils were there has to regrow the mucus lining and the lining should start functioning normally after a few days of growing. If you smoke cigarettes or weed the smoke will directly get adsorbed on the raw area making it vulnerable to bleeding, infection, pain, edema, swelling, and impaired healing. Smoke and weed will deposit soot and carbon particles which will delay healing and act as a nidus for infection. I strongly ask you to desist from doing those two and eat and drink healthy foods for a month until you are completely fine. Take abundant fluids. Take all the medicines prescribed by the doctor and follow up with him as per his instructions. Do ping me if you need any support."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My partner had phlegm with blood just now without coughing. He does not have chest pain and a fast heartbeat. Before a day, he also had a headache and hot temperature. Yesterday, he poked his nose with his finger at night. This morning, he had phlegm coming with a portion of blood. Does it require medical attention? Does spitting phlegm with blood is an alarming one? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. A possible diagnosis can be lung cancer. For it, your partner must be a smoker for 15 to 20 years or over 50 years so that he can spit blood continuously. If your partner does not have these conditions, then you must be calm. Respiratory tract infection can also be a cause for having phlegm with blood. A headache and fever will also support the diagnosis. Poking the nose with a finger can also be a cause for having phlegm with blood because blood can pass from the back of the nose to the pharynx. On considering the age, it is necessary to rule out malignant pathology. If the bleeding is not continuous, then there is no need to get tensed. In addition to bleeding, if your partner has a fever, headache, and cough, then respiratory tract infection will be a probable diagnosis. You can consult a family doctor for evaluation and treatment. If there is a continuation of bleeding and if your partner is a smoker, then it is necessary to do a chest X-ray."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have missed my period for this month. Last month my date was 29th and my cycle is usually 28 to 30 days. I am married and I had tried for pregnancy during my ovulation days.

Two days before there was some vaginal discharge of brownish color but there was no bleeding. I am not on any medications. I tried for pregnancy test today also but again it came out negative.

However, if you do not get your regular cycles even after one more week. Do check serum beta HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) blood test to rule out pregnancy, as some times false negatives can happen with urine tests. Such changes in the cycle pattern that you had mentioned can occur with hormonal imbalance, stress, weight gain, changes in diet and exercise pattern, anemia, hypothyroidism, etc. Hormonal. Serum beta HCG (if the normal cycle does not revert in a week). Hormonal.

It can be oral submucous fibrosis, fungal infection, and lichen planus. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your inner side of the cheek looks that you have a white lesion and due to that, you have all these symptoms. Please send a photograph with a mouth opening and measure the mouth opening with a scale from the edge of the central tooth to the lower edge of the central tooth. There is a need for having further information to initiate treatment. If it is a case of oral submucous fibrosis, you need to take it seriously. The other two conditions require treatment.

Sometimes, I have a sinus problem. Can I develop latex allergy if I use yoga mat made up of natural rubber material?","Doctor":"Hi. Allergy is genetically determined, and it can be identified by doing allergy testing. We cannot say whether you can develop an allergy or not. Even a skin prick test or a blood allergy profile can tell you whether you are sensitized to that particular allergen, or not and it is not confirmatory. Regarding the current allergies you have, dust allergy is a misconception. Anybody will sneeze when they inhale dust or polluted air. That is not an allergy. Sinus problem occurs due to allergy. Most common allergies occur due to pollens, house dust mites, and molds. Molds play an important role in allergy and chronic sinusitis patients."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Recently, I did a series of blood tests to check my pre-existing G6PD deficiency.

I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) level is low. But clinical correlation is needed in your case. I suggest you investigate with CBC, reticulocyte count estimation, and peripheral smear examination to check whether there is a presence of hemolysis or not. If there is no hemolytic episode, then there is no need to worry. In G6PD deficiency, you have to be alert when you have typhoid and pneumonia. It can lead to oxidative damage and can result in hemolysis. Drugs like Primaquine, Sulpha drugs, Aspirin, and Vitamin K analog should be avoided.

Whenever I put my finger in my ear to pop up my eardrum, my eardrum does not flexibly move at all. It is like it got stuck in one place. It does not move up and down when I put my finger. It is just fixed up in one place and the tinnitus has also gone bad. It vibrates really bad when anyone talks to me or I talk to anyone. I am so worried. Will my eardrum heal again?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, tympanic membrane is anchored to bone and does not move up and down but moves inward and outward because of sound. Secondly, it is placed 2.5 cm from external ear orifice and cannot be moved with a finger. Since you had a perforation two years back, it might not have healed at all. The other symptom you are talking about is tinnitus. It is possible to have in presence of a perforation. You should get the ear examined. Also, I would like to know if you have any discharge now."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 25 years old having 61 kg and 173 cm in height. How can I gain some weight?","Doctor":"Hi. You should focus on a balanced diet. Start having protein, carbohydrate-rich diet. You can take a banana shake in the morning. It will give you instant energy as well as help in weight gain. Start taking milk and milk products. You can have pulses, beans, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Apart from the exercise, you should be active physically. Go for a walk or do some exercise on daily basis to increase your stamina and muscle building. Thyroid test, CBC (complete blood count) test. Underweight."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am worried about my prostate. Urine stream is low. Often going to the toilet. Can feel pain in testicles after sex.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. Can you please confirm how old you are? You have mentioned your age to be 41 years. I am asking because 41 years is pretty early to develop prostate enlargement, although not impossible, it is definitely very rare to develop significant enlargement to cause symptoms at your age. That said it is possible to have some low-grade prostate infection that can possibly cause your symptoms. To find out, a prostate examination and urine analysis are necessary to confirm. Also, an ultrasound scan to measure the size of the prostate gland and a uroflowmetry to ascertain the speed of the urinary flow will give a complete picture. If it is due to prostate enlargement, then simple daily medication should be effective if you have had symptoms only for a short duration."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My girl is 10 months old. Her growth and development are very slow. The test showed elevated TSH level 164.23. Diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism. I am also hypothyroid but I have been taking my medication Eltroxin 25 mcg properly from the two years. Then why this happened to my daughter? Her development and weight throughout the pregnancy period were normal. Are there any chances of mental retardation or brain damage because hypothyroidism is diagnosed at age of 10 months? At the time of birth, she was healthy. No newborn screening was done by the hospital. Her birth weight was 3 kg 400 gm now she weighs only 5 kg 800 gm. Will she have to take medication throughout life?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query about your daughter's congenital hypothyroidism. I am sorry and I can empathize with you but at the same time, I would like to say that timely diagnosis in an infant for congenital hypothyroidism is very essential and your daughter was diagnosed early on before any damage occurred in the sense for growth and brain development.  Congenital hypothyroidism occurs due to an inborn error of metabolism and can be manifested anytime after birth. Yes, there should have been an at birth screening. Your hypothyroidism has only a transient effect to the developing fetus if you are already on treatment. Her weight is increasing so that is a good sign. As long as she is on treatment and at the correct dose then the child can grow normally without any brain development issues. These are the things which happen when the child goes undiagnosed. So please be positive. Your prime responsibility now should be at watching her growth and development. Just monitor the following signs at all times. Decreased activity, large anterior fontanelle, poor feeding, and weight gain, small stature or poor growth, jaundice, decreased stooling or constipation, hypotonia, hoarse cry. T4 (total or free T4) and TSH should be repeated 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of therapy, then every 1 to 3 months during the first year of life and every 2 to 4 months during the second and third years."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 27 years old female, weight 88.5 kg having a thyroid. I am not losing weight inspite of working out five days a week. This is making me frustrated. I really need help. I cannot see myself so stressed after working so hard. I have attached my medical reports here.","Doctor":"Hello. We went through your post, your main issue is excess weight. Weight reduction has two important components and both are necessary, and that are consuming fewer calories and burning more calories. If you are doing only one, nothing is going to happen. I would suggest you take only vegetarian diet that too low quantities and with minimal oil. You can add Orlistat 120 mg with each major meal like lunch and dinner. That will help further in accelerating weight loss. However, what you eat as your food is very important."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My age is 30 and unmarried. I suffer from a migraine for the past 16 years. At least one time per week, duration of more than 10 hours.","Doctor":"Hello. Noted you are having migraine problem many times. So, if you are having repeated migraine headache problem then prophylactic treatment for a migraine can be started. For prophylaxis Amitryptiline, Beta blocker, Topiramate, etc., drugs are available and one of them can be prescribed. Try to avoid loud noise and more sunlight exposure. Peppermint or flaxseed oil topical application can be beneficial. During an acute attack of a migraine, Rizatriptan 5 mg tablet can be taken."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father's age is 49 years. He feels burning in the chest after waking up at midnight. Waking up is normal as routine.","Doctor":"Hi. Your father can have a duodenal ulcer with acid reflux. I suggest Rabeprazole 20 mg OD for one to two weeks for that. Meanwhile, avoid gastric irritants like excess spicy foods, excess tea, coffee, stress, smoking, etc. Cooked oatmeal help in the soothing of the stomach. Include curd in your diet. If no improvement, then USG abdomen or endoscopy like investigation can be planned."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a cough and common cold for the past one week. After three days, I also had a fever, and I had sweating at night time. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. According to your complaints and history, I would recommend you start taking Antipyretics and Antitussive soon. If you do not have any recovery from a cough within a week, then you can do a sputum test and chest X-ray for further management. You can consult a general practitioner for a physical examination and start to have medications soon. Please monitor your weight too and notify it to your GP (general practitioner) if there is any change. Try to cover your mouth while coughing and stay in a well-ventilated area. Avoid going inside crowded places until you recover."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have mixed emotions. Sometimes I am overwhelmed with emotions. But sometimes I am entirely emotionless. I am unable to concentrate on my studies as I am extremely drained mentally. Nothing is making me feel better. If I feel better for some time, at the end of the day, I feel completely numb. I am sleeping a lot nowadays. I am unable to do my work. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your problem, and I can understand your concern. It can be due to mood disorder and depression. You need to consult a psychiatrist soon as depression can present with a sleep problem, a decrease in energy, numbness, unable to concentrate on work, and low mood. In such situations, taking SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) can help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My creatinine blood level is 0.98. It is normal. My age is 27, weight is 88. My urine output has also reduced.","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed your health query and can understand your concerns. Your creatinine levels are not abnormal in this laboratory result (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The results are from a reliable laboratory and show you have well within the normal range of creatinine levels. No issues diagnosed based on the lab results. But clinical correlation is also important here. You complained reduced urine output. There are a lot of reasons for that. The first thing you need to take care of is your daily fluid intake amount. If that is not up to the mark, improve that first. Take more vegetables and fruits and avoid meats and chicken. No fried and fast foods or junk calories. Avoid soft drinks. As far as your medication is concerned, Singulair has no side effect that may have affected your urine output. It is a safe medication to be taken for many reasons. If this does not help, please consult a local physician with the advantage of physical examination and proper evaluation. If needed, he may also refer you to a kidney doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The frequency of urination and thirst has increased from the last two to three days all of a sudden. Sometimes it is two to three times even in an hour. I am a 29-year-old male. I regularly do HIIT exercises two times a day.","Doctor":"Hello. As you described the complaints, you seemed convinced that it is due to HIIT (high-intensity interval training) only. But there could be many more factors associated with it. To know the cause and prescribing further treatment I need to evaluate your case better. How much is your daily fluid intake approximately and what is your regular dietary routine for your HIIT? Since when you are doing HIIT? Do you feel heat in the sole? Any difficulty in urination? Any symptoms of headache or any other condition? Let me know in the follow up about the above questions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am not normally anxious or depressed, married with a young daughter and a wife who is pregnant. It stared with an entire all day leg ache (left leg). Two days later my arm started to fell weird, tingles and biceps hurt. Since then (three weeks ago now) I have had the following symptoms. Numb or tingle fingers, feeling of weakness (but not actually weak), pain in hands, feeling of stiffness in fingers, lots of muscle twitches across body but mainly legs, feet, hands and arms, cramp type feeling in both big toes and calf muscles (not full on cramp), nausea and dull headache, dry throat, lump in front feeling, and a scratchy throat feeling. I keep looking for atrophy, though nobody thinks I have that. A sore skin feeling across my lower ribs and upper back like sunburn but without the burn, fatigue. I have seen three GP's. All three have said they think I am fine, they do not have worries and one said I do not have MND. I have had a complete blood test which had come back as normal. At my third GP appointment, I was tested for strength and reflexes. She could find nothing clinically wrong, no weakness but did mention some quite brisk reflexes but they were symmetrical. Is this normal? a referal was made, she said she does not think it is MND or anything bad basically. I was diagnosed with health anxiety two weeks ago and I am currently taking each day 50 mg Sertraline. Can you please confirm that the symptoms I mentioned are not MND or ALS related? That the twitches are nothing to worry about using your expertise? Confirm that the brisk reflexes on both sides (symmetrical) are nothing to worry about. That the type of cramp I am experiencing is not related to ALS or MND using your experience.","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms are not typical of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). You should know that at your age ALS is a very exceptional diagnosis. But there are also a lot of other conditions that may mimic this clinical situation. For this reason, I would recommend performing some tests. Complete blood count for anemia, blood electrolytes for possible imbalances, thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction, vitamin D levels and vitamin B12 levels for a possible deficiency, nerve conduction studies would help exclude ALS and calm your anxiety."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have acute pain and inflammation behind the neck and shoulder. Tingling pain in the left-hand finger and pain in the middle back and sometimes lower back. I am male, 27 years old.","Doctor":"Hi.

I have reviewed your query and can well understand how worried you are about this issue. And you are not alone in this respect. Most of the females come to their physician with the same complaint. I usually describe it as a naturalization phenomenon and it happens due to hormonal changes that take place just before and after ovulation. It is to prepare the body for ovulation and (if the female conceive) for the oncoming pregnancy. If symptoms are bearable, avoid taking any medications. If moderate, you may take Acetaminophen for symptomatic relief (as needed). If severe, take Ibuprofen 800 mg as needed. Your OBGYN physician may also assist you in this regard and if needed she may go for your physical examination and some investigations."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have teeth of yellowish color.

Gargle mouth after every meal."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I apologize for the long message, but I am a concerned mom. I have two sons (ages 3 and 5) and both of them and I have been experiencing chronic sinus or ear issues for the past several months. Their pediatrician has referred us to ENT since she does not know what it is. Both boys (and myself) have inflamed nasal swellings that block the nasal passages. We all have deviated septums. My 3-year-old has dog and cat allergy and is prescribed Nasocort and Zyrtec daily which are ineffective. The 5-year-old tested negative for all allergies. We use top line air purifiers throughout the house but are still experiencing severe symptoms. The boys had tonsillectomies, adenoidectomies tubes last year due to scale 4 with obstructive tonsils or adenoids. Nightly I have extracted sticky, firm clumps from behind the nasal swellings that only appear after massaging sinuses. They do not drain out on their own. Both boys ears are totally blocked. And my 5-year-old had dark brown fluid with strong foul odor leak out of one ear the other night. Both have recently been on Azithromycin (3 day doses of 5 ml per day) but symptoms have not improved. Not sure if any of the following are related, but all occured around the time symptoms began. My dad was at our house with a severe bronchial and sinus related illness and and also diagnosed with candida. We had also just been swimming in a lake. We live directly across from a large scale construction project that produces lots of dust that began around same time. My youngest had a recent staphylococcal infection on his arm treated topically with muciprocin. Any clues about what this could be and if it requires more immediate action vs. wait for ENT appointment?","Doctor":"Hi. Do not stop Zyrtec (Cetirizine) and nasal corticosteroid spray. The polluted environment around you can harm your children badly. I think that the black plug inside your son's ear is a fungal infection. You need a topical antifungal drop for five days, then the ENT specialist will wash it off, vacuum it. There is a great possibility that all of you have caught an infection from the old grandfather. I recommend immunotherapy for your children if the medical treatment does not help. I also advise you to send nasal smears for laboratory investigation (culture and sensitivity)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

For further information consult a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother has recently received a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. Here is a history of her: She had what we believed to be a nervous breakdown four years back. This was after a year of stress from a pending court case. After this breakdown, she displayed some psychotic symptoms. Would constantly go to the toilet to wash her hands. Had obsessive thoughts that were very strong. She was placed on an antipsychotic, sleeping aid Zoplicone and Lithium. After a month, she was stabilized and came home. The obsessive thinking continued but not so much in the form of compulsions. Over the next four years, she was quite up and down and tried to take her life a few times. One becoming close and ended up in an intensive scar. She had taken a large amount of Lithium and was taken off this and antipsychotics. After recovery, she became extremely maniac but obsessions disappeared and then went into a depression where the obsessions started again. Then she displayed some psychotic thinking around my father not to be trusted and would send her back to the initial mental hospital. We then managed to have her admitted to an OCD center. In here she very quickly declined and became very delusional. They then decided to test her for biological causes. They conducted neuropsychological testing and diagnosed the FTD. I have done a lot of reading on this condition and really have not noticed the majority of the symptoms and the way she is displaying in this institution is very similar to the previous occasion four years ago. She also had an MRI done 1.5 years ago due to some seizures and they did not find any issues on the frontal or temporal lobes. These findings were not reviewed by the neurologist that recently diagnosed the FTP. He was also unable to access any information from her first admission. Does this warrant a secondary opinion.","Doctor":"Hi. I read carefully your question and would explain that fronto-temporal diagnosis is a very challenging diagnosis, which is determined by the neuro-psychological tests and the progression of the disease. Sometimes, the radiological findings are not typical of this disorder, so I am not very surprised to learn that her MRI findings are not compatible with the diagnosis. Did she perform any MRI four years back? Some changes between the two MRI would help determine the diagnosis. Does she have memory problems or speech problems? Anyway, you should know that sometimes the first signs in frontotemporal dementia are just depression or psychosis. Memory problems or speech problems come next (in the next years). So, if there is a progression of the disease, the diagnosis of FTD would be more probable. Does she have any family history for dementia? If her symptoms are completely reversible from antidepressants or antipsychotic therapy, the diagnosis of FTD would not stand. So, there is not too much to be done, besides treat her symptoms and wait to see for possible further progression. Genetic test for FTD can be done too."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from severe ear pain in my left ear. Today is the third day and I cannot hear properly. It resulted due to pricking my ear.","Doctor":"Hi. After reading what your complaints are, I think two possibilities are there which can lead to the symptoms you are perceiving. It could be that you already had an underlying infection of the middle ear which can lead to an earache and pricking was incidental or that fiddling with ear may have lead to infection of the external ear canal which could lead to symptoms. I would like to know if you had a common cold and running nose or pharyngitis before an earache and decreased hearing appeared. Is there any discharge from the ear? Does moving your pinna cause any pain? In either cases, you need an antibiotic and analgesics. If you had any history of cold, you need decongestants as well.

I have reviewed your uploaded video carefully (attachment removed to protect patient identity). These movements do not look like spasms. They are related to a normal reflex of the children. From the other hand, spasms also cause extension in the neck. It is not seen in the video. You should know that having epileptic seizures along with infantile spasms are a part of a progressive encephalopathy, and they have a progressive worsening. If these movements become frequent, I would recommend consulting a neuropediatrician and performing EEG (electroencephalography)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been on Fluvoxamine 100 mg CR for the last two months for health anxiety issues.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 48 years old. I am experiencing weak erection and difficulty in sustaining the same. This condition was observed 10 years back. Also, there is premature ejaculation.

I also have varicose veins. I have had very frequent bleeding apart from the periods and am now on the third brand called Norgeston which has not helped to stop the bleeding. I have heard that taking a double dose for a month can help to contain the bleeding. Is that fine to do?","Doctor":"Hi. I have some additional questions for you: 1. How long have you been taking these POP (Progestin-only pills) contraceptive pills? If you just started to take the POP pills and your body is adapting to them, maybe increasing the dosage is an option but if you have been for more than three months with POP pills, I do not think you will get any improvement increasing the dosage.  2. I understand you have had these bleedings with all the three brand names. And what is the reason you had to change brand names? Which kind of secondary effects did you have? Names of the other pills you tried? 3. When you say bleeding, do you mean red blood like period or brownish spotting? Every day? Or randomly? This kind of bleeding or spotting may be due to many different reasons like the most likely reason is (as you suggested) that you are taking a low dose of Progesterone and if you increase the dosage (two pills a day for two weeks) probably you will get to control it. But we must have other reasons into account, such as a possible early pregnancy (and in this case we are talking about a thread of miscarriage). Please, have a urine pregnancy test done. Sometimes, (no need to worry, but need to verify) it is a polyp or a small fibroid inside the uterine cavity that may not respond to the hormonal control. In this case, my advice is to go to your Gynecologist, because she or he needs to do a vaginal scan to verify the uterine cavity. Sometimes it is another hormonal problem not related to your cycle (thyroid). That may produce this bleeding and if you doublé the Progesterone dosage, you will not get to reduce the bleeding."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I suffered from ringworm (tinea corporis) long back. I used Itraconazole 100 mg for two weeks. Now the same has appeared on buttocks. For this, what medicine needs to be used? If I use these tablets, will it cause any other side effects? The problem is like round shaped and it is spreading. This is the problem. Please suggest me medication.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your complaints and reviewed the attached photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are having tinea which is a superficial fungal infection of the skin. I would recommend you to take oral and topical antifungal medicines. I would recommend you to take capsule Itraconazole (capsule Onitraz) 100 mg twice daily and apply Luliconazole cream (Lulifin) cream on the affected areas once daily for four weeks. For itching, take tablet Levocetirizine 5 mg once or twice daily depending on the intensity of itching. These medicines will not cause any side effects. These are prescription drugs and should be taken under the supervision of the doctor. Also, keep the area dry and clean, wear loose-fitting cotton clothes, stay in the cool airy environment and avoid sharing of soaps and towel."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 21 years old.

You should eat foods with reduced calories. You should take fewer calories when compared to the calories burned through the exercise. Do a workout for 45 minutes every day. You should have a good sleep for seven to eight hours a day. Stop eating junk foods. Avoid drinking alcohol if you have the habit. Take a handful of nuts every day.

I am worried. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You had done endoscopy and colonoscopy for diarrhea. If there are no features of inflammatory bowel disease and if the biopsy report does not show features of gluten enteropathy, then there can be a possibility of having irritable bowel syndrome.

Now, I have started spotting and I am feeling extremely nauseous followed by cramps. Is it possible that I could be pregnant even though I took the pill? This is the fifth time I am using Escapelle within seven months.","Doctor":"Hi. The morning after pills are large dose Progesterone and they can cause irregularity or delay of periods. You have been taking it too frequently and it is not advisable. You should better use condoms as they protect not only against pregnancy but also prevent sexually transmitted diseases. The chances of getting pregnant are less in your case but still, you should go for a pregnancy test after two weeks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am very depressed.

PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease) may not always present with classic symptoms. Your condition is suggestive of PCOD. Just exercises daily. Do not gain weight. Cut down on carbohydrates. Also, daily Vitamin D 400 IU can be of some help. Otherwise, you have to take birth control pills which are basically hormones to regularize your cycles.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

The HSG (hysterosalpingogram) report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) shows that there is a left sided cornual block of the left fallopian tube but the right is patent, so pregnancy is possible, but that would depend on the ovarian side which ovulates.

He asked my father to urinate to check for urine retention. He checked my father, and there was no urine retention. He did not say anything afterward. Can it be a malignancy? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Benign prostate hyperplasia is a common problem that happens due to increasing age. Symptoms usually start with difficulty in urinating, repeated nighttime urination, and narrow stream. These symptoms can be managed with oral drugs. USG is not a test to detect malignancy, as it will recognize only the enlargement. There can be few signs like invasion or hypoechoic lesion that can point to malignancy. In such cases, we advise for PSA testing and prostate examination followed by a biopsy. Having PSA (prostate specific antigen) at high levels can point towards malignancy. You can do a PSA testing if there is a suspicion seen on USG.

My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out.

At the start, I took medicine for six months, then my period started becoming normal, with one week late or early. My weight reduced from 68 to 57 kg. Now, the problem is I got conceived three years back. Then I got an abortion at six weeks of my pregnancy as we both husband and wife were not ready for a baby at that time. It was medical abortion, and the thing is after having the complete dose first time, bleeding was not much. So, I took the medicine again within the second day of the first time. After that, I gradualy started gaining weight, headache, back pain, lower abdominal pain, etc. At present days, I am havng periods once in two months, food craving, lazynes, can lay whole day at bed doning nothing, sudden lower abdominal pain, back pain, head ache, mood swing. And my weight has reached to 72 kg. What can I do? Is it the side effect of the medicine?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? All these effects are due to PCOD. No medicine will cause this, at this young age of 25 years. Your laziness as you mentioned is creating all the problem. PCOD (polycystic ovaries), this is a congenital condition, I mean it is a genetically programmed, you get it from your parents. When you suddenly put on weight, this cholesterol is converted into estrogen hormone (if I may simulate, have you seen obese men developing breast and in young obese girls, who develop periods at a younger age? They all have high levels of estrogen hormone or female hormone). In your body too, when fat, which is a store for tomorrow, is more than normal, this is converted to a hormone which tips the balance between FSH (from the brain) and the ovarian hormone. FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) as the name suggests stimulates follicle from the ovary, but once the follicle is big enough to ovulate, the FSH is suppressed by the same estrogen hormone from the ovary. But when the same estrogen hormone is coming from fat, the brain gets confused and follicle growth stops early at a smaller follicle size and will not rupture. Next scan you will see all these follicles as polycystic ovaries.  This is usually associated with obesity, irregular cycles, no periods for a few months and later heavy periods with clots and fleshy masses, or spotting on and off. Thyroid abnormality and prolactin problem indirectly. You develop that extra-pad of fat around the mid-segment of the body, especially waist, thighs and breast, no fat beyond elbow and knees. Excessive body hair growth, hair fall, a dark shade over lower half of face, acne, oily face skin, the black skin over the back of the neck, inner thighs and under-surface of the breast. May have a family history of diabetes, especially the father or his family. This will not allow ovulation to occur at the time and so you cannot get pregnant, till treated. It also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. But this has a solution. Your weight has to be: Weight (in kg) = height (in cm)-100. Your expected weight is 61 to 65 kg. Once you reduce weight to normal range, you will not need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant and pregnancy will be healthy. To reduce weight, no fasting, no junk food or fast foods or red meat, reduce snacks between meals. Have low calories food, high proteins. Regular exercise (especially for the waist and hip area), aerobics , yoga, brisk walking (swing your hands well), try to reduce 2 to 4 kg per month. Do not hurry on weight reduction, it will be difficult to maintain. As soon as you reduce at least 5 kg, you will see changes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have high itching between thighs and genital organ.","Doctor":"Hello.

I was given Gulf Ferrous Sulphate compound tablets and Gulf Folic Acid 5 mg. I stopped taking them because they were making me sick. I felt like I was gonna pass out when I took them. I felt bloated and constipated. So I went to the pharmacy to buy my Iron supplements. I bought Ferofol 24 mg. Used it for about four months, and then I started feeling sick, feeling weak, nausea, leg pains, chest pains, feeling out of breath and had constant headaches. Woke up one day with severe chest pain, went to the hospital. I was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. I was put on a six months treatment. The doctor said I must not fall pregnant until I finish my treatment. I was also given contraceptives but I never used them. The doctor said the Iron supplements I was using had a small dose for someone who has anemia. Hence, my Iron levels dropped whilst taking them. I have been trying for a baby for the past few months. We have been using cycle tracker to track my most fertile days. But we do not seem to be winning. I have been having irregular periods. Two weeks before my periods, I was feeling pregnancy symptoms. I was feeling tired, had constant headaches, felt nausea, and lightheadedness. I thought either my iron levels were low or I was pregnant. Went to see a GP, took a pregnancy test that came out negative, but my pressure was high. Later, I had light red spotting for two days, then on the second, I started what appeared to be a normal period. Four days into my period,I passed out a big clot that appeared like a product. Before I passed out a big clot, I had severe cramps similar to the ones I had when I had a miscarriage. It felt like something was tearing inside, pressing against my uterus, also had back pain. After I passed out a clot, we saw a gynecologist. He said it is normal for blood to clot especially if it was late for a couple of days. I had an ultrasound, the gynecologist said everything was fine except my left vein was a bit swollen. He asked if I was peeing more than usual. I said yes and that I had difficulties sleeping on my sides and that my urine had bubbles and it was bright yellow. He said it could be a kidney infection. They gave me antibiotics and a drip. I have not got my period yet for this month. I do not know when it is gonna come. Am I not ovulating? Can a miscarriage cause infertility problems or is it the Iron supplements I am taking? I want to have a baby. What could be causing my period delays?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Miscarriage is not a usual reason for infertility, but anemia is definitely a cause. From your history I presume that the bleeding of periods is quite heavy, that could be the reason for anemia. If blood smear shows an iron deficiency anemia and you are feeling weakness with gastritis, you need to know the severity of anemia, by doing a Hb % and PCV (packed cell volume). If Hb is less than 8 g/dl, then it is better to have an iron sucrose infusion, based on the calculation. If anemia is severe, your gut wall will be edematous and iron absorption from tablets will be poor. In anemia, you will have anovulatory cycles (when you are anemic body will conserve energy and hormonal balance is lost, it will save blood by delaying periods). So, that is the reason for irregular periods, when the delay of periods occur, the inner lining of the uterus thickens and as it drops out, the pain due to dilatation of cervix will occur. Pain will be relieved as soon as the clot or the mass falls out. As long as you have anovulatory cycles, to maintain a good Hb, you will need Iron tablets, Vitamin B complex, Proteins, these three components are ingredients of hemoglobin. So to have a good fertility outcome, have anemia workup done and get it fully corrected with parenteral treatment. Kindly see if the following checklist of investigations is done:  Husband- Semen analysis at least two, done four weeks apart preferably in an infertility center (examination done by andrologist), blood sugars. Wife- Blood sugars, thyroid profile. Ultrasound scans to evaluate uterus, ovaries, and adnexa. Confirm tubal patency, most important- Tube is the connection between uterus and ovaries (the bridge where sperm meets the egg and forms a baby). This is in the size of hair follicle and cannot be seen on scans. Being such a small opening, the tube can get blocked easily. So, check with HSG (X-ray with dye), or SSG (scan with dye) or laparoscopy. If all this is done and found normal, nothing can stop a pregnancy with God's will. All the best."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is having a fever for the last five days, every evening about 102°F. Please check his reports and in the attachment and consult whatever we can do.

I had a miscarriage last year at my 16th week due to amniotic fluid leakage, the doctor could not tell the reason for it. And now I am pregnant again with 16 weeks too and this time my doctor suggested me to consider cervical suture as my cervix size is 26.9 mm and I really did not want to do it considering the risks.

Could you please kindly advise me on this?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to iclinq.com. Do not think twice. It is better you get a cervical stitch done. Considering your history and present cervical length, it would be better if you go for cervical suture. Obviously, as the gestation increases the cervical length would shorten up more. The cut off is 25 mm, so no point in waiting. Also, add weekly intramuscular Hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection 500 mg would quiesten the uterus without contractions until 32 weeks and it helps. Another thing is strict rest, avoid any strain like constipation, cough, sneeze, strenuous exercises, etc. Short cervix. Cervical stitch. Strict rest, avoid sitting positions, as it increases the pressure over internal os. When necessary."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

Her sugar profile was healthy throughout the pregnancy with Metformin. Now after pregnancy, she is taking Metformin 500 mg at night before dinner. Now her FBS and PPBS (post lunch) sugar are regular.

Women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. They are diagnosed at an earlier age with this condition. It is a state of insulin resistance. In post-pregnancy, she can have high blood sugar values, especially in post-meal up to six weeks and even up to 12 weeks. If she has a family history of diabetes type 2, she is at high risk of developing it too. In hormone imbalance state, the risk doubles. At this point, I would recommend taking Metformin 500 mg twice daily at least for three months. She should take a healthy diet with low starch and high protein. Doing exercise can also help to lose weight. Diet and exercise help a lot. Monitor blood sugar levels weekly thrice in the fasting period in the morning before breakfast, in post lunch and post-dinner or before bedtime.

I also sometimes feel pain on my face but my major problem is that if I use nasal sprays, I get well for 1 or 2 hours but then again I have breathing problems. I am also unable to understand if I have a right side deviated septum. So, why do I have difficulty in breathing from the left side and also if my left nose gets open my right side closes and if right opens left closes? Kindly help me, please.","Doctor":"Hello. Having read through your query, I can understand your concern. Patients with DNS can have nasal obstruction on both sides. First, because the septum can deviate in an S-shape giving rise to obstruction on both sides. Second, on the side opposite to DNS, there may be enlargement of another structure called Inferior turbinate secondary to DNS. This is called paradoxical obstruction. Third, excessive use of sprays can lead to mucosal atrophy or thinning and a subjective feeling of an obstruction. You may share your CT to guide me further. You should go for surgery. It is a minor procedure that can be done even under local anesthesia."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have pain in my upper wisdom teeth for the past one year. I had visited a dentist for a check-up. He did X-ray of my teeth and told me that food stuck between molar teeth and wisdom teeth is causing pain. So he advised me to remove wisdom teeth and filling process. But I am scared that upper teeth have a connection with brain and eyes. So, the process of teeth removal can harm my eyes and brain. Please advise me what I can do. If I do not remove my teeth, then what will be its side effect?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. This is a misconception that there is a direct connection between wisdom teeth to brain and eyes. There is no such relationship between the two. Wisdom teeth are vestigial and do not function if your other teeth are in good position. If you get it removed, there will be no problem to your eyes or brain.

I have taken JAK2 mutation test which is negative. What is this test for? I have erythromelalgia blood disorder. Is all this connected to cancer? I want to understand this test and doubts. Can you let me know?","Doctor":"Hello. Polycythemia vera is not exactly cancer. It comes under the group of diseases called myeloproliferative disorders. Basically, it is an uncontrolled proliferation of your blood cells. In polycythemia vera, your red blood cells increase in an uncontrolled way. Usually patient present with incidentally detected high hemoglobin or hematocrit on blood tests. It can cause a headache, blurring vision, pruritis, painful extremities. One characteristics finding is aquagenic pruritis that is itching induced while bathing with hot water. It is confirmed by doing JAK2 mutation and erythropoietin levels. About 90 to 95 % of cases of PV show this mutation. All these symptoms can be seen with secondary polycythemia which can be caused by many causes. Like tumors secreting erythropoietin (EPO), smoking, heart disease, abnormal hemoglobin. So if your EPO value is high, secondary causes need to be ruled out. As you have mentioned your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), fit the diagnosis of polycythemia. But JAK2 is negative. I would advise you to get EPO values, and if they are high, a detailed search for secondary causes should be done before labeling diagnosis as polycythemia vera or primary polycythemia. As JAK2 is negative, polycythemia cases are very rare. Till then, you can take antiplatelet and periodic phlebotomy to maintain a hematocrit of 42 or below."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a right ovarian cyst of 4 cm and left adnexal heterogeneous shadow of 6 cm.

Why do I cry frequently without a specific reason or trigger? How can we stop them? How to treat the problem?","Doctor":"Hi. Crying frequently without a trigger is always associated with psychological issues. For physical causes, it can be a chronic pain from a chronic inflammatory condition like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or physical weakness from a debilitating disease like cancer. There is some psychological or mental component associated with physical factors for causing this problem. It depends upon the individual's self-control and mental strength to stop the problem. Counseling can also help. It is better to get help from a psychiatrist when it gets worse or when it is affecting the daily routine."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Please explain about the things that are toxic to humans in their day to day life. How do they affect the health? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. Detergents contain hazardous chemicals that irritate the skin and cause eczema. Some individuals who are prone to allergy, also get contact dermatitis. They also cause damage to the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract when they are ingested. Detergents contain phenol. The skin absorbs them quickly, and they result in a renal and hepatic dysfunction for a long term. Perfumes or body sprays contain hazardous compounds. When they are inhaled, they irritate the delicate mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract, and they result in asthma and allergic rhinitis in some individuals. Certain compounds in perfumes can also cause a headache. Processed foods like sausages are harmful to the digestive system, and when they are ingested for an extended period, they result in colon cancer. Processed meats are said to be carcinogenic. Canned food also contain chemicals that are carcinogenic. Canned foods which are rich in fructose also cause hepatotoxicity. Foods rich in trans fat predispose to atherosclerosis. Air fresheners that contain artificial fragrance can irritate the eyes and cause inflammation. It can also cause asthma due to chronic inhalation of phthalates present in these compounds. These hazardous fumes when readily inhaled cause lung parenchymal diseases in the long term. Some may affect the reproductive functions also."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, How can we manage the symptom changes that happen during menopause?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Whenever I urinate I feel like there is a blockage that is preventing all the urine coming out at once. This requires me to wait for a long time and continue pushing the urine out and then at the end I am using my fingers to squeeze the urethra to get out the last. Even after all of that, there continues to be some dribbling of droplets. Also, sometimes after masturbating, I end up having to go every five minutes 5-10 times to let out a few more drops until it is all emptied out. This is something I have been struggling with for quite a while. I showed my doctor and he assigned an antibiotics course that did not make a difference. I suspect it has something to do with semen blocking the flow of urine but I am not sure and cannot find anything related on google. Any advice on this would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. Semen blocking the way cannot happen so this much thing is clear. Secondly, for how long you are having urinary symptoms you mention? Do you have any urinary complaints like frequency, urgency, poor stream, nocturia, dribbling, or burning micturation? Does your poor flow of urine settles or become somewhat better when you strain during micturation? I think it can be a stricture disease. Do you have any history of diabetes or hypertension or any medication taken? Which antibiotics did you take? Any history of catheterization or trauma to the penile region?"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, When I have the fever, can I take Cetirizine in the morning and then Paracetamol in the afternoon?","Doctor":"Hi. You mentioned that you have the fever. You can use Paracetamol. You can take it up to three times a day and can stop if your temperature comes down. Now, coming to Cetirizine, it is used for allergy, cold, etc. If you are having a flu type of fever, that is, fever with the cold or itchy throat, then yes you can use it along with the Paracetamol. I suggest you take both the medicines together. You can use Levocetirizine, which avoids sleepiness. Hence, you can be focused in your work.

I am 54 years old now with a height of 173 cm and weight 64 kg. Within two weeks, angioplasty was done for me in LAD (left anterior descending) coronary artery. After four years, I had undergone bypass surgery for four vessels. Every year, during the medical check-up, my TMT result was showing negative. This year also my TMT is negative and the report is as follows: Total exercise period was 12 minutes and achieved 88 % of maximum predicted heart rate with a calculated workload of 14.30 METs. There was no significant respiratory symptom related to exercise. The exercise was terminated due to fatigue and the achievement of target heart rate. The resting blood pressure and response to exercise were normal. Resting ECG was normal. Exercise ECG: ST depression during exercise 4 stage, ST level was -0.90 mm in V5. Maximum HR is 88 %. Maximum workload 14.30 METs and the conclusion is good exercise capacity and negative TMT. My other reports are EF as per echocardiogram is 55 %. Blood sugar and cholesterol reports are normal. My current medication is as follows. Tablet Nikoran 5 mg twice a day, tablet Tenolol 12.5 mg once a day at night, tablet Rosuvastatin 10 mg once in a day and tablet Clavix 75 mg once in a day. My problem is that I am getting pain and heaviness on the right side of my chest since 10 years after bypass surgery. Because of this, I am feeling shortness of breath and heaviness in the chest while walking. I consulted a heart specialist and gastroenterologist. Sonography, CT scan reports for chest and abdomen are normal. Colonoscopy and endoscopy reports are normal. During barium x-ray, reflux was detected. The gastroenterologist has prescribed me anti-reflux tablet Nexpro Fast 40 mg, which I have been taking since five years. I am very strict about consuming less oil, less fat and less sugar in my diet. My problem has come down but not got eliminated. One physician has advised me to go for angiography to rule out the right side pain and heaviness problem. But my cardiologist is not suggesting an angiography because of negative TMT report and said a right side chest problem is not related to the heart. What is your opinion? Could you please advise me what can I do now? What is the solution for this?","Doctor":"Hi. I read through your entire case history. You are lucky that you have a good cardiac output. Your EF (ejection fraction) is all right and as per your stress test, there is nothing going in opposite and your heart is still doing well. Frankly speaking, heaviness on the right side of the chest is not at all related to cardiac issues. In my personal experience, I have seen many patients who feel pain in the chest or heaviness after CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) or bypass or open heart surgery. The reason being opening of the chest during surgery. I am sure after checking your stress exercise and ECG, your heart is doing well. There is no ischemic zone responsible for your problem. This heaviness has nothing to do with your heart. Whenever we open the chest for surgery, we advise for chest physiotherapy. This is related to the bony cage of the chest and soon after some exercise or physiotherapy, you will be relieved from your problem. This is not a rare problem, because if once the chest is opened surgically, then the person has to suffer some kind of problems like heaviness of chest or pain in the chest or chest discomfort.

Considering you are obese, hypothyroid and still on supplementation, it indicates that serum insulin levels are high (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Hypothyroidism and anovulation could be a concern and you may be experiencing irregular menses. You need to get a follicular study done for a cycle to check if your ovaries are producing quality follicles and if they are ovulating by midcycle or not. This can be achieved by transvaginal ultrasound. I hope PCOD has already been ruled out, which can further deter your chances of fertility. You should reduce your weight and aim at 70 kg, else you may always try assisted techniques of ovulation induction if there is any problem with ovulation.

Does sinus infection be a reliable sign of pregnancy? Why does pregnancy trigger sinus issues in some women?","Doctor":"Hi. A lot of women have an increase in sinus congestion during pregnancy. It happens due to the increased level of estrogen during pregnancy which tends to cause vasodilation generally. Hence, they have improved blood flow through the nasal and sinus passages. It leads to symptoms such as runny or blocked nasal passages, congested sinuses, and even sinusitis. It is not a reliable sign of early pregnancy. This symptom comes along with other symptoms to indicate pregnancy. Some women who tend to have sinusitis may not be able to tell it.

Bowel habits of infants are as different as the infants themselves. Some babies go several times a day, while others go every few days or even less frequently. Also, breastfed babies usually poop more frequently than those who are formula fed. Finally, a baby’s stooling habits will change as their digestive system matures and their diet changes. Nothing to worry but if you observe sudden change, that is, he poops more than usual and passes looser, more watery stools than usual, then it is probably diarrhea. Please consult your pediatrician.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am also worried as dengue is spreading around my community and I would like to give him some medication which is preventive in nature. I would like to know what is the best medicine regime for my son to prevent dengue.","Doctor":"Hello. Eupatorium mother tincture is definitely a good choice of preventive remedy for dengue. You may give him 5 to 7 drops of this remedy mixed in half a cup of water once a day as a preventive medicine. If he has milder symptoms of fever or body ache then it can be taken twice a day. Gelsemium 200cc is another good remedy for dengue if he gets dull and drowsy during the fever. This remedy can be given twice a day for five days or until feels better. Kindly consider a general preventive measure for dengue like immediately consult a doctor for milder symptoms like fever. Take plenty of water, fluids and rest, rest under the bed net while you have a fever. Eat healthy and nutritious food. I am sure if you follow above steps he will less likely contract dengue.

I am a hypertensive patient, and I am taking Metosartan 50 in the morning. The blood pressure is under control. Recently, I started to have a walk in the morning. For a few days, I walked quickly for 15 minutes. After a few days, my heart rate got increased, and I felt weakness in my leg after having a walking for five to seven minutes. I did my ECG and ECHO recently. The results were completely normal. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems that you do not have stamina and endurance. Your muscles get tired due to the lack of stretch exercise. You need to start stretch exercise and cardio to gain more energy and endurance. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). With normal investigations, your heart is working regularly. Your body muscles are causing the problem. It is mandatory for you to do body stretching exercise and cardio exercise on a daily basis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have lost 5 kg in one year. I also have hair loss. I do not know the problem behind it. Please help me.","Doctor":"Keyword - Unexplained weight loss Hi. You are having a weight loss of five kilograms in one year. It can be due to anxiety, over-exercise, and due to less food intake than a requirement. You can rule out such common cause if it is present. If this is not the issue, then investigate with serum TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) estimation to rule out hyperthyroid. You can do test for HIV using Elisa, and fourth generation testing if it is suspected. You can do a chest X-ray to rule out any lung problem if it is present. Any chronic infection can also lead to weight loss. So provide your history if it is present. You can consult a physician for a physical examination."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have an itchy skin rash, and I have flaking of skin in the genital area. I have this problem for many years.

But we have to rule out other severe conditions like typhoid. Please mention whether you have any skin rash or bloody diarrhea. Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration.

It will help to stop diarrhea."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, How can we prevent tooth decay? Please explain about the toxic things that we use every day and say a few words regarding healing tonics.","Doctor":"Hi. Follow these steps to prevent tooth decay. Brush your teeth twice a day. Floss your teeth after each meal. Avoid eating sugary foods. Avoid having a tartar build up in the teeth. Avoid using artificial teeth whiteners. Take a vitamin-rich diet. The toxic things that we touch every day are detergents, dishwashing liquids, petrol, mobile devices, and laptops, body sprays, and perfumes, plastic containers, money (high germ content), and nonstick pans. Healing tonics are polluted with various kinds of pathogenic organisms. They transmit diseases such as leptospirosis, typhoid, and schistosomiasis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Is it safe to do strength training for osteoporosis? Does strength training improve the bone mineral density? What type of exercise or movement are good for osteoporosis? Which one has to be avoided, and why? What are the signs and symptoms seen in osteoporosis? When it has to be diagnosed in everyone?","Doctor":"Hi. Strength training is not safe, and it is highly recommended in osteoporosis. It helps to increase the bone mineral density. Do workouts that keep the spine straight such as squatting. Try to strengthen your back muscles. Have workouts on your hip and spine. Do cardio exercise along with these workouts. Have a regular walking. You have to avoid activity that involves the bending of the spine. Avoid doing the heavy lifting. Osteoporosis has to be screened in persons who reach menopause, persons having a history of fracture frequently after 40 years of age and persons with family history. Individuals having back pain, pain in the knee joint, and having fractures frequently has to be screened for osteoporosis. It has to be tested for men above 60 years of age and women above 45 years of age."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, The lightning crotch is a pain that shoots to the pelvis during pregnancy. Does it affect the baby during pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi. No, the pain is felt only by the mother, and it does not affect the baby. As the baby grows, the gravid uterus puts pressure on the lower limbs and nerves causing shooting pain. The baby is always comfortable, and it is well protected within the uterus."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What is raw water and how is it different from the tap, spring, and other types of water? What are the perceived benefits and dangers of drinking raw water? When did this fad start? Have you ever seen a patient getting sick by drinking raw water?","Doctor":"Hi. Raw water consumption has become quite a thing recently, particularly in certain parts of the united states and among people depending on or advocating alternative or herbal medicine. It is unprocessed and totally natural water so it is high in salt contents and other constituents that prevent or slow down cellular aging, however this is just theoretical with no published results. It differs from filtered water and spring water in its high salt contents and silica and lacking chlorine and fluoride which are usually found in processed water. Also, the main difference is that it contains many pathogenic organisms ranging from bacteria to parasites causing various diseases and serious infections some of which are life-threatening. Namely, typhoid and paratyphoid fever, leptospirosis, shigellosis, schistosomiasis, cholera, amoebiasis, etc. I have heard of many cases of raw water making people sick. Cases of typhoid, amoebiasis, and cholera which are water borne diseases are quite prevalent in some areas."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I stood on a rat's blood that my assistant killed about half an hour after the incident. It was hit on the head so I presume there was some saliva in the blood, I was obviously bare-footed and have no open sores on my feet but do have cracked heels. Is there any way I could have contracted rabies if the animal had been rabid?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand that you are worried but the chances of you contracting rabies from a pool of blood while may or may not have saliva of a bat which might or might not have been rabid are quite slim. However, if your heels are cracked enough to have caused an opening in the skin then I think you could get a rabies vaccine course, just to be on the safe side assuming that the bat was stray. Do not be scared as the sole is far away from the brain so, in the unlikely case of the virus being there, it is still not too late to get the vaccine."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

Do partial erection occurs only during intercourse or during masturbation? Are you able to insert during intercourse or that is also not possible? Do you have any history of diabetes or hypertension? Are you a smoker or alcoholic?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can you have sex after a heart attack?","Doctor":"Hello. This is a very common question among heart attack patients. I would explain that there is not a specific time to return to your sexual life after a heart attack. It depends on the individual basis of physical activity. It is usually recommended to start sexual intercourse when the patient is also able to perform a moderate physical activity (climbing a pair of stairs, walking 100 meters, etc.). An exercise cardiac stress test can be performed, just to be sure that the patient can afford to perform a moderate physical activity."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How HIT exercise can boost your mood?","Doctor":"Hi. I am sure a lot of people are aware of the neurotransmitter serotonin which is directly linked to mood changes. A decrease in the amount of serotonin in the body can lead to depression and low mood. When talking about exercise to boost your mood, it is thereby wise to focus on the ones that raise your blood serotonin levels significantly. Running and yoga are the best ways to do that and if you cannot or unable to do either of these, you can try jogging or brisk walking, particularly in the early morning and preferably with surrounding greenery. Bicycling, one can take this up simply as a means of transport too and boost one's mood. Stretch exercises, treadmill if you want to keep to the gym. Any of these can be done multiple times a day in short bursts, and prove to be significantly effective according to various studies."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 29 years old male, 5'7\\", 235 lbs. I am suffering from SVT, degenerative disc L4 to S1, ulcerative colitis. Have undergone appendectomy (more than 10 years ago), tonsillectomy (more than 10 years ago), cholecystectomy (three years back). Medicines I am taking are Lopressor 50 mg twice daily, Norco 10 mg (as needed), Bentyl 20 mg. For the last three days, I have been having severe abdominal pain. Similar pain as when I had gallbladder attacks. Started out as come and go thing. But all day has been constant. I had also been vomiting. At least six times today. Not able to keep any medicines down or food or liquids. For the last few hours now I have been having episodes of SVT. Not lasting longer than 20 minutes and the maximum rate was 210. However, I have been able to vagal down each time. I am currently at the normal rate but my BP is high (176/110). Can my abdominal pain throw me into SVT? I have not had an episode like this in quite a while. Usually well controlled. Mostly my concern is with the abdominal pain as this is very painful and becoming intolerable.","Doctor":"Hi. Your symptoms are most likely a classic case of post cholesystectomy syndrome which occurs roughly after two years post cholecystectomy, like your case. This can be dealt with by dietary modification like fat-restricted diet and oral ursodeoxycholic acid if there are persisting stones. An abdominal ultrasound can identify it. Hepatitis could also be a possibility so do not take Aspirin or any NSAIDs. Antispasmodics can help with the pain. As for SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), anything can set off an attack like stress, exertion. So, in your case, the severity of the pain could be causing it. You need to get both your heart rate and blood pressure down as soon as possible. You might need injection Adenosine. Take an antispasmodic for the right quadrant pain. I understand all these medications require a prescription.  Upper abdominal ultrasound. Acute hepatitis. Postcholecystectomy syndrome with supraventricular tachycardia. Prescription drugs like a beta blocker or Adenosine, antispasmodic for pain relief, Ursodeoxycholic acid if microlithiasis. Avoid fatty food."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had sex about three months ago but the body has been feeling strange lately. My partner is negative. This is how my symptoms started. It was one day in school two months back where I just could not sit down because of my lower back pain and would go away about two days later and notice everytime I get out of the bed, I would have back pain in the spine area. I would say after that started going on, about two weeks later my tongue and fever popped up on my lip and form a white clear blister popped out and noticed my tongue got white and all my lymph nodes started to swell. The next day I felt my arms burn on and off and the right side of my groin throbbing but you can see it swollen there. I went to the first aid and they said it is an upper yeast infection and then I went to another and they said it could be cancer or HIV symptoms because of the white tongue and blisters in my throat. So I panicked and went to the hospital and they ran for HIV and it came back negative. I have to include that I took an OraQuick test for HIV and it came back negative. She came and told me that I had a viral infection and to drink plenty of water. Now, today I went to the health department for a full STD test of everthing for that as well. However, my result was fine and I had night sweats when I started taking medicine. And now that some of my lymph nodes are there on my left side of my neck and armpit, and the right side of my groin is throbbing but does not appear to be swollen. My mouth is tingling because of HSV1 and my finger are throbbing or jumpy but painless and sometimes become stiff.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, you have to acknowledge that your STD tests and HIV OraQuick are negative so that there is nothing serious. You are 26 and if the whitish lesions were not there prior to sex then we can rule out cancer too. You are not in a high-risk age and cancerous lesion does not appear all of sudden. HIV has been ruled out already. The test came negative and your partner is safe too. The enlarged lymph nodes could occur even in candida infection too. Rest of the symptoms you have could be explained by active febrile illness most likely viral. You should get your CBC or complete hemogram done again. This will help in finding out infection. Continue to take anti inflammatory drugs for symptomatic relief. Tingling could be partially due to anxiety."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am turning 40 in a few days. For the past two months, I have been having gas or burning sensation, etc. Three weeks ago, I noticed some black specs but could not tell whether it was blood, so went to a local gastro clinic. We did a series of test endoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, blood test, stool test. All were normal. However, while doing the abdominal ultrasound, there was an observation on the prostate. Prostate was normal in size and echotexture. Tiny cyst measuring 3X2 mm seen in the midline. No free fluid noted. The overall impression is abdomen: no sonological abnormality detected, pelvis: tiny midline prostate cyst. I just wanted to know what can I do about the prostate cyst observation.","Doctor":"Hi. The prostatic cyst is a fluid-filled bubble in the prostate which is usually harmless and present since birth but becomes detectable in adulthood. You should not worry about it. If you have urinary problems, you can contact again."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My eyes have become smaller over the years. It did not happen all of a sudden. They have become smaller for a few years. I use the laptop for more than 10 hours a day. Does the problem occur due to increased use of a computer? Do I need to wear anti-glare or blue cut lenses? I am taking tablets for the thyroid problem for the past four years.","Doctor":"Hi. You can share a close picture of your eyes. You might have drooping of eyelids which is known as ptosis. It gives an appearance of eyes getting smaller. When you are using a computer regularly, kindly follow these instructions. Display of your screen should have a good resolution. The height of the screen should be below the eye level. Move your eyes from the screen for every 20 minutes and gaze at an object as far as possible for 20 seconds and then get back to work. Blink your eyes for at least 15 to 20 times per minute. Whenever you click the mouse, try to blink. Take a break for every 45 minutes. Instill refresh tears eye drop to the eyes for four to six times a day. When your eyes feel tired, light your room. The light should come from behind your head, and it should not be in front of you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am pregnant. My exterior vagina is itchy. It is itchy in the clitoral hood. I do not have bumps, discharge, and pain. I had a vaginal checkup, and all the STD testing was done at the beginning of the pregnancy. The results came fine.","Doctor":"Hi. From your history, I can see you are slightly overweight. It increases your body sweat, and pregnancy increases the body secretions. Usually, the areas around the vagina are wet with sweat, sebaceous gland secretions and due to the water, we use locally. These factors allow the growth of fungus locally. These result in causing these symptoms. Use cotton undergarments. Use local wash like V wash (Lactic acid with Tea tree oil) locally twice a day. Apply local ointment like Candid B (Beclomethasone with Clotrimazole) twice a day for one week. Do not use undergarments at bedtime."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a diagnosis of disc herniation. I have done an MRI. I have severe pain in the left leg. I have this problem for the past two months. It got started before four months when I lifted a heavy box. I have a sharp pain. After two months, it became normal. After a month, it came back suddenly. I have sent you the photos of the disc.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Yes, you have a large paracentral disc prolapse on the left side. I cannot say about the level involved as you have not sent a sagittal section. If you have the symptoms matching with the level of the disc, then you have to wait for at least six weeks for the disc to have a shrinkage. If there is no improvement or if you are having motor weakness or bowel or bladder disturbance, then these are the indicators for the surgery rather than having a conservative treatment. A decision to have surgery should be taken by yourself along with the advice of the clinical examiner."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a bladder leakage at night. I tested my urine. It was fine. I do not have urine leakage during the daytime. I had this problem before five months. My urologist gave me Nocitva nose spray. I have read that using Noctiva can lower the sodium present in the body. I tested my sodium level before eight months. It was 142 mEq/L. Do I need to check my sodium level now? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, using Noctiva nasal spray (Desmopressin acetate) can cause a decrease in sodium levels in the blood. The risk is small, and it usually happens within the first month. Then your body starts coping with it. Generally, we measure the sodium levels just before starting the drug, a week after starting the medication and a month after taking the drug. If we find the levels in a stable condition, then we repeat them once in six months. In your case, as you have started the medication, I would advise you to get a sodium level now and a couple of weeks later. If they are normal, then you can get it done for every six months. It is just a precaution to monitor these levels, as the actual risk of developing low sodium levels is less than 10 %."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 22 years old and I have two children. No health issues. Around four months ago, I had sharp stabbing pains in my pelvic area, foul odor discharge, irregular bleeding, yellow or brown vaginal discharge. I am in my second year of being on the contraception implant Nexplanon. Due to my age, the local doctor could not help and said I needed to go to a sexual health clinic so I did. They said I had BV (bacterial vaginosis) and gave me antibiotics. I still have bad smelly discharge even four months later. But my main concern is I was going to the toilet and as I wiped I felt a lump in the middle of my vulva. I asked my husband to have a look he said it looks like a skin tag. It is connected via the side of my vulva skin and around that area is different shades of color and it slightly hangs.","Doctor":"Hi. Do you have any other medical health issue or have been on medications? It is better to have a complete check and treatment if any health issue you have. Regarding discharge, it should be checked in the laboratory by sending a high vaginal swab to check which organism is causing smell and irritation. So, for vaginal discharge, you should have a high vaginal swab and its report needs to be checked here or with a local gynecologist doctor or even you can discuss with infectious control to get specific treatment, if needed. After collection of the swab, have tablet Metronidazole 400 mg eight hourly and tablet Doxycycline 100 mg 12 hourly for 14 days. After swab result, it might be possible that you need specific treatment as well or need to investigate and treat your partner as well. For lump at the vulva, it would be better if you would send me a picture of the issue. If it is lump hanging or coming out or seems to move out at coughing, the pressure or at abdominal stress, then it could be prolapse like cystocele, at rectum rectocele or urethrocele might be due to tissue weakness or increased intraabdominal pressure or difficult delivery. The skin over it could be different due to local friction even could be inflamed and bleed as well. If just small skin tags are hanging, those could be warts that is the infection actually. Any local cyst or abscess could be likely related to Bartholin gland that also needs to be treated. It is better to have one local examination at the time of collection of swab by the gynecologist. The skin tags or skin scrapping could be sent if it is wart like thing to confirm causative organism. In case of lump that could be cystocele, rectocele or urethrocele, and needs to be graded as in some cases, it needs exercises, vaginal pessary or even more advancd surgery.  Have a strict hygiene. Wear soft comfortable undergarments. Use condoms to prevent transmission of sexually transmitted infection. Sitz bath can be tried. Avoid local cosmetics. Use a soft blade to clean hair."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The right part of my body feels tighter that the left. I feel pain in my right calf and thigh when I wear trousers and in my right underarm when I wear a shirt. What can I do to solve this?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. I need to know more about your symptoms. When and how does it start? Is it increasing day by day or it is the same? Is it associated with any pain or muscle ache? Is it aggravated by activity? Are there any diurnal variations? Is there any back pain or neck pain? Any numbness or loss of sensation? How about urination? Any history of trauma or headache? The most common cause of stiffness on one side of the body is muscle rigidity, also known as muscle tension, which can result in muscle pain. It is characterized by the inability of the muscles to relax normally. We are worried about unilateral stiffness. It could be due to spinal cord or brain-related conditions such as minor stroke or multiple sclerosis, spine injury, etc. For the same you need evaluation, I suggest you should consult your physician. Symptomatic relief includes physiotherapy, isometric exercise, and stretching will help. You also can use hot fomentation or massage to relax your limbs.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have calculated Mentzer index as well which is also not in favor of thalassemia minor.

Allergic conjunctivitis can trigger spontaneously. Reduce the sensitivity of the eye to such allergens. I prescribe eye drops Winolap DS (Olopatadine) one drop four times a day.

As your pregnancy test is negative and this is happening for the first time, it is not a serious issue. Just wait and watch. The period will come naturally in another one or two weeks.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I understand that you know very well about your disorder as of now. The basic problem with the IBS-D (irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea) is the spastic contraction of bowel and increased secretion of various gut hormones leading to abdominal pain and diarrhea. Since you have tried many medications so far, I see there is still a role of low dose antidepressant medication which help normalize the gut hormones in balance. But unfortunately, these drugs have some side effects, not necessarily mental wise but some physical adverse effects such as dry mouth, dry eyes, and can sometimes lead to constipation and also could cause increased sleep. But since we recommend the patient to start with a low dose and then gradually step up if tolerated well. You can take tablet Amitryptline 5 to 10 mg once daily at night time. And your mind will take sometime before actual improvement. Like it can give you relief in two to four weeks time.

After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have been given a trisomy 21+ NT risk of 1:72 and I have just given my blood sample today for NIPT. I have multiple fibroids which are mostly located posteriorly. I am really worried and want to know about the level of risk my pregnancy has.","Doctor":"Hi. Your previous obstetric, gynecology, medical, and drug history matters. Have you been on folic acid daily? If you had any medical issue, was it treated and checked properly? Your nuchal translucency is normal. PAPPA more than 0.5 MOM is normal but you have 0.18. It is less. Free beta hCG is fine. It would be better if you would send me your report. As per your description, your risk for Down syndrome is 1:72. Then you have an estimated chance of having a baby with Down's syndrome as 1 in 72 babies. Your age limit has the risk of anomaly moderately. Check NIPT report and have detailed anomalies scan at 20 weeks with expertise hands. Multiple fibroids can give you painful antenatal period as in pregnancy degeneration occurs at a more higher pace. Have a strict check on the scan, NIPT report and discuss here or with a local treating gynecologist. If you do not have a family history of a congenital anomaly then the risk would be less as this also count to calculate risk. If the above two investigations come normal, then in future, the baby will need strict monitoring of fetal heart sound, movement, and growth. Have regular antenatal visits and in case of any bleeding or pain report immediately to tertiary care gynecology emergency."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My teeth color is yellowish. How can I change my teeth color to white permanently?","Doctor":"Hello. The teeth color is a result of genetics, nutrition and other habits such as smoking. If your teeth are healthy overall and caries free and you brush twice per day, teeth whitening can be performed but it lasts for about six months to two years. Permanent teeth whitening can be accomplished by putting on veneers (resin or porcelain) or crowns on your six front teeth. This can be done in a dentist's office. If you pick veneers, your dentist will prepare your front six teeth by removing a small number of yellowish teeth and then he will replace it with resin or porcelain. The same will happen if you choose putting crown on but the amount of the tooth substance removed will be around the double. So, the solution I propose for permanent teeth whitening is veneers. Nutrition, genetics, bad habits. Putting on veneers or crowns. Avoiding smoking, excessive red wine and coffee drinking, brushing twice a day thoroughly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have one side nose block due to my allergy.

I have gone through your question, and I can understand your concern about your denture. You have to take it out after having meals, and you have to clean it properly or keep it in water till you wear it next time.

But the laboratory technician has advised me to come back with semen sample again after three days as the given semen sample was not liquifying. I am trying for a baby for about four months.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm?

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time.

Many things happen due to genetics or due to use of any specific product. Check your family history regarding gray hairs. Use natural products to color hairs like henna (Indian herbal product). For PCOD, have a strict healthy diet with less salt, sugar, oil, and spice. Do a walk daily to have a healthy BMI (body mass index) and weight. Try to have regular menstrual cycles, or you can take a cyclic combined oral contraceptive pill for three months. Please send your scan report to guide you further. If you have any fertility issue, try to remove the fibroid as it is large and then decide for conception. If you have heavy periods due to fibroids, then you can do a myomectomy. Use natural products to the hairs. Avoid using conditioners regularly. If you have irregular cycles, try to consult a gynecologist for a further examination. Try to do serum progesterone, serum testosterone, serum insulin, serum prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, and thyroid function test.

You have spinal cord compression due to untreated vertebral fracture which causes severe back pain and difficulty in moving your lower limbs. In such cases, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is the most diagnostic one, and a neurosurgical consultation is required. Surgery can be done to decompress the spinal cord. It can improve the pain and movement. In case, if the operation is not possible, stronger pain medication can be taken to control the pain. I recommend taking Tramadol 50 mg for every six hours along with Paracetamol. Also, take vitamin B complex tablets to improve your nerve conduction and pain.

My question is whether it comes under safe days or not. If not, what to do for protected sex?","Doctor":"Hello. You are right in contemplating the fact that tomorrow she will be on her day 19 of her cycle, which is her unsafe period if her menses have been regular, so chances of pregnancy with unprotected intercourse would definitely be higher. So, the best way to have protection would still be barrier contraception with condoms with additional use of spermicidal jelly over it to reduce the chances of failure due to rupture condoms during intercourse. Also, practice ejaculation outside the vagina, that would further reduce the chances of any misadventure. The second method is to ask her to use a cervical diaphragm, which is a female condom and needs to be inserted before intercourse and removed post intercourse along with you using barrier contraception. The failure rate of condoms is 3.3 percent which can be increased by either using double condoms with or without spermicidal jelly or with a female condom."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have attached my mother's FNAC of the thyroid.

There is nothing to worry about. The treatment is Thyroxine which she is already taking and regular monitoring of her thyroid function tests. Also, better to do a radioiodine isotope uptake scan of the thyroid gland. The prognosis is good with treatment. However, if the thyroid gland is enlarged too much and is causing compression symptoms, then it needs to be surgically removed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 38 years old, my weight is 60 Kg.

But if your blood sugar levels are in the range of 250 to 350 with the use of medicines, then it is on the higher side and you will need a modification of medicine dosage or addition of another new drug.

It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 39-year-old male. I had irritation around the anal area before a week.

It has been three weeks and bone still seems to be moving. My hand is in a sling and I am also wearing the brace. 2 to 3 days back started noticing bone tenting towards the skin. Will the fracture heal by itself or will I need surgery?","Doctor":"Hello. Treatment for clavicle fracture depends on the fracture configuration and displacements. If it is tenting the skin over it or shortening of more than 2 cm, it is an indication for surgical treatment. Surgery means we open the fracture site and reduce the fragments and fix it with plate and screws. Please send X-ray picture and the clinical photo of your collar region."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am so worried. I had a blood test and my hemoglobin is 16 g/dl (9.9 mmol/l) and hematocrit is 46 PTC. I am female, 39, and healthy. My white blood cells, platelets, and thrombocytes are in normal middle range. Is a bit high hemoglobin sign of some sickness? What to do next?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome back to icliniq.com. So, actually, your hemoglobin level is borderline high and not low. So, you are not having anemia. You are probably thinking about polycythemia. But as your hemoglobin is not much elevated and your total WBC count with platelet count are within range, no need to worry. In the female, normal hemoglobin range is between 13 to 16. I suggest you investigate with serum erythropoietin just to be sure if it is within range. Excess non-vegetarian diet also can lead to high hemoglobin level. Sometimes, if the investigation is done in the dehydration stage, then also such finding can occur. You can revert back with serum EPO (erythropoietin) report to guide you further."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Around a month ago, I had a dental trauma on my lower three incisors. The teeth have moved slightly from their original position. My dentist has advised me for a root canal for all the three teeth. Now before two days, he started the process, and one of my teeth has turned black. What can I do now?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. I feel that the dentist has to stabilize your teeth first if they are mobile. It can be done by splinting. RCT (root canal treatment) is usually done to the teeth if the trauma has involved the pulp. Discoloration or pink teeth usually occurs in injury. If the RCT is done, place a crown over the treated tooth, and the discoloration will go off definitely. I can guide you better if you send the photograph of the teeth with an X-ray."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My sister is 6 months 20 days pregnant with ART. She is having premature ovarian dysfunction. She was on Lonopin 40 mg with Ecosprin tablets. She had undergone two time ART procedure. All her reports were fine, but the fetus had no pulsations. So, she underwent two times for abortion. Now this time everything is fine, and her doctor advised to stop Lonopin. He said nothing to be worried about and no need to take an injection. Do you think she needs to take these injections and if she takes these injections full time, can it bring some complications?","Doctor":"Hello. No, she should not stop low molecular weight injection and instead take a good brand either Enoxaparin or LMWX and tablet Ecosprin 150 mg, as her previous history is such that we should not ignore it. If not taken, then she is at high risk for early development of high BP, slow growth of the baby, water level around the baby remains low and some time bleeding can occur during pregnancy. So you have to be very careful."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am an 18-year-old girl. I have been a patient of beta thalassemia major.

Recently, I have felt itchy throat-stuffy nose only on one side of the nose that is open and closes when I lie down. Moreover, due to an itch, there is a cough. No nasal drippings.","Doctor":"Hi. Your symptoms are suggestive of upper respiratory tract infection, possibly allergic inflammation. I suggest you investigate with CBC for primary work up. Meanwhile, a decongestant can be prescribed for your symptoms. You can drink warm water that helps in the soothing throat. Salt added lukewarm water gargle can be beneficial.

After that, four days ago, it happened again. So, I consulted a new doctor. He prescribed Toba DM and Flur eye drops. I am 18 years old boy, 5’4\\", weight 45 kg. I am fearing about whether it is a retinal tear.","Doctor":"Hi. Flashes are seen in retinal tears, but they are also seen in various other conditions. It is great that you have got your retina evaluated. But in the prescription (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there is nothing mentioned which requires Toba DM or Flur for management. I would recommend that you discuss with your doctor why those medications have been started or you stop using them immediately. Long-term use of steroid drops may lead to high intraocular pressure and damage to vision due to glaucoma. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 22 years old. I have to get my periods this week. But I am getting black or brown discharge. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi. It is known as irregular shedding. It is caused due to stress-induced hormonal imbalances during a cycle. You have to do an ultrasound pelvis to check endometrial thickness. If the endometrial thickness is less than 8 mm, then you can have a progesterone deficiency. It needs to be evaluated soon."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 18 years old. I was playing with my friend's dog yesterday. By mistake, the dog's teeth touched my hand, and a little drop of blood came out. Do I did need an injection?","Doctor":"Hi. If your friend has done a vaccination to the dog, then there is no problem. Keep the bitten site clean, wash with warm water and soap. Apply Oxygenated water and Betadine (Povidone Iodine) locally. You can take them over the counter, and there is no need for a prescription. As you are 18 years old, and if still, you are getting your scheduled vaccines, then there is no need for getting another Tetani injection."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am on my period for one month.

If it is less than 5 to 6 mm, then this medicine, Sysron (Norethisterone) will not stop the bleeding, but instead, you need to take combination oral contraceptive pills to stabilize the lining. If the lining is quite thick then, Sysron will work.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

You need to understand one thing. It is not going to heal unless you stop straining while passing stools. As it is a wound at the passage it causes your anal sphincter to go into contraction in pain further causing you to strain and it becomes a cycle. You need a high fiber diet. You can supplement with psyllium husk powder.

If you still have bleeding in spite of being on the hormone pills, then some other cause should be thought of. Possibilities are: Hope a pelvis examination has been done, to rule out any local infection on cervix and area surrounding uterus. A cervical polyp has to be ruled out. They produce midcycle bleeding. Hope a pelvic scan has been done to rule out uterine fibroid or polyps. D and C is no diagnosis or treatment. Thyroid profile and serum prolactin hormone checked. Hope you are not diabetic and blood sugar levels are checked. Hope pelvic infection has been ruled out. If so both you and your partner have to be treated.

She has drooling and now saliva is coming out under the tracheostomy plate. She asks for frequent suctioning as she feels difficulty breathing . Her saturation is above 90 after suctioning. Since it is lockdown we are worried to take her to hospital. Is this an emergency?","Doctor":"Hi! If the patient is tracheostomised and if your really SURE that the secretions from the tracheostomy tube is saliva, then there is a possibilty of developing a fistula(an abnormal connection) between the food pipe(Oesophagus) and the trachea called as tracheosophageal fistula. In such a condition we first need to heal the fistula and it can be done by following below mentioned advice 1. There would be a cuff inflator pipe through which air can be inflated and deflated in and out from the cuff. Even though the inflated cuff prevents faulty aspiration of fluids from the mouth while swallowing, it can also create a necrosis around the trachea thus causing the oesophagus to get connected to it. You to need to suction the tube and deflate the cuff every 2 hrs for 15mins so that this raw surface connecting the two heals and saliva from the tube stops coming. 2. For few days, the patient might be stopped orally and a ryles tube might have to be inserted to feed the patient. Repeated swallowing can again infect the area and might lead to leak of food also through the tube. ( you can go to the emergency of any hospital to get this tube inserted in case its not there!)

Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

If you have constipation or stomach problem, use fibers and vegetables in the diet and reduce consumption of meat-based products. If you have a stomach problem, acidity, avoid citrus acid-causing foods. Use milk in the diet. For acidity, you need to consult a physician, if present in your case. Avoid or stop smoking.

We are strictly following the diet and taking insulin with regular blood check-up (four times daily).","Doctor":"Hi. From your history, I gather that you have been taking insulin from early pregnancy and closely following it. If your blood sugar levels are well controlled with diet, exercise, and insulin, then there is nothing to worry about. There is no specific and extra chance for the baby to have any anomalies. Baby will have all the features of a normal pregnancy. The pregnancy complications rate is same as any other normal pregnancy. You do not need to worry. You can have an NT (Nuchal translucency) ultrasound scan at 11-14 weeks, Quadruple marker at 15-17 weeks, anomaly scan at 19 weeks, and fetal echocardiogram at 22-24 weeks.

It seems like his body does not produce any semen at all. He has the sexual pleasure just like normal people, the only problem is that he does not have any semen. He visited a few doctors and they ran a few tests on him like sperm count. The tests were quite disappointing as there was no sperm at all. Some doctors said that he has to undergo a biopsy of the testis tissue to make sure the organ is healthy and then look for other causes of the problem. But my brother is afraid of this biopsy because he thinks that this biopsy can hurt his testis forever. Is there any solution to his problem? How can he overcome this issue? Is biopsy the only solution to his problem? Is it safe to go for the biopsy?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, I would like to tell you that biopsy is completely safe. It hurts very minimally, only like an intravenous injection. During a biopsy, a small piece of tissue (from the testis) is taken for examination and there is no risk of damaging his testis forever. The biopsy of the testis is one of the options out of many tests which have to be done before complete diagnosis. Nil production of semen is more likely due to blockage of ejaculatory duct. Before going for biopsy of the testis, he should go for checking the patency of ejaculatory duct. If they have already checked this in the tests which were conducted earlier, then he can go for the biopsy.

Collect the running fluids and do sugar estimation. Remember that the test has to be done soon after collecting the liquid. Otherwise, it will not be accurate. Next, get a sinus CT scan done to rule out the causative reason for having recurrent throat infections. Please send a picture of the throat to see whether there is any tonsillar hypertrophy. Meanwhile, start taking Septillin tablets to improve immunity. When there is no throat infection, give him amla (gooseberry) to eat. He can also have an allergy to pollens. So, he can develop an allergy. It can manifest as throat irritation, runny nose, and itching. You can do some tests to check allergy and follow some precautions to stay away from allergy.

Does breast milk transfer chicken pox to the baby? Do I need to take special care of my baby? Can I do breastfeeding now? Does it affect my child? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. A mother who contracts chickenpox can do breastfeeding. Any vesicles present on the breast should be covered to minimize the risk of transmission. There is no evidence shown the presence of the varicella-zoster virus (Chickenpox) in breastmilk. Hence breastfeeding is safe. Breast milk does not transfer chickenpox to the baby. The doctor may prescribe Acyclovir 800 mg five times a day if you are seen within 24 hours of rash onset. It reduces the time to have full crusting of lesions and reduces the number of lesions. Acyclovir can be taken during breastfeeding. It is safe to take.

I cannot say whether it is viral or bacterial. If it is viral, the disease will get relieved in 10 to 15 days. You should do cold compresses three to four times a day in both the eyes.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

Research has shown that keeping the temperature below 110-degreeFahrenheit is beneficial to health. Slightly cold water is also good for your health as it boosts the immune system but not too cold. Water that is cold can harbor many pathogens like legionellae and others. Water too hot is bad for the epidermis as it damges the natural oils of the skin and predisposes a person to eczema and other skin conditions. Taking a bath in temperatures around 110-deg Fahrenheit can significantly hydrate the cells of the body and also maintain the natural texture of your skin. As for duration, too much time in the water is not recommended. An average of 20 minutes in temperatures around 110-degree Fahrenheit is good. In the case of children or the elderly, observe caution with high temperatures."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I did not get an erection that easily and am not able to hold it for long also.

In such situations, the erectile dysfunction is managed by a drug like Sildenafil or Tadalafil and behavior method called Master and Johnson technique. You can google this technique and can start practicing it.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

She has had them for several months now and not getting bigger in size. It has been of the same size since it appeared. She does not have any pain or itching. She does not complain about them. But, I noticed another small one starting to appear. I think it is high time I should get her treated for this problem. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I read through your child's problem. This may be due to molluscum contagiosum, if central umbilication (a depression similar to that of navel present at the center of any lesion) is present in each lesion and a white body is present inside the bump or these might be warts (if soft, pinkish, irregular, fleshy and without any umbilication). Both these conditions are viral infections. Both of them can spread and form new lesions. In both the conditions, new lesions keep appearing. These lesions can be removed by different options like cauterization and cryotherapy. Warts can also be treated with topical lotion like Podowart (Podophyllum resin, Benzoin, and Aloes solution) under the supervision of the doctor. Molluscum can be treated by enucleating the white body from inside.

The hard lens/RGP lens provides a lot of discomfort. Do I have other options apart from glasses?","Doctor":"Hi. Keratoconus is a degenerative eye disorder. This causes corneal thinning and leads to a conical shaped cornea. Soft lenses can be used, the silicone lens with hydrogel based ones in particular. Though RGP (rigid gas permeable) lens are preferred for better vision outcomes, a combination of soft and rigid lenses are also available. If this option fails, then go in for surgical options like microwave thermokeratoplasty."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, One year ago, I had a serious breakup with my girlfriend.

Relationship issues need to be settled down before it starts disturbing you. You have to fully understand what it will lead to and how it will affect your life in the long run. When you get into any relationship for more than a year, you start associating and sharing your feelings with that person, which is quite obvious. In any breakup, the reason for the breakup is very important to deal with. You have not mentioned it here. If you had mentioned, it would have been even more helpful in suggestions.

They found enlarged heterogeneous pituitary gland with two areas of heterogeneity. One measuring 5 mm on the left and one on the right measuring almost 8 mm.

Known postsurgical changes with encephalomalacia and volume loss in the right temporal lobe are also there.","Doctor":"Hello. Indeed you are having a pituitary microadenoma as the size is less than 10 mm. And recurrence rate is 10 to 50 % after surgical removal. So, medical therapy is preferred such as Dopamine agonist Bromocriptine. The patients resistant to Bromocriptine are given Cabergoline. A transsphenoidal approach is considered as a surgical approach but the medical approach is preferred as it has been recurrent. Consider surgically only if the tumor grows and shows pressure symptoms. A continuous endocrinological follow up should be considered. Diet and daily activity changes are normally not needed or related to microadenoma patients but as your BMI is 26, it is considered as overweight. So you should lose your weight to avoid other health problems."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had unsafe sex yesterday and took I-pill in half an hour to avoid pregnancy. Today, I had sex again.

I would like to know which medicines you take for hypertension? I would like to know, whether you have done any urine examination? Rest eGFR (glomerular filtration rate) of 71 is within normal range for you, if urine examination is normal. I would advise you to decrease the protein intake and avoid protein supplements. You take water as much so that urine daily passed is around 1.5 liters. You should avoid any nephrotoxic drugs (painkillers, herbal medicines).

But my fear and anxiety got increased. So after ten days, I did a tridot test. It came nonreactive. After ten days, I had a problem of having frequent urination and itching. So I consulted a doctor. He asked me to do a urine test, and the results came normal (with pus cells of three to six). Again, after ten days, I did a card test for HIV, VDRL for syphilis and HBsAg. All the results came nonreactive. After a few days, I got sores inside my lips. So I was planning to take IgG test for HSV. Is tridot test taken for HIV is reliable? Is there any chance to get gonorrhea and chlamydia after 100 days? Is IgG test is reliable after four months? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. Tridot test for HIV is reliable. There is something called window period in HIV. It usually ranges from two to three months where the test for HIV will be negative. In such cases, the test has to be repeated. Since you have done the test after three months, this test should be conclusive. VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory test) and HBsAg test (hepatitis B surface antigen test) are reliable. If they are negative, it means that you do not have an infection. Gonorrhea symptoms will start within two to five days of contact, and chlamydia comes within 10 to 14 days of contact. The chances of having gonorrhea and chlamydia after three months are minimal. For Herpes, you have to take both IgG and IgM antibodies test. IgG antibody indicates past infection, and IgM antibodies indicate present infection. If you have blisters, then IgM will be positive. If IgG alone is positive, it suggests about the past infection. I explain about pus cells also. Pus cells are polymorphonuclear leukocytes and neutrophils. There should be more than ten pus cells in the urine per high power field for the urine test to be positive. Having three to six pus cells are not of much significance. It should be more than 10 to be worried."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have low energy for a few days now. I have done a blood test, and I have a ferritin level of 10 ng/mL.

I still have low energy, and it is affecting my daily life. Can I take an infusion now? Can it help me? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. It also depends on the level of hemoglobin. There are no additional benefits seen while having an infusion. It gives a rapid rise in hemoglobin. If you have responded to oral treatment, then it is not necessary. Please send your blood reports soon. If everything is fine, then do a thyroid test."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from allergies rhinitis. My TSH level is high, and my hemoglobin level is high. How to cure it?","Doctor":"Hi. For allergic rhinitis, you can take Fexofenadine for getting relief from congestion. If you have a repeated history of allergic rhinitis, then allergic testing can be done. An alteration in TSH can be seen due to inflammation. You have to redo your TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) after the inflammation subsides. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Additionally, your CBC (complete blood count) shows a high level of hemoglobin and high level of RBC (red blood cells) and HCT (hematocrit). So it can be secondary polycythemia. Sometimes, dehydration leads to these problems. For that, you need to maintain hydration and repeat CBC after one week. If still, if it remains high, then investigate with EPO (erythropoietin) estimation for further work up."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

When he sneezes he holds it back and he loses consciousness. I tell him not to hold it back but he is physically not able to let it go alone. Is there anything I can do to help him or anything he should do and are there any dangers in his life?","Doctor":"Hi. First, we need to find out what is the cause of recurrent sneezing. If you look into the physiology, sneeze is a protective reflex often in response to something irritative and offensive which the body wants to push out in order to prevent it from reaching the lungs and thereby into the circulation. Most commonly it is dust, but can be attributed to other irritative substances such as animal fur, pollens, smoke, fumes, etc. What can be done? 1. Prevention of entry of irritative substances is the key and plays a major role in preventing allergic responses. This can be effectively done by wearing an n95 mask most times even while indoors. 2. In addition, a combination of antihistaminic and steroidal spray containing Azelastine and Fluticasone two puffs two times a day does wonder. 3. Holding a sneeze inside can be lethal, as it is high pressure reflux and by holding the sneeze, reverse pressure can be created which has no where else to go but above to the cranium thereby an increase in intracranial pressure causing a vessel to rupture resulting in a stroke. This is a far possibility, but in elderly individuals, it can happen and is lethal. Secondly, an increase in intrathoracic pressure can also stimulate the vagus nerve resulting in vasovagal syncope causing a brief loss of consciousness. It is very important that these measures are followed in order to prevent any untoward incident. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from constipation.

Adding fiber to your diet increases the weight of your stool and speeds its passage through your intestines. Slowly begin to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables each day. Choose whole-grain bread and cereals. Do exercise most days of the week. Physical activity increases muscle activity in your intestines. Try to fit in exercise most days of the week. Do not ignore the urge to have a bowel movement. Take your time in the bathroom, allowing yourself enough time to have a bowel movement without distractions and without feeling rushed.

If ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is normal and the fever subsides, this may be a remote possibility.

So, these lymph nodes if less than 1 cm in size and soft in consistency and not attached to skin or underlying structure may indicate reactive etiology which is not harmful.

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

If you have these following symptoms, you have to consult a doctor soon. If you do not have any of these suspicious symptoms, then it can be a tension headache or a migraine.

After five days, she got her periods. After a month, she got her periods again. But her breast and lower stomach size have got increased. I want to know whether she is pregnant or not. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. She has got periods twice after having unprotected intercourse. Her first period can be due to the withdrawal effect of drugs, and the second episode after a month can be a regular period. Change in breast size can occur during regular menstrual periods. But it is usually not noticeable. You have not mentioned whether there was an ejaculation done or not. So if you think that there is a change in size, I would advise you to do a urine pregnancy test for your partner. As it is more than eight weeks, it will detect pregnancy if it is there."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am working in a software company. I have a gastric problem, stomach gets big and tight when gas occurs. Below are a few symptoms. When gas occurs, irritation in stomach above the belly button and just below rib bone (little right), releasing more gas when I go to the bathroom, if I eat anything spicy, irritation in the stomach at the time of eating, below right rib, no heartburn. I met a doctor, who gave Nexium 40 1-0-1 and Sucrafil 1-0-1. It was good for two hours after food, but later gas forms, feeling stomach has increased its size. So, met a Gastroenterologist, who checked and gave, Deltone 60 1-0-0 and Lafaxid 10 0-0-1. But the same issue, after eating food, nearly two hours later, gas forms, irritation at the point comes. At weekends, when I am at home, I used to eat biscuits, fruits often, so 90 % I do not get this gas problem. My weight has increased to 8 kg in the last six months.","Doctor":"Hi. You have to modify your diet and lifestyle. Try to avoid or reduce the amount of gas forming foods in your diet. Also, reduce excess spice and masalas. Add more of salads. Try short frequent feeds rather than heavy food or meals three times a day. Keep yourself well hydrated with two liters of water daily. Avoid carbonated drinks, excess coffee and alcohol if any. Have regular aerobic exercises. Follow these measures consistently for a month and see the response. Regarding medicines, Nexium (Esomeprazole) is a good choice.

You can take tablet Emistat 8 mg (Ondansetron) one tablet in the morning, afternoon and evening before having a meal for three days. Please say whether you have abdominal pain.

Kindly let me know some exercises to strengthen the abdominal muscles.","Doctor":"Hello. You must take complete rest for one week, and no exertion up to one month. After one month, you may get back to normal activities without restriction. It is advisable to start the routine work slowly and gradually. It is not advisable to do abdominal crunches after hernia surgery, even when fully recovered. There is a common misconception by patients that strengthening the abdominal muscles will help prevent a future hernia. But this is not true. The abdominal muscles have nothing to do with hernia. Hernia develops because of the weakness in the abdominal fascia. Fascia is the dense sheet that encases muscle and attaches muscle to bone. Fascia is rich in collagen. Exercise does not strengthen fascia but may weaken it. Consult a general practitioner online for further follow up -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am writing this on behalf of my mother. She is 60 years old and weighs about 86 kg. Her complaint is very extreme pain on the knee (left leg). This issue started one year ago and we consulted orthopedics who applied an injection on her knee after verifying an x-ray report and prescribed a couple of tablets. Doctor said it is a kind of arthritis. There was some relief after that visit. My mother again started facing the same problem since last month. Pain is so extreme from inside the knee that she cannot even move her left leg. Her right leg is fine. Kindly prescribe some relief and treatment plan.

I got super paranoid thinking that they were hanging out behind my back and I ended up crying myself to sleep. I take no medication. Is there any chance that I have depression?","Doctor":"Hi. You have mentioned that you are experiencing low mood, crying spells, and paranoid thoughts. You are not in a depression. Teenagers might experience certain mood swings due to hormonal changes in the body. You are going through the same. With the mentioned symptoms, you cannot be diagnosed as having depression.

How can I take care of gut in order to take care of my head?","Doctor":"Hello. There is definitely a positive relationship between the two and there is a medical explanation for that. Mental health issues like depression and anxiety tend to cause gut problems like hyperacidity, loss of appetite, nausea, constipation, and even mild diarrhea. Vice versa, gut problems like chronic diarrhea or loss of appetite with or without other symptoms may cause symptoms of anxiety depression, social anxiety, etc. In order to keep a healthy mind, the following measures can be taken to ensure a healthy gut. Drinking plenty of water, mainly warm water. Eating fibers and green vegetables to avoid constipation. Eating meat in measured amounts. Avoiding overeating and eating on time. All these measures and many more can give your gut and over whole body good shape which will, in turn, add to your self-confidence, stamina, feeling good about yourself, etc. Someone who has a happy healthy gut can prove to lead a productive life thus contributing to good self-esteem and confidence.

Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attached blood test results (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your daughter's serum ferritin is low which reflects the low iron stores. Her hemoglobin is low. Her low ferritin levels support it. Her TIBC (total iron binding capacity) is high, and it is commonly seen in iron deficiency anemia. But her serum iron levels are not consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Her transferrin saturation of 66 % suggests an iron overload.

My hands and feet would get very cold whenever I have my attacks. I would have difficulty breathing.","Doctor":"Hi. You do seem to have a case of chronic gastritis due to Helicobacter pylori infection evident from the endoscopy report. You need prescription antibiotics to treat that given in the form of a regimen called triple therapy for 10 days to two weeks. This also contains antiulcerants which protect your gastric mucosa from stomach acid and will allow your ulcers to heal.  Now, coming to the hands getting cold could be Raynaud's phenomenon that can be due to stress caused by the attack and difficulty in breathing may be due to the severe dyspepsia and heartburn that you may feel because of gastritis. If you take the triple therapy as per doctor's prescription you carry on the antiulcerant medication for two more weeks, your symptoms should improve significantly. Please let me know if your symptoms do not improve after taking triple therapy and antiulcerant for another two weeks. Avoid spicy food, going without food for several hours. Eat frequently. Avoid constipation. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, tea."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 32-year-old female. Recently, I got tested for rubella.

I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As per the laboratory reports, one thing is clear that you are not immune to rubella as the titers of IgG are below the required level. You are in a safer zone as you have appropriately vaccinated in childhood. In rare cases, due to numerous reasons, we do not develop complete immunity. Do not plan for pregnancy now.

These symptoms are common in both STD (sexually transmitted diseases) and UTI (urinary tract infections). If you do not have vaginal discharge or any history of unprotected sex, then UTI is the cause. You can confirm the diagnosis with the following tests. You can do urine microscopy and routine examination soon. You can do a vaginal swab for microscopy and culture. Drink plenty of water and keep the area dry and clean.

If the finger swelling and pain occur due to cold exposure, then it can be a Raynaud's phenomenon. It is an autoimmune disease. As there is involvement of finger in one side, it can occur due to an autoimmune cause. Your blood circulation is poor. So, you can do an ultrasound color Doppler of the arterial system of your hand. In the case of vascular insufficiency, vasodilator drugs like Nifedipine can be taken first with low doses. You must exclude an infectious etiology. If there is a pus formation under your nailbed, an antibiotic can be taken. In case of severe pain, you can take Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications like Aceclofenac plus after having food."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Last year my father had a heart attack and well it has been treated well. But after a year he feels his head to be spinning, weak, and has fluctuating blood pressure. Why is it so?","Doctor":"Hello. I would like to explain that the head spinning could be a sign of blood pressure fluctuations. Other possible causes to consider would be an inner ear disorder or low blood flow to the brain (vertebro-basilar insufficiency). For this reason, I would recommend consulting with his attending physician and performing some further tests. A cardiac ultrasound to examine his heart function, a Doppler ultrasound of the carotid and vertebral arteries to examine the blood flow to the brain, thyroid hormone levels, complete blood count for anemia, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose, kidney, and liver function tests. A head-up tilt test is necessary to investigate for orthostatic hypotension."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 39-year-old woman, non-smoker. Some times when I clear my throat I spit mucus with a little blood. I am not sick and I have no cough. What could it be? I consulted an ENT doctor before.","Doctor":"Hi.  How many years do you smoke? Do you drink alcohol? What did the ENT doctor say about you?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My doctor, a long time ago, said that I have GERD. It is an acid reflux condition. I get really disgusting burps that taste like rotten eggs and I get diarrhea. That will go on for about three hours and then I throw up and I feel fine. I take acid reducers but I still end up getting it. I have also tried eating less and drinking more water instead of tea and coke. Can you tell me anything that I can do?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, you are having GERD which is gastric esophageal reflux disease which means acid of your stomach along with food regurgitate into your food pipe known as the esophagus. There are many causes for that like being overweight, excess tea, coffee or cold drinks intake, excess alcohol, chocolate, fatty food, going to bed immediately after eating especially dinner. And certain food as you mentioned.  First of all, you should avoid the food which causes these symptoms. Secondly, avoid coffee, cola, alcohol, chocolate, and fatty spicy food like burger, pizza, etc. Reduce your weight as you are over weight with 120 kg. Eat your dinner early with at least a gap of four hours between your dinner and going to bed. Place blocks under the head end of your bed so that your head end is elevated 30 degrees and food does not regurgitate into your food pipe. Along with that use following medications. Esomeprazole 40 mg, one before breakfast at least 30 minutes, syrup Gaviscon two tablespoons after meals three times a day, tablet Maxolon 10 mg, one tablet twice a day before meals 20 minutes. Use these medications for four weeks, then let me know."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 24-year-old male. My weight is 75 kilograms. I have a healthy diet. I have a habit of drinking alcohol once a month, and I do not have the habit of smoking. I checked my blood pressure, and it was 155 by 65 mmHg. Is it high? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. You are slightly overweight. I suggest you reduce taking carbohydrates and fats in your diet. Your blood pressure is elevated. Still, a single elevated reading does not mean that you have hypertension. Taking repeated measurement for at least two to three times, and having your BP high at these measurements, may suggest that you are hypertensive. At your age, a normal BP should be below 120 by 80 mmHg. BP (blood pressure) is a dynamic parameter. It usually gets elevated after having an emotional upset, anxiety or physical exercise. Repeat your blood pressure measurement soon. Reduce taking salt in your diet. I also advise you do a blood test called lipid profile. An elevated cholesterol or triglyceride level can also cause high BP."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have blood dots present under my skin. But it appears only in my arms.

I was admitted to a hospital last week and was discharged within one day. The doctor said that first, we can check through medicine, now sometimes I am feeling nervous and minute rapid heartbeat.","Doctor":"Hi. Wolf Parkinson white syndrome is caused by the presence of extra pathway of the heart electricity which causes parts of the heart to be excited before others and sometimes the connection between the normal pathway and the extra pathway cause what is called reentry cycle which causes an attack of tachycardia (rapid heart beats). Treatment options include medical and ablation. Medical: Propafenone 150 mg tablet every eight hours (control heartbeats). In severe cases ablation using a catheter is required. Beta blockers like Metalor is not suitable as it blocks the normal pathway and enhances the extra abnormal pathway. I recommend that you follow up and send me your ECG and echocardiography report in order to identify the type and severity of the arrhythmia."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 21 years old. Last month, I was experiencing some ringing sounds in my ears, with dizziness. It triggered my health anxiety. I convinced myself that I have MS. Now after a month, my dizziness is gone. But I have new symptoms like joints making crackling sounds (especially in my hips and shoulders). My arms and calf muscles are tight sometimes, and they hurt a lot. My hips make a loud popping sound sometimes which I have never heard it before. If I swing my leg in a circular motion, it makes a loud pop. It causes my whole body to vibrate. I am panic, and I am afraid of going to the doctor. Currently, I am taking Magnesium 200 mg daily.","Doctor":"Hi. You are suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. Your joint symptoms may occur due to vitamin D deficiency. I suggest you do a blood vitamin D level and a complete blood count. Multiple sclerosis does not happen with joint symptoms. It is a disease though commonly seen in young females, often manifest with limb weakness and cramping in one of the limbs. Multiple sclerosis can present with vertigo in case of brainstem involvement. But, it seems to be a remote possibility in your case. I suggest you take an anxiolytic for your symptoms. If the vitamin D level is found to be low, you may need a vitamin D supplementation."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

They want to give her a Rhogam shot this weekend. I know it is a blood product. Is it safe?","Doctor":"Hi. Rh incompatibility is a mismatch that occurs between the blood of the mother and the blood of the fetus. It happens when the mother is Rh-negative, and the fetus is Rh-positive. When Rh-negative blood is exposed to Rh-positive blood, the Rh-negative blood responds by producing antibodies. It attacks and destroys the Rh-positive blood cells. It leads to problems such as fetal anemia, which can cause a life-threatening condition known as hydrops fetalis, causing internal bleeding, heart and kidney failure, and shock. Rh immunoglobulin prevents the mother's immune system from attacking the baby’s blood. It is entirely safe, and it should be administered for the well being of the baby."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How is it possible that I got heart palpitations from caffeine use (5.8 mg/kg a day)? Could it be that I also used Wellbutrin?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, both these caffeine and Wellbutrin commonly causes palpitations. Even a lower dose of caffeine can cause palpitations and there is no as such dose relationship with respect to palpitations. It may lead to all your symptoms. Also, anxiety or stress is usually an additional factor which may cause or worsen the palpitations. Usually, palpitations like these are usually benign and non-life-threatening although they may be troublesome. Considering your comorbidities, it is better to evaluate these, not just due to palpitations but also as screening cardiac test, and to rule out the possibility of cardiac arrhythmia. So, you should have a baseline ECG especially during palpitations and may need 24 hours Holter monitoring if not able to get ECG during palpitations. Also, you may alternatively use mobile-based rhythm monitors like Alivecor Kardia or other monitors. Also, you should get one echo done to look for the status of heart and its valve. So, try to reduce caffeine consumption as much as possible and see the response."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have this mole on my back. I think it has been there for a while. My GP took one look at it and declared completely benign. I was wondering what sort of mole it is? Is it worrying? I used sunbeds frequently for about a year when I was younger. Never since.","Doctor":"Hi. Most likely it is a benign melanocytic nevus (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The worrying signs are a sudden change in colour, a sudden increase in size and shape. If you want to confirm whether it is benign or not, you can go for dermoscopy (noninvasive technique), skin biopsy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 36-year-old male. I suffer from severe fatigue, unexplained weight gain, headache, sleeplessness, cognitive dysfunction, with reduced sex drive for the past three years. I have a blurry vision too. I have gone to many doctors. But, I am not feeling healthy. My testosterone ranges from 176 ng/dL to 325 ng/dL. My endocrinologist says that there is nothing to worry. My estradiol and prolactin levels are normal. My free T4 was .54 ng/ dl, and TSH was 1.69 mIU/L. My memory has become worse, and my head is fully pressurized. I had an MRI, and there was nothing seen on it. I need some help, and I do not know what to do. Currently, I am taking Wellbutrin XL.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the query and the test results thoroughly (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have depression. Having depression with moderate to severe degrees result in having all these symptoms. So, it would be helpful to know if these symptoms preceded the development of depression or came along with it. A headache and firm pressure could be a side effect of Wellbutrin XL (Bupropion). Fatigue, weight gain, memory impairment, lack of sleep, loss of libido, and suicidal intentions are all symptoms of severe depression. Treat your depression problem first. You will see your symptoms reducing after taking adequate treatment for depression. I think you need to talk to your psychiatrist to readjust your dose and to add other drugs. If these symptoms came way before the onset of depression, then they are unrelated to it. I suggest you check your adrenal hormone levels like serum cortisol. Please let me know whether these symptoms developed before or after the depression. Also get the following investigations done. So that proper treatment can be initiated."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had protected sex with someone whose status I do not know. I am kind of worried now. I did not ejaculate and the condom slipped half way during the session and pulled that back. Is that a matter of concern? Shall I go for any test?","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your post. Slipping of the condom makes it an unprotected sexual intercourse and there is a small 1 % risk of getting STD although non-ejaculation makes it a lesser risk. You can test after two weeks for syphils and HIV by doing FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption) and CMIA for HIV after two weeks to be on the safer side. However, as the risk is very minute, there is no need to worry."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

He would always talk about her when he would come home from work. He would talk about her constantly. Sometimes even saying that she also likes him and that he knows they are going to end up together. He had the biggest crush and still till this day talks about her. He lost his job a few months ago and started acting weird. His manager is a different race. So when he was home after he got fired, he would constantly be outside wanting to get tanner because he said thats the way she likes guys. To be tanned how his old manager's race is. He would sit outside every single day wanting to get sunburned. He did indeed. Then weeks went by and he told my mom that his mission of sitting down outside was over and that he will start going to walk instead. At this moment all he does is wake up and go walk anywhere and walk to different places for no reason. He constantly says that he is married already with his old manager and that he is moving to another city. He says the same thing every time. He leaves since the morning and walks everywhere and comes back till the night. He does not do drugs but has a past of doing drugs. He used to drink every weekend before he started doing all of this. He would drink coffe every day before work. And on weekends drink alot. I and my family are concerned about him. We do not know what is wrong with him. He does not do drugs. He drinks sometimes on weekends, not often anymore. He says he is married and that he makes a call to someone and they pay all his bills. He leaves every day and walks anywhere. He knows what he does, he is aware. But we do not understand why he thinks stuff that is not in fact true. He is living in a fantasy.","Doctor":"Hello. He has developed an attraction for his manager and there was no actual relationship and then he lost the job. Then he started developing the symptoms. He has developed firm belief that he is married to his manager. His behavior has changed suddenly, lost the job and he is running or going out for sunbath without any explainable cause. These are most likely occurring due to some psychotic disorder. This could be due to delusions resulted due to psychosis. This cannot be ignored. His urgent psychiatric consultation is advised. Drugs like Olanzapine, Risperidone, Quetiapine, etc., can be used to control his symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had premature rupture of membrane. I lost total amniotic fluid like a gushing flow, that time actually I was in the toilet for elimination. I have multiple fibroids, and HBsAg positive, but I do not know what is the reason for the fluid leak. The doctor said it is because of HBsAg. Please tell me what is the reason behind this. Termination has been done. Prescribed for myomectomy surgery. Can you tell my possibilities of pregnancy and precautions for next time? And one thing, my body temperature in both palm and the sole is high compared to others. I do not have any fever.","Doctor":"Hello. The leak can be due to many reasons. The most common is due to some contraction of the uterus and may be due to a weak membrane and or more baby movement, sudden irritation, and strong contraction, due to some infection and many more. If you have one pregnancy with fibroid then there can be a pregnancy with fibroid and you can also go for myomectomy and then pregnancy. The only thing you should do is to take more care and more rest next time. and take medicines regularly with a regular check-up. Only these things are in our hands. The temperature of the palm and sole, is mostly because of your body nature and not related to any other thing (individual variations)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

No pain or discharge during urination. I am 48 years old. Medicines include Metformin HCl 500 mg, Atorvastatin 10 mg, Benazepril 10 mg.","Doctor":"Hi. Pain at the tip during erection can be due to: 1. Tight frenulum: this is skin fold at the tip on the lower side of the foreskin. This needs a frenuloplasty. 2. Partial phimosis: this prevents retraction of the foreskin during intercourse and may cause pain, especially seen in diabetics. It may require circumcision. 3. Peyronie's disease: hardening of penile tissue with pain on erection. This starts with pain and ends in hard plaque felt in penis near tip or shaft or base. 4. Rarely Raynaud's phenomenon. In this, there is also a pain in hands and toes, especially when exposed to cold.  I think in your case since you have not mentioned about foreskin issues, it may be early Peyronie's disease. Taking small doses of Sildenafil or Tadalafil helps. You can take 5 mg of Tadalafil daily, provided you are not taking Nitrates. Some people can have mild body ache after initial doses. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband has an eye infection for the past two months. The doctors diagnosed that it is a fungal infection pythium keratitis. This infection might be from crops. They said that there is no anti fungal for this type of fungus and asked to apply Itral eye drop hourly, Zaha four times a day, Homide two times a day. A corneal ulcer is created and a white like thing is in the cornea. Vision is blurred due to this. Could only identify the objects. He is under treatment for the past 30+ days. Do we have treatment for this?","Doctor":"Hi. In case the organism is pythium as you have said, it has been found that it does not respond to available antifungals. Previously patients have been managed by corneal transplant to remove the infected organ so that it does not affect inner parts of the eye. Your decision will depend on how well the infection is responding to the treatment being tried. If it is increasing despite all the medications, a corneal transplant may be the only way forward. Better to keep serial photographs of the eye for comparison and easy decision making."},{"Patient":"Hey doctor, I have been shy for as long as I remember. Not sure when I started suffering from social anxiety, I guess it built up slowly. Probably started in the middle of my teenage years. I am 32 now. I have been able to get through pretty good during the years. However, something really nasty started when I was about 27 to 28. Back then it was only sometimes, pretty rare at the start but now it is happening all the time, regardless of who I am interacting with, random people, family, and friends. What I am talking about is something I would describe as terror. So, it is not the everyday fear or anxiety I used to be able to deal with. It is fear as extreme as it gets. I am pretty sure I would not even react in this way if I met a bear in the wood. It happens upon eye contact. There is not really any time in between the eye contact and the arising of this terror, so it is not like I can do anything. My mind reacts with terror as soon as my eyes meet another person's eyes. It comes like a quick surge and then it settles so I can actually still communicate but those surges can still come back later in the conversation. However, these moments of terror are so nasty that I have started to avoid meeting anyone (I know, it does not make things better. But what to do? This is insane stuff going on (sometimes I get these attacks when I watch people in movies even). This thing has a bit of a domino effect as well because I see no hope anymore, am depressed and would rather not be alive at all, to be honest. If one is not able to enjoy another human's company, what is the point? I am interested to know what is going on with my mind. I wanna know what this is. More details about the presenting complaint: Already stated, current medications: None, past medications of the same issue: none, lab tests performed: none.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that it can be extremely distressing for someone to feel the way you have been feeling. You seem to have a social anxiety disorder that has worsened lately. Sometimes it is common for social anxiety to run its own course, where it waxes and wanes and worsens during some life periods (hence the terror that you have described). It can also lead to depression because of the suffering involved. The good thing is now we know a lot about this disorder in terms of treatment. There are medications as well as therapy options like cognitive behavioral therapy which have been shown to be very effective in people with this disorder. I would encourage you to seek help from a qualified psychiatrist as soon as possible so that you feel better."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am unable to sleep at night. I tried a lot but cannot sleep at all. It is after 5 AM that I feel like sleeping. Please help me to sleep at night. My age is 19 years.","Doctor":"Hello. At times, if a day or two we cannot sleep on time say 10 or 11 PM and suppose we sleep at 5 AM, then we will wake up after 6 to 7 hours, that is 11 or 12 PM in the afternoon. So, if this becomes a pattern in some days and our biological clock get adjusted with this new sleep and wake up time, this is called phase delay sleep problem. If you have only sleep disturbance, no other mood or behavior problem, then try sleep hygiene measure. Define your wake up time no matter when you slept, wake up at fix time. Do not drink tea, coffee, cola after 6 PM. Do not use your bed for any other purpose except for sleep. Do not keep tossing and turning in bed if you cannot sleep.

He is having an erection but is unable to sustain it during the intercourse. Firstly, he is not sure if he is suffering from ED or is it just anxiety. Are there any tests to be sure of ED? Secondly, if it is diagnosed to be ED (which most probably can be), can this be cured? How will his sexual life be? If it is curable, can it be cured with natural methods or medicine or surgery? If it cannot be cured, is there an alternative for him to have a happy sexual life?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your symptoms and I would like to know a few more details to answer your query better. Is he able to achieve an erection sufficient for vaginal penetration during intercourse? Is the loss of erection due to early ejaculation or happens without ejaculation?  The mechanism of erection can be tested by a penile doppler study during which the response to medication can also be tested. If he is able to achieve an erection sufficient for vaginal penetration, then the cause is more likely to be either psychological or just early ejaculation. A detailed clinical examination is also required to make sure that there are no other abnormalities that can affect full erection. At this age, the cause is most likely anxiety, but given his history of diabetes, a full evaluation is necessary to rule or other causes. The treatment is based on his most predominant concerns, though it cannot be completely cured, it can definitely be managed to get a normal sexual life."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Over the last few years, I have watched and photographed several lunar eclipses (no solar ever). About a year ago, I noticed I was seeing ghost images when I looked at the moon with either eye or both 9 w/left, 7 w/right. Went to Ophthalmologist and they said I need cataract surgery. I went with premium Lenses. Well, surgery pulled the ghost images a bit closer to source but still see them. They are now clearer, along with floaters I could not see before. Ghosts only happen at night (moon, white letters, lamps. As the sun starts rising the ghosts start fading. ITS been 8 to 10 months since the last eye was done and still ghosts with either eye or both. I have tried several types of anti-glares. No help.","Doctor":"Hi. The ghost images are a normal retinal phenomenon known as after images. You need not worry about it. You can see them clearer after cataract surgery because they are a normal retinal response to any image. The more the contrast, the more the ghost images or after images. The floaters are formed as a natural course of aging of vitreous jelly which fills up our eye. Also, it is better to get your retina examined six monthly or at least yearly to look for any breaks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a blood test today and the results show hemoglobin is 18.05 and the RBC are 5.8 and hematocrit is 42 %.

If not pregnant, then perhaps, she is nearing the time of her menses as that could feel like pressure and pain down there. If none of the above, then you could get an ultrasound of lower abdomen done to rule out cysts. Please get the following investigations done and update me so that we can proceed with treatment.

If the hole is in teeth, it can be acute apical periodontitis. In the former case, you need to take medication like Ofloxacin plus Ornidazole combination twice daily for five days. In the latter case, take Augmentin 625 (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) twice daily for five days. For any confusion, send me a picture I will provide you with a better possible treatment plan.

Then five days later, I had some bleeding which I am not sure whether it was just bleeding or unusual period. Ten days later, I had sex and took an emergency pill two hours after. I would like to know, is that possible to take the pill for two times in the same month and is it still efficient? My average period cycle is normally 28 days, usually, between 26 to 32 days, and duration lasts long for 6 to 7 days. Could you please suggest another method of contraception that will be suitable for me?","Doctor":"Hi. No, it is not known that emergency pills are how much effective when taken more than once in the same cycle. You should be careful before taking it. Your periods can be disturbed due to it. Bleeding may be due to it. Wait for your period and if it is delayed then do urine pregnancy test to confirm. More likely it turns to be negative and periods delayed. With a regular cycle of 26 to 32 days, you can look for the safe period definitely. If you do not have any kid, then condom and monthly pills are the best options you have as a contraception. And if you have one or two children then copper T is also a good option. Do consult the nearby gynecologist to clear pros and cons of each. Not a single method is 100 % effective.

Obesity, diabetes, thyroid, etc., also will cause this. As you are overweight must check thyroid and diabetes. Sometimes, it is natural and not associated with any disease. You can try Aldry lotion (Aluminium Chlorohydrate) which has anti-sweating property. Use deodorants and perfumes. Avoid fatty and spicy food and also avoid tight shoes and occlusive socks. Botox (Botulinum toxin) is one of the most popular treatments nowadays. We inject this over feet which cause sweat glands paralysis and totally stops the sweating and so odor."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 25 years old and my menstruation cycles had been irregular since the start. After 1.5 years of irregularity (missing periods for many months), I visited the gynecologist and after seeing all my tests results, my doctor told me because of my obesity I had irregularity in my periods. He prescribed me Diane 35 for the first 21 days post that I got my menses and thereafter he asked me to continue with the normal course of Krimson 35 of one tablet a day for 21 days. Thereafter my menses became regular while being on the medicine. After one year, I discontinued the medicine out of fear of side effects and thereafter my menses continued irregularly again. During my late teens and early 20's my menses were highly irregular (missing for more than 4 to 6 months) but from last two years, it occurs monthly either with heavy bleeding for 1 to 2 days or very light bleeding or spotting for 10 to 15 days. I am not on any medication right now nor do I have any other symptoms like cramps or nausea or any other menstrual symptoms. However, I still continue to be obese and did develop some levels of facial hair around my chin area. Could you please let me know, if I could go back to starting Krimson 35 to get everything back on track? Will there be any kind of side effects? Will there be any difficulty in conceiving at a later stage of my life?","Doctor":"Hello. With your history, it seems that you need to decrease your weight which is the single most important factor in your menses. There are others but first, we have to control this. Yes, of course with irregular menses it can be difficult to get pregnant. No need to start Krimson 35 (Cyproterone Acetate and Ethinyl Estradiol) but need to do some test may be. And try to reduce weight. From history, it seems that you have PCOS. Do one sonography and consult a nearby gynecologist for a good advice. Drink more water."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a secondary burn on my calf, after a month of self-treating. It just got worse. I play soccer and that and the sweat is what was irritating it. So I finally went to the doctor and they prescribed me SMZ, TMP DS. I took it for about a week until I realized I was having a lot of side effects and an allergic reaction especially around my mouth. At first I thought I was just breaking out. Then it was not like sores or blisters. I kept self-treating the rash around my mouth and stopped taking the antibiotics. For a couple days it was gone. I was happy. Then I was in the sun one day for soccer and it was just like another rash but worse. I stayed home from school, did not do anything because I just wanted to get it better. But now it looks really bad. I believe I have perioral dermatitis. It is red patches all around my mouth. It is really dry and scaly, also there are like white-heads around my mouth also but they are not whiteheads. I would try to moisturize it with coconut oil or tea tree oil but I think that is what made it worse.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case. Right now you have applied too much moisturizer (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Please apply Hydrocortisone cream two times a day for 10 days. If blisters or erosions are present then you may need oral steroid as well. Sometimes, a sulfa group of drugs shows photosensitivity and cross-reactivity to another agent as well. Apply sunblock regularly. Maintain good oral hygiene."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just had three wisdom teeth pulled three days back. I still have severe swelling in my face and neck. I have been having a fever since last night. I have a severe migraine for two days now. Could I have an infection?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your question I can understand your concern. As per your history, it looks like that you may be having post extraction infection. As you said, there is swelling, pain, and fever, all these symptoms lead to a conclusion of post-extraction infection. You need to take the following medication like tablet Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) 625 twice daily for five days, tablet Zerodol SP twice daily for three days. If you are having large swelling or any other associated medical or drug history let me know so that I may adjust your medication and dosage accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife was 5 months pregnant and yesterday she gave birth to a premature baby. The doctor has advised us to stay in the hospital for a long time. Is it advisable to do so? Shall I get her discharged from the hospital?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Do not get your wife discharged from the hospital until the doctor advises to do so.  A baby of just 5 months pregnancy is extremely premature. The baby is premature not only with respect to the age but also by the development of the respiratory system and brain.  Premature babies need tender care in the hospital. They can suffer from many health issues. These babies require nutritional support and prevention from infection. Apart from this, most of these babies develop apnea (cessation of breathing) due to the immaturity of their brain. Therefore, they need appropriate care in the hospital. So, you cannot take your baby home, till the baby accepts feed and does not need any medical support. At present, your baby definitely needs hospital care.

The pain of near ones makes you feel helpless. This weakens your strength somehow. Symptoms like lack of sleep, disturbance, and tension occur when you feel stressed for any reason. But you have to be strong for your brother. If you feel low, he will become worse and lose his willpower to fight the illness.

There is some red pus or something in his diaper. What could be the reason? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. The clinical features which you have mentioned indicate that your baby might have UTI (urinary tract infection) or urinary stone (less likely). A child with UTI will have a burning sensation during micturition (urination). UTI might cause hematuria (blood in urine). This is the cause for the red color in your child's diaper. UTI may or may not be associated with fever.

It is very small and white in color. Should I visit a dentist or will it be alright if I go for home remedies?","Doctor":"Hi. It would have been better if you had sent a clear photograph of the jaw and whether you did a filling of the tooth in the same area so that I can assess it properly. Still, with limited inputs, I feel it is a case of gingival abscess due to a diseased tooth or carious tooth. Yes, it needs dentists intervention if there is really a problem in tooth and if the tooth is fine, then you can get well with medication. Tablet Ofloxacin 290 mg, Ornidazole 500 mg BD for five days. Tablet Diclofenac 50 mg and Paracetamol 500 mg BD for three days. Mixed with Chlorhexidine 0.1 % twice daily for 15 days. Rinsing for only 15 seconds. This abscess will resolve in a few days but as I told, it is to be seen whether you have a carious tooth or filling or RCT treated tooth in the same region. If you have radiograph, you can send. But I am pretty sure you will get relief in three days after taking this medication."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Why am I sweating without a reason all the time especially when eating? Does that mean I need B12 as I already take pills but do not get any better? Will I get better or B12 is just to prevent from getting worse for the polyneuritis?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Sweating while eating is a phenomenon called gustatory sweating. It is a common symptom that occurs due to a neuronal trigger. It is very common in people with diabetes. With your medication listed, I can see that you are under treatment for diabetes. I understand that sweating can be a very annoying and embarrassing symptom. You are already taking B12 supplements for helping neuropathic symptoms. A better control of your blood sugar levels may help you to get relieved to some extent. If you are overweight, reduce your weight to see an improvement in symptoms. Try eating slowly and avoid spicy food. Other than this, there are other modes of treatment like anti-muscarinic injections, but I recommend that you try natural remedies first, because these injections have their side effects."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a cough that lasts for more than a month now.

I did not experience fever, pain in my stomach, and IBM. I have already taken Azithromycin for three days and Ambroxyl but still no relief. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello.  I can understand how troublesome it is if it is disturbing your sleep. These cough episodes you are having are mostly due to hyperactive airways. I would advise you certain investigations mentioned below. Also, I would like to know, if you get a cough after exposure to dust, pollens, or pets? Do let me know anything that might cause the worsening of your symptoms. Secondly, do you have heartburn or on and off cold? Bronchial asthma. Allergic bronchitis.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am taking Carbo vegetabilis 200C, Cantharis 200, Berberis vulgaris, Calcarea fluorica 12X, and Magnesium phosphoricum 12X.","Doctor":"Hi. The heaviness of breast can occur due to premenstrual symptoms. The heaviness of chest can occur because of bloating and acidity.

You can take Mercurius corrosivus 30. Take five pills every morning, noon, evening and night. Take Nux vomica 1m five pills at bedtime daily. Take Asafoetida 3x three tablet at morning, noon and evening. You will surely feel better by taking these medicines. Have a change in your food habit and sleep. It can help to recover soon.

I was waking up with fever and heartbeat rate of 90 to 95 whereas I am usually 55 to 60. I went to the dentist, he cleaned the area, took an X-ray and gave me Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium tablets (875 mg and 125 mg, respectively) twice a day for five days plus Paracetamol or Ibuprofen for the pain.

After five days of treatment, I think it should have been gone. If you can upload a picture of your X-ray and teeth involved in the mouth, I can provide you with a better treatment plan. Because periodontitis is infected by anaerobic bacteria and will not respond to Amoxiclav (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) that effectively.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Is this a cause of diseased teeth? Currently, I am on Esoz 40 and Telmekind H.","Doctor":"Hi I have read your complaint and the relevant details. My first question would be did you not visit back the dentist after the filling has been done? Because you are already informed that it has a split deep under which means the treatment cannot be just a filling. I wonder why the treatment was ceased half-way. The ideal treatment plan for a split or fractured tooth should be as follows: Now the swelling in the gum and the bad odor is because the tooth got decayed heavily and it is over a year. This is called necrosis similar to a dead tooth. The burning sensation and the white coating on the side of your tongue are because of the rubbing of the tongue over the sharp edges of the tooth. Now the only choice is to remove the tooth and since the friction causing factor is removed the tongue will get back to normal in few days after extraction.

You are not ovulating regularly, and so you have irregular periods for years. If there is a lactation, then there is a deranged prolactin level. Check your serum prolactin hormone and thyroid profile. If there is an abnormality, correct it soon. If you are taking any antidepressants or antipsychotics or any other drugs to regulate periods now, it requires a change.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

When standing, he bends his legs at knee point and also clenches his fists when grasping. From the looks, he seems okay. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Rickets can be due to vitamin D deficiency or hypophosphatemia. You did not tell me the phosphate level in blood of your child. The hypophosphatemic form of rickets is resistant to vitamin D supplement. As X-ray is normal, this is a remote possibility in your child. Alkaline phosphatase is very commonly found to be high in growing child. But it is also high in rickets. With treatment, ALP comes to within reference range. I suggest you continue with the Vitamin D and Calcium supplementation and get a phosphate level in your child's blood. Do not worry if minor deformities are present. Because these deformities will disappear as the child grows. But if the child cannot walk properly despite having a normal X-ray, and normal phosphate level, then consult with an orthopedic consultant. He will help your child by suggesting some good orthoses.

They both have seemed to have helped but unfortunately, I believe they are the cause of my severe acne, as the acne soon developed after beginning the inhalers. I was wondering if there is an alternative to these prescribed inhalers.","Doctor":"Hello. Did your doctor prescribe you to undergo a PFT or pulmonary function test accompanied with a reversibility with bronchodilator? If not, then before using inhalers, the diagnosis of bronchial asthma must be established. I suggest you stop the steroid inhaler for three months if your symptoms are not present at present and then you go to a pulmonologist and get your PFT done. For the time being, if the frequency of symptoms is less than one per month, you can take the Salbutamol inhaler on a required basis. For allergy, you can take the combination Monteleukast (10) with Levocetirizine (5) at bedtime for 15 days. Steroid inhalers although have few systemic adverse effects, should not be prescribed in the absence of an established diagnosis of bronchial asthma. If the diagnosis cannot be established even after thorough investigations and if symptoms are distressing, then one can advise a trial of a steroid inhaler. There is also a variant of asthma which is called cough predominant asthma which your doctor had thought you have, I guess. Lastly, gastroesophageal reflux is a very common cause of a chronic cough with a normal X-ray chest. so you can take a combination of Pantoprazole (40) with Domperidone (30) sustained-release before food for one month."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have had a canker sore on the inside of my bottom lip for a couple of months now.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

A difference of two to three days is possible depending on the position of the baby and the measurement of the caliper placement. Ideally, we recommend a first scan to know the exact dating and to calculate the expected due date (EDD).

I have been advised for removal of the cyst and to have a biopsy of the cyst for odontoma. I do not have pain and swelling. I visited a dentist before few months where I took an X-ray. We found a small dark area in the X-ray. It was an odontoma with an unerupted canine. It was confirmed again in a CBCT scan. The results came with a dentigerous cyst and odontoma. I am scared of the surgery done under GA. Is it necessary to remove the cyst? Surgeons suggest me different opinions. One oral surgeon is implying for removal of the cyst, odontoma and placing a plate on the canine. Another surgeon is recommending for the removal of the cyst and odontoma. Another dentist says me to wait and watch as it is asymptomatic. I am attaching my reports. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. If the cysts are small, they can be left untreated. But the problem is that the cysts can create an infection later. They can also cause more issues like tooth mobility, bone loss or any other transformation. So it is better to remove it. Odontomas are developmental. They also create problems when they are left untreated. But again, there are chances of cyst formation and expansion later. So, if the oral surgeon suggests for removal of the cyst, try to go for it. I have gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is better to remove the cyst. Currently, you do not have problems. If it is left untreated, it can form ameloblastoma in the future. You do not worry. These cysts are found in any person due to the impacted tooth."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 23 year old obese boy. My weight is 110 kg and I feel myself unfit.

According to your cycle length, your fertile days start from day-10 to day-20. This could be because of premenstrual symptoms. But, sometimes, the cycle length can vary.

My period is always regular and my expected date was in the first week the following month. I had uneasiness and fatigue by the end of last month. Left side upper abdominal pain started a week back. It comes occasionally and goes on its own. Occasionally, the pain shifted to right side upper abdominal pain, then lower left side abdominal pain etc. My periods did not appear on the expected date. I did a pregnancy test yesterday, but the result was negative. Since yesterday, my appetite has reduced. After having dinner, my abdominal pain started increasing and it only stopped after I intentionally puked out half of the food I ate. Today morning there was severe abdominal pain, periods like pain, and some drops of blood came out. After that I was revealed. Now the bleeding again stopped. Periods like pain persists and uneasiness after taking food. I wonder, whether I am pregnant and is that implantation bleeding. I read that the implantation bleeding occurs after seven to ten days of intercourse and before your missed period. In my case, there is a long gap and it is two days after the missed period. What could it be? I have no other symptoms of sore breast or nausea. Except, I feel fatigue especially in mornings and has become an early sleeper. I also have uneasiness after having food. No aversion or special interest to any food. But, not at all feeling hungry. Frequent periods like pain in the center lower abdomen. If there is a possibility of pregnancy, when can I again do a urine pregnancy test?","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms appear more of premenstrual syndrome and as you had a day of bleeding with on and off lower abdominal pain off and on. There is likelihood that your menses shall resume again in few days unless you have conceived. Urine pregnancy test is not sensitive until eight days post missed periods and hence it is advised that you should opt for a blood based serum beta-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) test to rule out pregnancy conclusively. If the hCG levels are less than 5 ng/dL then you are surely not pregnant. But if they are higher then you are surely pregnant and the bleed that you had was an implantation bleed possibly or an early sign of threatened miscarriage. So, please get a serum beta-hCG test done to have a clear idea with regards to possible pregnancy as you had sex during your fertile period.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Basically, because of exogenous testosterone, your body has stopped production of testosterone from testis resulting in testicular atrophy and hypogonadism. Do you have children? Are you married? I would like you to get a baseline hormonal assay which would help us for future reference. I will not prefer hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) and I would like to start you on Clomiphene citrate 25 mg every alternate day. Clomiphene is better than HCG. HCG can be given if there is no improvement with Clomiphene citrate. Exogenous steroids must be totally stopped.

So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months).

Also, there is a mild pain without blood while passing stool. I am worried about dark stool. Do you suspect stomach ulcer?","Doctor":"Hello. Dark and hard stool is because of constipation and not ulcer. Gastric ulcer will initially produce burning pain in the middle part of the upper abdomen and in very rare case bleeding occur from ulcer and then only stool become brown colored. Pain around the anus is also due to excessive straining to pass hard stool. In addition to your mentioned treatment, you should add stool softener to relieve strain during passing stool. Consult your specialist doctor and discuss with him or her. Once the constipation is relieved and then also you have dark stool, then you should get a stool examination for occult blood to check the microscopic amount of blood in stool and based on which further evaluation will be decided. Stool occult blood test, digital rectal examination and proctoscopy. Continue the same treatment and add stool softener.

I am preparing for a big exam so I am under some good amount of stress. I am burping a lot.","Doctor":"Hi. Our gastrointestinal tract has a forward propulsive movement (peristalsis) that moves the food material forward as it is digested, absorbed and finally expelled as feces. If somehow this movement gets hampered, food along with the digestive juices would stagnate, stomach acid will reflux into the food pipe and on the other hand, the bowel habits would not be proper. Degradation of undigested food in the intestines by the intestinal bacteria would lead to the excess gas formation. In order to relieve yourself, you need to do the following. Avoid spicy food, take small but frequent meals. avoid long gaps between meals. Avoid alcohol intake (if it is a part of your habit). Take Prilosec (Omeprazole) once daily before breakfast. Take plenty of green leafy vegetables as well as other sources of dietary fibers. Take fiber supplements like Isabgol or psyllium husk or senna. I would insist you to increase your dietary fiber intake. Regular morning walk and exercise to keep the bowel movements proper. Take curd or yogurt on daily basis. It contains beneficial bacteria and should help. Stress reduction has a very important role to play. Yoga and meditation should help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is 12 years old. She is constipated. Has not been able to have a bowel movement for about 10 days. She has been taking Metamucil, plus lots of prunes, pears, veggies, and generally healthy diet. Also drinking lots of water. Now she has been leaking grainy, liquid stool. This used to happen to her sometimes when she was younger and got constipated but has not happened for years. This morning I had her try a glycerin suppository but it did not help. She spoiled her underwear 5 or 6 times today. She will not be able to go to school tomorrow. I am wondering whether to try an enema or whether that could make things worse. She is incredibly frustrated and upset about missing school.","Doctor":"Hi. This is due to severe constipation. We need to find the cause of constipation in this kid. Common causes are functional (irregular bowel habits), less common causes are urinary tract infections-anatomic abnormalities. Patients who have anatomical abnormalities, present in early childhood, we need to do barium studies to rule out anatomical abnormalities. As we know that functional constipation is the most common cause. We need to clear her bowel with an adequate dose of laxatives (acute clearing and maintenance dose of laxatives) and modify the lifestyle to regularize the bowel habits. Most of the patients respond with our regimen. If does not she may need further evaluation in form of colonic motility studies. I will not recommend any investigation straight away. I want to see previous routine reports if already done. To follow. Polyethylene glycol (130 gm), one packet in two liters water over four hours, monitor stool consistency, it should be clear water at the end, if it is not clear, repeat same again on same day. Most of the children require 3 to 4 packers in two days duration. No need to worry about loose stools, that will stop after stopping of medicine. By the second day give Polyethylene glycol (17 gm sachet), three sachets at night time. Do not push with force while defecation, pass stool twice in a day, sit for 15 minutes (preferably after food intake). Continue high fiber diet and plenty of water. Local anesthetic gelly (Lignocaine gel) to apply locally (perianal region, before defecation), if she had pain. We need to see her blood hemoglobin profile, urine routine examination. According to that we may need to do tTGA, IgA.

An optimization of your therapy could help improve your situation. Regarding angiography or angioplasty, it can be performed in this clinical situation safely, if it is indicated by the doctor.

Most importantly, what is the color of her stool? Is your doctor told you anything about the liver whether it is big or normal?

Other common causes can be neonatal hepatitis or some metabolic disorder.

I had -4.5 R and 5.25 L before the surgery. I am now 31 and have developed some slight myopia (R - 0.25 and L - 0.50) and astigmatism. One thing I have always noticed was that both before LASIK and now, my left eye always seems a bit blurry when looking out of them separately (at a distance). At times, I feel that up close with my corrective lens on it is the reverse and my left is slightly clearer. I mean could this just be due to them being two separate organs and maybe my right eye has a higher visual acuity than my left eye at a distance? In addition, even without my glasses I can read things that my wife cannot at a distance. We had her vision checked thinking it must be myopia and she tested 20/20 or better. Though I do not really suffer from dryness, I use Similasan drops frequently throughout the day as a protective measure. I work long hours in the computer, probably for 12 or more a day. I have anti-glare coatings on my glasses. I asked my optometrist if I should be worried about the excessive time on a computer and he said as long as I am using the drops and resting my eyes every 20-30 minutes it should have no effect on my vision, as my issues are related to the length of my eyeball. Even though my prescription is weak, I have always been extremely sensitive to the difference in both eyes. I know it sounds absurd. Some things I do are lubricate, rest muscles, where my glasses which are anti-glare, etc., and have recently changed to lights in my working areas that mimic daylight.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

In secondary, there is a low level of FSH, LH, and testosterone. So you have secondary hypogonadism also called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Do a serum prolactin test. You are taking HMG (Menotropin) and HCG (Human chorionic gonadotrophin). It will gradually increase the testosterone level and testes size, which is small.

I am using Montelukast sodium and Levocetirizine. It prevents the symptoms. But when I stop taking it, the cough gets increased.","Doctor":"Hi. From your history, it is clear that you are suffering from allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma. To confirm it, you have to do a spirometry test that is PFT (pulmonary function test). If it is significant, then you must take a regular inhaler treatment. Montelukast and Levocetirizine help to control asthma. But the definitive treatment is inhaler therapy. You can start using Foracort inhaler 400 (Budesonide with Formoterol) two puffs twice daily with Zerostat VT spacer followed by gargling with cold water. Continue using Montelukast and Levocetirizine. Have a regular follow up with your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am 18 years old. I had sexual intercourse. We used contraceptives like a condom. But the condom got broked. I do not know whether the sperm has gone inside. I washed my genitals quickly after knowing that the condom has got broken. I took a pregnancy test, and it came negative. Can I put my trust in the pregnancy test or should I have to consult a doctor? Is it possible to get pregnant in two days after having sexual intercourse?","Doctor":"Hi. If you had intercourse around 10th to 17th day of your cycle, and if you have a regular menstrual cycle, then the possibility of conception increases with each day within that period when the condom has broken. In this situation, you can take an emergency pill within 72 hours of sexual intercourse to avoid pregnancy. Sperms can stay alive in the vaginal tract for up to seven days whereas the egg remains available for fertilization for 24 hours. In conception, you have to wait for at least a week to get a positive pregnancy test with urine dipstick. Serum beta hCG can be detected earlier, but you have to wait for a few days. You do not need to go to a doctor. Just repeat the urine pregnancy test after two weeks or get a blood pregnancy test done."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had unprotected sex during the last days of my periods when the bleeding had stopped. After a day, I started bleeding again in spots (not a lot). I have not taken a contraceptive pill yet. I am confused if I should take a pill or not. If I do not take a pill tomorrow, will it lead to pregnancy? Is there any chance of pregnancy or is it nothing to worry about?","Doctor":"Hi. It is normally happening as in the last third or fourth days the bleeding stops and after 12 hours, some spotting again is observed. It is usual. In case of activity, some pressure also locally develops and it can show spotting if residual is there and that still had to come in form of spotting in recent cycle 's end or in form of brown blood in the start of coming or next cycle. If you have been having irregular cycles and had intermenstrual or postcoital spotting previously then better to take I-pill for your satisfaction as you have not mentioned the complete history. In the case of cervical, endometrial polyp, any cervical pathology or endometriosis can have post-coital bleed, but for that also you have not given history."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was trying to put a condom on but I was doing it upside down then I flipped it and wore it. I am worried that while trying to put it in the wrong way, some semen might have got on to the condom. Is it possible to make her pregnant or the sperm dies in just a few seconds when they come in contact of the open air? I already had ejaculated once in my pants before. So it was not a precum that might have contacted the condom.","Doctor":"Hi. The sperm does not die as soon as they expose to open air. If the condom contains the sperm on the outer side, then it can cause pregnancy. As you mentioned that it was not just precum, but it was semen. So, if it was semen or sperm on the condom then they can cause pregnancy. If your partner was in her fertile period when you had sex, then there are chances of pregnancy. If she was not in the fertile period, then the pregnancy is unlikely. So, verify her fertile period.  Also, the emergency contraceptive pill can be used within 72 hours of sex, to avoid pregnancy. Ask her to check it, and you can also check for pregnancy when her period is due or almost after two weeks, that she is pregnant or not. If her pregnancy test return to be positive even then there is an option to terminate it, after consulting with your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a dark complexion person with age of 31 years and I am happy with the natural appearance but my all family members are fair complexion except me.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The pain appears to be localized to the upper back region towards one side. According to the age and symptoms, it can be myalgia (muscle pain). I would suggest you take a muscle relaxant like Thiocolchicoside for a couple of days twice daily. If the pain is severe, take Paracetamol or Aceclofenac tablet along with the muscle relaxant. Take Aceclofenac after having food and take the antacid tablet (Ranitidine or Pantoprazole) before taking food. Take good rest. Avoid doing any strenuous activities. It is good to avoid driving and sitting for long hours, sitting in wrong poses, and avoid using smartphones while lying down to sleep. Do a hot fomentation, and a pain relief balm or gel (Diclofenac ointment) can be applied. Take a bath in hot water, especially pour hot water over the area that has pain. Avoid taking cold foods and drinks. Avoid smoking. For a final diagnosis, you can do a chest X-Ray and an ECG to rule out the pulmonary conditions and heart-related issues respectively. You have to do them only if the above measures fail or if the pain aggravates. Please describe the nature of pain. Please say about the pain whether it is a shooting type or pinching type or dull aching. Please say whether the pain is intermittent or continuous.

You seem to be suffering from allergic rhinitis which is a form of hypersensitivity and it causes running nose. However this has an offending agent and when the allergen is avoided, the allergy subsides. To confirm whether it is allergy we can do two tests which includes absolute eosinophil count and serum IgE. The positive signal shows that you suffer from allergy. A negative in the above tests need not always rule out allergy. For allergic rhinitis, the accompanying symptoms are itching of eyes or nose, occasional nose block and sneezing multiple times. Next, constant running nose can be due to nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis, inverted papilloma, nasal malignancy, deviated nasal septum, etc. Please give me details regarding the following too: What is the color and consistency of nasal discharge? Is there any foul smell from the discharge? How you perceive smell?

Can I eat all kinds of non-vegetarian foods, curds, citric and acidic food, ice creams and chocolates? What has non-vegetarian food got to do with a dog bite? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hello. There are no dietary restrictions following a dog bite and you can eat whatever you like to have. Also, let me share a few facts after dog bite:- A 10 days quarantine for the dog that has bitten is generally followed. If the dog during this period if develops any personality change like aggressiveness or excitability or dullness or any paralysis the dog should be humanly killed. The most important is, one should clean the dog bite wound thoroughly, not to suture and get vaccinated. Avoiding non-vegetarian foods, onion and garlic following a dog bite is a social taboo and a misconception. There is no scientific explanation to explain the relation between the pathogenesis of rabies and what we eat to the extent of my knowledge. You can eat everything and just observe the dog.

It showed everything was normal and the endo lining was 8 mm and the uterus looked closed. I cannot find that report, but I know the uterus looked normal, just like on all my previous reports. I had my periods regularly for the next two months. I think I ovulated both times because I had all the signs and the temperature rise. Both periods were quite heavy and last one was a bit more on the hemorrhagic side, but not something to worry. I just noticed, it was more abundant and red than my normal and also less crampy and painful. No spotting or any other irregularities. Yesterday, cycle day 11, I went for an ultrasound to monitor my follicles and incidentally the doctor saw something in my endometrial lining, which she assumed was a polyp. The endo lining was 12 mm. I have attached images for your reference. The doctor was not worried about it, since it was so soon after the late abortion and she said maybe it will go away on its own and wait for two to three months. Although she said if it is a polyp then it will not go away. So, I am confused. Anyway, I have become very stressed over this, worrying that it is endometrial cancer and why else would a polyp grow so much and so quickly in just seven to eight weeks. On all my ultrasounds in the last years, no polyp was ever found or suspected and the image never looked like this. I am wondering how serious and worrisome for cancer this looks. Should I push for a hysteroscopy? I know that if it is cancer, I am going to lose my uterus and ovaries and never going to have a baby and I am terrified this will be the case. And I have read that up to 4% of endometrial polyps are cancer. My bad luck seems to never end. Also, could it be something other than an endometrial polyp, such as a placental polyp or a blood clot or a placental site nodule? I read about those online. I have taken a home pregnancy test and it was negative. So, I do not have much HCG in me anymore and I also ovulated normally and have a dominant follicle right now waiting to ovulate. I am just surprised that it is so soon after the miscarriage. Can you let me know your opinion? What does it look like to you on the ultrasound pictures? What should I do next?","Doctor":"Hi. From the ultrasound picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity) you have provided, it does not look like polyp in endometrium. In fact it looks like some collection such as fluid or blood in endometrial cavity, although the appearance of single static film can be deceiving. Polyp normally looks more hyperechoic (whitish). Even if it is polyp, there is no need to worry as many polyps come and go with menstrual bleeding and as you said there is 96% chance of it not being cancer. I always like to look on positive side. So, there is no need to hurry for hysteroscopy. Chance of polyp being endometrial cancer is very low especially if it occurs after abortion or childbirth as your endometrium had more than sufficient exposure to progesterone to prevent cancer. If you are feeling physically fit to carry pregnancy and of course if hemoglobin has come back to normal, there is no contraindication for conception. But, my recommendation would be to wait for at least one more month. If polyp is seen again in next midcycle scan, we can plan hysteroscopy in future and there is no need to think about it right now.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I hope there will not be any major side effects because I am not taking any other contraceptive pills. Also, I do not want to use a condom. I read that the contraceptive pill should be started on the first day of the periods and taken one pill daily for 21days. But, my periods got over before 15 days. Can I start the contraceptive pill for 21 days from today?","Doctor":"Hello. You are already in your fertile period as on date and likely to have ovulated already. If you have been involved with unprotected sex, then you should take an I-pill within 72 hours of the intercourse and need not repeat the I-pill every time you have sex in this cycle. One I-pill shall be enough because in the next five to seven days post I-pill intake you should receive your withdrawal bleed and that would indirectly ensure that you are safe from getting pregnant. It would mark the start of fresh cycle and then you can be started on low dose oral contraceptive pills from day 2 of your fresh cycle, which would be the day 2 of the withdrawal bleed following I-pill. I-pill does have side effects and it can cause irregularity of your next two to three cycles making the cycles scanty or heavier. More than one I-pill in a month should be avoided and it should only be used for emergency contraception purpose and not otherwise. You may also consider female diaphragms or cervical caps if you do not prefer male condoms for protection. These are female condoms, which are safe as well and act as a barrier contraceptive.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I had braces for two and a half years for upper teeth only, and I still wear my retainer every night. I recently got veneers on my upper six front teeth, so my dentist had to make a couple of adjustments to my retainer. For about two months the retainer was good, but recently in the morning when I take my retainer out, one or two of my veneers seem to move and when I bite they click back into place. I went to my dentist, but he assured me that everything is fine. He also said that if it bothers me so much, then I should see my orthodontist about getting a new retainer. As an experiment, I wore my retainer for about a week (day and night) and throughout that time, I did not have any movement issues. Then when I switched back to only night-time wear, it started happening in the mornings again. I am worried that my teeth are being damaged and that they are going to fall out randomly one morning.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Gradually, over the past two years, I have been seeing a change in my ejaculation. At the point of orgasm, the ejaculate no longer comes out. But this is definitely not retrograde ejaculation. The ejaculate gets stuck at the root of the penis. If I apply pressure with my finger at the outward facing root of the penis, and scoop upwards with my finger about 1 inch, the stuck ejaculate makes it round that bend and is expelled. If I time this right with orgasm, it can expel with normal force. What is this condition known as, what is the remedy, and is it related or unrelated to Dutasteride?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query, I would like to know a few more details about your symptoms. How is your urinary flow, do you have to strain? Have you had any endoscopic procedure or catheterization done in your urethra? Are you only on Dutasteride or do you take alpha-blockers as well? Why were you prescribed Dutasteride at 35 years of age? The process of ejaculation requires a coordinated connection on the muscles surrounding the root of the urethra to expel the semen.

I cannot be certain, but it appears that there is an issue in the same in your case. There is no specific name for the condition though.  Also, 35 is a very early age for you to have prostatic enlargement large enough to be on Dutasteride.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I went into my dentist this past week to get it smoothed out (very minor) but he also noticed a horizontal fracture across the middle of my front tooth. He does not want to jump into anything too quickly so said just to watch it and if it cracks off he will cap it. Since then I have noticed only when I put pressure on the tooth to bite down I have discomfort, but nothing constant. Should I be concerned about the pain? Is there anything I can do to help protect the fracture like having a sealant put on? And should I be concerned about the idea of a cap changing the way my face looks (looking unnatural, wanting to continue whitening my teeth, etc.)?","Doctor":"Hi. I had gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  As per your history, you had a recent tooth damage with microfracture, that means you have been put on the wait and watch. If your tooth is vital after a month or two and fracture has not widened, you do not need any treatment. If there is any discoloration or pain than the crown is the option. Nowadays the crown are totally in compliance with your dental shade and it does not looks artificial in any case if done properly.  If you can upload a picture of the broken tooth taken in natural light, I can tell you does it need an immediate treatment. As of now, I do recommend you to use fluoridated toothpaste. Also, keep your teeth clean by brushing at least twice daily because chipped off teeth are highly prone to caries or cavities."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I often get a mouth ulcer which is in the form of oval shape and white in color.

If any one of the following has happened during the injury, you will need tetanus followup: I advise you to take the tetanus injection (tetanus toxoid vaccine) as soon as possible.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

It started when I was in grade school, I got nose bleed when it is very hot, or when the air is dry and it only happens once a month or once every two months. For the past three months, I got frequent nosebleed for two to four times a week. I am doing the basic list to prevent it such as, lean a bit forward, pinch the nose, put ice packs, and use petroleum jelly. But the thing is, it is stressing me out. I panic when I see blood, I have asthma as well and I do not think that petroleum jelly can help me with it. I am taking vitamin C (500 mg) per day, and I use Seretide 250 (Diskus) for my asthma. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I hope you are doing well. I understand your concern. I assure you that you need not be worried. Epistaxis or nasal bleeding is a very common condition and has been reported to occur in up to 60 percent of the general population. Most nosebleeds are not serious and can be handled easily as you have mentioned. Most will stop on their own or with simple first aid actions. Common causes of epistaxis are local causes such as chronic sinusitis, nose picking, foreign bodies, intranasal neoplasm or polyps, irritants (e.g., cigarette smoke), medications (e.g., topical corticosteroids), rhinitis, septal deviation, etc. If the nose bleed is related to an injury, you should be assisted in finding medical assistance urgently. Some people may be taking medications that make them more prone to bleeding. These people should also seek care urgently. Signs and symptoms include bleeding from one or both nostrils, bleeding in the back of the throat, causing the victim to vomit blood. First Aid Interventions: Sit upright and lean forward. Spit out blood that collects in the back of the throat or mouth. Pinch the nose firmly. Use your thumb and index finger to pinch your nostrils shut. Breathe through your mouth. Continue to pinch for 5 to 10 minutes. Local drops such as Oxymetazoline or Phenylephrine solution can be helpful. To prevent re-bleeding, do not pick or blow your nose and do not bend down for several hours after the bleeding episode. During this time remember to keep your head higher than the level of your heart. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My 2.5 years old is having a wet cough and running nose (no fever).

I suffer from moderate hypertension and diabetes since last eight years but always in control of medicines. Last year I had undergone angiography as an age-based test and symptom of pain on starting walking short distance a few meters. Many times it does not, in a mid-thoracic area of the upper back and epi-gastro area. But things were seen normal except for a small branch which was 100 % clogged but the cardiologists said it does not matter. This problem of feeling pain when walk some meters started four years back. It is surprising that if I jog stationary position for even two minutes no pain. Now since a few days when I lie down on the bed also the pain starts but not in sitting position. So an MRI was recommended and I underwent MRI of the spine with contrast. The report is in brief here:  Under report one MRI dorsal spine, spine curvature straightened. Generalized spondylotic changes were seen in form of osteophytes and disc desiccation at multiple levels seen in the form of loss of hyperintense signal on T2W images. Rest normal. Report 2 MRI cervical spine with contrast: spine curvature straightened. Generalized spondylotic changes were seen in form of osteophytes and disc desiccation at multiple levels see I in the form of loss of hyperintense signal on T2W images. Diffuse broad-based posterior and bilateral foraminal disco-osteophyte protrusion seen at C4/5, 5/6, and 6/7 levels having left propensity and causing compression of bilateral exiting C5,6,7 nerves root in their respective foramina. Rest normal. Report 3 MRI thorax with contrast: fibrotic band seen in left basal lung parenchyma. Rest all normal. Report 4 MRI lumbosacral with contrast: spinal curvature is straightened. Generalized spondylotic changes were seen in form of osteophytes and disc desiccation at multiple levels seen in the form of loss of hyperintense signal on T2W images. Diffuse broad-based posterior and bilateral foraminal disc bulge with posterocentral disc protrusion seen at L5/S1 level indenting the thecal sac and compressing bilateral traversing S1 nerve roots.  12 years back, I had L4/L5 disc bulge problem stenosis and sciatic nerve type pain in leg left and burning sensation and pinpricks in feet of both legs. I was about to go for surgery but an osteopath corrected this with manipulations for 5 to 6 days and signs abated. Till then this part is fine. But now there is some pain or mild sensation sometimes in legs. I sit long hours on the computer and am academician so have a sedentarylife. I also have GERD type problem. It is also noted by me that if I continue walking for a few days by stopping frequently then after a few days pain does not occur or come after long walks.

I appreciate your detailed history. The symptoms you have described are suggestive of neurogenic claudication due to the neuro-foraminal stenosis and disc bulges in the spine.

The key is to suppress the allergic cell release. If not controlled you may need a short course of steroids. Steroids work like magic in these diseases, but it is bound to relapse once you stop it.

I do not have pain or swelling, but whenever I touch the root of the upper teeth on the gums, I feel a sensation. Can an oral and maxillofacial surgeon extract the two concerned teeth and then remove the cysts? I am scared of an enucleation surgery. I am attaching the OPG.","Doctor":"Hello. The OPG (attachment removed to protect patient identity) shows a cystic lesion extending from your upper right canine to the last molar. Maxillary sinus floor is also involved. Enucleation is a surgical procedure to remove the cystic lesion, depending on the cyst size and location. It can be done under local anesthesia or general anesthesia. The treatment of a cyst involves following steps. Teeth in the cystic area will be checked for tooth vitality and mobility. If the teeth are not grossly decayed, then root canal treatment will be done for the concerned teeth. If multiple teeth are involved (in your case canine to molar is in the cystic area), splinting will be done to stabilize your teeth during surgery. Then cyst enucleation is done. There are different methods available now for filling the bone cavity after cyst enucleation to improve and accelerate healing. OPG is not conclusive for a maxillary posterior region pathology. CBCT of maxilla gives the best picture regarding the size, location, association with adjacent structures, bone quality, and tooth prognosis. Due to the thickness and curvature of the lower jaw, OPG will not give a clear picture. For that, you have to take an intraoral periapical radiograph (IOPA).

It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I also got an ELFA test after three months post my last exposure, which was also non-reactive. I had a qualitative EDTA plasma HIV-1 RNA PCR test four months post my last exposure with a minimum assay range of 35 copies per ml. The reports said viral load not detected.

After taking antibiotics, I had neurological reactions to them. They are memory loss, brain fog, and had concentration problems. Later on, we discovered that I have sensitivities to a lot of medications and chemical sensitivity. So I would like to explain the EEG report which was done during my reactions to antibiotics and brain problem. Can antibiotics slower the brain activity? My EEG report showed these results. My essential activity was appropriate. I had a relaxing and intermittent alpha rhythm with a frequency of 9 to 10 Hz and an amplitude of 30 V. There was alpha activity occurring intermittently from my parietal region to the temporal and central areas. The diffuser was the interpolated low-amplitude beta rhythm. My reaction to closing and opening the eyes was appropriate. A central and temporal had an intermittent rhythmic theta activity with a frequency of 6 Hz. Temporal and frontotemporal are rare theta waves or a tiny group of theta waves. During my deep breathing, I had no response to waves. The phenomenon of tracing was reflected during IFS.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There is a critical finding seen. You have a slow activity (theta waves) in the temporal and frontotemporal lobe. It correlates with the memory problems, and for the confusion you had. Coming to the point, I would recommend repeating the EEG (electroencephalography) after some weeks after taking the antibiotics. It may be a temporary brain dysfunction due to a possible allergic reaction or a metabolic disorder. We cannot say that taking antibiotics slows the brain activity, but it causes a temporary malfunction of the brain, probably due to cell swelling or cell dysfunction (electrolyte imbalance)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 30 years old male.

An ultrasound scan was performed and they found two heterogeneous ovarian cysts, one on the right is 1.5 cm and the other on the left is 1.4 cm. There were multiple simple cysts. My endometrial lining was 6 mm. They said everything else looked good. I have a history of ovarian cysts. Do heterogeneous cysts happen before or after ovulation? Do they impact menstruation? Also, what is the difference between heterogeneous and homogeneous ovarian cysts?","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, 1.5 cm and 1.4 cm are a very small size for a cyst. Because, in every cycle around ovulation one of your ovary makes around 3 cm follicle (cyst). In a sonography, if it looks clear without any shadow in the cyst, then it is homogeneous and when something is found floating in the cyst as echoes (shadow), then it is called heterogeneous. Homogeneous have clear fluid. In heterogeneous cyst, the shadow may be due to blood, pus cells, epithelial cells, other debris, hormones, enzymes or turbid fluid.  In 1.5 cm and 1.4 cm sized small cysts, it is not so much important that whether it is heterogeneous or homogeneous because it is mostly going to disappear around your period. Before ovulation, mostly follicles are with clear fluid. After ovulation, it may be homogeneous or heterogeneous with decreased size. Actually, it looks like disappearing follicle and not a cyst. A cyst can disturb your cycle only if it is of a bigger size and remains even after menstruation. Mostly it begins from unruptured follicle during ovulation and the size can be from 4 cm to 11 cm or even bigger in some case. This type of cyst requires treatment.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

The wound on your nose will heal fairly quickly, and your breathing is likely to improve shortly after the procedure. However, the overall healing process can be slow.

I am not sure if it really is a cardiac problem or some other. I quit smoking last year. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Hope you get alright soon. For more information consult a cardiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 31year old male. I was recently diagnosed with minor gastritis after EGD. I was having stomach problems but have recovered at present. Last two weeks I have been having some chest discomfort. ECG and other tests show normal heart function. Since two days, the chest sensations are more prominent mostly while moving. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Since you have mentioned that ECG and other tests came out to be normal, it is not associated with any cardiac abnormality. As you have a history of gastritis confirmed through EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy), there is more possibility of association with acid reflux. Acid causes irritation of esophagus and leads to inhibition of vagal tone (vagus nerve supply to the heart) resulting in increased heart rate. This in turn leads to palpitation, chest discomfort, burning sensation etc.  I advise you to follow these: Another possibility is that you could have some muscle spasm/pull if this sensation is pain. If there is pain during movement of chest then you can take some muscle relaxant like Chlorzoxazone in combination with some pain killer. The word chest discomfort indicates that it could be palpitation (feeling of one's own heart beat which usually occurs when the heart rate increases), tightness in the chest, burning sensation or chest pain. If the discomfort persists, revert back with details like dietary habits, blood pressure and medical reports to a cardiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My father who is 79 years of age has got prostate tumor.

Your father has apparently a stage I penile cancer. The ideal management is surgery which may only involve a wide local excision. This can be done by a general surgeon or even a dermatologist who can perform skin surgery.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As per the history, most likely you have severe gastritis with overlapping esophageal spasm and gastroesophageal reflux. It is because the stomach acids regurgitate back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and severe burning sensations. Dyspepsia can be a sign of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Dyspepsia can also be a sign of a stomach ulcer or gastritis, which is an inflammation of the lining of your stomach. I suggest you get an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, to rule out any erosion of esophageal mucosa or Barrett's esophagus or ulcers. I suggest you try the following. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. If your symptoms are not relieving, please discuss with your primary physician. To be on the safe side, I would suggest getting an EKG (electrocardiography) done because sometimes atypical angina can present with same symptoms.

I have reviewed your complete history and understand that you have ongoing infection within the lower part of your large bowel which is called as rectum. Medically it is termed as proctitis i.e. inflammation of rectum. The blood and mucus - which you describe a whitish layer, is common among patients suffering with proctitis.  I have seen you have taken some antibiotics however it seems the durarion of antibiotics was not okay and Ciprofloxacin that you have been prescribed is no more effective in.your case. Other acid suppressant medications would not help you much in problem relating to rectum. So, I want you to start a 3 week course of antibiotic which is very safe and does not have significant side effects except in some patient it could cause mild diarrhea. It is very safe. Tablet Rifxamin 200 mg thrice daily for 3 weeks. Avoid any other medications.  You come back to me in next 1 to 2 week. I hope that your symptoms by then would go away. In case, if that does not happen, then I would ask you to get some stool and blood tests done and would further modify your treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Recently, I found a little flesh on the wrinkly part of my anus and also near the perineum but connected to the anus.

Is it fine to use white noise to calm him? Is it fine to breastfeed him while I am having a fever? I am expressing milk sometimes and feeding him through a bottle. Can I express milk and store for future usage? If so how long can I store and use it? I am having one or two cups of coffee each day does this effect the baby through milk? Also, my milk production is less and depending more on formula milk. Please advise me.","Doctor":"Hi. From your history, it seems you are taking excellent care of the child. Good. Now for your queries. Children below the age of 6 months sleep in the day and stay awake at night. It is normal. There is no medicine for the same. As regards to consoling a baby, you can use white noise (no dependency or harm) or whisper songs in the babies ear, give the baby pacifier (no issue of taking in the air or anything like that. The child is anyways going to pass gas like a big person. It is normal). Swing the baby in a light to and fro motion, swaddle the baby in some cloth wrapping. Important point: Another reason for the child to keep crying continuously may be poor feeding. As you have mentioned, the milk production is less, it is expected since you are under stress. So do not worry. Also, you can try giving breastfeeding first followed by top feeds. If the child is still hungry the child will consume the top feeds. Let the child consume as much as it wants. Advisable to avoid breastfeeding while having a fever as you may transmit the organism by close contact with the baby. In such cases, you can give expressed milk or top feeds. Use a mask when coughing if you are feeding the baby. Yes, you can theoretically store milk at room temperature up to three hours, fridge up to 12 hours and deep freezer up to 24 to 48 hours minimum. However, I personally do not advise to do this because there are chances the milk may get contaminated by the various organisms in the surroundings of the house.  There is no effect of coffee on the milk taken by the baby. Golden rule: Sleep when the baby sleeps and stay awake when the baby is awake for at least the first few months if you want to have peace of mind."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have enlarged prostate and some lesion on the prostate. The report has been attached. For the past four years, I have been suffering from urinary tract infections and kidney stones and my life is very much disturbed.

But during this problem, he remains unconscious. He does so only when he is in deep sleep. We consulted a doctor locally and he suggested MRI of the brain and EEG. He also prescribed some medicines and said that he will have to take the medicines for at least three years, and then only the problem can be cured and also suggested that he should not sleep for more than six hours at night. So I want to seek your opinion in this regard and what is the disease and could it be cured? Also advice on the medicines prescribed by our local doctor and any other precautions to be taken.","Doctor":"Hi. The diagnosis seems to be correct (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It indeed looks like epilepsy. Sometimes, the cause is unclear. Sometimes it is due to an underlying genetic problem. However, MRI being normal there is no need for any kind of surgical treatment for this problem. EEG is abnormal and he would definitely require antiepileptic treatment for 2 to 3 years at least. After that, repeat EEG and see for improvement. If no seizure recurrence during these three years, then antiepileptics can be tapered off."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I feel irritated on deep thinking about people who are cheating me.

I have three queries.I procrastinate a lot. Is it psychological? Can it be rectified?I have low self-esteem. Things which happened in my past keep coming to my mind and it hurts me. My mum has told me that I am a good for nothing and I cannot do anything. Is there a way out from feeling so worthless?My husband is an awesome guy. He is very caring and kind. He is the perfect match for me except the fact that he is not interested in sex. Right from when we got married, he never was interested in sex. He has sex when I force him too much and for having kids. Is it due to a low amount of testosterone in him? Can it be rectified via a testosterone injection? If that is the case, will he be interested in sex only or will his whole personality change? He is very emotional and helps out with everything. I do not want that to be changed.Thanks for your time.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. 1 & 2. A lot of individuals have the habit of procrastinating. If there are no other associated symptoms, we cannot label this as psychological. You have mentioned that you have low self-esteem and you think a lot about past. Sometimes, you feel worthless and these symptoms might be associated symptoms. Delaying anything without any reason could be due to lack of motivation, initiative or judgment. This should be properly evaluated. This might be due to underlying mood disturbance. Mild depression can cause similar presentation. If there are no such symptoms and you just have the issue of procrastination, then this is not an alarming thing. Try to remain relaxed, make a proper routine of your day to day activities and follow that routine. This will help improve the functioning. Once you are engaged in your routine, the problem of feeling worthless will also go. Try to get pleasure by finishing the work on time and this will motivate you to do more and ultimately the worthlessness symptoms will go. 3. You have mentioned that your husband is an awesome guy and is emotionally very supportive. But, one issue is that he is not very interested in sex. If he has low interest in sex but during sex, if he is getting good erections, then I do not think there is a problem of low testosterone. I hope he is not overweight and has mesomorphic build. In obese individuals, low testosterone could cause problems. Still, to get a clear picture, you can talk with him and get his serum testosterone and prolactin levels done. This will rule out any hormonal cause. Testosterone injections are given for hypogonadism and this will improve the libido and erection of individual. You can give him herbal medicines containing supplements like L-arginine and yohimbine. Both these supplements will increase his libido and erection. You can find these in supplements stores.

Sometimes, the TSH value rises to 100. He has been on Levothyroxine or Eltroxin 100 mcg for the last 17 to 18 years now. Lately, he was hospitalized for emergency due to low heart rate and breathlessness. After many tests like Holter test, the bradycardia or arrhythmia was seen.","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, from the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) it appears that he is having bradycardia and sinus arrhythmia, but no tachycardia. So, according to me, electrophysiology (EP) studies may be helpful, but not necessary. It could be due to thyroid illness as well. Your father's TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) is slightly elevated and not very common to cause bradycardia at this TSH levels. Before going ahead, I think the dose of Thyroxine should be increased to 125 mcg and get TSH levels in normal range. Another possibility is sick sinus syndrome (sinoatrial node disease) if it persists after normalizing thyroid level. Treatment of which is pacemaker and EP study is not necessary if established he should go for it. You have mentioned about Epsolin (Phenytoin) to control heart rate. He already has low heart rate, so this should be reconfirmed. Because, he will need medicines to increase heart rate like Deriphyllin, Alupent (Metaproterenol), Asthalin (Salbutamol), etc., and not decrease heart rate.

He has been having severe stomach pain for weeks and now he has lost a lot of weight. Since being on insulin his feet have become swollen, and his eyes yellow. Prior to insulin, he was on Metformin but his blood sugar was still high. Now he is suffering more, I really do not know what to do now. Please help. Should he go back to Metformin?","Doctor":"Hi. From your history, it seems your father is suffering from uncontrolled Diabetes mellitus for seven months or more which was not controlled with Metformin. The present complaints you have mentioned after starting insulin, may not be actually related to insulin rather may be due to uncontrolled diabetes or else a systemic disease most probably involving liver in view of jaundice. Or even a renal problem can cause the same because he is on pain killers (Ibuprofen) which may effects negatively to kidneys in such patients. First, stop Ibuprofen at the earliest. Make sure insulin is injected at proper site, rule out insulin site infections. Rule out kidney and liver involvement by doing RFT (renal function test) and LFT (liver function test) along with blood routine. Why insulin was directly started after Metformin is also a doubt? There are many good oral tablets which are stronger than Metformin that may be tried before insulin if no contraindications. Weight loss may be due to uncontrolled sugars which are signified by blood sugars postmeal. Liver function test. Renal function test. Complete blood count with ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). HBA1c (glycated hemoglobin). Proper diabetic diet. Regular aerobic exercises for 30 minutes per day. Insulin maybe continued-special care on storage, site of injection, methods of injecting. May be shifted to anti-diabetic tablets once the patient is stable."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

When I consulted doctors, many opinion like angioplasty were given. Do I need to go for an angioplasty? Without medicine, food controller, and exercise, can I reduce TGL to 60 to 170?","Doctor":"Hello. I guess you did not have any chest pain or any shortness of breath. Need for angiography and angioplasty depends not on the lipid level but on other tests like ECG and echo which helps to predict the possibility of blockages, and whether you had any chest pain or not. Also, the need for angiography depends on troponin level as well which is a marker of heart attack, which is elevated there (attachment removed to protect patient identity). So if it is truly elevated, then you will need an angiography. So overall, you need to undergo ECG, echo as well and if they show any abnormalities, then you will need angiography.

Next, you need to be on medications for both deranged lipid profile like Rosuvastatin, Fenofibrate, maybe Aspirin and for deranged sugars.

I am having this issue where my tongue is red in the middle and painful when it is pushing around spit or food or when it is pushing itself to the roof of the mouth. I have a burning sensation. It is hardly noticeable in the morning but by evening it is irritating and it hurts again. The tongue is also much whiter than normal and it retains the colors of what is eaten. For example, something red stains the tongue. There is no pain when talking or when the tongue is simply resting. I have been to an ENT specialist recently for this. Diagnosis is median rhomboid glossitis caused by suspected candidiasis. This is pending culture. I am currently on Voriconazole 200 mg two times daily for 14 days. I am on the verge of completing the course, but I see no results. I had a similar issue last year but it did not look like this. I ended up having strep which may have caused the issue. So, I had a rapid strep test which came back negative. I have also been to a general practician and got Nystatin swish and swallow for seven days with no results. I was then put on Diflucan for 14 days, yet no results. I have a past history of ulcerative colitis which is controlled. I am currently using Humira for colitis (one pen) twice monthly.

I am 25 years old. My height is 5 feet and 2 inches. I weigh about 127 kg. I have underactive thyroids, but they are not treatable by NHS standards. I have a mixed connective tissue disorder. Currently, I have a contraceptive implant and constant vitamin D deficiency. I am fairly active, as I have to run around for my disabled mother, as well as lift a 55 kg mobility scooter in and out of a car daily. Also, my TSH was 3.25 and my T4 was 13.5.But, for the last two to three years, I have been getting a lot of pain behind my left eye, to the point that I feel like taking it out would be the only release of pain. However, putting pressure on it helps a little. I also tend to get a dull pain or a headache in the base of my skull, at the top of my neck. But that may be due to a bad bed and pillows. I have had it tested by two opticians. One of them said that I should get checked for MS, which my doctors and neurologist scoffed at, and the other said he could not see any symptoms of a tumor. The only thing that seems to take the edge off the pain is strong co-codamol 30/500. I have also noticed recently that sometimes I do lose grip in my dominant hand, and sometimes struggle to put sentences in the right order, or just lose my balance. I also struggle to eat and sometimes feel sick after eating, even more so if I eat in the morning. But, my doctors do not seem to care about my eye at this point.

I noticed peripheral flashes when blinking and walking and quick black narrow lines. I saw an ophthalmologist. He found the retina to be fine. I now have some flashes around peripheral in the right eye and a new large annoying floater, no curtain or loss of vision. Talked to an ophthalmologist last night. Said not to move eyes much. Should I go to ER? No vision loss. Just flashes and fast moving stringy floaters and flashes when moving eyes and walking.","Doctor":"Hi. The hollow of the eye is filled with vitreous jelly. With aging, the jelly starts to liquify and separates from its attachments to the retina. This results in a little tug on the retina, resulting in flashes. This phenomenon is known as posterior vitreous detachment or PVD in short. The large floater appears when the PVD is complete, that is, it detaches from its final strong attachment on the optic nerve head in the retina. What you are experiencing is normal aging of the vitreous jelly. Now in this process, sometimes breaks may form in the retina leading to floaters. Floaters may be due to the cells from the back of the retina gaining access to the vitreous cavity through the breaks in the retina. Sometimes floaters may result when the break involves a retinal blood vessel. It is extremely important to get a dilated fundus examination done on an urgent basis to rule out any of the breaks. If found, they can be lasered to prevent further progression to complete retinal detachment. So kindly do see a retina specialist. Let me know how it went. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am bipolar with OCD. I also suffer from psychotic symptoms and also and I currently smoke a nicotine vape which I feel is keeping my moods stable and psychosis at bay. The only problem is that I feel my OCD is much worse. Could this be due to the nicotine in the vape? I would like to give up but worried I will become unstable. Is it possible the vape is making my OCD symptoms worse? I am currently on 75 mg of Chlorpromazine and a low dose of Diazepam for panic attacks.","Doctor":"Hello. Nicotine smoke could increase the stress and might make OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) symptoms worse. You have to stop this. You are on Chlorpromazine for mood and psychotic symptoms but there is no specific drug to control anxiety and obsessive thoughts. Drugs like Fluoxetine should be added to your prescription in order to improve the OCD symptoms and anxiety. A low dose can be used safely in bipolar disorder too. Please talk to your psychiatrist about this."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I need your opinion regarding my future pregnancy.

However, there was a small thin area covered by serosa, with a blood clot underneath. The rupture extended along the upper right side into the right broad ligament and round ligament. The incision was closed in two layers, and most of the extension areas were closed and imbricated in two layers as well.'

The moment I was given the injection, my body developed rashes, redness, and itching. My doctor immediately gave Avil injection after which rashes and redness subsided. Two days back, I again had got indigestion problems after a week of having junk food outside. This time I had Pan D tablet, but this time after an hour I developed rashes, itching, and the whole body turned red. I again went to the 24/7 hospital and the doctor again injected Avil after which the redness and itching subsided. The doctor also told me never to take Pantoprazole tablets as I am allergic and reacting very badly. Now, I have been given Rantac and I have no problems now. So, here are my questions: As my doctor told PAN tablets will be regularly prescribed for other illness too to avoid acidity and other stomach ailments, do I have to tell that I have Pantoprazole allergy whenever I visit a doctor?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The success of emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) like an I-pill or unwanted-72 remains 99 percent when the withdrawal bleeding is experienced within next 5-7 days thereby ruling out pregnancy completely due to shedding of endometrium.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For the last nine months, I am facing this problem. I never had this type of hair fall or any hair fall before. Where I stay, there was hard water, so I started using drinking water for bathing. A few months later, I got to see some less hair fall than before which is around 30 hair strands a day. So now I cannot have my previous hairstyle and I can see some small patches in my crown corner. But the thing is that I do not think my new hair is growing vigorously. I got worried when I see four to five strands in my pillow cover every morning and most importantly my hairs are thin which falls and some dandruff problems nowadays. As I got no family history in baldness, I am so anxious about this issue. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Hair fall can mainly be divided into two types, you can have increased shedding or thinning of hair. Increased shedding means seeing more than 50-100 hairs falling per day. Less than that is a normal hair fall cycle and usually grows back. Increased shedding can happen because of dietary deficiencies, stress, high fever, water change, harsh shampoos, dandruff. Since you are noticing patches of emptiness most likely it is thinning or male pattern baldness. This can happen due to genetics and male hormone testosterone acting on the roots. Smoking, thyroid issues, and consuming whey protein can accelerate it. By genetics, it need not necessarily mean your father or mother, it could be uncles or grandparents as well. Minoxidil is the treatment of choice for patterned balding. Also, checking up for deficiencies like serum ferritin, vitamin D, and B12 and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) will help. Photographs are needed to exactly identify if you are having patterned balding and accordingly treatment can be started."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Our baby is 16 days old and is suffering from jaundice.

Lady can have a bleeding vaginally, when their hymen memberane rupture. Clinically we see bleeding, which can be mild spotting to heavy bleeding.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out.

Before seven months, I have developed right epididymitis and right spermatic cord hardness like stone. It was diagnosed as epididymo-orchitis. There was a superficial abscess on the right side. Incision and drainage have been performed before two months. Still, I am having some pinching pain and hardness in the spermatic cord. Currently, I take Amoxicillin 500 mg twice daily. In the past, I had Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin and Tazobactam. I had a CBC, tumor markers, urinalysis, urine culture and biopsy of the wound. All the reports were normal.","Doctor":"Hello Your present condition cannot be attributed to the inguinal hernia repair done six years ago. May I know what kind of repair was done? Either laparoscopic or open repair? Acute epididymo-orchitis is a clinical syndrome consisting of pain, swelling and inflammation of the epididymis, with or without inflammation of the testes. Chronic epididymitis refers to epididymal pain and inflammation (usually without scrotal swelling) that lasts for more than six months. Symptoms of discomfort and pain at least 3 months in duration in the scrotum, testicle or epididymis are localized to one or each epididymis on clinical examination may be considered as chronic epididymitis. The most common route of infection is local extension and is mainly due to infections spreading from the urethra (sexually transmitted infections - STIs) or from the bladder that is UTI (urinary tract infection) and prostatitis. Your symptoms for the last 5 months can now be considered as chronic or acute progressed to chronic epididymitis. The causes include infections like Chlamydial, tuberculous and also post-infectious. Do you have any history of diabetes, recurrent UTI, BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) with prostatitis, cystitis or STDs? For diagnosis, you need to get the following tests: The treatment includes both conservative and surgical. The conservative part includes antibiotics once the culture report arrives, NSAIDS (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or narcotic analgesics like Tapfree (combination of Tapentadol and Paracetamol). The surgical treatment is epididymectomy. For further information consult a urologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 25 year old female. I am 9 months pregnant with a severe toothache.

I had minor discomfort the next few days while swelling went down. There has been no discoloration. I have been able to go to the bathroom fine. There is now a pea size lump around or in the veins or arteries that causes minor pain when pressure is applied. It is firm but soft at the same time. What could this be?

You have had a blunt trauma to your scrotum almost a week back and since then have had a decrease in the swelling and no urinary complaints which are good signs. Was there ever any blood in the urine immediately after the incident? From your description, it appears that what you have is a scrotal hematoma which is resolving gradually. So you need to worry. All you would need is some scrotal elevation which will ease pain and swelling. But I would still advise you to visit your urologist to make sure the pain is just in the scrotum and not involved the testes, which is not possible without a clinical exam.

I have severe acne scars on face, back, lower back, below the neck and pimples on face. Even after using Benzoyl peroxide there is no change. I have oily skin. I use to get severe menstrual pain up to 3 or 4 days and for which I am using Meftal spas. I have breast pain mostly except the period days and few days following. Also there is a small color difference in the right breast not overall. But, the pain is not specific to this area. I get pain in both breasts. Is it just premenstrual pain or something to be concerned? For allergy, I am using nasal spray and Allegra tablet. Back pain is present occasionally and not severe. I have hair fall and thinning of hair from scalp and dandruff problem. When I oil my hair for dryness I get more pimples. What else can I do for dry hair, hair fall and dandruff? Occasionally, I get a lump below the lower abdomen on the right side. A doctor once made me cough and tested, the lump was not formed. But, he said with symptoms it would be hernia. It follows with a mild pain there. Also, at times I feel like I have to give pressure while urinating. Will these be a symptom for PCOS or endometriosis or any hormonal imbalance? What are the ways to help remove acne scars? Is baking soda a good choice? Or any other home remedy? I apply lemon juice on face, even baking soda, but nothing is working for the scars. I drink milk twice a day mixing Amul pro whey protein powder. Does dairy product cause acne? At times I get a burning sensation on body, especially after afternoon sleep, and also at the back of neck when my hair touches. Is that due to severe back acne scars? How can I take care of the diet for the problems concerned? Can you suggest me a good sunscreen for my skin?","Doctor":"Hi. For acne, take a course of tablet Azithromycin 500 mg daily on three consecutive days in a week for four to six weeks and continue with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5 percent gel on the pimples in the morning and Adapalene gel at night on the pimples. As far as scars are concerned, you can try using Tretinoin 0.05 percent cream on the scars at night. It will not have significant benefit, but you can give it a try. Otherwise you can consider: Besides this, avoid oiling of scalp, keep your face dry, avoid using creams and moisturizers and reduce the intake of sugary foods. Baking soda and lemon juice will not have any effect on acne scars. So, you can stop using them. Dairy products are known to aggravate acne, so reduce their intake. For dandruff, use a Ketoconazole shampoo every alternate day to start with and then taper slowly once improvement is seen. Along with this, use a good quality conditioner after hair wash and start with tablet Keraglo Eva (gamma Lenolenic acid) once daily for hair fall. This needs to be continued for a minimum of three to four months. I do not think the burning sensation is due to acne scars. You should go for La Shield sunscreen gel over your entire face at intervals of three to four hours during the daytime. For breast changes and lump, I would recommend you to consult a surgeon as he will be able to guide you better regarding these symptoms. For back pain, consult an orthopedician and for allergy consult an ENT specialist.

The powder also can be mixed in milk or buttermilk and consumed. In Siddha, normally the gynecology related disease are treated with drugs for three cycles (90 days). Thus, you can continue the drug for 90 days. Apart from Kalarchi choornam, you can also take capsule Nandhi mezhugu in the morning and evening after food for seven days. Next three days, drug free period. Thus total of 10 days. Again 7 days capsule + 3 days free. This is to be continued for three months. During menstrual period days: you should stop both Kalarchi choornam and Nandhi mezhugu. Both the drugs to be started again on day 4, after the first day of bleeding.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I went for an ultrasound at 5 weeks and there was a gestational sac and a yolk sac. However, I also had a 2 cm luteal cyst on my right ovary and what looked like a hemorrhagic cyst of 3 cm on my left ovary. I asked about it and the doctor said it did not look suspicious and she did not suggest any follow up. I have been having pain in my left side ever since ovulation, but how come the luteal cyst is on the right side? Could I have gotten a hemorrhagic cyst on the side that did not ovulate? Is the fact that I have 2 cysts at the same time a concern or should I not worry? I have a family history of breast cancer and so I am worried about ovarian cancer as well. The pain comes and goes, I have not had it for 3 weeks. But 3 days ago it started bothering me again. The pain is very mild and not interfering with anything but it makes me worry about the cyst. My next ultrasound is at 12 weeks. Is that a long time to wait to check on the cyst again? Or is it unlikely to represent a problem? Also I have read that hemorrhagic cysts usually disappear in pregnancy when ovaries stop working. But can they grow during the first 12 weeks when they are functional and shrink after the placenta takes over? If the ultrasound at 12 weeks shows it has grown, is that indicative of cancer or still most likely benign?","Doctor":"Hi. Both the cysts one of 2 cm and other of 3 cm, and one luteal cyst and one hemorrhagic cyst respectively are insignificant and has no concern with cancer at this size. On and off pain during pregnancy do happen but this cannot be ignored if it is very severe. You had your USG done at 5 weeks and now you are 8 weeks 5 days, but pain is still present on and off. You have not mentioned about the cardiac activity of fetus in your last scan.  So, it is better to repeat your scan to know about the cardiac activity as well as the size of both the cysts.  Regarding the ovarian cyst we have to see whether the size is increasing, decreasing, or it is the same. If it's increasing then it is of concern (if more than 5 cm). If it remains the same or decreases, then nothing has to be done, as it will regress on its own. So, repeat your scan now instead of repeating it at 12 weeks. As you have told me about the family history of breast cancer, I advice you that in future you will have to be vigilant regarding the same.

I had a urinary tract infection about two years ago. From that period, I am doing blood tests to evaluate the kidney function every 15 days.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

So, if you had a kiss by a confirm case of Herpes labialis, you may get such infection. But, it is not always an infection to convert into a disease as body's immune system protects us from such kind of pathogen.

Another sac was also present with cardiac activity. And the doctor said one of the twins got miscarried. To survive the other, I took Prolactin injection and was given Susten tablets. Had one shot of hCG too. I had my NT scan which showed everything normal, nasal bone was present and NT was 1.5 mm. Though the doctor did not suggest any test, I chose to do the double marker test.

As your NT scan was normal with normal appearing NT and nasal bone, this nearly rules out chances of Down's syndrome. Single soft tissue marker at this time is not significant.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, please do not freak out. If we have adequate information, it would be easy to figure out the cause for such groin node enlargement. It would have been a little more informative if you could mention the size of the node that you could feel, whether on single or both sides? Whether it is a single node or multiple? If multiple, whether they could be felt discreetly or they are stuck together? Also, if you had any history of fever recently? That could have given some idea about the nature of these groin nodal swelling. The most common causes for the enlargement of the groin nodes is any infection or inflammation in the sites they drain the lymph fluid, which includes the genital area (including the lower third of vagina) and legs. So, I would like to know if there is any genital infection or ulcers, or any infection or wound in your legs. Many times, in sexually active individuals, it could represent a presentation of sexually transmitted infections like chancroids, syphilis, or sometimes in herpes too.

How to get diagnosed with alcoholic cardiomyopathy when the echo test result is normal, and 24-hour ECG test shows tachycardia?","Doctor":"Hi. Alcohol effects on left ventricular function can be reversible. A number of small studies have demonstrated that if it is started before fibrosis, abstinence from alcohol can result in significant improvement in left ventricular function. A short duration of symptoms of heart failure and abstinence from alcohol are the two factors associated with favourable outcomes. The prognosis of patients with alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy is poor with the continuous use of alcohol. The reported mortality rates are as high as 42% in three years. Light microscopic altered structure and function of myocardial fibers can detect alcohol cardiomyopathy, where echo failed to reveal any abnormality in early stages.

Two days after the surgery, I started getting headaches when sitting up and less so when standing, which progressively got worse. Today, these headaches are very intense. I cannot really stand or sit for a long time as the pain becomes too intense. Also, when I put my chin to my chest or when I move my head left or right the pain becomes more intense. When I put my chin to my chest, I also feel pain in my thoracic spine area. I can only lie-down basically and I have a newborn to care. Is it normal to have more intense pain when putting my chin to my chest with postdural puncture headache? I am worried about this symptom, but I do not have any fever.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic disorder, almost always characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), usually due to t(9;22)(q34;q11) or its variants. The Ph results in the formation of the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, which is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase. Around 1 % of CML patients appear to have a Ph-negative karyotype but carry a cryptic BCR/ABL1 fusion that can be located by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) at chromosome 22q11, 9q34 or a third chromosome. Hence, the cytogenetic profile is normal by karyotyping in Ph-negative patients but they have the BCR/ABL fusion gene which is detected by molecular methods like FISH and PCR.

I have gone through the clinical images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The reason why this occurs is elusive, although many hypothetical explanations are given. Surgery is the best and only curative option. The wound can be closed without any problems after surgery. Keeping the wound open is an outdated technique of operation. Generally, no scan is advised. You can get an MRI if you want to get it done but it will not be of great help. Do not worry. It is not a life-threatening condition. It will not spread to other parts of the body. It is an easily treatable condition. You should go and get it operated. I would advise you to reduce weight, and check blood sugars, and BP.

There are certain guidelines:  Before all this you need to go and get yourself examined by a good reputed general surgeon in your area. Ayurveda is outside my field of expertise and I am not convinced about you using ayurvedic medicines to treat hemorrhoids at this stage. There are other various possibilties like rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, cryotherapy, etc. The doctor who examines her may advise a colonoscopy to find out the status of the fissure.

Should I go for Penicillin treatment? I got tested for HIV 1 and 2 tests and CMIA a month back with a value of 0.15 and before ten days, the value was 0.13. Currently, I am consulting a dermatologist. Should I switch to sexologist for syphilis treatment? Also, please suggest what diet should I follow to overcome this disease?","Doctor":"Hi. Please continue treatment with a dermatologist only. There is no medical degree which qualifies one to be a sexologist. Penicillin is the most definitive treatment for syphilis but get the allergy test done before taking the full treatment. Apply Mupirocin ointment twice a day on the ulcer. Continue your doctor's treatment as he or she is examining you in-person so is the best judge for the line of management.

I never injured it during sex, but I have squeezed it too hard after urination. I can get an erection, but it is uncomfortable. The discomfort extends from the tip of the penis to the testicles, but only on the right side. I have never had any bruising or discharge. I visited my GP and he referred me to a hospital. They made an artificial erection and filled my penis with dye to check blood circulation and said everything was normal. So, what can be the reason for the pain?","Doctor":"Hi.

I have been to the urologist and had a cystoscopy because I was having problems with leakage of urine after I pee and urgency. The doctor said my prostate was slightly larger than normal and gave me some medicines. Those medicines did not help with the symptoms, and he gave me another medicine called Rapaflo and that did not help either. The leaking still has not gone away, and it hurts to ejaculate sometimes. I had the cystoscopy done about five months ago. Is there some medicine to help with this? The leaking is very embarrassing, and my sex drive is much lower. I do not feel like I get erections.

Over the past year, I have been experiencing these symptoms. I have a fast pounding heart, especially after a night of drinking. The following morning, I always wake up early to a pounding heart, and it scares me. This happens after big meals and while exercising also. When I exercise, my heart feels like it is going to explode. I also have fatigue and mental fogginess, my concentration is low, and I feel like I am just overall slow or have low energy. I have anxiety, and I have been diagnosed with anxiety in the past. I was in a dark place for awhile, but things seem to be getting better. The doctor wanted to put me on Zoloft, but I declined and had thankfully found peace with daily meditation. I have a low libido, and I am just not that interested anymore. My testosterone levels are low for my age. My last readings were 302 ng/dL, 290 ng/dL, and 270 ng/dL, which were all taken in the morning. As a person who exercises a good amount, I find it hard to gain strength or any muscle. I want to fix this, and I have consulted many doctors, but none are willing to help me. I honestly believe that my testosterone level is the main cause with all this. I have thought about taking matters into my hands and starting a treatment regimen but, I would rather do so under the supervision of a doctor.","Doctor":"Hello. As your BMI (body mass index) is 34, in obesity, the decreased levels of testosterone-binding protein cause a decrease in the total testosterone levels, but not the normal free level. Before we evaluate you for low testosterone, we need to confirm it by doing free testosterone levels. If free is also low, then we need to find the cause, for that, we need FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) level. So, you first get free testosterone levels done. Also, any anxiety, depression, or any psychological issues can cause loss of libido. You can visit an endocrinologist for the same. Secondly, regarding your heart rate, it is certainly not related to testosterone. But it can be related to anxiety, alcohol, and heart. There are two possibilities, one is anxiety related and secondly due to heart arrhythmia. Many individuals who drink, tend to have a weakening of the heart and atrial fibrillation, in which heart beats irregularly and fast, especially after drinks. Hope this helps you. Get back if you have any further doubts.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Due to various reasons like coronary artery disease, hypertension or a block or interruption of conduction, it may lead to changes in the ECG (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Not a matter of worry, still one stress test and echo test should be done to rule out coronary artery disease. I guess there is no history of hypertension. Also get a lipid profile test done.

I need to increase my platelet count at least 1.65 to 1.70 platelets per microliter of blood for some medical purpose. I am taking papaya leaf juice. Can I take Dexorange?","Doctor":"Hi. I need to know for which purpose you have done CBC (complete blood count) investigation. Kindly mention any clinical complaint if present for giving more comment and also want to know how long your platelet count remains low? Or is this only for the first time? Platelet count should be at least 1.5 platelets per microliter of blood, and your platelet count is slightly low that is 1.38 platelets per microliter of blood. If you have no clinical complaint, then I do not think you have to investigate further. Papaya leaf extract syrup and papaya fruits can be taken to improve platelet count. Peripheral smear examination report can be done to check platelet morphology. Your all other parameters are within the range.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have my serum creatinine, serum uric acid, creatinine urine and protein urine test done. The result indicates that I have creatinine 1.37, uric acid 9.6, creatinine urine 169.84 and protein urine 31.9. My current medication is Amlovas 5 mg tablet once daily and Seloken XL 50 mg once daily. Please explain me.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems that you are suffering from hypertensive nephropathy. You would need to know and understand that you need strict control of blood pressure and the addition of an agent. I suggest you to take an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors like Ramipril, which helps greatly in controlling the protein in urine, as a result of nephropathy. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with them and take the medicine with their consent. I would also suggest you for an ultrasound abdomen to check for the status of the kidneys along with the prostate. A lot many times, the enlarged prostate can also cause kidney dysfunction. I hope your blood sugar has been checked and is normal. Revert back with the test report to a nephrologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mom is suffering from sciatica pain. She is 45 years old. Her doctor suggested complete bed rest for two months. It has been a month for now. She is facing trouble to take breath properly (night times). She is having head spinning and a sensation of falling from bed. She is having high blood pressure and is a diabetis patient. She is on regular tablets. What to do for the head spinning while sleeping on bed?","Doctor":"Hi. The possibilities for her head spinning are as follows. Probably, your mom is suffering from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It can be controlled by a tablet like Vertin16 mg (Betahistine) or Stugeron (Cinnarizine) at bedtime or twice daily. The second possibility is as she is diabetic and hypertensive, we have to think about circulation deficiency to the brainstem, which controls balance. It can be evaluated by doing MRI brain and adding Ecosprin to improve circulation to the brain. It may also be drug induced. If she is taking Gabapentin or Pregabalin for neuropathic pain, then it may cause giddiness and sway while walking. It can also be due to hypotension secondary to the hypertensive at night. Vitamin B12 deficiency also can produce swaying and giddiness. You can confirm it by asking about peripheral numbness and increase in giddiness on standing with closed eyes. It can be corrected by vitamin B12 supplementation. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and ask to add Vertin or Stugeron. See the response. If your mom is not improving, then think about other possibilities.

I was on stress medicine Escitalopram (Cipralex) 10 mg, an SSRI, for the past 5 years and presently not taking any medicine. Perimetry and eye pressure done regularly every year for the past 5 years. Got an MRI brain and CT scan done two years back and the results were normal. My eye pressure was between 18-20 and the normal vision with floaters is 6/6. Present scenario is recently I have got OCT done for eyes. Please refer the OCT results and let me know, is there any threat for loss of vision? Are OCT results related with light sensitivity? Kindly explain in detail or describe about borderline results of OCT? What does it mean? Does Novoret - Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Omega-3 will help to improve borderline thickness region? How to improve borderline thickness area? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. At the outset I want to assure you that, after going through your history and the OCT results (attachment removed to protect patient identity) there is no possibility of any threat to your vision.  I would suggest you to; continue monitoring your eye pressure with periodic OCT and perimetry, preferably automated perimetry. Nowadays there is something called as low pressure glaucoma, the possibility of which should be kept in mind. Lastly, regarding the floaters, fortunately 90% of the time eye floaters are innocent and outcome of the usual wear and tear process. The only time when there can be an indication of something serious is, when there is a sudden sharp increase in their numbers especially accompanied by flashes of light.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

My ultrasonography report says fetal heartbeats not visualized even with the help of a color Doppler. Is it normal? I am very scared. Please reply.","Doctor":"Hello. If you are sure that it is eight weeks then it is not a good sign. Usually, the scan can detect the pregnancy and the heartbeat as early as six weeks.But it is advisable to wait for seven to 10 days and repeat the scan. If there is still no sign of heartbeat then it will mean an unhealthy pregnancy. But if you have ovulated a few days later, your baby is not yet six weeks and you will be able to appreciate fetal heartbeat on the next scan.You will have to keep your fingers crossed until the next scan. If you are very anxious to know about the health of your baby, the other option is to have a serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) tomorrow morning and repeat it after 48 hours. In this period, the blood levels will double if the baby is healthy. If the baby is not healthy, the second value of hCG will be lesser than the original value or it will be almost the same.

What could have caused this? I feel she could be having a yeast intolerance. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Your wife has been treated for urticaria. I would keep a possibility of idiopathic urticaria/hives. It presents as sudden skin welts/swellings, which can be distributed all over the body. Itching is usually severe; however it is subjective in individuals. The causes of urticaria includes various factors such as infections (bacterial, viral or fungal), drugs like painkillers and also certain foods, additives and preservatives. Physical urticaria can occur due to cold temperature, heat, dermographism, etc., and cholinergic urticaria will occur in response to strong emotions, exercise, spicy food, etc. Autoimmune urticaria associated usually associated with autoimmune disease such as thyroid, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc. The most common one is idiopathic urticaria, where there will be no underlying identifiable cause. Regarding treatment, I suggest oral antihistamines like Montelukast and Levocetirizine once daily. Also she can take tablet Allegra 120 mg (Fexofenadine) once daily. Treatment may sometimes last for months or years. A topical soothing lotion like calamine would help her symptomatically.

I just read your query. See, pimple and cyst are two different things. Pimple is a kind of comedo having bumpy appearance. It is usually painful and pus may or may not be present. A cyst is an encapsulated growth which can be filled with water or fluid. It can grow slowly and usually non-cancerous. Pain is sometimes present. There are fewer chances of a pimple under frenulum in the mouth. More chances of cyst are there. Cyst usually requires surgical management. It can be ruled out with the help of clinical examination only. So ideally you should visit a nearby physician so that he can examine you and treat you properly. But if you are sure that it is a pimple you can take the following treatment: Take it for 10 days and consult me after ten days regarding improvement and for further management or you can consult a nearby physician. But, I still recommend you to visit a physician to make sure whether it is a cyst or a pimple.

Today also she is having frequent loose motion. ORS solution and paracetamol syrup given, but got little bit control again started.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to icliniq - Loose motion ( diarrhoea) is common problem in young kids. It is very important to make sure that your daughter is well hydrated till she gets better . - It is very good that you are already giving ORS solution which needs to be given frequently. Loose stools can last for some days before getting better. It will help to clear the body of germs & toxins. I need to ask you a few more questions to guide you in the right direction - How many times /day does she have loose stools ? - is there any blood in stool ? - is she is any pain ? does she cry while having stools ? - is there any vomiting ? - is there any fever ? if there is no fever , there is no need to give paracetamol. - any signs of dehydration ( lips & tongue dry, not passing urine as usual) - Is her weight gain good and within normal range ? - is she otherwise her usual self or is she ill looking, crying & confused ? Treatment plan: - Provide your daughter with frequent sips of ORS throughout the day. For every loose stool she needs to be given 10 mls/kg of ORS. Assuming her weight to be 7-8 kgs, you should give 80 mls ORS for every loose stool. ORS needs to be continued till loose stools stop -You can also give tender coconut water if available. - Give bland non-spicy food like plain idli, rice for some days. -If she is still breast feeding, it is good to continue. - If available you can give Enterogermina oral suspension 2 mini ampoules a day for 3 days. You can mix with water and give her. - Zinsy syrup 5 mls once a day for a week - Most common reason for loose stools at this age is viral , so antibiotics are not needed. But if she has fever or bloody mucusy stools she will need to be examined . Otherwise, loose motion will settle in 4-5 days IMPORTANT Due to the Coronavirus lock down, visiting hospital/clinic may be difficult. But if your daughter shows any of the following signs she needs to be taken to the nearest hospital/clinic to be examined by a paediatrician. - looks sick - not drinking ORS - lips and tongue getting dry - not passing urine even once in 6 hrs - looks dull and crying excessively - blood in stoll If you have any further concerns, you can contact us again for further advice Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I got hit in my right eye with a ball.

My Hb was 7.4 g/dL and electrophoresis was normal. Now, after a month, my Hb level is increased to 8.7 g/dL. Should I receive another bottle of blood to increase my hemoglobin further?","Doctor":"Hi. Hemoglobin (Hb) less than 10 g/dL during pregnancy is unfavorable. Blood transfusion should be done when Hb levels are less than 7 g/dL, so you do not need a blood transfusion now. You have to check your Hb till it reaches at least 10. The rate of increase in Hb is same either iron orally taken or through blood transfusion if provided iron gets absorbed from gut properly. Your rate of increase in Hb level is also good.  I suggest you investigate the cause of anemia. You must get a serum vitamin B12 level done along with the stool examination for ova cyst as these may also be causing anemia along with iron deficiency. I advise you to have a high protein diet, iron enriched food and oral Iron supplements. 1. Iron deficiency anemia.  2. Macrocytic anemia. 3. Worm infestation. Hb levels every two weeks, serum B12 levels and stool examination for ova cyst and iron studies. Gestational anemia. Oral Iron and vitamin C supplementation.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It clearly indicates that the tooth is visibly decayed and gone deeper to involve the nerves and blood vessels of that particular tooth. Ideally, there will be sensitivity if the first two layers of the tooth are affected (enamel and dentin). If the third layer (pulp) is involved and further the bugs percolate inside the length of the teeth, then the symptoms you feel would be there. Now the situation looks like you must visit a nearby dentist for either root canal treatment or extraction depending on your preference. The steps involved would be an x-ray first to check the shape of the roots of the tooth (two or three roots if it is a molar tooth). You sound like an emergency, please visit the hospital or ring the dental practices who attend patients with an emergency during the COVID-19 times.

I am a father of two, height is six feet and weighing 87 kg. I was suffering from mild constipation (first poop is easy but clearing remaining used to take some time from past few months. I used to spend at least 15-20 minutes in loo. This is when I observed urine retention and mild constipation). From past few months, even my rectum was paining. History of UTI: It all started with severe pain after the passage of urine five months back. It was diagnosed as seminal vesiculitis and urologist said that it is common among men and advised sitz bath whenever it pains and advised me to have sex regularly. Though sitting in hot water tub helped me and it relieved me from pain, but the pain was recurring every 20 to 30 days. This continued for almost 18 months. Four months back, I had few drinks (I never consumed alcohol earlier) continuously for a few days, and that triggered severe pain after urination. One day it was so severe that I noticed blood in urine (hematuria) and urination was very frequent on that day. I suffered from fever also that day. The very next day I went to a urologist and got it diagnosed. This time my doctor advised for the following lab test: Hemogram (automated), glucose – random, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), creatinine – serum, urine routine, microscopy (qualitative method), urine culture, imaging – ultrasound abdomen (including post void residue) and uroflowmetry.

So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

My left arm feels weaker. Sometimes I feel tingling in random fingers. I have morning neck and back stiffness also. Please guide to a set of exercises that I can do regularly to free the nerves and start my earlier workouts. Currently, I am doing neck exercises including chin tucks, abd posture correction. However, nerve pain persists. I did my MRI last year. IMPRESSION: •\\tGeneralized posterior bulge of C3-C4 and C4-C5 intervertebral discs, however not causing any significant cervical cord or nerve root compression. •\\tGeneralized posterior bulge of C5-C6 intervertebral disc with indentation of bilateral exiting C6 nerve roots. •\\tGeneralized posterior bulge of C6-C7 intervertebral disc, however not causing any significant cervical cord or nerve root compression.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. As you mentioned, you are suffering from neck pain which shows as nerve pain as per your experience. As your complaints are left arm feels weaker, sometimes tingling in random fingers with morning neck and back stiffness, I feel it is compression at spinal cord root levels as that is even confirmed by MRI scan which you have already undergone. So my provisional diagnosis with view of your age, gender, height, and weight is cervical spondylotic radiculopathy which can best to be treated with physiotherapy and lifestyle modification. I will suggest some exercises and lifestyle modification. Follow it for 15 days. Do not lift heavy weight more than 2 kg. Lessen the use of mobile and computer to only two hours a day. Go for daily walking for about 1 hour, if not jog inside the house. Our primary goal should be to relieve compression and strengthen the muscles around the neck and shoulder. Chin tuck exercise is good only, in addition, you can do neck and shoulder girdle exercise also. You can lie on the belly and do the neck and shoulder elevation exercise. Pendulum exercise also will give you much relief. You lie flat on the floor or use a very thin pillow. As this lockdown finishes you need to take cervical traction and IFT (interferential therapy) at a physiotherapy center nearby. Take only warm water regularly. Another important thing is change in lifestyle. Join art of living online happiness program where all exercises with yoga can be done online. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 48 years old. I am experiencing weak erection and difficulty in sustaining the same. This condition was observed 10 years back.

I was a social smoker till my 30 years of age and nothing since. I watch my alcohol intake and had 6 months of abstinence in the 1st half of last year. I am 5'11\\", 12 stone and active.Over 8 years, I have occasionally got food stuck, normally chicken or steak when I have been shoveling it down. Three years ago I got a piece of steak stuck and had to go to A and E. This was eventually removed with the aid of a gastroscope and was embarrassingly very large. As part of this, they noticed some inflammation and took a number of biopsies as the doctor suspected I had eosinophilic esophagitis. However, they all turned up completely clear. I was prescribed 20 mg Omeprazole. Last year, following a fear I had seen blood in the stool, I got very anxious and ended up having a colonoscopy. This was also completely clear. This year during Christmas, I over indulged a little and on Christmas day got a piece of turkey temporarily stuck, although some water got it down. For some reason though I then began convincing myself I had esophageal cancer or even stomach cancer. This has lead to a number of follow on symptoms like a bit of pain behind my breastbone, belching, getting obsessed with swallowing my own spit and becoming more anxious. I went to see my GP. I explained her all my above symptoms though no vomiting, weight loss, cough, etc. She did a very thorough physical examination, felt for obstructions, tapped my chest cavity and listened to my stomach gurgling. After all of these she said there was absolutely no risk of me having esophageal cancer and told me to up the Omeprazole for a month and relax, then see her again then. However, I am still scared I now have stomach cancer as I do not think any biopsies were done in that area. Please can you provide me with reassurance that I do not have stomach or esophageal cancer?","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms require evaluation as this could be simply gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can cause reflux and stucking of food. Since your endoscopy and biopsy reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are concerned, they are all not suggestive of esophageal carcinoma. In my opinion, you should go ahead for barium swallow study. It is a simple test and would evaluate any evidence of strictures or constriction, if any over the esophagus. However, a biopsy revealing esophagitis with no evidence of malignancy clears you from the presence of any cancer at present. In acid reflux disease a combination of Omeprazole and Domperidone helps greatly. You should take soft, bland diet as spicy food aggravates acidity. In case of acute pain, you can take antiflatulent syrup like Digene or Gelusil.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it?

I have bipolar disorder type II, social and generalized disorder, and panic disorder. However, I am in constant depression for one year. I do not cycle anymore if I do, my hypomania is very mild and short-lived. Moreover, anxiety is debilitating. I am afraid to go out from home, feeling constant anxiety physical symptoms, such as sweaty palms and feet, chest pain, blood pressure rise, racing heart, and much more. I need something to ease my depression symptoms, but also something that would affect my anxiety in a positive way. My current medications are Lamictal 200 mg, 3x5 mg Tranxene, 5 mg Olanzapine, and 75 mg Venlafaxine. I am unable to take more Venlafaxine because from 150 mg my blood pressure and heart rate were out of control. My previous medications were Lithium, Depakote, Carbamazepine, Anxiolytics, Escitalopram, Zoloft, Quetiapine (which I cannot use because of its negative effects on anxiety and blood pressure, just for me), and Risperidone. I am wondering about Paroxetine, Citalopram and Prozac. If escitalopram 20mg was without any effects for two months, is it reasonable to try out Citalopram? I tried Prozac in past, I could not bear initial side effects but that were different times. Does it affect anxiety disorders from your experience? Paroxetine suits best. Which of these medicines could benefit me the most?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your detailed query and history. With regards to your anxiety symptoms, you have tried out SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) class of medications. So, I would like to suggest you try a TCA (tricyclic antidepressants) class of antidepressants like Amitriptyline 75-100 mg, Dosulepine 100 mg, or Nortriptyline 75-100 mg. They are indicated in people who have had partial results with SSRI or SNRI medications. If you do not wish to try out the TCA and coming back to your query about the three medicines, the best results for anxiety will be with Paroxetine between 12.5 mg to 37.5 mg, and Citalopram will also work fine at 20 mg. In addition to these, you can also consider augmenting the action of these by adding Mirtazapine 7.5 mg at night. I would like to suggest that you should consider reducing Olanzapine to 2.5 mg, since you are not in hypomania, and have depressive symptoms. Reduction to 2.5 mg will make it an augmenting agent again for the antidepressant, and also further help with your anxiety issues. Also just to mention, some people do get benefit from having a few sessions of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) from a Clinical Psychologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, You were wonderful in allaying some health anxiety over some skin issues several months ago. So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician's attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician's assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query.","Doctor":"Hello. A solitary epidermal nevus is very common and does not pose any kind of serious health concern. Neither is a biopsy required. You are right. Any associated symptom should have been present since birth or early childhood in this case. Even if it is passed on to the future generations, it is harmless. A yearly medical examination is more than enough for the nevi in both your kids. Good luck."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having a problem with bowel movements with soft, pasty stools. Lots of small stools after the first bowel movement in the morning. All bowel movements take hours to develop once I feel I am in need of a bowel movement. Often times I have to manipulate bowel movement with a shallow enema. Most bowel movements are difficult and are a single push that leaves me feeling as it is incomplete. The build up to a movement either assisted or not is extremely uncomfortable. No sharp pains but gassy, bloated and a feeling of inflammation in lower bowel where sigmoid colon meets rectum. I have no problem with fiber in my diet and I eat fermented foods and take probiotics.","Doctor":"Hello. So, this basically occurs due to constipation and incomplete evacuation. There are certain points you need to remember. Firstly, you need to have a healthy lifestyle which includes a healthy diet and regular exercises. In diet, you should eat a high-fiber diet like fruits (apple, banana, oranges), green leafy vegetables like spinach, raw cucumber, whole wheat, etc., and plenty of water, which will help your free passage of stools. Next thing, make use of morning gastrocolic reflex. Normally when one eats breakfast, one tends to get a bowel movement. So have a good breakfast and plenty of water which will give good gastrocolic reflex. Visit washroom after this reflex comes. Most importantly, effective and physiological treatment is fiber supplementation. You should have Psyllium husk 5 to 6 g with each meal and drink plenty of water after it so as to give good volume to your stools. Gradually, we can increase the dose as needed up to 10 g with each meal. If this is not effective we can try other laxatives like syrup Lactulose 15 to begin with and increased up to 30 ml at bedtime which is also quite effective. Linzess you have already been trying, Lubiprostone we can try later. But we try to avoid this as much as possible as it can lead to laxative abuse.

The possible reason for the headache is your medicine Monit SR (Isosorbide mononitrate) can be a cause of headache. Nitrate headaches are well known and we would need to see if this is the reason in your case. Also, since you have CAD at such a young age, there can be a possibility of carotid artery blockage which might be giving you a headache. Get that evaluated.

I have diabetes. I had dengue infection few months back and since that day I have vaginal itching. It is usually mild but gets severe sometime. I am not sure whether it is because my blood sugar, which is not in control and nothing to do with dengue. I think it as yeast infection. It is itching too much around vagina including urinal area. There is a white deposit on my skin. For itching, I scratch it and it pains. Can you please help me? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems you do have yeast infection. It looks like your blood sugar is not under control because of which you are having this problem. Dengue is unrelated to this. Try putting Canestan (Clotrimazole) ointment on the area after properly cleaning the area, four to five times a day. Keep the area dry and clean. Also insert three Candid-CL tablets (combination of Clotrimazole and Clindamycin) daily at night into the vagina. This should help you out. If not, then we need to add oral antifungal medicines. Also, if this does not control the vaginal itching, take Allegra (Fexofenadine) tablets at night.

I thought it as normal and applied ice. Also, I am using an ointment given by an RMP. It is almost two days now and still, I am unable to fold the finger. If there are three joints in a finger, then I am getting pain in the middle joint whenever my dad or mom does some massage with ice. Kindly help me with the above issue. Thanking you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. I know how it feels when the finger got hit and unable to fold. First of all, after applying ice for 10-15 minutes ask someone to hold the finger from hand to the first joint. As you know there are three joints in a finger, ask them to slowly move the first joint without disturbing the second joint, and then do the same with the second joint by holding the first and the third joint. Repeat this for at least four times a day. If unable to do movements, then you can visit a surgical shop and ask for a single finger grip. which helps in the immobility of fingers. If available, can take Paraffin wax used in physio treatment. Melt the wax and apply it on the finger for 10 minutes. The wax therapy will be available at any Physiotherapy Centre. I hope these remedies will provide some relief from pain and gives mobility of the finger. Follow up after a week for the further treatment plans. Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.
