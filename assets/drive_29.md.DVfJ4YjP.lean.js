An unknown number is divisible by exactly four numbers z from the set {6,15,20,21,70}. Determine which ones.(Michal Rolínek)","solution":"SOLUTION. If the sought four numbers included both 20 and 21 simultaneously, the unknown number would be a multiple of three, four, five, and seven, and thus would also be divisible by 6, 15, 70, which contradicts the requirements of the problem. Therefore, one of the numbers 20, 21 does not belong to the sought quartet, and thus all three numbers 6, 15, 70 belong to it. Every common multiple of the numbers 6 and 70 is divisible by both three and seven, and thus also by twenty-one. Therefore, the fourth sought number is the number 21.The four sought numbers are 6, 15, 21, 70. Their least common multiple is 210, which is not divisible by the remaining number 20. (Thus, the unknown number can also be any multiple of 210 l, where l is odd.) This solves the problem.Note. The problem can be solved systematically by first listing all five four-element subsets, i.e., the setsbegin{gathered}A={15,20,21,70}, quad B={6,20,21,70}, quad C={6,15,21,70}, D={6,15,20,70}, quad E={6,15,20,21},end{gathered}and determining which of them can satisfy the conditions of the problem, i.e., that there exists a number N whose divisors include all four elements of the considered set, while the fifth omitted number is not its divisor. Thus, we can successively eliminate all sets except C, for example, set A: if N is divisible by both numbers 15=3 cdot 5 and 20=2 cdot 10, it is also divisible by 2 cdot 3=6, i.e., 6 in mathrm{A}, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, if the given number is divisible by all three numbers 2, 3, and 5, it is divisible by all the remaining numbers 6, 10, and 15. In the opposite case, it would be divisible by at most two of the numbers 2, 3, and 5, and thus by at least two of the numbers 6, 10, and 15, and thus by each of the prime numbers 2, 3, and 5, which is a contradiction.]"},{"problem":"In a production of Hamlet, several roles are paired, for example, Gertrude and the Queen in the Play can be played by two actors.

How many more performances should she buy tickets for so that there is at least a 90 % probability that she will see all three roles in the other casting as well?","solution":"I. solution. The probability that in n performances, the person does not see the role pairing from a pair of roles that they like is frac{1}{2^{n}}, because there are 2^{n} ways to assign the roles, and only one case occurs where the role they have already seen is always drawn. Therefore, the probability that they see the desired pairing at least once is 1-frac{1}{2^{n}}. Since there are three pairings (and their drawing is independent), the probability that they see all three in the desired role pairing is left(1-frac{1}{2^{n}}right)^{3}. This probability must be at least 90%: left(1-frac{1}{2^{n}}right)^{3} geq 0.9.

The Bisector of angle A is Perpendicular to BCGiven that left(dfrac{overrightarrow {AB}}{|AB|}+dfrac{overrightarrow {AC}}{|AC|}right)cdot overrightarrow {BC}=0, this implies that the sum of the unit vectors in the direction of overrightarrow {AB} and overrightarrow {AC} is perpendicular to overrightarrow {BC}. This condition indicates that the angle bisector of angle A is perpendicular to side BC. Since the angle bisector is also a line of symmetry for angle A, this perpendicularity suggests a special relationship between the sides AB and AC, specifically, AB = AC.2. Calculating cos A and Determining angle AFurther, given dfrac{overrightarrow {AB}}{|AB|}cdot dfrac{overrightarrow {AC}}{|AC|}=dfrac{1}{2}, we interpret this as the cosine of angle A since the dot product of two unit vectors gives the cosine of the angle between them. Therefore, we have cos A = dfrac{1}{2}. From trigonometry, we know that cos dfrac{pi}{3} = dfrac{1}{2}, which means angle A = dfrac{pi}{3}.3. Concluding the Shape of triangle ABCSince we have established that AB = AC, and angle A = dfrac{pi}{3}, the only way to satisfy these conditions in a triangle is if all sides are equal and all angles are dfrac{pi}{3}.

Substituting t = 2 into the equation h = 5t^2, we get:h = 5 times 2^2 = 5 times 4 = 20 text{ meters}.Therefore, the height of the fruit above the ground when it starts falling is approximately 20 meters.Hence, the answer is: boxed{20}."},{"problem":"7.44 A finite set of polygons in the plane is said to be properly placed if for any two of them, there is a line through the origin that intersects both.Find the smallest natural number m such that for any properly placed set of polygons, one can draw m lines through the origin so that each polygon in the set intersects at least one of these m lines.","solution":"［Solution］In the case of 3 polygons shown in the right figure, any line passing through the origin intersects at most two of them, hence we know that m geqslant 2.Since there are only a finite number of polygons, there must be one polygon that subtends the smallest angle at the origin. Let this polygon be M and the angle alpha subtended by M at the origin be bounded by two lines l_{1} and l_{2}. Then, any polygon in the group must intersect at least one of these two lines. Indeed, let M^{prime} be any polygon different from M. By the given condition, there must be a line l passing through the origin that intersects both M and M^{prime}. Thus, the line l is either between l_{1} and l_{2} (i.e., intersects the interior of angle alpha) or coincides with one of l_{1} or l_{2}. If the latter is the case, the problem is already solved. If l is indeed between l_{1} and l_{2}, then since the angle beta subtended by M^{prime} at the origin is not less than alpha, there must be a line l^{prime} passing through the origin that intersects M^{prime} but does not intersect the interior of angle alpha. If l^{prime} coincides with one of l_{1} or l_{2}, the problem is solved. If l^{prime} is outside angle alpha, this precisely means that one of l_{1} or l_{2}, say l_{1}, lies within the angle beta between l and l^{prime}.

Thus, after each even-numbered digit (2nd, 4th, ..., 98th), the next two digits can again be 3 ways, which is (3^{49}) cases for each of the three starting digits.

Let:   [   u = ln^2(x-a) quad text{and} quad dv = dx   ]   Then:   [   du = frac{2ln(x-a)}{x-a} , dx quad text{and} quad v = x   ]3.

We need to evaluate ( int ln(x-a) , dx ). Using integration by parts again, let:   [   u = ln(x-a) quad text{and} quad dv = dx   ]   Then:   [   du = frac{1}{x-a} , dx quad text{and} quad v = x   ]5. Applying integration by parts:   [   int ln(x-a) , dx = x ln(x-a) - int x cdot frac{1}{x-a} , dx   ]   Simplifying the integral:   [   int x cdot frac{1}{x-a} , dx = int left(1 + frac{a}{x-a}right) , dx = x + a ln|x-a|   ]6. Therefore:   [   int ln(x-a) , dx = x ln(x-a) - (x + a ln|x-a|) = -a ln|x-a|   ]7. Substituting back, we get:   [   int ln^2(x-a) , dx = x ln^2(x-a) - 2(-a ln|x-a|) = x ln^2(x-a) + 2a ln|x-a|   ]8. Evaluating the definite integral from 1 to 3:   [   V(a) = pi left[ (3-a)left(ln^2(3-a) + 2a ln|3-a|right) - (1-a)left(ln^2(1-a) + 2a ln|1-a|right) right]   ]9. To find the minimum value of ( V(a) ), we take the derivative ( V'(a) ) and set it to zero:   [   V'(a) = pi left[ ln^2(1-a) - ln^2(3-a) right] = 0   ]10. Let ( x = ln(1-a) ) and ( y = ln(3-a) ). The equation ( ln^2(1-a) = ln^2(3-a) ) implies:    [    x^2 = y^2 quad Rightarrow quad x = pm y    ]11. Case 1: ( x = y ) has no solutions because ( ln(1-a) = ln(3-a) ) is not possible for ( 0 < a < 1 ).12. Case 2: ( x = -y ) implies:    [    ln(1-a) = -ln(3-a) quad Rightarrow quad ln(1-a) + ln(3-a) = 0 quad Rightarrow quad ln((1-a)(3-a)) = 0    ]    [    (1-a)(3-a) = 1 quad Rightarrow quad 3 - 4a + a^2 = 1 quad Rightarrow quad a^2 - 4a + 2 = 0    ]13. Solving the quadratic equation:    [    a = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 8}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{2}    ]    Since ( 2 + sqrt{2} ) is extraneous (greater than 1), the valid solution is:    [    a = 2 - sqrt{2}    ]14. Finally, we evaluate ( V(a) ) at ( a = 2 - sqrt{2} ):    [    Vleft(2 - sqrt{2}right) = pi left[ (sqrt{2} + 1)left(ln^2(sqrt{2} + 1) + 2(2 - sqrt{2}) ln(sqrt{2} + 1)right) - (sqrt{2} - 1)left(ln^2(sqrt{2} - 1) + 2(2 - sqrt{2}) ln(sqrt{2} - 1)right) right]    ]The final answer is ( boxed{ Vleft(2 - sqrt{2}right) } )"},{"problem":"If the sum of the binomial coefficients in the binomial expansion of ( sqrt{x} - frac{1}{x})^{n} is 64, then n= ______, and the constant term in the expansion is ______. (Answer with numbers)","solution":"To solve this problem, we note that the sum of the binomial coefficients in the binomial expansion corresponds to the value obtained by setting x=1 in the given expression. Thus, ( sqrt{1} - frac{1}{1})^{n} = (1 - 1)^{n} = 0^n. However, in the problem, we are given the sum of the coefficients as 64, not 0^n. This implies we consider the sum of the coefficients without the substitution, which is the same as evaluating (1 + 1)^n = 2^n. So we have:2^n = 64 Rightarrow n = log_2{64} = 6.Now, we expand ( sqrt{x} - frac{1}{x})^{6} using binomial theorem. The general term is:T_{r+1}= C_{6}^{r} (sqrt{x})^{6-r}left(-frac{1}{x}right)^{r} = (-1)^{r} C_{6}^{r} x^{3-frac{3r}{2}}.To find the constant term, we need the exponent of x to be zero.

Claim: The largest number of words you can choose so that among any three, there is a word lying between the other two is ( n + 1 ) for ( n neq 2 ) and ( n + 2 ) for ( n = 2 ).2. Construction for ( n neq 2 ):    - Consider all words consisting of ( k ) letters \\"a\\" followed by ( n - k ) letters \\"b\\" for all ( 0 leq k leq n ). This gives us ( n + 1 ) words.3. Construction for ( n = 2 ):   - Consider all words consisting of letters \\"a\\" and \\"b\\". This gives us the words \\"aa\\", \\"ab\\", \\"ba\\", and \\"bb\\", which are 4 words in total.4. Proof:   - We need to show that any set ( S ) of words with the described property has ( |S| leq n + 1 ) if ( n neq 2 ) and ( |S| leq n + 2 ) if ( n = 2 ).5. Distance Property:   - For any three words ( A, B, C ), we have ( rho(A, C) + rho(C, B) geq rho(A, B) ) with equality if and only if for each ( i ), either ( c_i = a_i ) or ( c_i = b_i ).6. Binary Strings:   - For any ( 1 leq i leq n ), at most two distinct letters occur in the ( i )-th position in words in ( S ). Thus, we can assume all words in ( S ) are binary strings of length ( n ).7. Case ( n leq 2 ):   - For ( n = 2 ), the claim follows directly from the construction. So, assume ( n geq 3 ).8. Interpretation as Subsets:   - Interpret each string from ( S ) as a subset of the set ( [n] = {1, 2, ldots, n} ). Assume ( S ) contains the string consisting of ( n ) zeros.9. Claim 1: For any distinct non-empty ( A, B in S ), either ( A cap B = emptyset ) or ( A subset B ), or ( B subset A ).   - Proof: For any distinct non-empty ( A, B in S ), either ( emptyset ) lies between ( A, B ), meaning that ( A, B ) are disjoint, or ( A ) lies between ( emptyset ) and ( B ), which implies that ( A subset B ).10. Claim 2: No three non-empty subsets in ( S ) are pairwise disjoint.    - Proof: Assume otherwise, then there exist non-empty ( A, B, C in S ) such that ( A cap B = B cap C = C cap A = emptyset ). WLOG ( B ) lies between ( A ) and ( C ), but then taking some ( b in B ) implies that either ( b in A ) or ( b in C ), which is absurd.11. Chain Argument:    - Let ( S' = S setminus {emptyset} ). If the subsets in ( S' ) form a chain, we have ( |S'| leq n ). Suppose this is not the case. Take disjoint ( X, Y in S' ) so that ( |X| + |Y| ) is maximum. Then for each ( Z in S' setminus {X, Y} ), either ( Z subset X ), or ( Z subset Y ), or ( X, Y subset Z ).12. Bounding ( |S| ):    - If ( [n] in S' ), then ( X cup Y = [n] ) and ( S_1, S_2 ) must be empty, thus ( |S'| leq 3 leq n ). Suppose ( [n] not in S ). The subsets from ( S_1 ) form a chain, so ( |S_1| leq |X| - 1 ) and similarly ( |S_2| leq |Y| - 1 ). The subsets in ( S_3 ) form a chain by Claim 1, implying ( |S_3| leq n - |X| - |Y| ).13.

The height of the rhombus is 4, and the point of intersection of its diagonals is the orthogonal projection of vertex S onto the base plane. A sphere with a radius of 2 touches all the faces of the pyramid. Find the volume of the pyramid if the distance from the center of the sphere to the line A C is frac{2 sqrt{2}}{3} A B.","solution":"The center of a sphere that touches two intersecting planes lies in the bisector plane of one of the dihedral angles formed by these planes. For the given pyramid, such a sphere is either inscribed in the pyramid, or touches the plane of the base and the extensions of all lateral faces, or touches one of the lateral faces and the extensions of the other faces. Let S K and S N be the heights of triangles A S B and D S C respectively, and H be the center of the rhombus A B C D. If the sphere is inscribed in the pyramid S A B C D, then its center O lies on the height S H, since the bisector planes of the dihedral angles formed by adjacent lateral faces of such a pyramid intersect along the line S H. By the theorem of three perpendiculars, H K perp A B and H N perp C D, and since A B parallel C D, the points K, H, and N lie on the same line - the height of the rhombus A B C D. The plane A S B passes through the line A D, which is perpendicular to the plane K S N, so the planes A S B and K S N are perpendicular, meaning that the perpendicular O E, dropped from point O to the line S K of intersection of the planes A S B and K S N (i.e., the radius of the sphere), lies in the plane K S N. Consider the section of the pyramid by the plane K S N. In the quadrilateral O E K H, it is known that O E = O H = K H = 2 and angle O E K = angle O H K = 90^{circ}. From the equality of right triangles O H K and O E K (by the leg and hypotenuse), it follows that E K = K H = 2, so O E K H is a square, which is impossible, since angle E K H < 90^{circ}. Thus, the sphere cannot be inscribed in the given pyramid. Similarly, it is proven that the sphere cannot touch the face A B C D and the extensions of all lateral faces of the pyramid. Let the sphere touch the face D S C and the extensions of the other faces of the pyramid. The planes A S B and C S D pass through parallel lines A B and C D, so the line l of their intersection is parallel to each of these lines. Let F be a point on the extension of the segment K S beyond point S. Then F S N is the linear angle of the dihedral angle containing the center O 1 of the sphere. Then the bisector m of this angle lies in the bisector plane alpha of the considered dihedral angle and is parallel to K N as the bisector of the external angle at vertex S of the isosceles triangle K S N, and since two intersecting lines l and m of the plane alpha are respectively parallel to the lines A B and K N of the plane A B C D, the plane alpha is parallel to the plane A B C D. Similarly, it is proven that the plane alpha is the bisector plane of the dihedral angle between the extensions of the faces A S D and B S C. Thus, the radius of the sphere is equal to the distance between the parallel planes alpha and A B C D. Therefore, S H = 2, and since N H = frac{1}{2} K N = 2, then S N = 2 sqrt{2}. The bisector plane of the dihedral angle between the planes A B C D and C S D, containing the center of this sphere, passes through the line C D, parallel to the plane alpha, and intersects the plane alpha, so the line of intersection is parallel to the line C D. Similarly, the other bisector planes of the dihedral angles adjacent to the dihedral angles of the pyramid at the edges of its base intersect the plane alpha along lines parallel to these edges. Let O_{A} O_{B} O_{C} O_{D} be the quadrilateral formed by the intersection of these four lines. Its opposite sides are pairwise parallel, so it is a parallelogram. Its diagonals are respectively parallel to the diagonals of the rhombus A B C D, so O_{A} O_{B} O_{C} O_{D} is a rhombus similar to the rhombus A B C D. Thus, the center of the sphere mentioned in the problem condition cannot be a point different from the points O_{A}, O_{B}, O_{C}, and O_{D}, since only these points of the plane alpha are equidistant from the planes of all faces of the pyramid.Since S O_{D} parallel H N, the point O_{D} lies in the plane K S N, and N O_{D} is the bisector of the angle S N G adjacent to the angle S N K. Therefore, angle S O_{D} N = angle O_{D} N G = angle S N O_{D}, so S O_{D} = S N, and the similarity coefficient of the rhombuses O_{A} O_{B} O_{C} O_{D} and A B C D is frac{S O_{D}}{N H} = frac{S N}{N H} = sqrt{2}. The points O_{A} and O_{C} do not satisfy the problem condition, since then their distance to the line A C is equal to the distance between the planes alpha and A B C D, i.e., 2, so frac{2 sqrt{2}}{3} A B = 2, from which A D = A B = frac{3}{sqrt{2}} < 4 = K N, which is impossible, since the side of the rhombus is less than its height. Consider the point O_{D}. Let A B = x. From the similarity of the rhombuses, it follows that D H = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} S O_{D}. Since the orthogonal projection of the line O_{D} H onto the plane of the base of the pyramid is the line D H and D H perp A C, by the theorem of three perpendiculars, O_{D} H perp A C, so the length of the segment O_{D} H is the distance from the point O_{D} to the line A C, and since by the condition this distance is equal to 2 sqrt{2} frac{2 sqrt{2}}{3} x, from the right triangle S H O_{D} we find thatS O_{D}^2 = O_{D} H^2 - S H^2 = left(frac{2 sqrt{2}}{3} xright)^2 - 2^2 = frac{8}{9} x^2 - 4ThenD H^2 = frac{1}{2} S O_{D}^2 = frac{4}{9} x^2 - 2Let Q be the projection of point B onto the side C D of the rhombus A B C D.

Except for the first person in line, each person receives the bottle from another person in the line exactly once.

These transfers account for a total of 4+3+6=13 times. From the previous item, the total number of times the bottle is transferred is 15. Therefore, the bottle was passed 15-13=2 times from a man to a woman.c) (First Solution) Let N(h, h)=6, N(h, m)=2, N(m, h)=3, and N(m, m)=4 be the number of times the bottle was passed from a man to another man, from a man to a woman, from a woman to a man, and from a woman to another woman, respectively. Observe that:- the bottle was received by men a total of N(h, h)+N(m, h)=9 times;- the bottle was passed by a man a total of N(h, h)+N(h, m)=8 times.Since men received the bottle more times than they passed it, the last person in the line must be a man, as this is the only person in the line who receives the bottle from someone in the line but does not pass it.Now observe that:- the bottle was received by women a total of N(h, m)+N(m, m)=6 times;- the bottle was passed by a woman a total of N(m, h)+N(m, m)=7 times.Since women received the bottle fewer times than they passed it, the first person in the line must be a woman, as this is the only person who passes the bottle without having received it from someone in the line.(Second Solution) Let's enumerate the 16 people in the order they appear in the line:left{p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, ldots, p_{15}, p_{16}right}Above, each p with a number as an index represents a person. Since there are 16 people, the indices range from 1 to 16.

Therefore, we must have exactly 6 groups:begin{aligned}& underbrace{left{p_{1}, ldots, p_{k_{1}}right}}_{text {same gender A }} cup underbrace{left{p_{k_{1}+1}, ldots, p_{k_{2}}right}}_{text {same gender B }} cup underbrace{left{p_{k_{2}+1}, ldots, p_{k_{3}}right}}_{text {same gender A }} cup & cup underbrace{left{p_{k_{3}+1}, ldots, p_{k_{4}}right}}_{text {same gender B }} cup underbrace{left{p_{k_{4}+1}, ldots, p_{k_{5}}right}}_{text {same gender A }} cup underbrace{left{p_{k_{5}+1}, ldots, p_{16}right}}_{text {same gender B }}end{aligned}It is now clear that to have 3 bottle passes from a woman to a man, the people in the groups of gender A must be women and those in the group B must be men.

But it is not at all obvious how you prove it actually is 315, short of calculating the 315 points intersection for a specific example. Call the points A, B, C, D, E. Given one of the points, the other 4 points determine 6 lines, so there are 6 perpendiculars through the given point and hence 30 perpendiculars in all. These determine at most 30.29/2 = 435 points of intersection. But some of these necessarily coincide. There are three groups of coincidences. The first is that the 6 perpendiculars through A meet in one point (namely A), not the expected 15. So we lose 5.14 = 70 points. Second, the lines through C, D and E perpendicular to AB are all parallel, and do not give the expected 3 points of intersection, so we lose another 10.3 = 30 points. Third, the line through A perpendicular to BC is an altitude of the triangle ABC, as are the lines through B perpendicular to AC, and the through C perpendicular to AB. So we only get one point of intersection instead of three, thus losing another 10.2 = 20 points. These coincidences are clearly all distinct (the categories do not overlap), so they bring us down to a maximum of 435 - 120 =315. There is no obvious reason why there should be any further coincidences. But that is not quite the same as proving that there are no more. Indeed, for particular positions of the points A, B, C, D, E we can certainly arrange for additional coincidences (the constraints given in the problem are not sufficient to prevent additional coincidences). So we have to prove that it is possible to arrange the points so that there are no additional coincidences.

What is the greatest number of self-intersection points that a closed broken line consisting ofa) 13 segments,b) 1950 segments,can have?","solution":"7. a) Consider any link of our 13-link broken line. On this link, there can be no more than 10 intersection points - after all, the broken line has 13 links in total, and 3 of them (the link being considered and its two adjacent links) do not intersect this link. Therefore, the total number of intersection points cannot exceed (frac{13 cdot 10}{2} = 65) (65 intersection points will occur if each link intersects exactly 10 other links; in the product 13 cdot 10, each intersection point is counted twice, as it involves two links).It is not difficult to see that a 13-link broken line can have 65 intersection points. To obtain such a broken line, it is sufficient to consider a star-shaped regular 13-gon, which is formed by connecting points that divide a circle into 13 equal parts with chords that cut off (frac{6}{13}) parts of the circle (see Fig. 54, where for greater clarity, a 7-link broken line with (frac{7 cdot 4}{2} = 14) intersection points is depicted instead of a 13-link broken line with 65 intersection points).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_962b75a91b7185035ab9g-064.jpg?height=465&width=470&top_left_y=449&top_left_x=358)Fig. 54.Note. It can be shown analogously that the maximum possible number of intersection points of a closed (n)-link broken line, where (n) is any odd number, is (frac{n(n-3)}{2}).b) Analogously to problem 6, the parity or non-parity of the number of links in the broken line is very significant here. In the case where the number of links (n) is even, it can still be asserted that the number of intersection points does not exceed (frac{n(n-3)}{2}) (see the solution to part a, in particular, the note to this solution); however, in this case, as it is easy to see, the number of intersection points can never be equal to (frac{n(n-3)}{2}). Indeed, for the number of intersection points of the broken line to be equal to (frac{n(n-3)}{2}), it is necessary that each link of the broken line intersects with all (n-3) links that are not adjacent to it. But if a link of a closed (n)-link broken line, where (n) is even, intersects with (n-3) links, then this means that the two links adjacent to it are located on opposite sides of it (Fig. 55, a). And if each link of the broken line has this property, then the two links located one apart from the given one also cannot intersect it (Fig. 55, b).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_962b75a91b7185035ab9g-065.jpg?height=374&width=453&top_left_y=467&top_left_x=176)Fig. 55.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_962b75a91b7185035ab9g-065.jpg?height=246&width=441&top_left_y=597&top_left_x=691)Fig. 56.It is not difficult to see that the maximum number of intersection points of a four-link broken line is 1 (Fig. 56, a); the maximum number of intersection points of a six-link broken line is 7 (Fig. 56, b). It is also not difficult to show that for each even (n), there exists an (n)-link closed broken line with (frac{n(n-4)}{2} + 1) intersection points. To construct such a broken line, divide the circle into (n) equal parts and connect the division points with chords that cut off (frac{n}{2} - 1) parts of the circle (similarly to how we did it in the case of an odd (n)). We will obtain a broken line with (frac{n(n-4)}{2}) intersection points (each link intersects with (n-4) other links); if (n) is not divisible by 4, then this broken line will split into two unconnected parts (Fig. 57, a shows exactly such a case, corresponding to (n = 10)). By removing two parallel chords from our broken line and replacing them with diameters connecting the same four points in pairs, we ensure that even if the original broken line split into two parts, the new broken line will not split (see Fig. 56, b). In this process, a new intersection point - the center of the circle - will appear. However, if the new links pass through the intersection points of the old links (Fig. 57, b), several intersection points of the broken line will merge into one, and the total number of intersection points will decrease. By slightly moving one end of each of the new links along the circle, we will obtain a broken line where no three links pass through the same point (Fig. 57, c). The number of intersection points of this broken line will be (frac{n(n-4)}{2} + 1).In particular, there exists a 1950-link closed broken line with (frac{1950 cdot 1946}{2} + 1 = 1897351) intersection points.We will now show that an (n)-link broken line, where (n) is even, cannot have more than (frac{n(n-4)}{2"},{"problem":"If X sim B(n, p), and E(X) = 6, V(X) = 3, then the value of P(X = 1) is ________.","solution":"Given that X follows a binomial distribution B(n, p), we have the mean E(X) = np and the variance V(X) = np(1-p).From the given information, E(X) = np = 6 and V(X) = np(1-p) = 3.

We start by trying a=20 and b=20 which is a solution, since 5 times 20+2 times 20=140.This pair for a and b satisfies all of the conditions except ab and every time we add two 5 s and subtract five 2 s, a becomes greater and b becomes smaller.Thus, we need to go in the other direction.Consider a=20-2=18 and b=20+5=25.This is a solution since 5 times 18+2 times 25=140.Here, a<b and a+b=43, so this pair satisfies all of the conditions.Next, consider a=18-2=16 and b=25+5=30.This is a solution since 5 times 16+2 times 30=140.Here, a<b and a+b=46, so this pair satisfies all of the conditions.Notice that the sum a+b increases by 3 on each of these steps.This means that doing this 17 more times gets us to a=16-17 times 2=-18 and b=30+17 times 5=115.This is a solution since 5 times(-18)+2 times 115=140.Notice that it is still the case that a<b and a+b<100.Repeating this process one more time, we get a=-20 and b=120, which gives a+b=100 and so there are no more pairs that work.Since we know that a has to be even and we are considering all possible even values for a, there can be no other pairs that work.In total, there are 1+1+17=19 pairs of integers a and b that satisfy each of the given conditions and the given equation.## Solution 2We begin by rearranging the given equation to isolate b.Doing so, we getbegin{aligned}frac{a}{4}+frac{b}{10} & =7 frac{b}{10} & =7-frac{a}{4} 10 times frac{b}{10} & left.=10 times 7-10 times frac{a}{4} quad text { (multiplying each term by } 10right) b & =70-frac{10 a}{4} b & =70-frac{5 a}{2}end{aligned}Since b is an integer, then 70-frac{5 a}{2} is an integer, which means that frac{5 a}{2} must be an integer.Since 2 does not divide 5, then 2 must divide a and so a is even.Since a<b and b=70-frac{5 a}{2}, thenbegin{aligned}a & <70-frac{5 a}{2} 2 times a & left.<2 times 70-2 times frac{5 a}{2} quad text { (multiplying each term by } 2right) 2 a & <140-5 a 7 a & <140 a & <20end{aligned}Further, since a+b<100 and b=70-frac{5 a}{2}, thenbegin{aligned}a+70-frac{5 a}{2} & <100 2 times a+2 times 70-2 times frac{5 a}{2} & <2 times 100 quad(text { multiplying each term by } 2) 2 a+140-5 a & <200 -60 & <3 a -20 & <aend{aligned}Thus a is an even integer that is greater than -20 and less than 20 .Since there are 19 even integers from -18 to 18 inclusive, we suspect that there are 19 pairs of integers a and b that satisfy the given equation.It is a good idea (and good practice) to at least check that the largest and smallest of these values of a do indeed satisfy each of the given conditions.When a=-18, we get b=70-frac{5(-18)}{2} or b=70-5(-9), and so b=115.This pair satisfies the given conditions that a<b and a+b<100.Substituting a=-18 and b=115 into the given equation, we getfrac{a}{4}+frac{b}{10}=frac{-18}{4}+frac{115}{10}=frac{-9}{2}+frac{23}{2}=frac{14}{2}=7and thus a=-18 and b=115 is a solution.When a=18, we get b=70-frac{5(18)}{2} or b=70-5(9), and so b=25.This satisfies the given conditions that a<b and a+b<100.Substituting a=18 and b=25 into the given equation, we getfrac{a}{4}+frac{b}{10}=frac{18}{4}+frac{25}{10}=frac{9}{2}+frac{5}{2}=frac{14}{2}=7and thus a=18 and b=25 is also a solution.At this point we can be confident that for each of the 19 even integer values of a from -18 to 18 inclusive, there is an integer b for which the pair of integers a and b satisfy each of the given conditions and the given equation."},{"problem":"Task 6.

Let the vertices of the given triangle be denoted as P, Q, R as shown in the figure. The distance of a point X from the line YZ will be denoted as d(X, YZ). For area calculations, we denote c=|AB| and v=d(C, AB). Finally, S_{XYZ} will denote the area of triangle XYZ.Triangles ABC and FEC with a common angle at vertex C are similar by the theorem SSS with a similarity coefficient |CF| / |CA| = |CE| / |CB| = 1/3, so it follows that EF parallel AB, |EF| = |AB| / 3 = c / 3, and d(C, EF) = d(C, AB) / 3 = v / 3. From the last relation, it follows that the distance between the parallel lines AB and EF is 2v / 3.Similarly, from the similarity of triangles ABC and GDC with a coefficient |CG| / |CA| = |CD| / |CB| = 2/3, it follows that DG parallel AB and |GD| = 2 cdot |AB| / 3 = 2c / 3. The proven parallelism of the three segments AB, DG, and EF means the congruence of the angles marked in the same way in the figure.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_29a3dddc7a9db375e695g-06.jpg?height=497&width=596&top_left_y=1151&top_left_x=730)We see that triangles PAB and PEF are similar by the theorem AA, and the similarity coefficient |EF| / |AB| is (as we already know) 1/3. Therefore, we havefrac{d(P, EF)}{d(P, AB)} = frac{1}{3}, quad text{and} quad d(P, EF) + d(P, AB) = d(E, AB) = frac{2v}{3}.From this, it easily follows that d(P, EF) = v / 6 (and also d(P, AB) = v / 2, which we will use in the note after the solution).Now, notice that point G is the midpoint of segment AF. Since GQ parallel EF, GQ is the midline of triangle AEF. Similarly, RD is the midline of triangle BEF. From this, we get|QR| = |GD| - |GQ| - |RD| = |GD| - frac{|EF|}{2} - frac{|EF|}{2} = |GD| - |EF| = frac{2c}{3} - frac{c}{3} = frac{c}{3} = |EF|.Triangles PQR and PEF are thus congruent by the theorem ASA. The desired area S_{PQR} is therefore equal to the area S_{PEF}, which we can easily determineS_{PEF} = frac{1}{2} cdot |EF| cdot d(P, EF) = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{c}{3} cdot frac{v}{6} = frac{1}{18} cdot frac{cv}{2} = frac{1}{18} cdot S_{ABC}.Conclusion. The desired ratio of the areas of triangles PQR and ABC is the same for any initial triangle ABC, and it is equal to 1:18.Note. The use of the theorem ASA to prove the congruence of triangles PQR and PEF can be replaced by noting that QREF is a parallelogram, since its opposite sides QR and EF are parallel and congruent. Let's show that it is not even necessary to consider triangle PEF at all. Instead, after calculating |QR| = c / 3, we can directly calculate d(P, QR) = v / 6. For this, it is enough to use the similarity of triangles PAB and PQR with a coefficient |QR| / |AB| = 1/3. According to this, we have d(P, QR) = d(P, AB) / 3 = v / 6, since we have already determined the value d(P, AB) = v / 2 in the solution.## GUIDING AND SUPPLEMENTARY PROBLEMS:N1.

Analyzing the Dominant Term:   As ( n ) tends to infinity, ((1+sqrt{3})^{2n}) grows exponentially while ((1-sqrt{3})^{2n}) tends to zero because (|1-sqrt{3}| < 1). Therefore, the dominant term in both the numerator and the denominator is ((1+sqrt{3})^{2n}).6. Final Limit Calculation:   [   lim_{n to infty} frac{sqrt{3} cdot (1+sqrt{3})^{2n}}{(1+sqrt{3})^{2n}} = sqrt{3}   ]Thus, the limit is (sqrt{3}).The final answer is (boxed{sqrt{3}})."},{"problem":"The circumference of the cross-section of a cylinder is 90 mathrm{~cm}.

The following automaton is suitable:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_10c029b6c4865f8b8ca3g-268.jpg?height=235&width=482&top_left_y=545&top_left_x=844)2. The following automaton is suitable. The idea is to remember whether there is a carry in the addition being performed. We start without a carry, and the carry and the digits we read allow us to determine if the addition is correct and the next carry, and we must end without a carry.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_10c029b6c4865f8b8ca3g-268.jpg?height=289&width=486&top_left_y=1032&top_left_x=288)3. By combining the two previous points, we construct an automaton that remembers three things in its states: whether what we have read on the first line is odious or not, then whether what we have read on the second line is odious or not, and finally the presence or absence of a carry in the addition. We take the set of states to be ({n, y}^3). We obtain the following automaton.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_10c029b6c4865f8b8ca3g-268.jpg?height=911&width=1016&top_left_y=1569&top_left_x=286)4. This time, the choice of the two terms of the sum is free, so we will use nondeterminism to guess these terms. Consider the following automaton.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_10c029b6c4865f8b8ca3g-269.jpg?height=914&width=974&top_left_y=248&top_left_x=284)On the one hand, if a number is the sum of two odious numbers, the triplet of the representations of these two odious numbers and the number itself is accepted by the automaton from the previous point, so the representation of the number itself is accepted by this automaton. On the other hand, if a representation is accepted by this automaton, by reading the labels of the same arrows in the previous automaton, the first two components provide representations of two numbers that are odious and have the desired sum. Therefore, this automaton is indeed the one sought.5. Since we have an automaton that accepts exactly the representations of the numbers we are looking for, we can find its language, which will answer the question. The method described in the proof of Kleene's theorem is one way to do this, but it is not the only one. We can also determinize the automaton and simplify it, hoping to get a sufficiently simple result from which the language can be deduced. All these calculations can be done by hand, but also by computer. We will find that the previous automaton is equivalent to the following automaton:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_10c029b6c4865f8b8ca3g-269.jpg?height=406&width=754&top_left_y=1913&top_left_x=274)From there, we verify that all numbers are sums of two odious numbers, except for 0 and numbers of the form (2^{2i+1} - 1) for (i) a natural number.## VI.

The remaining 20-s black cells ruin no more than 3 pairs each, so in total they ruin no more than 3(20-s) = 60 - 3s new pairs. In total, no more than 4s + 60 - 3s = 60 + s leqslant 60 + 18 = 78 pairs are ruined. Then, the number of unruined pairs, consisting only of white cells, is no less than 112 - 78 = 34.An example with 34 pairs of white cells is constructed as follows: consider 18 main black cells and 2 more boundary cells, each of which does not form a pair with other black cells (Fig. 3).|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  || :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |Fig. 3: to the solution of problem 9.6"},{"problem":"The ﬁgure below has only two sizes for its internal angles.

In turn, this number is smaller than one that starts with 3, and so on. So, we will count how many of these numbers start with 1, 2, etc.If we fix the first digit, for example, 1, we will have 4 choices for the second digit, namely, each of the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5. For the third digit, we will have only 3 choices, as we cannot choose a digit that has already been used, and so on. We will have 2 choices for the fourth digit and only one choice for the last digit. Therefore, we have 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24 5-digit numbers that start with 1 in Pedrinho's list, and clearly, these have to be the first 24 numbers, as they start with 1.Similarly, we also have 24 numbers that start with 2 (it's exactly the same calculation, replacing 1 with 2), which have to be the next 24 numbers in the list. The same applies to 3, 4, and 5. We conclude then that the first 24 numbers start with 1, then we have 24 that start with 2, followed by 24 that start with 3.

When 4 people share a car, there is 1 car left empty. This means that the total number of people (x) can be divided into groups of 4, and after doing so, there is still 1 car left without people. Mathematically, this can be represented as the total number of cars when people are grouped by 4, plus 1 extra car. This gives us the first part of our equation: frac{x}{4} + 1.2. When 3 people share a car, 9 people are left without a car. This means if we try to group the people into sets of 3, there will be 9 people who cannot be grouped. This situation gives us the total number of cars needed if each car takes 3 people, but since 9 people are left without a car, we subtract these 9 people from the total number of people (x) before dividing by 3.

For every integer ( n geqslant 1 ) we defineM_{n}=max _{1 leqslant k leqslant n} frac{S(n, k)}{k}, quad m_{n}=min _{1 leqslant k leqslant n} frac{S(n, k)}{k}, quad text{and} quad Delta_{n}=M_{n}-m_{n} geqslant 0.By definition, ( a_{n} in [m_{n}, M_{n}] ) for all ( n geqslant 2 ); on the other hand, ( a_{n-1}=S(n, 1) / 1 in [m_{n}, M_{n}] ). Therefore,a_{2018}-a_{2017} leqslant M_{2018}-m_{2018}=Delta_{2018},and we are interested in an upper bound for ( Delta_{2018} ).Also by definition, for any ( n > 2 ), we have ( Delta_{n} leqslant frac{n-1}{n} Delta_{n-1} ).Proof. Choose positive integers ( k, ell leqslant n ) such that ( M_{n}=S(n, k) / k ) and ( m_{n}=S(n, ell) / ell ). We have ( S(n, k)=a_{n-1}+S(n-1, k-1) ), sokleft(M_{n}-a_{n-1}right)=S(n, k)-k a_{n-1}=S(n-1, k-1)-(k-1) a_{n-1} leqslant (k-1)left(M_{n-1}-a_{n-1}right),since ( S(n-1, k-1) leqslant (k-1) M_{n-1} ). Similarly, we getellleft(a_{n-1}-m_{n}right)=(ell-1) a_{n-1}-S(n-1, ell-1) leqslant (ell-1)left(a_{n-1}-m_{n-1}right).Since ( m_{n-1} leqslant a_{n-1} leqslant M_{n-1} ) and ( k, ell leqslant n ), the obtained inequalities yieldbegin{array}{ll}M_{n}-a_{n-1} leqslant frac{k-1}{k}left(M_{n-1}-a_{n-1}right) leqslant frac{n-1}{n}left(M_{n-1}-a_{n-1}right) quad text{and} a_{n-1}-m_{n} leqslant frac{ell-1}{ell}left(a_{n-1}-m_{n-1}right) leqslant frac{n-1}{n}left(a_{n-1}-m_{n-1}right).end{array}Therefore,Delta_{n}=left(M_{n}-a_{n-1}right)+left(a_{n-1}-m_{n}right) leqslant frac{n-1}{n}left(left(M_{n-1}-a_{n-1}right)+left(a_{n-1}-m_{n-1}right)right)=frac{n-1}{n} Delta_{n-1}.Back to the problem, if ( a_{n}=1 ) for all ( n leqslant 2017 ), then ( a_{2018} leqslant 1 ) and hence ( a_{2018}-a_{2017} leqslant 0 ). Otherwise, let ( 2 leqslant q leqslant 2017 ) be the minimal index with ( a_{q}<1 ). We have ( S(q, i)=i ) for all ( i=1,2, ldots, q-1 ), while ( S(q, q)=q-1 ). Therefore, ( a_{q}<1 ) yields ( a_{q}=S(q, q) / q=1-frac{1}{q} ).Now we have ( S(q+1, i)=i-frac{1}{q} ) for ( i=1,2, ldots, q ), and ( S(q+1, q+1)=q-frac{1}{q} ). This gives usm_{q+1}=frac{S(q+1,1)}{1}=frac{S(q+1, q+1)}{q+1}=frac{q-1}{q} quad text{and} quad M_{q+1}=frac{S(q+1, q)}{q}=frac{q^{2}-1}{q^{2}}so ( Delta_{q+1}=M_{q+1}-m_{q+1}=(q-1) / q^{2} ). Denoting ( N=2017 geqslant q ) and using Claim 1 for ( n=q+2, q+3, ldots, N+1 ) we finally obtainDelta_{N+1} leqslant frac{q-1}{q^{2}} cdot frac{q+1}{q+2} cdot frac{q+2}{q+3} cdots frac{N}{N+1}=frac{1}{N+1}left(1-frac{1}{q^{2}}right) leqslant frac{1}{N+1}left(1-frac{1}{N^{2}}right)=frac{N-1}{N^{2}}as required.Comment 1. One may check that the maximal value of ( a_{2018}-a_{2017} ) is attained at the unique sequence, which is presented in the solution above.Comment 2. An easier question would be to determine the maximal value of ( left|a_{2018}-a_{2017}right| ).

(15 points) Several boxes are stored in a warehouse. It is known that there are no more than 60 boxes, and each of them contains either 59 apples or 60 oranges. After a box with a certain number of oranges was brought to the warehouse, the number of fruits in the warehouse became equal. What is the smallest number of oranges that could have been in the brought box?","solution":"Answer: 30.Solution. Let the number of boxes with oranges be denoted by n, the number of boxes with apples by m, and the number of oranges in the brought box by x. According to the problem, 59 m = 60 n + x. By moving 59 n to the left side, we get 59(m - n) = n + x. From this, it follows that n + x is a natural number divisible by 59, so it is at least 59. Also, since both sides of the equation are positive, we have m > n.If x leq 29, then n geq 30 and m geq 31, which contradicts the condition n + m leq 60. Therefore, x geq 30.It remains to note that for m = 30, n = 29, and x = 30, the condition of the problem is satisfied, meaning there could be exactly 30 oranges in the brought box.Alternative solution. Consider the situation with the smallest possible number of oranges in the box. Note that there must be more boxes with apples than boxes with oranges (otherwise, there would already be fewer apples than oranges in the boxes, and the brought box with oranges would not be able to equalize the number of fruits). Let the number of boxes with oranges be denoted by n; then n leq 29, otherwise the total number of boxes would exceed 60.We will prove that the number of boxes with apples is exactly one more than the number of boxes with oranges. Indeed, in any other case, there are at least n + 2 boxes with apples. This means that the number of apples in the boxes is at least59(n + 2) - 60 n = 118 - nSince n leq 29, this difference is at least 89. But then one box with apples can be removed, and the number of oranges in the brought box can be reduced by 59. This means that the considered case does not give the minimum number of oranges in the box, a contradiction.Then the difference between the number of apples and the number of oranges in the boxes is59(n + 1) - 60 n = 59 - nThis difference decreases as n increases, so the smallest value of the difference is achieved at the largest value of n. Therefore, this difference (equal to the number of oranges in the box) reaches its smallest value, 30, at the largest value of n = 29 (the total number of boxes is then exactly 59).## CriteriaThe highest applicable criterion is used:15 points. Any complete solution to the problem.12 points. The estimate is proven that there are at least 30 oranges in the box.Alternatively (if the above criteria are not applicable or give fewer points), the following advancements are summed:+8 points. It is proven that to achieve the minimum difference between the number of apples and the number of oranges, the number of boxes with apples must be exactly one more.In the absence of a proof of this fact, the following criterion is used:+6 points. This fact is stated without proof.+7 points. All cases for n < 30 are considered, where there are n + 1 boxes with apples and n boxes with oranges. (For example, it may be noted that when n increases by 1, the difference 59(n + 1) - 60 n = 59 - n decreases by 1.)In the absence of a complete consideration of these cases, the following criterion is used:+3 points. An example is given where there are exactly 30 oranges in the box (or it is otherwise proven that such a situation is possible).The following advancement is not scored:0 points.

Since C = pi - (A+B), we have sin C = sin(pi - (A+B)) = sin(A+B).2. Using the sine addition formula, sin(A+B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B.3. The given equation sin C = 2cos A sinleft(B+frac{pi}{3}right) can be expanded using the sine addition formula as well:    [2cos Aleft(frac{1}{2}sin B + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos Bright) = cos A sin B + sqrt{3}cos A cos B].4. Equating the two expressions for sin C, we get sin A cos B + cos A sin B = cos A sin B + sqrt{3}cos A cos B.5. Simplifying, we find that cos B(sin A - sqrt{3}cos A) = 0.From this, we have two possibilities: cos B = 0 or sin A - sqrt{3}cos A = 0.- If cos B = 0, then B = frac{pi}{2}, which contradicts the condition of triangle ABC being acute. Therefore, this case is discarded.- The remaining possibility is sin A - sqrt{3}cos A = 0, which simplifies to tan A = sqrt{3}. Given that 0 < A < frac{pi}{2}, we conclude that A = frac{pi}{3}.Therefore, A = boxed{frac{pi}{3}}.# Part (2):1. From part (1), we know cos A = frac{1}{2}.2.

The area of triangle ABC, S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2}bcsin A, can also be expressed as frac{1}{2}a cdot AD. Thus, AD = frac{sqrt{3}bc}{2a}.5.

But in this case, the equality m-r=2020 d_{1}=2021 d_{2}+800 also holds, so the number m-r also satisfies the condition of the problem.

Let t = frac{y}{x}, then t > 0.The condition is equivalent to 2 + a(t - 2e)ln t = 0.This implies that (t - 2e)ln t = -frac{2}{a} has a solution.Let g(t) = (t - 2e)ln t.

Prove that there is a polynomial  S(x) so that  P(x) equal{} S(Q(x)) quad forall x.","solution":"1. Given Information and Initial Setup:   We are given polynomials ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ) and a polynomial ( R(x, y) ) such that the identity ( P(x) - P(y) = R(x, y) (Q(x) - Q(y)) ) holds. We need to prove that there exists a polynomial ( S(x) ) such that ( P(x) = S(Q(x)) ) for all ( x ).2. Using the Division Algorithm:   By the Division Algorithm for polynomials, we can write:   [   P(x) = A(x)Q(x) + B(x)   ]   where ( A(x), B(x) in mathbb{R}[x] ) and ( deg B < deg Q ).3. Substituting into the Given Identity:   Substituting into the given identity, we get:   [   P(x) - P(y) = [A(x)Q(x) + B(x)] - [A(y)Q(y) + B(y)]   ]   Simplifying, we have:   [   P(x) - P(y) = A(x)Q(x) - A(y)Q(y) + B(x) - B(y)   ]   Given ( P(x) - P(y) = R(x, y) (Q(x) - Q(y)) ), we can write:   [   Q(x) - Q(y) mid A(x)Q(x) - A(y)Q(y) + B(x) - B(y)   ]4. Analyzing the Divisibility:   Since ( Q(x) - Q(y) mid A(x)Q(x) - A(y)Q(y) + B(x) - B(y) ), we can write:   [   Q(x) - Q(y) mid [A(x) - A(y)]Q(x) + B(x) - B(y)   ]5. Considering the Roots of ( Q(x) ):   Let ( {r_1, ldots, r_k} ) be the set of distinct roots of ( Q(x) ), and let ( Q(x) = (x - r_1)^{a_1} cdots (x - r_k)^{a_k} ) for some ( a_i in mathbb{Z}_{ge 1} ). If ( r ) and ( s ) are roots of ( Q ), then plugging in ( x = r ) and ( y = s ) implies ( B(r) = B(s) ). Hence, ( B(r_1) = cdots = B(r_k) ).6. Form of ( B(x) ):   Therefore, ( B(x) - c = (x - r_1)^{b_1} cdots (x - r_k)^{b_k} ) for some constant ( c in mathbb{R} ) and for some ( b_i in mathbb{Z}_{ge 1} ).7. Further Divisibility Analysis:   From the previous step, we get:   [   Q(x) - Q(y) mid [A(x) - A(y)]Q(x) + B(x) - B(y)   ]   We know ( x - y mid P(x) - P(y) ) for any polynomial ( P ). Hence, we can write:   [   frac{Q(x) - Q(y)}{x - y} Bigg| left[ frac{A(x) - A(y)}{x - y} right] Q(x) + left[ frac{B(x) - B(y)}{x - y} right]   ]8. Taking the Limit as ( y ) Approaches ( x ):   Taking the limit as ( y ) approaches ( x ), we get:   [   Q'(x) mid A'(x)Q(x) + B'(x)   ]   This implies:   [   A'(x)Q(x) + B'(x) = Q'(x)S(x, y)   ]   for some ( S(x, y) in mathbb{R}[x, y] ).9. Lemma: Multiplicity of Roots:   If ( Q ) has a root ( r ) with multiplicity ( n ), then ( r ) is also a root of ( B ), and it has multiplicity at least ( n ).10. Proof of Lemma:    Replace ( n ) with ( n + 1 ). We know ( Q(r) = 0 ) and ( Q'(r) = 0 ), and so on till ( Q^{(n)}(r) = 0 ). Taking ( n - 1 ) derivatives of the previous equation, every term on the LHS (except ( B^{(n)}(x) )) and every term on the RHS will have a term ( Q^{(m)}(x) ) for some ( m in {0, ldots, n} ), and is hence ( 0 ). Therefore, ( B^{(n)}(x) = 0 ), and also by the same logic ( B^{(m)}(x) = 0 ) for any ( m le n ). Therefore, ( B ) has a root at ( r ) with multiplicity ( n ) as well. ( blacksquare )11. Claim: ( B(x) ) is a Constant Polynomial:    Suppose ( Q ) has a root ( r_i ) with multiplicity ( a_i ge 2 ). By the Lemma, so does ( B ), so ( (x - r_i)^{a_i} mid B(x) ). Hence ( B'(x) ) has a root at ( r_i ) with multiplicity at least ( a_i - 1 ). By the previous equation, ( B'(x) ) has a root at ( r_i ) with multiplicity ( b_i - 1 ). Therefore, ( b_i - 1 ge a_i - 1 ), so ( b_i ge a_i ). Summing over all ( i ), we get ( deg B ge deg Q ), contradiction. Therefore, we must have ( B(x) = c ) in fact, since the ( 0 ) polynomial has any number as a root, and any root has infinite multiplicity. ( blacksquare )12. Final Step:    Now we are almost done. We claim ( A(x) ) also works in the place of ( P(x) ) in the original statement. Indeed, since ( P(x) = A(x)Q(x) + c ), and ( Q(x) - Q(y) mid P(x) - P(y) ), we have ( Q(x) - Q(y) mid A(x)Q(x) - A(y)Q(y) ), which implies ( Q(x) - Q(y) mid [A(x) - A(y)]Q(x) ). But ( gcd(Q(x), Q(x) - Q(y)) = gcd(Q(x), Q(y)) = 1 ) since they are polynomials purely in different variables. Therefore, ( Q(x) - Q(y) mid A(x) - A(y) ), as claimed. Now we can continue the process, and backtracking once the process is finished, we get that ( P(x) ) is a polynomial in ( Q(x) ) (the process essentially builds up the polynomial in ( Q ), increasing the degree by ( 1 ) at each step).The final answer is ( boxed{ P(x) = S(Q(x)) } ) for some polynomial ( S(x) )."},{"problem":"In the plane, the given vectors are overrightarrow{a} = (3, 2), overrightarrow{b} = (-1, 2), overrightarrow{c} = (1, 6).

By rotational symmetry, all dominoes in the bottom region are horizontal; all dominoes in the right region are vertical; and all dominoes in the top region are horizontal, as shown in Figure 8.If only k(k<2n) cells are marked, and there exists a partition P that satisfies the conditions, we will prove that there exists another partition different from P that also satisfies the conditions.Let d be the main diagonal of the grid. Construct a graph where each edge is colored one of two colors: each vertex in the graph corresponds to a cell in the grid. If two cells belong to the same domino in P, then a red edge is drawn between the corresponding vertices in the graph. A blue edge is drawn between the symmetric points of the two vertices about d. It is possible for two vertices to be connected by edges of both colors. Thus, each vertex has a degree of 1 for both red and blue edges. Therefore, the graph is partitioned into several cycles, each of which alternates between red and blue edges (a cycle can have a length of 2).Consider any cell c on the diagonal d. The two edges adjacent to c are symmetric about d. Therefore, the cells adjacent to c are different. This indicates that the cycle C(c) containing c has a length of at least 4. Consider a part of this cycle: c_{0}, c_{1}, cdots, c_{m}, where c_{0}=c and m is the smallest positive integer such that cell c_{m} is on the diagonal d. Then cell c_{m} is different from c. Since the symmetric path about the diagonal d is also part of this cycle, these two parts together form C(c). Therefore, C(c) contains exactly two cells on the diagonal d. This indicates that all 2n cells on the diagonal d belong to n cycles C_{1}, C_{2}, cdots, C_{n}, each of which has a length of at least 4.By the pigeonhole principle, there exists a cycle C_{i} that contains at most one of the k marked cells.To modify P, first remove the dominoes corresponding to the red edges in C_{i}, and then place the dominoes corresponding to the blue edges in C_{i}. Since C_{i} contains at least 4 vertices, the partition P^{prime} is different from P, and since C_{i} contains at most one marked cell, no domino in P^{prime} contains two marked cells. This proves that the partition is not unique.Therefore, k cannot be less than 2n."},{"problem":"Given P: |2x-3|<1, and Q: x(x-3)<0, then P is the (   ) condition for Q.A: Sufficient but not necessary condition;B: Necessary but not sufficient condition;C: Necessary and sufficient condition;D: Neither sufficient nor necessary condition.","solution":"Answer: First, solve the inequalities to get P: 1<x<2, and Q: 0<x<3.

Find, with proof, the largest possible value of 4tau(n)-n over all positive integers n.","solution":"1. Understanding the function tau(n):   - The function tau(n) represents the number of positive divisors of n. For example, if n = 12, then the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, so tau(12) = 6.2. Establishing an upper bound for tau(n):   - We need to find an upper bound for tau(n). Note that for any positive integer n, the number of divisors tau(n) is at most the number of integers from 1 to n. However, we can refine this bound by considering that divisors come in pairs. For example, if d is a divisor of n, then frac{n}{d} is also a divisor of n.   - If d leq sqrt{n}, then frac{n}{d} geq sqrt{n}. Therefore, the number of divisors tau(n) is at most 2sqrt{n}, but this is a loose bound. A tighter bound is given by considering the divisors larger than n/4.3. Bounding tau(n) more tightly:   - The only divisors of n larger than n/4 can be n/3, n/2, n. This gives us at most 3 divisors larger than n/4.   - Therefore, tau(n) leq n/4 + 3.4. Maximizing 4tau(n) - n:   - We want to maximize the expression 4tau(n) - n. Using the bound tau(n) leq n/4 + 3, we substitute this into the expression:     [     4tau(n) - n leq 4left(frac{n}{4} + 3right) - n = n + 12 - n = 12     ]   - Therefore, the maximum value of 4tau(n) - n is at most 12.5. Checking if the bound is achievable:   - We need to check if there exists an integer n such that 4tau(n) - n = 12.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find a positive integer ( n ) such that there exists a permutation (sigma) of the set ( S_n = {1, 2, ldots, n} ) satisfying the following conditions:   [   d(1) + d(2) + ldots + d(n) = 2017   ]   [   frac{1}{d(1)} + frac{1}{d(2)} + ldots + frac{1}{d(n)} = 2   ]   Here, ( d(a) ) is the length of the cycle containing ( a ) in the permutation (sigma).2. Cycle Decomposition:   Any permutation can be decomposed into disjoint cycles. Let the lengths of these cycles be ( c_1, c_2, ldots, c_k ). Therefore, we have:   [   c_1 + c_2 + cdots + c_k = n   ]   For each element ( a ) in a cycle of length ( c_i ), ( d(a) = c_i ). Thus, the first condition becomes:   [   c_1 + c_2 + cdots + c_k = 2017   ]3. Harmonic Sum Condition:   The second condition translates to:   [   frac{1}{c_1} + frac{1}{c_2} + cdots + frac{1}{c_k} = 2   ]   Since each cycle contributes ( frac{1}{c_i} ) to the sum, and each cycle length ( c_i ) must be a positive integer, we need to find such ( c_i ) that satisfy both conditions.4. Finding ( k ):   From the harmonic sum condition, we can infer that:   [   k = 2   ]   This is because the sum of the reciprocals of the cycle lengths must equal 2, and the only way to achieve this with positive integers is to have exactly two terms.5. Solving the Equations:   Given ( k = 2 ), we have:   [   c_1 + c_2 = 2017   ]   [   frac{1}{c_1} + frac{1}{c_2} = 2   ]   Solving the second equation for ( c_1 ) and ( c_2 ):   [   frac{c_1 + c_2}{c_1 c_2} = 2 implies frac{2017}{c_1 c_2} = 2 implies c_1 c_2 = frac{2017}{2} = 1008.5   ]   Since ( c_1 ) and ( c_2 ) must be integers, we need to find integer solutions to:   [   c_1^2 + c_2^2 = 2017   ]   The only integer solutions to this equation are ( c_1 = 44 ) and ( c_2 = 9 ) (or vice versa).6.

However, we must verify which of these values satisfy the original combinatorial equation. Looking back at the combinatorial equations, we can discard n = 1 and n = 2 since they don't make sense for the combinations (C_{n}^{3} and C_{n}^{5}), as n must be greater than 3 and 5 respectively. So, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.Let's reconsider the step where we compare:frac{1}{2 times (n - 3)!} = frac{1}{5 times 4 times (n - 5)!}Instead of simplifying the factorials prematurely, let's write them out explicitly:frac{1}{2 times (n - 3)(n - 4)(n - 5)!} = frac{1}{5 times 4 times (n - 5)!}Now we can cancel out the (n - 5)! on each side:frac{1}{2 times (n - 3)(n - 4)} = frac{1}{5 times 4}Multiplying both sides by 2 times (n - 3)(n - 4) gives:1 = frac{1}{10} times (n - 3)(n - 4)Multiplying both sides by 10:10 = (n - 3)(n - 4)Expanding this out, we get:n^2 - 7n + 12 = 10Subtracting 10 from both sides, we have:n^2 - 7n + 2 = 0This is not a correctly factored form; we made an error in our calculations in the previous step.

Since such integers do not exist, we made another mistake in factoring. We need to solve this quadratic equation to find the correct values of n:n^2 - 7n + 2 = 0This can be solved using the quadratic formula:n = frac{-(-7) pm sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 2}}{2 cdot 1}n = frac{7 pm sqrt{49 - 8}}{2}n = frac{7 pm sqrt{41}}{2}Since n must be an integer (because it's the number of elements in a set, and thus cannot be a fraction), this solution does not make sense in the context of combinations. We must have made an algebraic error.Let's go back and correct the algebraic manipulation. When we expand the expression (n - 3)(n - 4) correctly, we should get:n^2 - 4n - 3n + 12 = 10This simplifies to:n^2 - 7n + 12 = 10Subtracting 10 from both sides:n^2 - 7n + 2 = 0Instead of assuming this doesn't factor, let's apply the quadratic formula:n = frac{7 pm sqrt{49 - 4 cdot 2}}{2}n = frac{7 pm sqrt{41}}{2}Again, this does not result in an integer solution for n. This is because there have been several algebraic errors throughout the process.

Whether a figure is convex can be determined using geometric and analytical (coordinate) methods. Let's focus on the coordinate method.The equation of a line passing through two given points ( M_{1}left(x_{i} ; y_{1}right) ) and ( M_{2}left(x_{2} ; y_{2}right) ) is given by (see problem 23):[left(x-x_{1}right)left(y_{2}-y_{1}right)=left(y-y_{1}right)left(x_{2}-x_{1}right)]or, when ( x_{1} neq x_{2} ) and ( y_{1} neq y_{2} ),[frac{x-x_{i}}{x_{2}-x_{i}}=frac{y-y_{i}}{y_{2}-y_{i}}]Let (frac{x-x_{i}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=frac{y-y_{i}}{y_{2}-y_{i}}=k), then[left{begin{array}{l}x=(1-k) x_{1}+k x_{2} y=(1-k) y_{i}+k y_{2}end{array}right.]Equations ( (1^{prime}) ) and (1) represent the parametric equations of the line ( M_{1} M_{2} ) with the current point ( M(x ; y) ).Remark. Equation (1) is the equation of the line ( M_{1} M_{2} ), which is not parallel to the coordinate axes. If this line is parallel to the coordinate axes, its equation will be:[x=x_{i} quad text { or } quad y=y_{i} .]Task 1. By making the appropriate drawings, determine the following for the parameter ( k ):a) If the point ( M ) lies on the line ( M_{1} M_{2} ) and the vectors ( overline{M_{1} M_{2}} ) and ( overline{M_{1} M} ) are directed in the same way, then ( k>0 ); if these vectors are directed oppositely, then ( k<0 );b) If the point ( M ) does not lie on the segment ( M_{1} M_{2} ) and the vectors ( overline{M_{1} M_{2}}, overline{M_{1} M} ) are directed oppositely, then ( k<0 );c) If the point ( M ) lies on the segment ( M_{1} M_{2} ), then[0 leqslant k leqslant 1]The endpoints of the segment, points ( M_{1} ) and ( M_{2} ), correspond to the values: ( k=0 ) and ( k=1 ).Task 2. Prove that if the points ( M_{1}left(x_{1} ; y_{1}right) ) and ( M_{2}left(x_{2} ; y_{2}right) ) belong to the chord of the circle ( x^{2}+y^{2}-r^{2} leqslant 0 ), then ( x_{1} x_{2}+y_{1} y_{2}-r^{2} leqslant 0 ).Hint. Consider the expression ( x_{1} x_{2}+y_{1} y_{2}-r^{2} ) as the algebraic sum of the numerical values of the areas of rectangles with sides ( x_{1} ) and ( x_{2} ), ( y_{1} ) and ( y_{2} ), ( r ) and ( r ) (the numerical values of ( x_{1} x_{2} ) and ( y_{1} y_{2} ) can be positive, negative, or zero)."},{"problem":"Given a hyperbola with its foci on the x-axis and the equation of its asymptotes as y=pm frac{3}{4}x, and the product of the eccentricity of this hyperbola and the eccentricity of the curve frac{x^2}{4}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 (b > 0) is 1, then the value of b isA: frac{6}{5}B: frac{10}{3}C: 3 or 4D: frac{6}{5} or frac{10}{3}","solution":"AnalysisThis problem examines the geometric properties of hyperbolas and ellipses.

All mathematically and logically correct solutions are equally valid. When evaluating each problem, reasonably consider the provided scoring guide. A competitor should not receive more than 3 points for a partial solution to a problem if the path to the final solution is not evident from the partial solution.","solution":"IV/5. Let's see how many times each digit appears in the first row. First, let's count how many nines there are in the numbers from 1 to 999. The easiest way to do this is to count the numbers with exactly one nine, exactly two nines, and exactly three nines.If we have exactly one nine, we can place it in the first, second, or third position. For the remaining two positions, we can place any digit from 0 to 8, which gives us 9 options for each position. Thus, we have 3 possible choices for the position of the nine, and once it is placed, we have (9 cdot 9) options for the other digits. In total, this gives us (3 cdot 9 cdot 9 = 243) nines.Two nines can be placed in three positions in 3 ways, and on the remaining position, we can place any digit from 0 to 8, so there are (2 cdot 3 cdot 9 = 54) nines in such numbers. The number 999 has three nines.Thus, there are exactly (243 + 54 + 3 = 300) nines in the numbers from 1 to 999, and this is how many times each other digit appears. In the numbers from 1000 to 1999, there are also 300 twos, threes, ..., and one more thousand ones. The sum of the digits that appear in the numbers from 1 to 1999 is thus[1000 + 2 cdot 300 cdot (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9) = 28000]The sum of the digits from the number 2000 to 2006 is (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 35). The sum of the numbers in the second row is 28035.Second solution. Let (S(n)) denote the sum of the digits of the number (n). We observe: if (m + n = 1999), then (S(m) + S(n) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 28). Let's show that this is true. We can assume that (m) is a three-digit number and (n) is a four-digit number. Write (m) as (m = overline{m_1 m_2 m_3}). Then (n = 1999 - overline{m_1 m_2 m_3} = 1000 + (9 - m_1) cdot 100 + (9 - m_2) cdot 10 + (9 - m_3)). Since (0 leq 9 - m_i leq 9), the digits of (n) are (1, 9 - m_1, 9 - m_2), and (9 - m_3), so (S(m) + S(n)) is indeed 28.There are (frac{1998}{2} + 1 = 1000) different pairs of numbers (m) and (n) whose sum is 1999 (the number 1999 is paired with 0), so the desired sum is[begin{aligned}100 cdot 28 + S(2000) + S(2001) & + S(2002) + S(2003) + S(2004) + S(2005) + S(2006) & = 28000 + 35 = 28035end{aligned}]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_07_fb5898f0472fc84ca82bg-13.jpg?height=48&width=1625&top_left_y=1478&top_left_x=221)Counting individual digits in the numbers from 1000 to 1999 ..................... 2 points Sum of the digits in the numbers from 2000 to 2006 .........................................................................................Solution: the sum of the numbers in the second row is 28035 ............................................................[^0]:    Observing that only three numbers cycle ........................................................ 2 points    ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_07_fb5898f0472fc84ca82bg-09.jpg?height=49&width=1633&top_left_y=1643&top_left_x=220)    Concluding that the 100th position is the number (1956 - x) and calculating (x = 1856 ldots ldots ldots ldots ldots 2) points    Answer: the first position is the number 100, and the 99th position is the number (1856 ldots ldots .1) point"},{"problem":"The 36th question, the sequence left{a_{n}right}: a_{0}=a_{1}=1, a_{n}=sqrt{frac{n}{2}+a_{n-1} a_{n-2}}(n geq 2), find all real numbers t, such that for any positive integer mathrm{n}, it always holds that mathrm{tn}<mathrm{a}_{mathrm{n}}<mathrm{tn}+1.","solution":"Question 36:Solution: If there exist two t that satisfy the conditions, let's assume they are t_{1} and t_{2}, such thatt_{1}sqrt{frac{m}{2}+frac{sqrt{6}(m-1)}{6} cdot frac{sqrt{6}(m-2)}{6}}>frac{sqrt{6} m}{6}anda_{m}=sqrt{frac{m}{2}+a_{m-1} a_{m-2}}frac{1-6 t^{2}}{2 t}(m+1) Rightarrow 3>frac{1-6 t^{2}}{2 t}(m+1)andbegin{array}{l}2 b_{n+m}+b_{n+m-1}=frac{1-6 t^{2}}{2 t}(m+1)+b_{n-2}+2 b_{n-1}<frac{1-6 t^{2}}{2 t}(m+1)+3 Rightarrow 0<frac{1-6 t^{2}}{2 t}(m+1)+3end{array}Therefore, it can only be that frac{1-6 t^{2}}{2 t}=0, which means t=frac{sqrt{6}}{6}."},{"problem":"For a single-story apartment, we know the following: a) there is at most 1 door between any two rooms; b) from any room, there is at most 1 door leading outside the apartment; c) there are 12 doors in the apartment.

Therefore, the total number of doors in the apartment is frac{n(n-1)}{2} + n. This number is 10 when n=4 and 15 when n=5.

Thus, option A is incorrect.Option B: log _{5}(a-b) > 0Since a > b, it's true that a - b > 0. However, log _{5}(a-b) > 0 implies a-b > 5^0 = 1.

The perimeter of the equilateral triangle corresponding to the first term is ( x ). Therefore, the side length of the triangle is ( frac{x}{3} ).3.

Initial Consideration:   We need to ensure that for any subset of ( n ) numbers, there exist four numbers ( a, b, c, d ) satisfying ( a + 2b + 3c = d ). 2. Upper Bound Calculation:   Consider the largest possible values for ( a, b, c ) within the set ({1, 2, dots, 999}). The maximum value for ( a + 2b + 3c ) occurs when ( a, b, c ) are the largest possible values in the set. If ( a, b, c ) are close to 999, then:   [   a + 2b + 3c leq 999 + 2 cdot 999 + 3 cdot 999 = 6 cdot 999 = 5994   ]   However, since ( d ) must also be in the set ({1, 2, dots, 999}), we need to consider the constraints within this range.3. Lower Bound Calculation:   To find the minimum ( n ), we need to ensure that for any subset of ( n ) numbers, the equation ( a + 2b + 3c = d ) can be satisfied. We start by considering the smallest possible values for ( a, b, c ). If ( a, b, c ) are the smallest values in the set, then:   [   a + 2b + 3c geq 1 + 2 cdot 1 + 3 cdot 1 = 6   ]   This means ( d ) must be at least 6.4.

Ensuring the Condition:   We need to ensure that for any subset of ( n ) numbers, there exist four numbers ( a, b, c, d ) such that ( a + 2b + 3c = d ). If we select ( n ) numbers, we need to ensure that at least one combination of ( a, b, c ) from ( A ) and ( d ) from ( B ) satisfies the equation.6. Minimum ( n ) Calculation:   If we select ( n ) numbers such that ( n geq 835 ), then we can always find four numbers ( a, b, c, d ) satisfying ( a + 2b + 3c = d ). This is because:   - The set ( A ) has 166 elements.   - The set ( B ) has 833 elements.   - If we select ( n geq 835 ), we can ensure that there are enough elements in both ( A ) and ( B ) to satisfy the equation.Therefore, the minimum ( n ) is 835.The final answer is (boxed{835})."},{"problem":"6.034. 1+sqrt{1+x sqrt{x^{2}-24}}=x.6.034. 1+sqrt{1+x sqrt{x^{2}-24}}=x.","solution":"Solution.Write the equation as sqrt{1+x sqrt{x^{2}-24}}=x-1.

Therefore, option A is incorrect.Option B:In linear regression analysis, the correlation coefficient R^{2} is a measure of the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.

Identify Given Information: We are given that the lateral area of the prism is 6 and the base area is sqrt{3}. The prism is a regular triangular prism, meaning its base is an equilateral triangle.2. Solve for Side Length a and Height h:   - The lateral area of the prism is given by the perimeter of the base times the height (h), which is 3a times h = 6.   - The area of the base, an equilateral triangle, is given by frac{sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 = sqrt{3}.   - Solving these equations, we find:     - From frac{sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 = sqrt{3}, we get a^2 = 4 Rightarrow a = 2.     - Substituting a = 2 into 3a times h = 6, we get 6h = 6 Rightarrow h = 1.3. Find the Radius of the Circumcircle of triangle ABC (r):   - The formula for the circumradius r of an equilateral triangle is r = frac{a}{sqrt{3}}.   - Since a = 2, we find r = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}.4. Determine the Radius of Sphere O (R):   - The radius of the sphere O, R, can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius of the circumcircle (r), half the height of the prism (frac{h}{2}), and the radius of the sphere (R).   - Thus, R^2 = r^2 + left(frac{h}{2}right)^2 = left(frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = frac{4}{3} + frac{1}{4} = frac{19}{12}.   - Solving for R, we find R = sqrt{frac{19}{12}}.5. Calculate the Surface Area of Sphere O:   - The surface area of a sphere is given by 4pi R^2.   - Substituting R = sqrt{frac{19}{12}} into the formula, we get the surface area of sphere O as 4pi times frac{19}{12} = frac{19pi}{3}.Therefore, the surface area of the sphere O is boxed{frac{19pi}{3}}.

We distinguish three cases: there can be one, two, or three different digits in Isaac's starting number.- If only one digit occurs in the starting number, then the starting number is of the form overline{a a a} (by which we mean the number consisting of the digit a three times). Dilara then writes down no numbers, because there is no other number you can get by writing the digits of overline{a a a} in a different order. The sum is then overline{a a a} and that is always less than 1221.- If two different digits occur in the starting number, then the starting number is of the form overline{a a b}, overline{a b a}, or overline{b a a} (with a neq b). If Isaac's number is one of these three numbers, then Dilara writes down the other two. The sum then becomes overline{a a b}+overline{a b a}+overline{b a a}. We see that it must end in a 1, so b+a+a=11 or b+a+a=21. But if b+a+a=21, then we see that the total sum is already at least 2100 (because the sum of the first digits is also 21) and that is more than 1221. The only option is b+a+a=11.To find the largest possible starting number, we want to start with the largest possible digit. We see that a can be at most 5, but b can be 9 if a is 1. We try b=9 and a=1 and we look at the starting number overline{b a a}=911. Then Dilara writes down the numbers 191 and 119, and then we see that the sum 911+191+119 is indeed equal to 1221.- If three different digits occur in the starting number, then the starting number is of the form overline{a b c} (with a, b, and c different). Dilara then writes down the numbers overline{a c b}, overline{b a c}, overline{b c a}, overline{c a b}, and overline{c b a}. If we now look at these six numbers, we see that for the last digit, the digit a appears twice, the digit b appears twice, and the digit c appears twice. The last digit of the sum is thus the last digit of 2 a+2 b+2 c. This digit is always even, while the last digit of 1221 is odd.

We define the sum of the squares of the numbers on the board as ( S = sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k^2 ). We will show that this sum is invariant under the given operation.2. Proof of Invariance:    - Before the operation, the sum of the squares is:     [     S = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + dots + a_n^2.     ]   - Suppose we pick three numbers (a_1, a_2, a_3) and replace them with (sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2}).

Calculate Initial Sum: For (n = 10), the initial numbers are (1, 2, dots, 10). The sum of their squares is:   [   S = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + dots + 10^2 = sum_{k=1}^{10} k^2 = frac{10 cdot 11 cdot 21}{6} = 385.   ]4. Reduction Process: Each operation reduces the number of numbers on the board by 2. Starting with 10 numbers, we will end up with 2 numbers after 4 operations.5. Final Configuration: Let the final two numbers be (a) and (b). Since the sum of their squares must equal the invariant sum, we have:   [   a^2 + b^2 = 385.   ]6. Maximize One Number: To maximize one of the numbers, say (b), we minimize the other number (a). The smallest possible value for (a) is 1 (since all numbers are positive).

Define the problem and variables:   We need to determine the maximum number of rooks that can be placed on an ( n times n ) chessboard such that each rook is threatened by at most ( 2k ) other rooks. Let ( x ) be the total number of rooks placed on the board. For each rook, let its score be the number of rooks it threatens. 2. Introduce row and column variables:   Let ( r_i ) be the number of rooks in the ( i )-th row and ( c_i ) be the number of rooks in the ( i )-th column. The total sum of the scores of all the rooks, denoted by ( s ), can be expressed as:   [   s = sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i(r_i - 1) + sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i(c_i - 1)   ]3. Double counting and convexity:   By double counting, each pair of rooks that threaten each other is counted twice, once in the row sum and once in the column sum. Therefore, the total sum of the scores ( s ) is at most ( 2kx ):   [   s leq 2kx   ]4. Estimate the sum of squares:   Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can estimate the sum of the squares of the row and column counts:   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i^2 geq frac{(sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i)^2}{n} = frac{x^2}{n}   ]   Similarly,   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i^2 geq frac{x^2}{n}   ]5. Combine the inequalities:   Since ( r_i(r_i - 1) = r_i^2 - r_i ) and ( c_i(c_i - 1) = c_i^2 - c_i ), we have:   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i(r_i - 1) + sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i(c_i - 1) = sum_{i=1}^{n} (r_i^2 - r_i) + sum_{i=1}^{n} (c_i^2 - c_i)   ]   [   = sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i^2 + sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i^2 - x   ]   Using the previous estimates:   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i^2 + sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i^2 geq 2 cdot frac{x^2}{n}   ]   Therefore,   [   s geq 2 cdot frac{x^2}{n} - x   ]6. Set up the inequality:   Combining the upper and lower bounds for ( s ):   [   2 cdot frac{x^2}{n} - x leq 2kx   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   2 cdot frac{x^2}{n} - x leq 2kx   ]   [   2 cdot frac{x^2}{n} leq (2k + 1)x   ]   [   frac{x^2}{n} leq (k + frac{1}{2})x   ]   [   x leq n(k + 1)   ]7.
