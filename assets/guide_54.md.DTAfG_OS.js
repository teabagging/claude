It is suggested that you consider interrupting bisphosphonate treatment for 3-4 weeks prior to dental surgery and restarting after bone healing.for patients who have taken an oral bisphosphonate for more than 3 years, discontinuation of the oral bisphosphonate for 3 months prior to oral surgery may reduce the risk.

The actual tooth part doesn't start until almost my gumline. The other day, I bit too hard into the gum that is still on the impacted wisdom tooth and created a sore lump. Now I cannot chew on the left side of my mouth or close my mouth all the way.","Doctor":"HiWith your query, as you mentioned that you have impacted tooth that means the tooth hasn't reached to its occlusal level and still covered by gum that is technically called as pericoronal flap. Coming to your swelling I mean the lump could be a pericoronal abscess which  may be due to forceful food impaction in to gingiva called as pseudo pocket. Treatment for this are by two means initially it has to get irrigated by an antiseptic solution then either you should go for a procedure called operculectomy which means removal of gingiva or gum that is present over the tooth. This decision will be made by examining the tooth eruption status by radiograph and your age. In some instances if they decide tooth development is complete and chances of recurrence is more then you may have to undergo extraction for the impacted tooth.  I would suggest you to go and visit oral surgeon for time being you can start using antibiotics along with pain killers and visit dentist as early as possible for complete treatment.It is unethical to prescribe antibiotics without knowing your drug history and medical status.Hope this is informative"},{"Patient":"Since having a root carnal treatment an a crown fitted the crown only lasted 6 mouths before fulling out my dentist placed in back in only for it to come out again and since he replaced it the star of the year iv had four cysts in mouth should he of taken my tooth out by now ?","Doctor":"Hi!

Thank you for your help.","Doctor":"thanks for your query, i have gone through your query. felipressin is a vasoconstrictor that is used along with local anesthesia which increases blood pressure. if you want to get the tooth removed you can get it done under plane local anesthesia which doesnt contain vasoconstrictors. if the BP is under control you can also get it done with normal local anesthesia. consult a oral surgeon and get the tooth removed. i hope my answer will help you. take care."},{"Patient":"how long after getting wisdom teeth removed can someone begin smoking hookah again? and what are the adverse effects that could occur should one begin smoking the day of after the surgery? My wife was wondering, she had two teeth out today shes in no pain but what are the risks?","Doctor":"thanks for your query, i have gone through your query. any kind of smoking is not advised after tooth removal, because it creates a negative pressure and dislodges the clott and can result in infection like dry socket. so its better not to smoke for minimum of 3-5 days. if you still smoke it might not heal and you will get severe pain, it can get infected. i hope my answer will help you. take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I just noticed that i have a skin tag on my gums far above my teeth on top left side.

This grew fast cuz it wasnt there yesterday.","Doctor":"thanks for your query, i have gone through your query. the mucosal tags could be secondary to trauma or chemical or burn. it can be desquamative gingivitis or desquamation of the mucosa. nothing to worry, it is not cancer. consult your oral physician to get it ruled out from the above said conditions. you can use topical antiinflammatory drugs. do saline gargling. i hope my answer will help you. take care."},{"Patient":"I had my front upper teeth filled yesterday, and my lip is still swollen after 15 hours.  I also developed a huge water blister during the time they were working on my teeth.  The blister has gotten bigger and it is really hard to smile, eat, and talk.  I have rinsed the area with half hydrogen peroxide & half water and noticed some swelling go down but not completely. I also took ibprofin for the pain. I have been using cold compresses as well.  Is there anything else that I can do?","Doctor":"Hi! Welcome to Healthcaremagic.I read your query. Water blisters can happen due to various reasons like stress, infection, trauma, etc. In your case, its trauma related probably. It can either be due to trauma during filling or overhanged filling causing friction and thus blisters.In second case, you need to get your filling corrected. Otherwise, no treatment is required for blisters.Regarding lip swelling, it can be due to allergy or trauma. Do warm compressions, warm saline rinses. Take Ibuprofen or tylenol for pain.If it persists even after 2-3, you need to get your filling checked.Hope the answer helps you.

I have had this type of pain for the last several years. What I have observed is that it starts after generally eating meat, most typically chicken, and lasts for two days.

The next day, the fever and dizziness disappear and my stomach pain continues for another 1 day. The pain completely disappears in the third day.

I started experiencing excruciating pain directly after the root canal finished and up until now.  I went to an endodontist and he said the root canal is incomplete, and she didn't go all the way to the root in both canals, and that I would have to go back to get it redone.

As for white spots on tongue and burning, there may be rough spots left on teeth after reduction. This may lead to trauma and frictional keratosis.I suggest you go to your orthodontist and get any rought point left smoothened and polished. Also if there is any plaque or calculus, you can get oral prophylaxis done.If tolerable, do warm saline rinses. Massage gums using gum paint. Apply lidocaine gel before eating to reduce burning. Take multivitamin one tablet per day for 2 weeks. Maintain oral hygiene.Hope the answer helps you. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello!

Welcome to Healthcaremagic.I read your query. As you have infection in your teeth, it results in bone loss and pus formation.

I've always known I was sensitive to certain types of toothpaste (some make my mouth feel \\"raw\\"), but I also want to maintain good oral hygiene. Last weekend I felt like I had chemical burns in my mouth and the gum in-between my two front teeth was swollen. I started flossing and the area bled and some white tissue sloughed off. I never considered that it may be the toothpaste I was using, so I continued to brush 2X a day with said toothpaste and continued to floss. I realized day-before-yesterday that it may be my toothpaste and I stopped using it. I've since been brushing with baking soda. It seems as though it has improved some, but I keep getting a white tissue coating the \\"damaged\\" part of my gum. It feels fine as long as that white coating is there, but once I wipe it off it feels \\"raw\\" again.

Rather in most people, the wisdom tooth either does not errupt or errupt incompletely and usually is removed.If your wisdom tooth is fully erupted and alligned, and if dentist suggest that a root canal treatment can be done in that tooth, i suggest you to go for treatment rather than extraction. This will maintain occlusion.Extraction is always a last option if no treatment works. But may require small surgery, stitches and few discomforts post extraction like paresthesia or pain. Wisdom tooth removal does effect majorly the allignment of other teeth.Decision depends fully upon sugestion of dentist after an x-ray of tooth as for root canal, there should be visible distinct canal identified in wisdom tooth.Hope the answer helps you.

Is this pus in only limited part of gums as you mentioned or is it generalised? Do you notice any cavity in tooth near pus area?If there is, this pus can be due to dental infection, for which you need to visit a dentist.If there is no cavity, then this pus can be due to gum disease. Is the tooth in that area mobile, calculus deposit or gum receding?You need to visit a dentist. Get an x-ray done if required. In case of gum disease, you will be given an antibiotic course. If there is not much bone loss and tooth firm, scaling and curettage will help in removing infection.Maintain good oral hygiene. Do warm saline rinses. Use chlorhexidine mouthwash twice a day.

Yesterday I went to the dentist for a routine cleaning. While there the hygienist said that it was time for some wing bite x-rays. It had been two years since I had my last x-rays done. She proceeded to do them, however, I noticed that she was doing quite a few of them using various mouth pieces to get different views. After at least six different x-rays I asked her why so many were being done and she said that the doctor wanted a comprehensive set of x-rays done since it had been two years since my last x-rays were performed. I then asked the hygienist what comprises a comprehensive set and she said that ever tooth would be x-rayed. She said that they do that because cavities form between teeth and they want to know ahead what teeth might be heading for cavities. I have not had any cavities over the past 15 years and take extremely good care of my teeth, using the water pik twice daily and brushing and flossing regularly.  I am concerned about the amount of radiation that we expose ourselves to so this question is important to me to be clear on. I didn't feel I had any real clarification on this and wished for a bit more information. It wasn't forthcoming. So my key question is: what is a comprehensive x-ray procedure, and does it involve filming every tooth in a patient's mouth. I have never heard of this protocol being used before. Any information on this question would be helpful. Thank you.

If the gallbladder is not visualized within 4 hours after the injection, this indicates either cholecystitis or cystic duct obstruction. so it depends on the time at which image is taken.. diagnosis also varies according to the variation in image n the time of taking an image after injection of radiotracer.. so ur radiologist who did the proedure n saw the images of hida scan can answer ur question better.. i hope this will be helpful to you.."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, My 10 months old son has a swollen black gum, in our culture it is called Ebiino, and this situation used to be handled traditionally by digging up the gum and they remove something so called \\"maggot\\".

There can be many reasons for this lump inside the tongue.-first it can be possible that you had a trauma earlier on the tongue and now the lump appeared, it is called as pyogenic granuloma.-second it can be possible that it is a tumor called as granular cell tumor.-third it can be possible that because of some infected tooth the infection is spreading to the tongue.

I am 25 yrs old? How long it will take to cure?","Doctor":"Hi. Welcome to Healthcaremagic.I read your query. In case of spacing or irregular teeth, they are not treated individually but as entire dentition. I suggest you get an OPG and Lateral cephalogram done and visit an Orthodontist. If rest of your dentition is fine and the gap is the only thing and if it can be closed by their movement only, then your treatmentvwont require permanent braces.But usually this is not feasable as moving a tooth ultimately require whole dentition adjustment. You can go for capping or venners for only gap closure. Or there are transparent braces these days which are less visible. Treatment with fixed braces can last from 6 months upto a year varying from case to cas. And you may need to have a retention wire on inner sidd of your teeth to prevent relapse. This all needs to be decided after proper case study only.Hope the answer helps you.

Welcome to Healthcaremagic.I read your query. Is the ulcer on same location as earlier? Does it appear like a boil or swelling at tooth root?I suggest to visit your dentist and get it checked.

Both wisdom tooth partial coming out but the right side is coming outwards.

On lower right side my 1st molar is broken and had root canal few years back and require crown but can't afford at moment and wonder if it's worth removing this molar instead of the wisdom tooth to make space and how likely is it that the gap will be closed by the wisdom tooth or if at all.","Doctor":"Hi. Welcome to Healthcaremagic.I read your query. On right side as you mentioned the wisdom tooth is impinging the front tooth, it may lead to cavity and pain in front tooth. This may further need RCT and crown of the tooth in front of wisdom tooth if not take out in time. On left side, why would you prefer taking out an already RCT treated molar? The wisdom tooth is impacted, so it wont move enough to cause the closure of space from removal of molar in front.Also, you mentioned of swelled gums around wisdom teeth, which means pericoronitis, i.e. there is already infection around wisdom teeth.I suggest you to get both the wisdom tooth extraction and restoration of teeth in front of them. The RCT treated molar needs crown as RCT weekens the tooth and it can break under masticatory force. If not at the moment, get a crown over it. Till then avoiding bitting hard things from that side.Maintain oral hygiene. Do warm saline rinses.Hope the answer helps you.

Its true that anaesthesia works less in case of infection due to acidic pH created by pus. But it is not mandatory that it does not work at all. If the infection is too much, you can first take a course of antibiotics prescribed from your dentist to bring down the infection.Then you can get the tooth anesthetize for RCT.As you mentioned its painful on insertion of file during RCT, these means you have some vital pulp remaining in that tooth. Without anesthesia, the procedure would be painful and time consuming.Do warm saline rinses for draining out infection.Hope the answer helps you.

During endoscopy they at times put bite blocks in your mouth to prevent mouth closure or bitting on tube. This leads leads to jaw pain.Although its a short term effect. It will disappear soon.

Impacted wisdom teeth are more difficult to remove, leave you at greater risk for complications from surgery, and can permanently damage bones and other teeth. Also, the longer wisdom teeth pain persists, the more likely it is that an infection will result from bacteria entering open tissue.Hope this helps you.Wishing you good health...Regards."},{"Patient":"i got tested for HIV about 4 days ago it was negative i went because i started feeling dizzy with nausea now i have white coating on the back of my tongue and red swollen grains on back also my tongue is swollen i feel a gag reflex im very scared also i get a tingly sensation on my feet","Doctor":"hello thanks for consulting at hcm..u could have oral thrush,a fungal infection causing white coating,,,also papillitis of tongue at the back of tongue,,clean ur tongue with asoft  brush,, and could take topical antifungals..with the prescription of u r oral medicine/oral surgeon ..take acourse of multivitamins..do salt water gargle,,either ways consult a oral medicine/oral surgeon specialist..hope it helps,,tc"},{"Patient":"hello 6 days ago my lower left wisdom teeth is removed, it was horizontal. the surgery was not so hard but my left side of the tongue and lower left gums are still numb.

( btw I talked to my dentist and he said that it is normal I need time but he did not even bother to open my mouth and see the situation)","Doctor":"Hi! Welcome to healthcaremagic.I read your query. Wisdom tooth removal is a little more complicated compared to other teeth due to its angulation and proximity to nerve. The tingling and numbness which you are experiencing in tongue and gums can be due to minor pricking of the nerve during procedure. This usually takes 3-4 weeks to heal up or can be longer. Take proper diet, multivitamin tablet one per day for 2 weeks. Avoid taking too hot or too cold substances till numbness goes away or you may unknowingly injure your tongue.Do not accidently bite on it.Maintain good oral hygiene.Hope this answer helps you.

Bleeding is not uncommon for first 24hrs aftr removal of wisdom tooth. Also, oral bleeding is generaly bleeding and saliva. So may be the amount of blood you saw was less than that.I would suggest you to gently put a guaze piece over the wound area and bite on it. You can also put moistened tea bag as its tannic acid helps in stopping of bleeding. Change gauze piece if required.Sit upright or in a recliner. Do not rinse your mouth forcefully or drink through straw as it may dislodge the forming blood clot which is essential for blood stopping. You can put ice packs out side your mouth on surgical area, which helps in constricting vessels.Tranexemic acid tablet can be used twice a day for blood control.If the bleeding persists beyond 24hrs, please show it to the oral surgeon for any intervention required.Hope the answe helps you.

The tooth in front is quite sensitive and my jaw and cheek slightly aches. It is not horrendous pain at all, but more a dull ache. I am worried something could be wrong.

If you have infection in your tooth, it might have healed after extraction.Actually there is slight pain after extraction of molars, that is why dentist prescribes antibiotic and painkiller after the extraction.

Is this a side affect of gargling hydrogen peroxide or may this be caused be something else?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for writing to usHydrogen peroxide has a whitening effect because it can pass easily into the tooth and break down these complex molecules. Less complex molecules that reflect less light lead to a reduction or elimination of the discoloration of both the enamel and the dentin. The length of treatment depends on the level of discoloration and on the whitening product used. It ranges from short interventions in the dental office to applications at home lasting minutes/hours per day and repeated over a number of days. Single dark teeth can also be bleached successfully. Heavy tobacco stains may need as much as three months of treatment. Whitened teeth generally do not darken after treatment or darken only slightly, and when they do, retreating the teeth can easily be done.

Today I was eating sushi and I noticed that the white film is now gone and a hole is completely exposed. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for writing to usOnce a tooth is extracted, the resulting hole fills with blood and clots. This blood clot is the matrix from which your body creates the new bone and gum that will fill in the space left by the extracted tooth. As this blood clot matures and becomes more fibrous, it can appear to have a white film or skin over the top of it. This appears as a white spot in the center of the healing socket. This is nothing more than new gum tissue being formed and because this layer of the clot is exposed to the saliva in your mouth, it becomes saturated with moisture, waterlogged in a way, and appears white. This is perfectly normal and will disappear as the healing progresses. Do not poke at it or disturb it at all if you can help it.

In dental abscess, there is infection in tooth which leads to pus accumulation in bone and gums below tooth. Antibiotic cover is given to reduce infection. If you are having severe pain, ask your dentist to drain of the pus from tooth by drilling a small hole. It is very small procedure done under local anesthesia.

Lately ive been having teeth pain as well as swollen throat that has not gone away and 3 of my wisdom teeth have came in and I just got one wisdom tooth extracted 4 days ago and when the numbness from the medicine went away I started having worse pain than I did with the tooth there. Ive noticed either food particles or something else stuck in the hole where I got my tooth taken out and its kind of white/yellow and ive been trying to pick at it because im afraid to get food stuck in there and make anything worse but I noticed nothing much is coming out and it feels like I hit a nerve or something because the pain just gets worse and I feel it through my head and neck and jaw.

About 5 years ago I had a full in and barley my gums under it started swelling and a few years later my fill in fell off. I've gone to the dentist they said they can't do anything about it but just to pull it off. Is there anything to do to save it? I really don't want an implant :( please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Welcome to Healthcaremagic.I read your query. Since your dentist checked that tooth personally, tooth must have past the point of restoration. Ask your dentist if they can restore it with post and core. Or i suggest it would be good to get it removed to avoid further infection.If you dont wanna go for an implant, you can go for a bridge, also called as Fixed partial denture.So go to your dentist, get your tooth radiographed and decide.Hope the answer helps you. Thank you!"},{"Patient":"Can retainers cause sores and bumps to the roof of your mouth?

I have researched online about Forddyce Spots, this appears to be what it is, they are not getting worse, hurting or causing me any discomfort other than psychological. I am a recently divorced man (reason for going to a tanning bed) and this is causing me a great deal of anxiety because I am so self conscious of the obvious white spots on my lip that looks like a cold sore. I have even started putting a light colored lipstick on the spot to try and conceal it, but it only works for a short period of time and I continually check it to makes sure it hasn't rubbed off. I am willing to do whatever it takes to correct this please help.","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for consulting with healthcaremagic. This white spot which is present on your lips can be a fotdyces spot, mucocele, leukoplakia or lichen.There are these all condition similar to what you are mentioning.

I had one pulled on the left and three pulled on the right. The doctor put a chain on 2 of the teeth to pull them down. I had the surgery in October 2012. When I go to the orthodontist for my appointments they put wire and this rubber string on the chain but it seems like nothing is happening. It is now December 2013 and it seems like no teeth are even being moved or coming down. What will happen if they never come down? What will they do?","Doctor":"Hi. Welcome to Healthcaremagic.I read your query. You didn't mention the age of your baby. In some cases when teeth do not erupt according to age, orthodontic intervention is useful. The orthodontist must have done an OPG of the child. That shows the number of teeth developing. There is a specific time period for every tooth to appear in mouth, before which they wont. Except third molars, entire permanent dentition erupts by the age of 12-13years.Don't you worry. Just give child a healthy diet, calcium, milk, vegetables. And follow up with the orthodontist regularly. You can also get another OPG done for knowing various teeth development.Hope the answer helps.

Actually when there is infection in the tooth it can spread through blood stream to the heart,  and after surgery your heart will be more prone for infection.
