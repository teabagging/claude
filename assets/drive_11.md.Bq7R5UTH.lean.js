The projection of overrightarrow{AP} onto the direction of overrightarrow{m} is found using the formula for the dot product and magnitude:[|overrightarrow{AP}|cdot costheta = frac{overrightarrow{AP}cdot overrightarrow{m}}{|overrightarrow{m}|} = frac{(1)(1) + (-3)(-1) + (-1)(0)}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2}} = frac{4}{sqrt{2}} = 2sqrt{2}.]4. To find the distance d from P to l, we use the Pythagorean theorem in the context of vectors, where d is the length of the component of overrightarrow{AP} perpendicular to overrightarrow{m}:[d = sqrt{|overrightarrow{AP}|^{2} - (2sqrt{2})^{2}} = sqrt{(1)^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 - (2sqrt{2})^2} = sqrt{1 + 9 + 1 - 8} = sqrt{3}.]Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{B}."},{"problem":"Given sin alpha + cos alpha = frac{1}{3}, then sin 2alpha = (hspace{1cm})A: -frac{2}{3}B: frac{2}{3}C: frac{8}{9}D: -frac{8}{9}","solution":"Given sin alpha + cos alpha = frac{1}{3}, we start by squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root and simplify the expression.

(The values of tan A and tan C need not be integers.)[i] Proposed by Justin Stevens [/i]","solution":"1. Given that tan A, tan B, tan C form a geometric sequence, we can write:   [   tan B = sqrt{tan A cdot tan C}   ]   This follows from the property of geometric sequences where the middle term is the geometric mean of the other two terms.2. We know that in a triangle, the sum of the angles is pi. Therefore:   [   A + B + C = pi   ]3. Using the tangent addition formula for the sum of angles in a triangle, we have:   [   tan(A + B + C) = tan(pi) = 0   ]   Using the tangent addition formula:   [   tan(A + B + C) = frac{tan A + tan B + tan C - tan A tan B tan C}{1 - (tan A tan B + tan B tan C + tan C tan A)}   ]   Since tan(pi) = 0, the numerator must be zero:   [   tan A + tan B + tan C - tan A tan B tan C = 0   ]   Therefore:   [   tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C   ]4. Given that tan A, tan B, tan C form a geometric sequence, let tan A = a, tan B = b, and tan C = c. Then:   [   b = sqrt{ac}   ]   and:   [   a + b + c = abc   ]5. Substituting a = frac{b^2}{c} and c = frac{b^2}{a} into the equation a + b + c = abc, we get:   [   frac{b^2}{c} + b + c = b^3   ]   Let c = frac{b^2}{a}, then:   [   frac{b^2}{frac{b^2}{a}} + b + frac{b^2}{a} = b^3   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   a + b + frac{b^2}{a} = b^3   ]   Multiplying through by a:   [   a^2 + ab + b^2 = ab^3   ]6.

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that odot(alpha_1, alpha_2) neq odot(alpha_3) and odot(beta_1, beta_2) neq odot(beta_3). This implies that a and b must be even, as the sum of products of pairs of roots must be even.3. Reduction to smaller cases:   Since a and b are even, we can write alpha_i = 2q_i and beta_i = 2p_i for integers q_i and p_i.

Finding the derivative of f(x):   We have f(x) = x - 1 - aln x. The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is given by:   [   f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x - 1) - afrac{d}{dx}(ln x) = 1 - frac{a}{x} = frac{x - a}{x}   ]2. Determining the critical point:   The critical point occurs when f'(x) = 0. Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:   [   frac{x - a}{x} = 0 implies x = a   ]   Since a > 0, x = a is within the domain (0, +infty), indicating a potential extremum.3. Analyzing the function f(x) given it has exactly one zero:   Given that f(x) has exactly one zero in (0, +infty) and knowing that x = a is a critical point, we can deduce that f(a) = a - 1 - aln a = 0.4.

We find its derivative to determine its behavior:   [   g'(a) = 1 - 1 - ln a = -ln a   ]   This shows that g'(a)  1 and g'(a) > 0 for 0 < a < 1, indicating a maximum at a = 1 since g'(1) = 0 and the sign of g'(a) changes from positive to negative. Therefore, g(1) = 0 is the maximum value of g(a), leading us to conclude a = 1.5. Evaluating f(x) on [1, e^2]:   With a = 1, the function simplifies to f(x) = x - 1 - ln x. Its derivative on [1, e^2] is f'(x) = frac{x - 1}{x}, which is positive for all x in (1, e^2]. Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on this interval.6. Finding the maximum and minimum values of f(x):   Since f(x) is monotonically increasing on [1, e^2], its minimum value is at x = 1, giving f(1) = 0, and its maximum value is at x = e^2, giving f(e^2) = e^2 - 1 - 2 = e^2 - 3.7. Calculating the sum of the maximum and minimum values:   The sum of the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on [1, e^2] is 0 + (e^2 - 3) = e^2 - 3.Therefore, the sum of the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on [1, e^2] is boxed{e^2 - 3}."},{"problem":"The slope of the line x+sqrt{3}y-1=0 is ( ).A: frac{π}{3}B: frac{π}{6}C: frac{2π}{3}D: frac{5π}{6}","solution":"To find the slope of the line given by the equation x + sqrt{3}y - 1 = 0, we first rearrange the equation into the slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope.

Since ( PA_i ) makes an angle of ( 60^circ ) with the base, the height ( h ) of the pyramid from ( P ) to the base is given by:     [     h = PA_i sin(60^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} PA_i     ]   - The length of ( PA_i ) can be denoted as ( l ). Thus, ( h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} l ).4. Finding ( B_i ) on ( PA_i ):   - Let ( B_i ) be a point on ( PA_i ) such that ( PB_i = k cdot PA_i ) where ( 0 < k < 1 ).   - The projection of ( B_i ) onto the base plane will be at a distance ( k cdot PA_i cos(60^circ) = k cdot frac{1}{2} PA_i = frac{k}{2} l ) from ( A_i ).5. Summing the Distances:   - The total distance ( A_1B_2 + B_2B_3 + ldots + B_nA_1 ) can be approximated by the perimeter of the ( n )-gon formed by the projections of ( B_i ) onto the base plane.   - Each side of this ( n )-gon is approximately ( frac{k}{2} l ).6. Condition for the Sum of Distances:   - The perimeter of the ( n )-gon formed by the projections of ( B_i ) is ( n cdot frac{k}{2} l ).   - We need this to be less than ( 2A_1P = 2l ):     [     n cdot frac{k}{2} l < 2l     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     nk < 4     ]     Since ( 0 < k < 1 ), the maximum value of ( k ) is 1, thus:     [     n < 4     ]7.

Maximal Rectangle Centered at the Origin:   - Given a convex figure symmetric with respect to both axes, we need to find the maximal rectangle ( A ) inside it.   - Suppose ( A ) is not centered at the origin ( O ). The coordinate axes divide ( A ) into four smaller rectangles.   - If ( O ) is not the center, these four smaller rectangles are not all equal. Take the one with the largest area and consider a new rectangle ( R ) centered at ( O ) with this largest rectangle as one quarter of it.   - ( R ) will fit inside the convex figure, but its area will be greater than ( A ), which contradicts the assumption that ( A ) is the maximal rectangle.   - Therefore, ( O ) must be the center of ( A ).2. Symmetry and Convexity:   - Due to the symmetry of the figure with respect to the ( x )-axis and ( y )-axis, we can focus on the first quadrant.   - The part of the figure in the first quadrant is also convex.   - Let ( M = (a, b) ) be the point such that the rectangle with one vertex at ( O ) and the opposite vertex at ( (a, b) ) has maximal area ( k ).3.

Convexity and Tangent Line:   - Any point ( N = (x, y) ) of the convex figure must lie inside the triangle ( triangle OPQ ).   - If ( N ) lies outside ( triangle OPQ ), the line segment ( NM ) will intersect the hyperbola again, which contradicts the convexity of the figure.   - Therefore, the convex figure must be contained within the rectangle with vertices at ( (2a, 0) ), ( (0, 2b) ), ( (-2a, 0) ), and ( (0, -2b) ).5. Scaling Factor (lambda):   - The smallest (lambda) such that the scaled rectangle covers the convex figure is ( lambda = 2 ).   - For a rhombus centered at ( O ), (lambda = 2) is exactly the scaling factor needed to cover the figure.The final answer is ( boxed{ lambda = 2 } )."},{"problem":"Find the largest r such that 4 balls each of radius r can be packed into a regular tetrahedron with side length 1.

Calculate ( sqrt{1 + frac{BC}{BD}} ):   [   sqrt{1 + frac{BC}{BD}} = sqrt{1 + 2016 cdot 2018}   ]   Simplify inside the square root:   [   sqrt{1 + 2016 cdot 2018} = sqrt{1 + 2017^2 - 1} = sqrt{2017^2} = 2017   ]The final answer is (boxed{2017})."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, with the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C being a, b, and c respectively, and given that bcos C - ccos(A+C) = 3acos B, find cos B.","solution":"In the triangle ABC, from the equation bcos C - ccos(A+C) = 3acos B, we have:bcos C + ccos B = 3acos B. Using the Sine Rule, which states that frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C},we can substitute frac{b}{sin B} for frac{a}{sin A} and frac{c}{sin C} for frac{a}{sin A} to get:sin B cdot bcos C + sin C cdot ccos B = 3sin A cdot acos B. Dividing both sides by asin A, we obtain:frac{sin B cdot bcos C}{asin A} + frac{sin C cdot ccos B}{asin A} = 3cos B. By the Sine Rule applied previously, this simplifies to:sin Bcos C + sin Ccos B = 3cos B. Applying the Sum-to-Product identities, specifically the identity sin x cos y + cos x sin y = sin(x + y), we can rewrite the left-hand side as sin(B + C). Since in any triangle, the angles sum up to 180^circ or pi radians, B+C=180^circ-A or pi - A. Since sin(pi - A) = sin A, we have:sin A = 3cos B. Given that sin A neq 0 (since no angle in a triangle can be 0^circ or 180^circ), we can divide both sides by 3sin A to solve for cos B:cos B = frac{sin A}{3}.

Notice the following lemma:Lemma: (a_n = s_2(n)), where (s_2) is the sum of the digits of (n) written in binary.This lemma can be proved by induction on (n). For the base case, (a_1 = 1) and (s_2(1) = 1). For the inductive step, assume (a_n = s_2(n)) holds for some (n). Then:- (a_{2n} = a_n = s_2(n) = s_2(2n)) because multiplying by 2 in binary shifts all digits left by one place, adding a zero at the end.- (a_{2n+1} = a_n + 1 = s_2(n) + 1 = s_2(2n + 1)) because adding 1 in binary changes the last digit from 0 to 1.Thus, (a_n = s_2(n)) for all (n). Part (a)We need to find all positive integers (n) such that (a_{kn} = a_n) for all integers (1 leq k leq n).1. Express (a_n) in terms of binary digits:   Since (a_n = s_2(n)), we need (s_2(kn) = s_2(n)) for all (1 leq k leq n).2. Consider the binary representation:   If (n) is of the form (2^t - 1), then (n) in binary is a string of (t) ones (i.e., (111ldots1)). For example, (7 = 111_2), (15 = 1111_2), etc.3. Check the sum of digits:   For (n = 2^t - 1), (s_2(n) = t). We need to show that (s_2(kn) = t) for all (1 leq k leq n).4. Proof of necessity:   Suppose (n) has a zero in its binary representation. Let the rightmost such 0 be after (i) ones, so (n = overline{a0 underbrace{1 ldots 1}_{i text{ ones}}}) for some (a). Then, since (2^{m-1} + 1 leq n):   [   s_2(n) = s_2(n cdot (2^{m-1} + 1)) = s_2(overline{n underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{m-1 text{ zeros}}} + overline{underbrace{n}_{m text{ digits}}}) = s_2(overline{a1 underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{i text{ zeros}} underbrace{(n - lfloor log_2(n) rfloor)}_{m-1 text{ digits}}}) = s_2(a) + 1 + s_2(n) - 1 > s_2(n)   ]   This is a contradiction. So (n) cannot contain any zeros.5. Proof of sufficiency:   It suffices to show that (s_2((2^t - 1)k) = t) for all odd (1 leq k leq 2^t - 1). Even (k)s are then implied. Write (k = overline{c1}) and calculate:   [   s_2((2^t - 1)k) = s_2(overline{c1 underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{t text{ zeros}}} - k) = s_2(overline{c underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{t+1 text{ zeros}}} + overline{underbrace{1 ldots 1}_{t text{ ones}}} - overline{c1} + 1) = s_2(overline{c underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{t+1 text{ zeros}}} + overline{underbrace{2^t - 1 - k}_{t text{ digits, ending in a 0}}} + 1) = s_2(c) + t - s_2(k) + 1 = t   ]   So we are done. Part (b)We need to prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers (m) such that (a_{km} geq a_m) for all positive integers (k).1. Choose (m) as a power of 2:   Let (m = 2^t). Then (a_m = s_2(2^t) = 1).2. Check (a_{km}):   For any (k), (a_{km} = a_{k cdot 2^t} = s_2(k cdot 2^t)). Since multiplying by (2^t) shifts the binary digits of (k) left by (t) places, (s_2(k cdot 2^t) = s_2(k)).3. Compare (a_{km}) and (a_m):   Since (s_2(k) geq 1) for any positive integer (k), we have (a_{km} = s_2(k) geq 1 = a_m).Thus, there are infinitely many such (m) (specifically, all powers of 2).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 2^t - 1 } ) for part (a) and (m = 2^t) for part (b)."},{"problem":"In March 2014, to investigate the level of awareness among teachers about the second session of the 12th National People's Congress, Huanggang city planned to use stratified sampling to survey 60 teachers from three different middle schools, A, B, and C.

The sum of the numbers on all ten cards was 10 p+45. The sum of the numbers on the nine remaining cards after the loss was 10 p+45-(p+c), which simplifies to 9 p+45-c. We thus arrive at the equation, which we rearrange as follows:begin{aligned}9 p+45-c & =2012, 9 p & =1967+c .end{aligned}The sum on the right side of this equation must be divisible by nine. When dividing 1967: 9, we get a result of 218 with a remainder of 5. Therefore, 1967=9 cdot 218+5. From this decomposition, it is clear that the sum 1967+c is divisible by nine only if c=4.

Proposing a Candidate Function:   Let's propose ( f(x) = x^3 - 1 ) and verify if it satisfies the given conditions.   - For ( f(2) ):     [     f(2) = 2^3 - 1 = 7     ]     which matches the given condition.   - For the functional equation:     [     f(mn) = (mn)^3 - 1     ]     and     [     f(m) + f(n) + f(m)f(n) = (m^3 - 1) + (n^3 - 1) + (m^3 - 1)(n^3 - 1)     ]     Simplifying the right-hand side:     [     (m^3 - 1) + (n^3 - 1) + (m^3 - 1)(n^3 - 1) = m^3 + n^3 - 2 + (m^3 - 1)(n^3 - 1)     ]     [     = m^3 + n^3 - 2 + m^3 n^3 - m^3 - n^3 + 1     ]     [     = m^3 n^3 - 1     ]     which matches ( f(mn) = (mn)^3 - 1 ).3.

Then the functional equation becomes:   [   g(mn) = f(mn) + 1 = (f(m) + 1)(f(n) + 1) = g(m)g(n)   ]   This implies that ( g ) is a multiplicative function.4.

Thus, ( g(0) = 0 ).   - For ( g(1) ):     [     g(1) = g(1)^2 implies g(1) in {0, 1}     ]     If ( g(1) = 0 ), then ( g(n) = g(1)g(n) = 0 ) for all ( n ), which is absurd. Thus, ( g(1) = 1 ).5.

Find the smallest possible value of the sum,S = left | x_2 - x_1 right | + left | x_3 - x_2  right | + ................+ left |x_{100} - x_{99} right | + left |x_1 - x_{100} right | .","solution":"To find the smallest possible value of the sum ( S = left| x_2 - x_1 right| + left| x_3 - x_2 right| + cdots + left| x_{100} - x_{99} right| + left| x_1 - x_{100} right| ), we need to consider the arrangement of the integers ( {1, 2, ldots, 100} ).1. Understanding the Problem:   The sum ( S ) represents the total distance traveled if we start at ( x_1 ), move to ( x_2 ), then to ( x_3 ), and so on, until we return to ( x_1 ). The goal is to minimize this total distance.2. Distance Between Consecutive Points:   The distance between two points ( x_i ) and ( x_{i+1} ) is given by ( left| x_{i+1} - x_i right| ). To minimize the sum of these distances, we should arrange the points such that the distances are as small as possible.3. Optimal Arrangement:   The smallest possible distance between any two points on the number line is 1. Therefore, to minimize the sum ( S ), we should arrange the integers in consecutive order. 4. Calculating the Sum for Consecutive Order:   If we arrange the integers in consecutive order, i.e., ( x_i = i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 100 ), the sum ( S ) becomes:   [   S = left| 2 - 1 right| + left| 3 - 2 right| + cdots + left| 100 - 99 right| + left| 1 - 100 right|   ]5. Evaluating the Sum:   Each term ( left| x_{i+1} - x_i right| ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 99 ) is equal to 1. Therefore, the sum of the first 99 terms is:   [   sum_{i=1}^{99} left| x_{i+1} - x_i right| = 99 times 1 = 99   ]   The last term ( left| x_1 - x_{100} right| ) is:   [   left| 1 - 100 right| = 99   ]6. Total Sum:   Adding these together, we get:   [   S = 99 + 99 = 198   ]Therefore, the smallest possible value of the sum ( S ) is ( 198 ).The final answer is ( boxed{198} )."},{"problem":"Let p be a prime number, p ge 5, and k be a digit in the p-adic representation of positive integers. Find the maximal length of a non constant arithmetic progression whose terms do not contain the digit k in their p-adic representation.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the maximal length of a non-constant arithmetic progression whose terms do not contain a specific digit ( k ) in their ( p )-adic representation, where ( p ) is a prime number and ( p geq 5 ).2. Common Difference and Units Digit:   Let ( d ) be the common difference of the arithmetic progression. If ( p mid d ), the units' digit of the terms in the sequence never changes. This is because adding a multiple of ( p ) does not affect the units digit in base ( p ). Therefore, we can consider the sequence with common difference ( frac{d}{p} ) instead, which still maintains the property of not containing the digit ( k ).3. Assumption on ( d ):   We can assume ( gcd(d, p) = 1 ). This is because if ( d ) is not coprime with ( p ), we can reduce the problem to a smaller common difference as explained above.4. Invertibility of ( d ) modulo ( p ):   Since ( gcd(d, p) = 1 ), ( d ) is invertible modulo ( p ). Let ( c ) be the modular inverse of ( d ) modulo ( p ), i.e., ( cd equiv 1 mod p ).5. Form of the Sequence:   Consider the arithmetic progression ( dn + e ). We need to ensure that none of the terms in this sequence contain the digit ( k ) in their ( p )-adic representation.6. Modulo Condition:   For any term ( dn + e ) in the sequence, we have:   [   dn + e equiv k mod p   ]   This implies:   [   n equiv c(k - e) mod p   ]   where ( c ) is the inverse of ( d ) modulo ( p ).7. Range of ( n ):   Since ( n ) ranges over all integers, ( n equiv c(k - e) mod p ) will eventually cover all residues modulo ( p ). Therefore, one of the first ( p ) terms of the sequence ( dn + e ) will contain the digit ( k ).8. Maximal Length:   This shows that the length of the arithmetic progression without the digit ( k ) in their ( p )-adic representation is at most ( p - 1 ). This length is achieved by the sequence ( 1, 2, ldots, p - 1 ) itself, as none of these terms contain the digit ( k ) in their ( p )-adic representation.9. Special Cases for ( p = 2 ) and ( p = 3 ):   For ( p = 2 ) and ( p = 3 ), the problem is trivial because the ( p )-adic representation has very limited digits (0 and 1 for ( p = 2 ), and 0, 1, and 2 for ( p = 3 )). Therefore, the maximal length of the sequence without a specific digit ( k ) is very small and does not provide meaningful insight.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ p - 1 } )"},{"problem":"5.

Examine the inequality: Let ( angle B_1PC_1 = varphi ).

Understanding the Distribution: The distribution of X is given by P(X=i)=frac{i}{10} for i=1,2,3,4.

Calculating the Sum of Probabilities: We calculate the sum of probabilities for X=1, 2, and 3 because we know a must be greater than 3 for the sum to reach frac{3}{5}:   [   Pleft(1leqslant X lt aright) = Pleft(X=1right) + Pleft(X=2right) + Pleft(X=3right) = frac{1}{10} + frac{2}{10} + frac{3}{10} = frac{6}{10} = frac{3}{5}.   ]   4. Determining the Range of a: Since the sum of probabilities for X=1, 2, and 3 equals frac{3}{5}, and we know P(X=4)=frac{4}{10} would exceed this sum, a must be greater than 3 but not exceed 4.

The roots of this equation are numbers whose sum is 46 and whose product is 240, and it is easy to verify that these roots are 6 and 40. Therefore, z=6 or z=40. In a completely analogous manner, substituting y z=frac{240}{x} in x+y z=64 leads us to x=4 or x=60.Now, from x y z=240, it follows that y=frac{240}{x z}. Since y is an integer, then x z is a divisor of 240.

Therefore, the possible sums are all even numbers from -2012 times 1006 to 2012 times 1006.6. To find the possible remainders when divided by 2012, we need to consider the sums modulo 2012.

Simplify the product of distances:   - Notice that (|p - 1| cdot |p - omega| cdot |p - omega^2| = |(p - 1)(p - omega)(p - omega^2)|).   - Since (1, omega, omega^2) are the roots of the polynomial (z^3 - 1 = 0), we have:     [     (p - 1)(p - omega)(p - omega^2) = p^3 - 1.     ]   - Therefore, the condition becomes (|p^3 - 1| = 7).4.

Under this condition, these 4 numbers can be the roots of the equation. They are all roots of equation (1), since we only applied identical transformations to the difference of the two sides, except where a value appears that makes the denominator vanish. We get fewer than 4 different roots if the roots include equal values, and also if a c and b d have opposite signs, because in this case a c-b d x^{2} does not vanish in the real numbers. We need to examine under what values of a, b, c, d these cases can occur.For now, we assume that none of the parameters are 0. In the case a d+b c=0, (2) vanishes for any x for which it makes sense, and thus (1) degenerates into an identity. Indeed, from a d=-b c we get d / b=-c / a=k(neq 0), so d=b k, c=-a k, hence[frac{c x+d}{c+d x}=frac{-a k x+b k}{-a k+b k x}=frac{-k(a x-b)}{-k(a-b x)}=frac{a x-b}{a-b x}]and similarly[frac{c x-d}{c-d x}=frac{a x+b}{a+b x}]that is, the two fractions on the right side (in reverse order) are identical to one of the fractions on the left side. - If a d+b c=0 holds, then the products a d and b c have opposite signs, so the signs of the two factors are the same in one and opposite in the other, meaning that 3 of a, b, c, d are positive, or 3 are negative.We cannot accept as solutions the numbers pm a / b and pm c / d, because for these values, at least one of the fractions in (1) is undefined.The value x_{1}=1 is equal to one of the excluded values if a= pm b, or c= pm d, i.e., a pm b=0, or c pm d=0, or summarizing the four cases, if left(a^{2}-b^{2}right)left(c^{2}-d^{2}right)=0; in all such cases, and only in these cases, x_{2}=-1 is also an excluded value.Similarly, the equation[x_{3}=+sqrt{frac{a c}{b d}}=frac{a}{b}, text { or }-frac{a}{b} text {, or } frac{c}{d} text {, or }-frac{c}{d}]holds if a d=b c, and in this case x_{4} is also an excluded value, for example, from sqrt{a c / b d}=a / b by squaring and dividing, we get c / d=a / b, or b c=a d.x_{3,4} are different from x_{1,2} if a c / b d neq 1.In summary: if a, b, c, d are all non-zero, then the roots of (1) are:[x_{1,2}= pm 1, quad text { if } quad a d+b c neq 0 quad text { and } quadleft(a^{2}-b^{2}right)left(c^{2}-d^{2}right) neq 0, quad text { and }]x_{3,4}= pm sqrt{a c / b d}, if the ratio a c / b d is a positive number different from 1 and a d neq b c.Our results are also valid if we allow the parameters to be 0. In this case, only one of them can be 0, because if at least two of them are 0, then (1) is meaningless - if, for example, a=b=0, or c=d=0 - or (2) implies that (1) degenerates into an identity - if, for example, a=c=0, or b=d=0, or a=d=0, or b=c=0, because in this case a d+b c=0. - If, for example, a=0 and b c d neq 0, this does not affect x_{1,2}; however, x_{3,4}=0, but this is not a root because then a / b=0 is an excluded value; the case c=0, a b d neq 0 is essentially the same.

Since four of these must be concyclic, one of ( A, B, C ) must not belong to this group. Assume WLOG that the group is ( X, Y, A, B ).5. Analyze the groups to find contradictions:   - Look at the group ( X, Y, A, C, D ). The four concyclic points must include ( X ) and ( Y ), so it cannot include ( A ). Thus, the group is ( X, Y, C, D ).   - Now consider the group ( X, Y, A, C, E ). The four concyclic points must include ( X ) and ( Y ), but cannot include ( A ) or ( C ), leading to a contradiction.6. Show that no ( n geq 7 ) works:   - To prove this, it suffices to show it for ( n = 7 ).   - Let ( A, B, C, D ) be four concyclic points. Let ( X, Y, Z ) be the other three points.   - Consider circles through the quadruples ( (X, Y, A, B) ), ( (X, Y, C, D) ), ( (X, Z, A, C) ), and ( (X, Z, B, D) ).7. Perform an inversion with pole ( X ):   - For a general point ( P ), denote its image by ( P' ).   - Points ( A', B', C', D' ) are still concyclic, and ( Y' = A'B' cap C'D' ), ( Z' = A'C' cap B'D' ).   - The six points ( A', B', C', D', Y', Z' ) must still satisfy the hypothesis, but no four of ( Y', Z', A', C', D' ) are concyclic, leading to a contradiction.Thus, the minimum number of points that must lie on a circle is ( 9 ).The final answer is ( boxed{9} )."},{"problem":"3.

Mark 2013 red and 2013 blue points on some circle alternately, and mark one more blue point somewhere in the plane. The circle is thus split into 4026 arcs, each arc having endpoints of different colors. Thus, if the goal is reached, then each arc should intersect some of the drawn lines. Since any line contains at most two points of the circle, one needs at least 4026/2 =2013 lines. It remains to prove that one can reach the goal using 2013 lines. First of all, let us mention that for every two points A and B having the same color, one can draw two lines separating these points from all other ones. Namely, it suffices to take two lines parallel to A B and lying on different sides of A B sufficiently close to it: the only two points between these lines will be A and B.

After the preliminary round, Xiaoming and five other students entered the final. Through practical operation and on-site defense, the judges evaluated the performance of these six students and gave each student a score. Xiaoming wanted to know his score in advance. The teacher told him two pieces of information: ① the scores (in points) of the other five students are 83, 86, 88, 91, 93; ② your score is both the mode and the median among these six scores.

The median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers, and the mode is the number that appears most frequently.

Finding the original median: With five numbers, the median is the third number when sorted, which is 88. 2. Adding Xiaoming's score and finding the new median and mode: Since Xiaoming's score is both the mode and the median among the six scores, his score must be added to the list such that it becomes both the most frequent and the middle value. 3. Calculating the new median with Xiaoming's score: If Xiaoming's score is 88, the sorted list becomes 83, 86, 88, 88, 91, 93. With six numbers, the median is the average of the third and fourth numbers, which is frac{88 + 88}{2} = 88. 4. Checking the mode: With Xiaoming's score being 88, it appears twice, making it the most frequent number in the list, hence the mode.Since Xiaoming's score being 88 makes it both the median and the mode of the new list, it satisfies the teacher's conditions.Therefore, Xiaoming's score is boxed{88 text{ points}}, which corresponds to choice boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Given the sequence {a_n} with its partial sum S_n satisfying the equation {S_n} = 3{a_n} + {( - 1)^n} for all natural numbers n.(I) Find the first three terms of the sequence, a_1, a_2, and a_3.(II) Prove that the sequence {{a_n} + frac{2}{5}{( - 1)^n}} is a geometric sequence, and derive the general formula for {a_n}.","solution":"(I) For n=1, we have S_1 = a_1 = 3a_1 - 1, which implies a_1 = frac{1}{2}.For n=2, we have S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = 3a_2 + 1, which implies a_2 = -frac{1}{4}.For n=3, we have S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 3a_3 - 1, which implies a_3 = frac{5}{8}.(II) For n geq 2, we have a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = 3a_n + {( - 1)^n} - (3a_{n-1} + {( - 1)^{n-1}}), which gives a_n = frac{3}{2}a_{n-1} - {( - 1)^n}.Now, let's consider {a_n} + frac{2}{5}{( - 1)^n} = frac{3}{2}({a_{n - 1}} + frac{2}{5}{( - 1)^{n - 1}}).

Solution Put u = x 2 y+y 2 z+z 2 x, v = xy 2 +yz 2 +zx 2 , and w = xyz. We have 0 = (x+y+z) 2 = x 2 +y 2 +z 2 +2(xy+yz+zx), so xy+yz+zx = -3.

We have x 3 +y 3 +z 3 = (x+y+z)(x 2 +y 2 +z 2 -xy-yz-zx) + 3xyz = 3w. Hence also x 3 y 3 +y 3 z 3 +z 3 x 3 = (xy+yz+zx)(x 2 y 2 +y 2 z 2 +z 2 x 2 -xy 2 z-xyz 2 -x 2 yz) + 3x 2 y 2 z 2 = (xy+yz+zx)(x 2 y 2 +y 2 z 2 +z 2 x 2 ) + 3w 2 = -3·9 + 3w 2 = -27 + 3w 2 . Also (x+y+z)(xy+yz+zx) = u+v+3w, so u+v = -3w. Multiplying out, we find uv = (x 3 y 3 +y 3 z 3 +z 3 x 3 ) + 3x 2 y 2 z 2 + xyz(x 3 +y 3 +z 3 ) = -27 + 3w 2 + 3w 2 + 3w 2 = 9w 2 - 27. Hence u is a root of the quadratic u 2 + 3wu + (9w 2 -27) = 0. Completing the square in w (not u) we get (3w + u/2) 2 + 3u 2 /4 - 27 = 0, so 3u 2 /4 - 27 ≤ 0 and hence u ≤ 6. For equality we need w = -1. Remembering that x+y+z = 0, xy+yz+zx = -3, x, y, z are the roots of k 3 - 3k + 1 = 0. If we put k = 2 cos θ, then 8 cos 3 θ - 6 cos θ + 1 = 0. But cos 3θ = 4 cos 3 θ - 3 cos θ, so cos 3θ = -1/2. Hence 3θ = 2π/3, 4π/3 or 8π/3, so x, y, z = 2 cos 2π/9, 2 cos 4π/9, 2 cos 8π/9. Comment. This is all fairly unmotivated.

The eccentricity e is given as frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, which allows us to find the distance from the center to either focus, c, using the formula e = frac{c}{a}. Therefore, we have:[e = frac{c}{a} Rightarrow frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{c}{2} Rightarrow c = sqrt{3}]To find b^2, we use the relationship between a^2, b^2, and c^2 in an ellipse, which is a^2 - c^2 = b^2. Substituting the known values:[b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 2^2 - (sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1]Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is:[frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1]boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1}textbf{Ⅱ: (i)} Finding the coordinates of point Q:Assuming the existence of point Q(m,0) such that OP perp EQ, we first find the equation of line l that passes through A and has slope k.

Solving for x_1 in terms of k:[-2 + x_1 = frac{-16k^2}{4k^2+1}]The x-coordinate of P, the midpoint of AD, is:[x_P = frac{-2 + x_1}{2} = frac{-8k^2}{4k^2+1}]Thus, the coordinates of P are:[Pleft(frac{-8k^2}{4k^2+1}, frac{2k}{4k^2+1}right)]Given E(0,2k), the slope of EQ is k_{EQ} = frac{2k}{-m}, and the slope of OP is k_{OP} = frac{-1}{4k}.

Upper Bound on delta(k):   Notice that for any positive integer k, delta(k) le 9. This is because the maximum possible difference between the sums of two groups of digits is 9. If the difference were more than 9, we could always move one digit from one group to the other to reduce the difference.2. Numbers with All Digits:   Out of the 10^N numbers from 1 to 10^N, at most 9 cdot 9^N of them do not have all the digits from 0 to 9. For these numbers, we use the bound delta(k) le 9.3. Defect for Numbers with All Digits:   For any number k that has all the digits from 0 to 9, we prove that delta(k) le 1 by contradiction. Assume delta(k) ge 2. Let X cup Y be an optimal partition with sum X - sum Y = delta(k) ge 2.   - If 1 in X, we can move 1 to Y instead of X, thus decreasing the defect by 1. Since the defect was at least 2, this strictly decreases the defect, which is a contradiction.   - Therefore, 1 in Y. Similarly, if 2 in X, we can interchange 1 and 2 between X and Y, decreasing the defect by 1, which is again a contradiction.   - Continuing this process, we find that 1, 2, ldots, 9 must all be in Y, which implies sum X = 0 and sum Y > 0, making delta(k) = sum X - sum Y impossible.   Thus, we have proven that delta(k) le 1 for numbers with all digits.4. Parity Consideration:   If the sum of the digits of k is odd, then delta(k) = 1 because the sum cannot be evenly split. If the sum is even, then delta(k) = 0. Since half of the numbers have an odd sum of digits and half have an even sum, we have:   [   frac{sum_{k = 1}^{10^N}delta(k)}{10^N} le left( frac{1}{10^N} right) cdot left( 9 cdot 9^N + 0 cdot frac{10^N - 9^N}{2} + 1 cdot frac{10^N - 9^N}{2} right).   ]5.

Introduce an auxiliary unknown: widehat{A C B}=y. Then widehat{B A C}=2 y.By the Law of Sines, we have:frac{x}{sin y}=frac{x+2}{sin 2 y}=frac{5}{sin left(180^{circ}-3 yright)}orleft{begin{array}{l}frac{x}{sin y}=frac{x+2}{sin 2 y} frac{x}{sin y}=frac{5}{sin 3 y}end{array}right.This system is easier to solve if we eliminate x from it. From equation (12.1) x=frac{2}{2 cos y-1}, and from the equation x=frac{5 sin y}{sin 3 y}. Thus,frac{2}{2 cos y-1}=frac{5 sin y}{sin 3 y},from which2 sin 3 y=10 cos y sin y-5 sin yor4 sin frac{3 y}{2} cos frac{3 y}{2}=10 sin frac{y}{2} cos frac{3 y}{2}Obviously, cos frac{3 y}{2} neq 0. Otherwise, frac{3 y}{2}=90^{circ}, i.e., 3 y=180^{circ}, and thus widehat{A B C}=0^{circ}, which contradicts the condition. Dividing both sides of equation (12.4) by g(y)=cos frac{3 y}{2}.Note that when multiplying both sides of equation (12.3) by varphi(y)=(2 cos y-1) sin 3 y, we did not prove that the values of y for which varphi(y)=0 do not satisfy the condition of the problem. The reason is that the specified transformation of equation (12.3) can only introduce extraneous solutions, which are filtered out during subsequent verification according to the meaning of the problem. However, dividing both sides of equation (12.4) by g(y)=cos frac{3 y}{2} poses a risk of losing solutions. By proving that g(y) neq 0, we have shown that no solutions are lost during this transformation.Thus, we obtain the equation5 sin frac{y}{2}=2 sin frac{3 y}{2}orsin frac{y}{2}-8 sin ^{3} frac{y}{2}=0Since sin frac{y}{2} neq 0 (otherwise y=360^{circ}, which contradicts the condition), then 1-8 sin ^{2} frac{y}{2}=0; hence sin ^{2} frac{y}{2}=frac{1}{8}. Since x=frac{2}{2 cos y-1}, it is sufficient to find the value of cos y. But 1-cos y=2 sin ^{2} frac{y}{2}, so cos y=frac{3}{4}, and then x=4.Since the value x=4 satisfies the condition of the problem (verify this independently), we obtain:|A B|=4 mathrm{~cm},|B C|=6 mathrm{~cm}A successful choice of an auxiliary unknown plays a crucial role in solving problems by the method of forming equations.

Since ( x = frac{2020^{2021}}{2021} ), we can approximate ( x ) by considering the binomial expansion:   [   2020^{2021} = (2021 - 1)^{2021}   ]   Using the binomial theorem, we have:   [   (2021 - 1)^{2021} = sum_{k=0}^{2021} binom{2021}{k} cdot 2021^{2021-k} cdot (-1)^k   ]   The dominant term here is ( 2021^{2021} ), and the next significant term is ( -2021^{2020} ).

The last digit of A cannot be 0 either, because then a tenth of B would also be a valid number. From the second form of B, it is clear that for this reason, the second last digit of A cannot be 0 either, because then performing the subtraction 1000 A-A digit by digit in the usual way, we would get a 9 as the second last digit of B, regardless of the other digits of A. However, this means that the digit in the hundreds place of A cannot be 0 either, because then the digit in the hundreds place of B would be 9. If, therefore, we choose every digit of A to be as small as possible, we get the number 112, and with it B=111888 does not contain a 9, so this is the number we are looking for.Remark.

Now, we consider the locus of all points Q for which [O P Q]=1 / 2. It consists of two parallel lines passing with slope O P, as shown.Since operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1, see that only two lattice points on this locus actually lie inside the quarter-circle centered at O with radius O P.

Notice that this is perpendicular to EF by symmetry. Next, find the slope of EB, which is frac{15}{25}=frac{3}{5}. Then, the slope of EF is -frac{5}{3}. Line EF can be written as y=-frac{5}{3}x+b. Plug in the point (8,0), and we get the equation of EF to be y=_frac{5}{3}x+frac{40}{3}. Since the length of AB=25, a point on line EF lies on DC when x=25-3=22.

Solution. Let us denote the vertices of the given convex n-gon (in positive order) by the numbers 1, 2, ldots, n. Each set of four vertices that meets the requirement corresponds to a set of four numbers whereA) there are no adjacent (with a difference of 1) pairs of numbers,B) the numbers 1 and n do not appear together.(Indeed, the appearance of adjacent numbers, or the simultaneous appearance of 1 and n, would mean that one of the sides of the chosen quadrilateral is also a side of the polygon.) Conversely, every such set of four numbers corresponds to a set of four vertices that meet the original requirement. Therefore, the number of such vertex quadrilaterals is given by the number of sets of four numbers that have properties A and B. This latter number can be determined by subtracting the number of sets of four numbers that have property A but not property B from the number of sets of four numbers that have property A.The number N(A) is essentially the same problem as the 2nd problem of the 1970 Kürschák competition, 1 with the number of lottery numbers 90 replaced by n, and the number of lottery numbers drawn at once 5 replaced by 4. We apply the reasoning of the first solution given in the cited place with these changes.Let us denote the numbers of a properly chosen set of four numbers in increasing order by a, b, c, and d, so the validity of the set is equivalent to the inequality chain1 leqq a < a+1 < b < b+1 < c < c+1 < d leqq nThus, with the notationb' = b-1, quad c' = c-2, quad d' = d-3the inequality chain1 leqq a < b' < c' < d' leqq n-3also holds. Conversely, if the numbers a, b', c', d' satisfy (3), then the numbers a, b, c, d derived from them according to (2) satisfy (1). Therefore, N(A) is equal to the number of sets of four numbers that satisfy (3), or the number of sets of four different numbers (arranged in monotonically increasing order) that can be chosen from the first (n-3) natural numbers:N(A) = binom{n-3}{4}If a set of four numbers has property A but not property B, then the set contains the numbers 1 and n, and for the other two elements3 leqq b < b+1 leqq n-2holds, where b and c denote these elements. The number of pairs of numbers that satisfy (4) can be determined similarly to the above, yieldingN(A bar{B}) = binom{n-5}{2}Thus, the number of sets of four numbers that have properties A and B isbegin{gathered}N(AB) = N(A) - N(A bar{B}) = binom{n-3}{4} - binom{n-5}{2} = = frac{(n-3)(n-4)(n-5)(n-6)}{4!} - frac{(n-5)(n-6)}{2!} = = frac{(n-5)(n-6)}{4!} left(n^2 - 7n + 12 - 12right) = frac{n}{4} binom{n-5}{3}end{gathered}Remarks. 1. Our result is valid in terms of content (both geometrically and in terms of the computational reasoning) only for the cases n geqq 8. For n=8, N=2, one solution is the selection of the vertices with odd numbers, the other is the selection of the vertices with even numbers. However, the formula gives the correct result even for n=5.2. We can reach the goal somewhat faster based on the following idea. Let the vertices of the quadrilateral determined by the selected set of four vertices be denoted by P, Q, R, and S (in positive order). First, choose the vertex P from the vertices of the n-gon (we have n ways to do this), then number the vertices of the polygon starting from P in positive order. It can be easily shown by the above reasoning that we have binom{n-5}{3} ways to choose the remaining three vertices, thus we get n binom{n-5}{3} quadrilaterals. However, in this way, each quadrilateral is counted 4 times - we can label its vertices in 4 ways in positive order with the letters P, Q, R, S - so the number of different quadrilaterals is frac{n}{4} binom{n-5}{3}.II. Solution. The vertices of the n-gon determine binom{n}{4} convex quadrilaterals, among which there are also those that have 3, 2, or 1 side in common with the n-gon. (All 4 sides could only be n-gon sides if n=4, but we ignore this and focus on the cases n geqq 8.) We determine the number of these cases of coincidence and form the desired number N by subtraction.a) A quadrilateral has 3 sides in common with the n-gon if we select 4 consecutive vertices. This means we only choose the first one - which we can do in n ways - and the other 3 follow.b) If 2 sides are in common, these can be 2 adjacent - or 3 consecutive - sides of the n-gon, or 2 more distant sides. In the first case, the 3 consecutive vertices can be chosen in n ways, but the fourth vertex of the quadrilateral cannot be adjacent to these, so it can be chosen from (n-5) vertices of the n-gon; the number of such possibilities is therefore n(n-5). In the second case, we will have two pairs of adjacent vertices on the n-gon. The first pair's first vertex can again be chosen in n ways, and the second pair's first vertex in (n-5) ways (if, for example, the first pair is A_{n-1}, A_{n}, then the first vertex of the second pair can be A_{2}, A_{3}, ldots, A_{n-4}). In the thus thought n(n-5) connections, however, each desired selection is obtained twice, so the number of such quadrilaterals is n(n-5) / 2.c) Finally, if a quadrilateral has 1 side in common with the n-gon, then after selecting this, the remaining 2 vertices of the quadrilateral can be chosen from the remaining (n-4) vertices in binom{n-4}{2} ways, but in n-5 cases these are adjacent to each other, so the number of quadrilaterals belonging to this is:n left{ binom{n-4}{2} - (n-5) right} = n binom{n-4}{2} - n(n-5)According to all this,N = left( frac{n}{4} right) - left{ n + left( 1 + frac{1}{2} - 1 right) n(n-5) - n binom{n-4}{2} right}which, after appropriate rearrangement, agrees with the result of the first solution.[^0]:    { }^{1} What is the probability that among the five numbers drawn in a lottery, there are at least two adjacent numbers (with a difference of 1)? - See the solution in: László Lovász: Solution to the problems of the 1970 József Kürschák Mathematical Student Competition.

Since convex functions are continuous, there exists an open neighbourhood U of y such that for all z in U, g(z)>f_{i}(z) for all z in U. For each z in U, there must exist j with f_{j}(z)=g(z). Since the set of possible j is finite and U is infinite, there exists j such that f_{j}(z)=g(z) for at least three z in U. But therefore j in T which implies g(z)>f_{j}(z), a contradiction. This completes the proof of (1).Since T is nonempty, there are at most 2^{n}-1 possible subsets T of {1,2, ldots, n}. This upper bound can be achieved, for example we can take the graphs of f_{1}, ldots, f_{n} to be n distinct tangents of the graph y=x^{2}. In this case every subset T gives a distinct function because for every i, there exists some x such that f_{i}(x)=max _{j} f_{j}(x).For the lower bound, since no two lines are parallel, all functions f_{i} with 1 leq i leq n and max left(f_{i}, f_{j}right) with 1 leq i<j leq n are pairwise distinct elements of S. So there are at least n+frac{n(n-1)}{2}=frac{n(n+1)}{2} such functions. To achieve this lower bound, we can take n distinct tangents of the graph y=-x^{2}.

Let's describe .. around the acute-angled triangle ABD cdot circle K; let O be the center of this circle (Fig. 34). We will show that if the radius R of circle K is greater than 1, then point O will not be covered by any of the four circles with centers at A, B, C, D and radius 1. Indeed, AO = BO = DO = R > 1, so the circles with centers at A, B, and D will not cover point O. But the circle with center C and radius 1 will also not cover it, because CO > R > 1: indeed, if point C were located inside (or on the boundary) of circle K, then (acute!) angle BCD = alpha would be no less than half the arc BAD, which is greater than 180^circ because angle BDR is centered at point A. Similarly, it can be established that each of the triangles APO, BMO, BNO, DNO, and DPO is entirely covered by a circle of radius 1 with a center at one of the points A, B, or D. Thus, three circles of radius 1 with centers at A, B, and D cover the entire triangle ABD, from which, due to the central symmetry of the parallelogram, it follows that three circles of radius 1 with centers at C, D, and B will completely cover the triangle BCD. Therefore, for four circles of radius 1 with centers at the vertices of the parallelogram to completely cover the parallelogram, it is necessary and sufficient that the radius R of circle K be no more than 1.Now, by the Law of Sines applied to triangle ABD,2R = frac{BD}{sin angle BAD} = frac{BD}{sin alpha}But by the Law of Cosines, BD = sqrt{1 + a^2 - 2a cos alpha}, and thus,R = frac{sqrt{1 + a^2 - 2a cos alpha}}{2 sin alpha}Thus, the condition that our four circles cover the parallelogram can be written as:frac{sqrt{1 + a^2 - 2a cos alpha}}{2 sin alpha} leq 1ora^2 - 2a cos alpha + 1 - 4 sin^2 alpha leq 0Since the equality a^2 - 2a cos alpha + 1 - 4 sin^2 alpha = 0 holds whena = cos alpha pm sqrt{cos^2 alpha - 1 + 4 sin^2 alpha} = cos alpha pm sqrt{3} sin alphathe solution to the last inequality iscos alpha - sqrt{3} sin alpha leq a leq cos alpha + sqrt{3} sin alphaBut since 1 cdot cos alpha is the projection of side AB = 1 of triangle ABD onto side AD = a and triangle ABD is acute-angled, then cos alpha < a and thus cos alpha - sqrt{3} sin alpha leq a.Thus, four unit circles with centers at the vertices of parallelogram ABCD will cover the parallelogram if and only if a leq cos alpha + sqrt{3} sin alpha."},{"problem":"Which of the following statements is correct?A: If 4x^{2}-mx+25 can be factored using the complete square formula, then the value of m must be equal to 20.B: If the algebraic expression frac{{sqrt{x+1}}}{x} is meaningful within the real number range, then the range of values for x is xgeqslant -1.C: If an isosceles triangle has an angle of 80^{circ}, then the other two interior angles must both be 50^{circ}.D: If the system of inequalities about x is left{{begin{array}{l}{x≥3}{x＜a}end{array}}right. has no solution, then the maximum value of a is 3.","solution":"To analyze each option step-by-step:Option A: For 4x^{2}-mx+25 to be factored using the complete square formula, we need to express it in the form (2x)^{2}-2(2x)left(frac{m}{4}right)+left(frac{m}{4}right)^{2}-left(frac{m}{4}right)^{2}+25.

We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that there are exactly ( a ) large numbers and ( b ) small numbers among ( 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ).2. Construction: We propose ( m = b ) and ( n = ab + 1 ). We need to show that this construction satisfies the conditions of the problem.3. Define peaks and valleys: Let ( a(m, n) ) denote the number of peaks (large numbers) in ( R(mt, n) ) as ( t ) goes from ( 1 ) to ( n-1 ). Similarly, let ( b(m, n) ) denote the number of valleys (small numbers) in ( R(mt, n) ).4. Symmetry in peaks and valleys: Observe that ( R(mt, n) + R(-mt, n) = n ). This implies that if ( t ) is a peak in the sequence ( R(mt, n) ), it must be a valley in the sequence ( R(-mt, n) ), and vice versa.5. Claim: Suppose ( 0 < m < frac{n}{2} ). We have ( a(-m, n) = a(-m, n-m) ) and ( a(m, n) = a(m, n-m) + 1 ).6. Proof of the claim:    - To prove ( a(m, n) = a(m, n-m) + 1 ), note that ( t = 1, ldots, leftlfloor frac{n}{m} rightrfloor ) are all peaks. Let ( S_t = { x mid x equiv t pmod{m} } ). As we traverse the sequence ( R(mt, n) ) from ( 1 ) to ( n-1 ), we go through ( S_0, S_{-n}, S_{-2n}, ldots ) in ascending order. There is at most one peak in each ( S_{-n}, S_{-2n}, ldots ), and these peaks do not depend on ( n ) as long as ( n pmod{m} ) is fixed.    - The proof for ( a(-m, n) = a(-m, n-m) ) is analogous. We go through each ( S_j ) in descending order, and each ( |S_j| ge 2 ), so we can remove one element from each.7. Induction on ( a + b ): We proceed by strong induction on ( a + b ) to prove that the answer for ( a, b ) is ( ab + 1 ). The base case, ( (1, 1) ), is trivial.8. Symmetry in ( a ) and ( b ): Note that ( f(b, a) = f(a, b) ) because if ( a(m, n) = a ) and ( b(m, n) = b ), then it must follow that ( a(-m, n) = b ) and ( b(-m, n) = a ).9. Inductive step: Suppose ( m ) satisfies ( a(m, f(a, b)) = a ) and ( b(m, f(a, b)) = b ). If ( m < frac{f(a, b)}{2} ), we replace ( m ) with ( -m ) and focus on ( f(b, a) = f(a, b) ). In this case, ( m ge b ) because the number of valleys is at most ( m ). Therefore, ( f(a, b) - m ) satisfies ( a(m, f(a, b) - m) = a - 1 ) and ( b(m, f(a, b) - m) = b ). Thus, ( f(a, b) ge m + f(a-1, b) ge b + (a-1)b + 1 = ab + 1 ), completing the induction.The final answer is ( boxed{ ab + 1 } )."},{"problem":"3.

Numerator Analysis:   The numerator is given by:   [   sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{2n}{2k} 3^k   ]   Using the Binomial Theorem, we can express this sum as:   [   sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{2n}{2k} 3^k = frac{(1+sqrt{3})^{2n} + (1-sqrt{3})^{2n}}{2}   ]   This is because the even terms in the binomial expansion of ((1+sqrt{3})^{2n}) and ((1-sqrt{3})^{2n}) contribute to the sum.2. Denominator Analysis:   The denominator is given by:   [   sum_{k=0}^{n-1} binom{2n}{2k+1} 3^k   ]   Similarly, using the Binomial Theorem, we can express this sum as:   [   sum_{k=0}^{n-1} binom{2n}{2k+1} 3^k = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} cdot frac{(1+sqrt{3})^{2n} - (1-sqrt{3})^{2n}}{2}   ]   This is because the odd terms in the binomial expansion of ((1+sqrt{3})^{2n}) and ((1-sqrt{3})^{2n}) contribute to the sum.3.

Analyzing the Dominant Term:   As ( n ) tends to infinity, ((1+sqrt{3})^{2n}) grows exponentially while ((1-sqrt{3})^{2n}) tends to zero because (|1-sqrt{3}| < 1). Therefore, the dominant term in both the numerator and the denominator is ((1+sqrt{3})^{2n}).6.

Calculate the area and inradius of triangle (ABC):   - The area of (ABC) is:     [     [ABC] = frac{1}{2} times AB times BC = frac{1}{2} times 5 times 12 = 30     ]   - The semi-perimeter (s) of (ABC) is:     [     s = frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} = frac{5 + 12 + 13}{2} = 15     ]   - The inradius (r) is given by:     [     [ABC] = s cdot r implies 30 = 15 cdot r implies r = 2     ]3. Determine the locus of points within the triangle:   - We need to find the probability that a circle with radius (frac{1}{3}) centered at (P) does not intersect the perimeter of (ABC).   - This is equivalent to finding the area of a smaller triangle (A'B'C') inside (ABC) such that each side of (A'B'C') is (frac{1}{3}) units away from the corresponding side of (ABC).4. Calculate the inradius of the smaller triangle (A'B'C'):   - The distance from each side of (A'B'C') to the corresponding side of (ABC) is (frac{1}{3}).   - The inradius (r') of (A'B'C') is:     [     r' = r - frac{1}{3} = 2 - frac{1}{3} = frac{6}{3} - frac{1}{3} = frac{5}{3}     ]5. Determine the area ratio of the two triangles:   - The area of (A'B'C') is proportional to the square of the ratio of their inradii:     [     frac{[A'B'C']}{[ABC]} = left(frac{r'}{r}right)^2 = left(frac{frac{5}{3}}{2}right)^2 = left(frac{5}{6}right)^2 = frac{25}{36}     ]6.

Sum the numerator and denominator:   - The fraction (frac{25}{36}) is in simplest form, so (m = 25) and (n = 36).   - Therefore, (m + n = 25 + 36 = 61).The final answer is (boxed{61})."},{"problem":"6.

Given Conditions and Initial Setup:   - Let ( p > 13 ) be a prime of the form ( p = 2q + 1 ), where ( q ) is also a prime.   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs of integers ((m, n)) such that ( 0 leq m < n < p-1 ) and     [     3^m + (-12)^m equiv 3^n + (-12)^n pmod{p}.     ]2. Primitive Root Analysis:   - We claim that exactly one of ( 3 ) and ( -12 ) is a primitive root modulo ( p ).   - The order of any residue ( x ) modulo ( p ) must divide ( p-1 = 2q ), so it must be one of ( 1, 2, q, 2q ).   - If the order is ( 1 ) or ( 2 ), then the residue is ( pm 1 ), which is not the case here.   - Thus, the order of ( x ) is either ( q ) or ( 2q ).3. Legendre Symbol and Primitive Root:   - Using the Legendre symbol, we have:     [     left( frac{x}{p} right) equiv x^{frac{p-1}{2}} pmod{p}.     ]   - A residue ( x neq pm 1 ) is a primitive root if and only if ( left( frac{x}{p} right) = -1 ).   - Since ( p equiv 3 pmod{4} ), we have:     [     left( frac{3}{p} right) left( frac{-12}{p} right) = left( frac{-36}{p} right) = left( frac{-1}{p} right) = -1.     ]   - Therefore, one of the Legendre symbols is ( -1 ) and the other is ( 1 ).4. Identifying the Primitive Root:   - Let ( g in {3, -12} ) be the primitive root, and let ( h ) be the other one.   - Since ( h ) is a square, we must have ( h = g^{2k} ) for some integer ( 1 leq k < q ) and ( 2k - 1 neq q ) (since ( h notequiv -g pmod{p} )).5.

Thus, option B is correct.Step 2: Calculating the Maximum and Minimum Values- For 0 leq x leq 2, we have f(x) = x^{2} - x.- For -2 leq x leq 0, since f(x) is even, we get f(x) = f(-x) = (-x)^{2} - (-x) = x^{2} + x.- The graph of f(x) = x^{2} - x for 0 leq x leq 2 has its vertex at x=frac{1}{2}, leading to:  - f(x)_{max} = f(2) = 2^{2} - 2 = 2  - f(x)_{min} = f(frac{1}{2}) = (frac{1}{2})^{2} - frac{1}{2} = -frac{1}{4}- Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) is -frac{1}{4} and the maximum value is 2, making option A correct.Step 3: Evaluating f(2023)- Using the periodicity and symmetry, f(2023) = f(2024-1) = f(-1) = f(1) = 1^{2} - 1 = 0.

Then the maximum number of edges in G is 16.","solution":"Proof: Let f(n) be the maximum number of edges in an n-order simple graph without C_{4}. Clearly, f(n)=4. Now we prove that f(5)=6. First, if G is two triangles sharing exactly one common vertex, then G is a 5-order graph with 6 edges and no C_{4}. Second, if a 5-order graph G has 7 edges, then there must be a vertex with a degree no greater than 2. Removing this vertex and the edges associated with it, we get a 4-order graph G^{prime}. G^{prime} still has at least 5 edges, which must contain a quadrilateral. Now, we will prove that f(10)=16.Let G be a 10-order graph without C_{4}, and let A be the vertex with the highest degree in G. Let S={x mid x is adjacent to A}, T={x mid x is not adjacent to A}, and assume |S|=k, then |T|=9-k, where 1 leqslant k leqslant 9. For any point x in S cup T, it can be adjacent to at most one point in S, otherwise, adding A would form a C_{4}. Thus, S can have at most left[frac{k}{2}right] edges. Also, S and T can have at most 9-k edges between them, and T can have at most f(9-k) edges. Therefore,begin{array}{l}f(10) leqslant k+left[frac{k}{2}right]+(9-k)+f(9-k) . text { Let } g(k)=9+left[frac{k}{2}right]+f(9-k) . text { Then } f(10) leqslant g(k) .end{array}The relevant data is calculated as follows:begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}hlinek & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 hlinef(9-k) & 6 & 4 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 0 hlineg(k) & 17 & 15 & 15 & 13 & 13 & 13 hlineend{tabular}From the table, we can see that when k geqslant 5, g(k) leqslant 15, so f(10) leqslant 15; also, when k leqslant 3, f(10) leqslant frac{3 times 10}{2}=15.Thus, we only need to prove that when k=4, f(10) leqslant 16. Since T does not contain C_{4} and has 5 vertices, from the initial discussion, f(5)=6. If there is a vertex with degree 1, removing this vertex would leave a 4-order graph with 5 edges, which must contain a C_{4}. Therefore, each vertex must have a degree of at least 2. If there is a vertex A with degree 3, let it be adjacent to B, C, D but not to E. Since E has a degree of at least 2, E must be adjacent to two of B, C, D, which would form a C_{4}. Therefore, each vertex must have degrees of 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, meaning T forms two triangles sharing exactly one common vertex. Since |S|=4, if S and T are connected by at least 5 edges, then there must be a vertex in S that is connected to two vertices in T, forming a C_{4}.

We have no basis to consider any outcome of the first type and the outcome of the second type equally probable. To obtain a system of equally probable outcomes, it is convenient to assume conditionally that in all cases two numbers are dialed, i.e., that even if the correct number is dialed the first time, another number is randomly dialed afterward and it is asked whether the correct number was dialed (of course, in practice, there is no need to actually make the second call).The total number of possible equally probable outcomes of a sequence of two telephone calls is 10 cdot 9 = 90 (the first time any of the 10 digits can be dialed, and the second time any of the remaining 9 digits).

For arbitrary ( y ), we have:     [     f(a) = -a + g(y) + y + 1     ]     [     f(b) = -b + g(y) + y + 1     ]     Since ( f(a) = f(b) ), we get:     [     -a + g(y) + y + 1 = -b + g(y) + y + 1     ]     This implies ( -a = -b ), so ( a = b ). Therefore, ( f ) is injective.2. Prove that ( f ) and ( g ) are surjective:   - To show that ( f ) is surjective, note that for any ( y in mathbb{R} ), we can vary ( x ) to cover all real numbers. Thus, ( f ) is surjective.   - Since ( f ) is bijective (both injective and surjective), it is invertible. From the equation ( f(g(y)) = y + 1 ), we can solve for ( g(y) ):     [     g(y) = f^{-1}(y + 1)     ]     Varying ( y ) gives the surjectivity of ( g ).3. Find the explicit forms of ( f ) and ( g ):   - Since ( f ) is bijective, it has an inverse. Using the original equation ( f(x + g(y)) = -x + y + 1 ), set ( y = g^{-1}(0) ):     [     f(x) = -x + g^{-1}(0) + 1     ]     Let ( c = g^{-1}(0) + 1 ), then:     [     f(x) = -x + c     ]   - Substitute ( f(x) = -x + c ) back into the equation ( f(g(y)) = y + 1 ):     [     -g(y) + c = y + 1     ]     Solving for ( g(y) ):     [     g(y) = -y + c - 1     ]     Let ( d = c - 1 ), then:     [     g(y) = -y + d     ]4. Calculate ( g(x + f(y)) ):   - Using the forms ( f(y) = -y + c ) and ( g(y) = -y + d ):     [     g(x + f(y)) = g(x - y + c)     ]     Substitute ( g(z) = -z + d ) with ( z = x - y + c ):     [     g(x - y + c) = -(x - y + c) + d     ]     Simplify:     [     g(x + f(y)) = -x + y - c + d     ]     Since ( c = d + 1 ), we have:     [     g(x + f(y)) = -x + y - (d + 1) + d = -x + y - 1     ]Conclusion:[boxed{-x + y - 1}]"},{"problem":"3.

First, we identify the general term of the expansion of (1-x)^{6}. The general term, denoted as {T}_{r+1}, can be expressed using the binomial theorem as {T}_{r+1}={C}_{6}^{r}(-x)^{r}. Simplifying this, we get {T}_{r+1}=(-1)^{r}{C}_{6}^{r}{x}^{r}.2. Next, we need to find the coefficient of x^{4} in the expansion of (2+ax)(1-x)^{6}. This can be achieved by considering the contributions from both parts of the binomial (2+ax):   - The term 2 contributes 2(-1)^{4}{C}_{6}^{4}{x}^{4} to the expansion.   - The term ax contributes a(-1)^{3}{C}_{6}^{3}{x}^{4} to the expansion, since we need to consider the term from (1-x)^{6} that will give us x^3 to multiply by x and get x^4.3. Combining these contributions, the coefficient of x^{4} is given by the sum of these two parts: 2(-1)^{4}{C}_{6}^{4} + a(-1)^{3}{C}_{6}^{3}.

Let ( 2sqrt{3} = tau ).   - We have ( frac{1}{tau} in S implies tau in S implies tau^n in S ) for any positive integer ( n ).   - Applying ( tau^n ) in Lemma 1 gives us our subsequence.   - Now, take ( y_n = frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n} ). Each ( y_i ) is greater than 1 and they tend to 1, as otherwise ( x_i ) would grow arbitrarily large.   - Since ( x_n in S ), ( frac{1}{x_n} in S ), so ( y_n in S ), and thus ( {y_n} ) is a sequence of elements of ( S ) that tends to 1 from above.   - Take any interval ( [a, b] ). We will show that there exists an element of ( S ) in this interval.     - If ( a leq 1 leq b ), then this is trivial, as ( 1 in S ).     - If ( 1 < a < b ), there exists some ( y in S ) such that ( 1 < y < frac{b}{a} ), some power of which will be in our given interval.     - Similarly, if ( a < b < 1 ), then there exists an element of ( S ) in ( [frac{1}{b}, frac{1}{a}] ) by the previous logic, so its reciprocal satisfies the conditions.4. Show that ( f ) is nondecreasing:   Lemma 3: Given any positive reals ( a, r ), there exists a triangle with one side of length ( a ) and inradius ( r ) if and only if ( a > 2r ).   Proof of Lemma 3:   - If ( a > 2r ), take a circle ( omega ) of radius ( r ) and draw a tangent ( ell ) tangent at ( P ). Let ( B ) and ( C ) be the points on ( ell ) such that ( PB = PC = frac{a}{2} ).   - The other tangents from ( B ) and ( C ) to ( omega ) intersect at ( A ). As ( frac{a}{2} > r ), this ( A ) is on the side of ( BC ) containing ( omega ), so ( omega ) is indeed the incircle and not an excircle.   - On the other hand, if we have a triangle ( ABC ) with incircle ( omega ) of radius ( r ), center ( I ), and tangent to ( BC ) at ( D ), with ( x = BD, y = CD ):     [     tan^{-1}left(frac{r}{x}right) + tan^{-1}left(frac{r}{y}right) = angle IBD + angle ICD = 180^circ - angle BIC = 180^circ - left(90^circ + frac{angle A}{2}right) < 90^circ     ]   - As ( frac{d^2}{dx^2} tan^{-1}left(frac{r}{x}right) = frac{2rx}{(r^2 + x^2)^2} ), we have that ( f(x) = tan^{-1}left(frac{r}{x}right) ) is convex and thus:     [     tan^{-1}left(frac{r}{x}right) + tan^{-1}left(frac{r}{y}right) geq 2 tan^{-1}left(frac{2r}{x+y}right) = 2 tan^{-1}left(frac{2r}{a}right)     ]   - So, ( tan^{-1}(2r/a) < 45^circ ), which implies that ( 2r < a ).   Corollary: If ( a > 2r ), then ( f(a) > 2f(r) ).   Proof: If ( a > 2r ), there exists a triangle with sides ( a, b, c ) and inradius ( r ) for some ( b, c in mathbb{R}^+ ), so there exists a triangle with sides ( f(a), f(b), f(c) ) and inradius ( f(r) ), which means ( f(a) > 2f(r) ).   - Now, take some ( a > b ), and let ( frac{1}{2} > epsilon_1 > epsilon_2 > cdots to 0 ) such that ( frac{1}{2} - epsilon_i in S ).   - Then:     [     a > 2b left( frac{1}{2} - epsilon_i right) implies f(a) > 2fleft(b left( frac{1}{2} - epsilon_i right)right) = 2f(b) left( frac{1}{2} - epsilon_i right) = f(b)(1 - 2epsilon_i)     ]   - As ( i to infty ), ( f(a) geq f(b) ).5. Final step:   - Let ( x ) be an arbitrary positive real, and let ( {y_n} ) be a sequence of elements of ( S ) that approach ( x ) from below and ( {z_n} ) be a sequence of elements of ( S ) that approach ( x ) from above.   - We have ( f(y_n) = y_n f(1) ) and ( f(z_n) = z_n f(1) ), so:     [     y_n f(1) leq f(x) leq z_n f(1)     ]   - The squeeze theorem gives:     [     x f(1) = lim_{n to infty} y_n f(1) = f(x) = lim_{n to infty} z_n f(1) = x f(1)     ]   - Therefore, ( f(x) = x f(1) ) for all ( x ), finishing the proof.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = kx } ) for some constant ( k = f(1) )."},{"problem":"To beautify the environment, a landscaping department decided to purchase two types of landscape trees, A and B, for greening the southern section of Open Source Road.

Since varphi lies in the range -frac{pi}{2} < varphi < frac{pi}{2}, we deduce that varphi = -frac{pi}{3}.Next, knowing that the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the line x = -frac{pi}{12}, we must have 2sin(-omega cdot frac{pi}{12} + varphi) = 2sin(omega cdot frac{pi}{12} + varphi + pi). This leads to:[-omega cdot frac{pi}{12} - frac{pi}{3} = frac{pi}{2} + kpi, quad kin mathbb{Z}.]Solving for omega gives omega = 12k - 10. But since omega must be between 0 and 12, the only possible value for omega is 2.Thus, the expression for f(x) is f(x) = 2sin(2x - frac{pi}{3}).The least positive period T is given by T = frac{2pi}{omega} = frac{2pi}{2} = pi, so option A is incorrect.For option B, we evaluate the function at x = frac{7pi}{9} and find that y neq 0, implying the graph is not symmetric about the point left(frac{7pi}{9}, 0right), so option B is incorrect.To assess whether the function f(x) is increasing on the interval left(frac{pi}{4}, frac{11pi}{24}right), we need to check the derivative sign. For sin to be increasing, its argument, 2x - frac{pi}{3}, must be in the range -frac{pi}{2} leq 2x - frac{pi}{3} leq frac{pi}{2}. This results in -frac{pi}{12} leq x leq frac{5pi}{12}. Since frac{pi}{4} and frac{11pi}{24} are not within this interval, option C is incorrect.For option D, consider the function y = 2cos 2x translated to the right by frac{5pi}{12} units. The translated function becomes 2cosleft(2(x - frac{5pi}{12})right) = 2cos(2x - frac{5pi}{6}).

Therefore, triangles A D P and D C T are right triangles; P M and T N are their medians. Since the median of a right triangle to the hypotenuse is equal to half of the hypotenuse, T N=C N=D N, P M= A M=D M. Let angle T C D=gamma. Since triangle C T N is isosceles, and angle C T N=gamma, angle T N D= 2 gamma (as the exterior angle of triangle C T N). Angles P M A and T N D are equal due to the parallelism of lines P M and T N. Since triangle A M P is also isosceles, angle P A M=90^{circ}-frac{1}{2} angle P M A=90^{circ}-frac{1}{2} angle T N D= 90^{circ}-gamma.

Define the set and the problem:   Consider the set ( A = {1, 2, 3, ldots, 2008} ). We need to determine which of the classes ( X_r ) (where ( r in {0, 1, 2} )) is the largest. A set is of type ( r ) if the sum of its elements gives the remainder ( r ) when divided by 3.2. Symmetry and Initial Observations:   By symmetry, we can initially assume that the sizes of ( X_1 ) and ( X_2 ) are equal. We will use induction to show that ( X_1 ) is the largest for the set ( A ).3. Base Case:   Consider the set ( B = {1, 2, 3} ):   - The subsets of ( B ) are: ({1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}).   - The sums of these subsets modulo 3 are: (1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0).   - Therefore, ( |X_0| = 3 ), ( |X_1| = 2 ), and ( |X_2| = 2 ).4. Inductive Step:   Assume for a set ( B = {1, 2, ldots, 3k} ), the sizes of ( X_0 ), ( X_1 ), and ( X_2 ) are such that ( |X_0| ) is the largest. Now consider adding the next three elements ( 3k+1, 3k+2, 3k+3 ) to form the set ( B' = {1, 2, ldots, 3k+3} ).5. Adding New Elements:   - Adding ( 3k+1 ) shifts the sums of subsets of ( B ) by 1 modulo 3.   - Adding ( 3k+2 ) shifts the sums of subsets of ( B ) by 2 modulo 3.   - Adding ( 3k+3 ) does not change the sums modulo 3.6. Counting New Subsets:   - Each new element ( 3k+1, 3k+2, 3k+3 ) will create new subsets that shift the sums of the original subsets.   - The new subsets will be counted as follows:     - Subsets including ( 3k+1 ) will contribute to ( X_1 ).     - Subsets including ( 3k+2 ) will contribute to ( X_2 ).     - Subsets including ( 3k+3 ) will contribute to ( X_0 ).7. Conclusion for Larger Sets:   - For the set ( C = {1, 2, ldots, 3k+1} ), the largest class will be ( X_1 ) because the addition of ( 3k+1 ) shifts the sums of subsets of ( B ) by 1 modulo 3, increasing the count of ( X_1 ).8. Final Set Analysis:   - Since ( 2008 = 2007 + 1 = 3 cdot 669 + 1 ), the set ( A ) is of the form ( {1, 2, ldots, 3k+1} ).   - By our previous analysis, ( X_1 ) will be the largest class for the set ( A ).The final answer is ( boxed{ X_1 } ) is the largest."},{"problem":"101.

Applying this to frac{2y}{x+1} and frac{x+1}{y}, we get:[frac{1}{2}left(3+frac{2y}{x+1}+frac{x+1}{y}right) geq frac{1}{2}(3+2sqrt{frac{2y}{x+1} cdot frac{x+1}{y}})]Simplifying the square root, we find:[= frac{1}{2}(3+2sqrt{2})]Therefore, the minimum value of frac{1}{x+1}+frac{1}{y} is boxed{frac{3+2sqrt{2}}{2}}.This minimum value is achieved when frac{2y}{x+1} = frac{x+1}{y}, which leads to the system of equations x+2y=1 and frac{2y}{x+1} = frac{x+1}{y}. Solving this system gives x=2sqrt{2}-3 and y=2-sqrt{2}, confirming that the minimum value is indeed boxed{frac{3+2sqrt{2}}{2}}."},{"problem":"5.1.

Since the ordinates of vertices A and B are equal, A B | O x (Fig. 5.1). Of the three segments O A, A B, and O B, only O A and A B can be the sides of the parallelogram, as O B is the diagonal by condition; therefore, B C | O A and C(5 ; 0). Using formula (5.1), we findO B=sqrt{8^{2}+6^{2}}=sqrt{100}, A C=sqrt{(5-3)^{2}+(0-6)^{2}}=sqrt{40}; thus, O B: A C=sqrt{100}: sqrt{40}=sqrt{2.5} - the required ratio of the diagonals.According to formula (5.3), the equation of side O A is y=k x+q, where k=6: 3=2 and q=0; therefore, y=2 x. Using equality (5.7), we write the equation of side A B: y=6. Further, since B C | O A, the slope of line B C is k=2 by formula (5.8), and the corresponding value of q is found from the equation y=2 x+q by substituting the coordinates of point C(5 ; 0) for x and y; then we get 0=10+q, i.e., q=-10; hence, the equation of B C is y=2 x-10. Finally, the equation of O C is y=0.To find the equation of diagonal A C, we use the fact that points A(3 ; 6) and C(5 ; 0) belong to the line A C and, therefore, their coordinates satisfy the desired equation. Substituting these coordinates into the equation y=k x+q, we get 6=3 k+q, 0=5 k+q, from which k=-3, q=15.

From the fact that no rook attacks another, it follows that there is exactly one rook in each row and each column of the board. Note that the white cells of the columns with odd numbers (first type) are located in rows with even numbers, while the white cells of the columns with even numbers (second type) are located in rows with odd numbers. Therefore, rooks standing in columns with numbers of different parity cannot attack each other. Consequently, the total number of the desired arrangements is equal to the number of arrangements of 4 rooks in cells of the first type, which is 4!, multiplied by the number of arrangements of 4 rooks in cells of the second type, also 4!.Criteria.

Note that ( (u-2)a = ub ), so ( prod_{text{cyc}}(u-2) = prod_{text{cyc}} u ) or ( abc = 0 ).3. Case Analysis:   - If ( abc = 0 ), without loss of generality, let ( a = 0 ). The original inequality becomes:     [     left(frac{b}{b-c} - 1right)^2 geq 0     ]     which is evidently true.   - If ( abc neq 0 ), the original inequality is equivalent to finding the smallest ( k ) such that:     [     f(u, v, w) = u^2 + v^2 + w^2 - 4(u + v + w) + k geq 0     ]     subject to:     [     g(u, v, w) := sum uv - 4sum u + 8 = 0     ]4.

Therefore, we only consider ( (u, v, w) in [-10^{100}, 10^{100}]^3 ), which is compact. Thus, local minima of ( f ) must exist.5. Lagrange Multipliers:   To find the local minima, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Partial Derivatives:   Considering partial derivatives of ( f ) and ( g ) with respect to ( u ):   [   u - 2 = lambda (-v - w + 2)   ]   Similarly, differentiating with respect to ( v ) and ( w ) gives:   [   (u - v) = 0 quad text{if} quad lambda neq 1   ]   This implies ( u = v = w ), leading to:   [   u^3 = prod u = prod (u-2) = (u-2)^3 implies u = u-2   ]   which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( lambda = 1 ).7. Summation and Simplification:   Adding the expressions:   [   u - w = lambda (-v - w + 2)   ]   and symmetric expressions, we obtain:   [   sum u = frac{6(1 + lambda)}{1 + 2lambda} = 4   ]   Hence:   [   g(u, v, w) = 0 implies sum uv = 4   ]   Therefore:   [   f(x) = (sum u)^2 - 2sum uv - 4sum u + k = 16 - 2 cdot 4 - 4 cdot 4 + 8 = 0   ]   Thus, ( min f = 0 ), as desired.

Let ( z = a + ib ) and solve for ( a ) and ( b ):   [   z + frac{1}{z} = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} + frac{i4sqrt{2}}{sqrt{7}}   ]9. Solving this equation yields:   [   z = frac{2sqrt{7} + 4}{sqrt{21}} + frac{i(4sqrt{6} + 2sqrt{42})}{sqrt{21}}, quad frac{2sqrt{7} - 4}{sqrt{21}} + frac{i(4sqrt{6} - 2sqrt{42})}{sqrt{21}}   ]10. Therefore, we have:    [    (a, b) = left(frac{2sqrt{7} + 4}{sqrt{21}}, frac{4sqrt{6} + 2sqrt{42}}{sqrt{21}}right), quad left(frac{2sqrt{7} - 4}{sqrt{21}}, frac{4sqrt{6} - 2sqrt{42}}{sqrt{21}}right)    ]11. In either of these cases, we have:    [    frac{b^2}{a^2} = 6    ]12.

Understanding the problem:   We need to find all real numbers ( a ) such that ( 3 < a < 4 ) and ( a(a - 3{a}) ) is an integer. Here, ({a}) denotes the fractional part of ( a ).2. Expressing ( a ) in terms of its integer and fractional parts:   Since ( 3 < a < 4 ), we can write ( a = 3 + x ) where ( 0 < x < 1 ). Here, ( x ) is the fractional part of ( a ), i.e., ( {a} = x ).3. Substituting ( a ) in the given expression:   We need to evaluate ( a(a - 3{a}) ):   [   a(a - 3{a}) = (3 + x)left((3 + x) - 3xright) = (3 + x)(3 - 2x)   ]4.

Therefore, ( 9 - k ) must be in the interval ( (0, 5) ), which implies ( k ) must be in the interval ( (4, 9) ). Since ( k ) is an integer, ( k ) can be ( 5, 6, 7, ) or ( 8 ).6.

Remainder 0 is given by the squares of numbers divisible by 3, and remainder 1 is given by the squares of numbers not divisible by 3 (i.e., which give a remainder of 1 or 2 when divided by 3).Therefore, the expression x^{2}+y^{2} can be divisible by 3 only if both x and y are divisible by 3. However, then the left side of the equation is divisible by 9, so n must be at least 2.If we write x=3x' and y=3y', and substitute and divide the equation by 9, we getx'^{2}+y'^{2}+3x'y'=11 cdot 5^{m} cdot 3^{n-2}We can repeat this reasoning as long as the right side of the equation is divisible by 3. Also, from the previous arguments, it follows that the right side cannot be divisible by 3 and not be divisible by 9. Thus, in each step, we divide by 9 as long as the right side is divisible by 3. This shows that n must be an even number.Let n=2k for a natural number k. Then x=3^{k} cdot a and y=3^{k} cdot b for natural numbers a and b. It must hold thata^{2}+b^{2}+3ab=11 cdot 5^{m}Notice that a^{2}+b^{2}+3ab=(a-b)^{2}+5ab, so the equation actually reads(a-b)^{2}+5ab=11 cdot 5^{m}We conclude that (a-b)^{2} must be divisible by 5. Since 5 is a prime number, it follows that 5 divides a-b, so (a-b)^{2} is actually divisible by 25.If m geqslant 2, then the right side of the equation is also divisible by 25, so we conclude that 5ab must be divisible by 25, i.e., 5 divides ab. Thus, 5 divides at least one of the numbers a and b, but we know that they give the same remainder when divided by 5, so we conclude that 5 divides both a and b.Now we can reason similarly to the divisibility by 5 and divide the equation by 25 as long as the right side either has no factor 5 or has only one factor 5. The first case occurs if m is an even number, and the second if n is odd.This reduces the problem to two cases. If m is an even number, we write m=2ell, a=5^{ell} cdot c and b=5^{ell} cdot d, and solve the equationc^{2}+d^{2}+3cd=11The numbers c and d are natural, so they cannot be greater than 2 (since the expression on the left side would be greater than 11), and by listing all possibilities, we see that the only possibilities are c=1, d=2 or c=2, d=1.Thus, for even m=2ell and even n=2k, the solutions are(x, y)=left(3^{k} cdot 5^{ell}, 2 cdot 3^{k} cdot 5^{ell}right), quad(x, y)=left(2 cdot 3^{k} cdot 5^{ell}, 3^{k} cdot 5^{ell}right)If m is an odd number, we write m=2ell-1, a=5^{ell-1} cdot c and b=5^{ell-1} cdot d, and solve the equationc^{2}+d^{2}+3cd=55In this case, the numbers c and d cannot be greater than 6 because for c>6 we have c^{2}+3cd > 36+d^{2}+18d geq 36+1+18=55. Now we list all possibilities c, d in{1,2, ldots, 6}, and check when c^{2}+d^{2}+3cd=55. This is possible only if c=1 and d=6 or c=6 and d=1. Thus, for odd m=2ell-1 and even n=2k, the solutions are(x, y)=left(3^{k} cdot 5^{ell-1}, 6 cdot 3^{k} cdot 5^{ell-1}right), quad(x, y)=left(6 cdot 3^{k} cdot 5^{ell-1}, 3^{k} cdot 5^{ell-1}right)"},{"problem":"11.023.

First, we consider the equation of Circle O_1: {x^2}+{y^2}+4x-8y-5=0. To rewrite it in the standard form of a circle equation, we complete the square for both x and y:   begin{align*}   x^2 + 4x + y^2 - 8y &= 5    (x^2 + 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 8y + 16) &= 5 + 4 + 16    (x + 2)^2 + (y - 4)^2 &= 25.   end{align*}   Therefore, Circle O_1 can be rewritten as left(x+2right)^{2}+left(y-4right)^{2}=25, indicating the center of the circle is O_{1}(-2,4) with a radius r_{1}=5.2. Next, we analyze Circle O_2: {(x+2)^2}+{y^2}={r^2}(r>0). By the given equation, the center is O_{2}(-2,0) with a radius r.3. To find the distance between the centers O_1 and O_2, we calculate |{{O_1}{O_2}}|:   begin{align*}   |{{O_1}{O_2}}| &= sqrt{((-2)-(-2))^2 + (4-0)^2}    &= sqrt{0^2 + 4^2}    &= 4.   end{align*}4. Since the two circles have only one common point, they must either be externally tangent or internally tangent. However, because the distance between their centers is less than the sum of their radii, they cannot be externally tangent. Thus, they must be internally tangent, which means:   begin{align*}   |O_{1}O_{2}| &= |r_{1}-r|    4 &= |5-r|.   end{align*}5. Solving |5-r|=4 gives two possibilities:   - If 5-r=4, then r=1.   - If 5-r=-4, then r=9.Therefore, the possible values of r are 1 or 9, which leads us to the final answer: boxed{text{D}}."},{"problem":"A certain school held a speech competition with the theme \\"Youth in a Prosperous Era, Striving at the Right Time.\\" The competition was scored on a scale of 100 points for speech content, speech skills, and speech effects, with the final score determined by a ratio of 4:2:4.

Therefore, ( K ) is an integer if and only if the fractional expression is an integer, i.e., if ( n+10 ) is equal to one of the divisors of 12600. Here, we consider both positive and negative divisors with the same absolute value separately.( 12600=2^{3} cdot 3^{2} cdot 5^{2} cdot 7 ), and according to the 1106th exercise, the number of positive divisors is the product of the exponents increased by 1: ((3+1)(2+1)(2+1)(1+1)=72). There are as many negative divisors, so there are 144 integers ( n ) for which ( K ) is an integer. Specifically, from the equationn+10=-12600,-6300, ldots, 8,9,10,12, ldots, 12600we getn=-12610,-6310, ldots,-2,-1,0,2, ldots, 12590b) To determine the integer pairs ( n>0, K>0 ), we exclude those positive integers ( n ) for which ( K leq 0 ). Transform (1) as follows: ( K=K_{1}+K_{2} ), whereK_{1}=frac{12600}{n+10}, quad K_{2}=(111-n)(n-9)=-(n-60)^{2}+2601( K_{1} ) is positive for all ( n>0 ) and monotonically decreases as ( n ) increases. If ( 9 leq n leq 111 ), then ( K_{2} geq 0 ), so here ( K>0 ). For ( n>111 ) and ( 00end{gathered}so here also ( K>0 ).The second form shows that for ( n>60 ), ( K_{2} ) is also monotonically decreasing, so this holds for ( K ) as well. For ( n=113 ), ( K0 ). Therefore, ( K>0 ) for ( 0<n<113 ) integer values.For these ( n ), ( 10<n+10<123 ), so we need to find how many divisors of 12600 are between 10 and 123, excluding the boundaries. Two observations simplify the answer. The factorization ( 12600=2^{3} cdot 3^{2} cdot 5^{2} cdot 7 ) shows that all integers from 1 to 10 are divisors, so the number of positive divisors to be excluded due to the lower limit is 10. Furthermore, the square root of 12600 is close to 112.2, and the number of divisors smaller and larger than this is equal, as dividing by a number smaller than the square root results in a quotient larger than the square root and vice versa. For example, 12600/105 = 120, these are so-called paired divisors of 12600. Thus, the number of divisors to be retained up to 112.2 is ( 72 / 2 - 10 = 26 ), and we only need to find the divisors of 12600 between 112.2 and 123. We have already seen that 120 is a suitable divisor, and there are no more, as 113 is prime, and the others are multiples of the prime numbers ( 19, 23, 29, 13, 59, 17, 11, 61 ), which are not present in the factorization of 12600.Therefore, there are 27 natural numbers ( n ) for which ( K ) is a positive integer.Based on the work of László Hárson (Budapest, Berzsenyi D.

Since there are 3 odd numbers (3, 5, 7) and 2 even numbers (4, 6), the number of ways A can happen is binom{3}{2} + binom{2}{2} = 3 + 1 = 4. Therefore, P(A) = frac{4}{10} = frac{2}{5}. Event B, where both cards have odd numbers, corresponds to selecting 2 cards from the odd numbers. There are binom{3}{2} = 3 ways this can happen, so P(B) = frac{3}{10}.

Therefore, the center of the circle omega_{n+1} with radius n+1 / 2, which is tangent to sigma_{n} at the upper point, has coordinates left(0, n^{2}+n+1 / 2right). Thus, the equation of the circle sigma_{n+1} isx^{2}+left(y-n^{2}-n-1 / 2right)^{2}=(n+1 / 2)^{2} or x^{2}+left(y-n^{2}right)^{2}-2left(y-n^{2}right)(n+1 / 2)=0.

Therefore, this equation has a unique solution y=n^{2}+n. Consequently, the circle omega_{n+1} has exactly two common points with the parabola y=x^{2} (with the specified ordinate).

Case 1: When either A or B is 0- If A=0, then the equation becomes 0cdot x + Bcdot y = 0, which simplifies to By=0. Since B is non-zero (as A and B are different), this equation represents the line y=0.- If B=0, then the equation becomes Acdot x + 0cdot y = 0, which simplifies to Ax=0. Since A is non-zero, this equation represents the line x=0.- Therefore, when 0 is chosen as either A or B, we have 2 different lines: x=0 and y=0.2. Case 2: When A and B are chosen from 1, 3, 5, 7, 9- The total number of ways to choose 2 different numbers from 5 is calculated using the permutation formula A_{5}^{2} = 5 times 4 = 20.- However, certain combinations like (1,3) and (3,9) or their reverses (3,1) and (9,3) represent the same line. This is because the equations 1x + 3y = 0 and 3x + 9y = 0 are equivalent, as are their reversed counterparts. Thus, we have 2 sets of combinations that represent the same lines.- Therefore, the actual number of different lines represented when A and B are chosen from 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 is 20 - 2 = 18.3.

Given that triangles ABE and BCF are congruent, we have:   [   angle ABE = angle CBF quad text{and} quad angle ABC = 90^circ   ]   Since angle ABC = 90^circ, it follows that:   [   angle EBF = 90^circ   ]2.

The stronger fighter wins. We say that village A is stronger than village B if a fighter from village A wins at least k of the 400 fights.It turns out that each village is stronger than its neighboring village in a clockwise direction. Determine the maximum value of k so that this can be the case.Answer: The maximum value is k=290.## Solution:","solution":"We first give a construction and then prove that more than 290 is not possible. O.B.d.A we can assume that the fighters have strengths 1 to 400, and we number the villages clockwise from one to twenty.Construction: In the first village live the fighters of strength 400,190, 189, 188, . . In the second village live 399,398, 171,170,..,157, 156, and so on, in the last village live the fighters 210,209,...,192,191. To put it more clearly, we first distribute the fighters with strength greater than 190 to the villages, into the first village 400, into the second village 399, 398, into the third village 397, 396, 395, etc.. Then we fill the villages with fighters with a maximum strength of 190, into the first village 190,..,172, into the second village 171, ldots, 156, etc.Note that village x has just x fighters with strength greater than 190 and 20-x fighters with strength less than 191. For x in{1, ldots, 19} the fighters with strength greater than 190 win against all fighters of village x+1. The fighters with strength less than 191 win against the fighters with strength less than 191 in the next village, so they each win (20-(x+1)) times. In total, village x wins 20 x+(20-x)(20-(x+1)) times. The calculation shows that each of these villages wins at least 290 times. Now let's look at the twentieth village. Its fighters win against nineteen fighters from village one, so the twentieth village wins more than 290 times. Thus k=290 is possible.Upper bound: Assume that k>290 goes. We call fighters with a maximum strength of 200 weak. There are 200 weak fighters and twenty villages, so there is at least one village that has at least 10 weak fighters. We count how many times this village can win. The remaining fighters in the village win a maximum of 10 cdot 20=200 times. This means that the 10 weak fighters must win at least 91 times. The next step is that at least one of the 10 weak fighters must win 10 times. Consequently, the following village also has at least 10 weak fighters. Using the same argument, we conclude in turn that each village has at least 10 weak fighters. It also follows from the argument that the strongest of the weak fighters must be stronger than the strongest of the weak fighters from the following village, otherwise he cannot win 10 times. However, since we can apply the argument in turn, it also follows that the strongest of the weak fighters in the first village must be stronger than himself, which is not possible.

Solving these equations gives us:[x = 15, quad y = frac{20}{3}.]Therefore, to maximize S without exceeding the budget, the front iron grille should be designed to be boxed{15} meters long."},{"problem":"Given y=x^{2}-4x+3, when mleqslant xleqslant m+2, the minimum value of the function y is frac{5}{4}.
