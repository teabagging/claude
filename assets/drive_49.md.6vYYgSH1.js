Understanding the Problem:   - We are told that there is a certain amount of rice in a 10-dou bucket, but we don't know how much. Let's call this unknown quantity of rice y dou.   - The rest of the bucket is filled with grain, and after threshing, we get 7 dou of rice. Since the bucket's total capacity is 10 dou, if y dou is rice, then the grain that was added must fill the remaining space, which we can call x dou. Therefore, the total content of the bucket before threshing is x (grain) + y (rice) = 10 dou.   - The problem also tells us that 50 dou of grain produces 30 dou of rice, which means the conversion rate from grain to rice is frac{3}{5}. So, after threshing, the grain (x dou) converts to rice at this rate, and the original rice (y dou) remains as rice.2. Setting Up the Equations:   - From the first point, we have our first equation: x + y = 10.   - For the second point, after threshing, the grain (x dou) converts to rice at a rate of frac{3}{5}, and when added to the original rice (y dou), it totals 7 dou of rice. This gives us the second equation: xcdotfrac{3}{5} + y = 7.3. Formulating the System of Equations:   - Combining the two equations from above, we get the system of equations:     [     left{begin{array}{l}     x + y = 10      xcdotfrac{3}{5} + y = 7     end{array}right.     ]   - However, to match the format of the choices given, we need to adjust the second equation to clearly represent the relationship without the multiplication sign explicitly shown, which is a common practice in algebra. So, the second equation simplifies to: x + frac{3}{5}y = 7.4.

Understanding the Condition:   The given condition is (i + j mid ia_i + ja_j) for all (i, j in {1, 2, ldots, 2016}). This can be rewritten as:   [   i + j mid i(a_i - a_j)   ]   This implies that (i + j) must divide (i(a_i - a_j)).2. Analyzing the Divisibility:   Since (i + j) divides (i(a_i - a_j)), we need to consider the greatest common divisor (gcd) of (i) and (i + j). Notice that:   [   gcd(i, i + j) = gcd(i, j)   ]   If (i) and (j) are coprime (i.e., (gcd(i, j) = 1)), then (i + j) must divide (a_i - a_j).3. Special Case for (2k - 1):   Consider (i = k) and (j = k - 1). Then:   [   i + j = k + (k - 1) = 2k - 1   ]   Since (gcd(k, k - 1) = 1), it follows that:   [   2k - 1 mid a_k - a_{k-1}   ]   If (2k - 1 > 2016), then (a_k = a_{k-1}) because (0 leq a_k, a_{k-1} leq 2016).4. Implication for Large (k):   For (k > 1008), (2k - 1 > 2016). Therefore, (a_k = a_{k-1}) for all (k > 1008). This implies:   [   a_{1009} = a_{1010} = ldots = a_{2016}   ]5. Considering Smaller (i):   For (i < 1009), we need to find some (j) such that (gcd(i, j) = 1) and (i + j > 2016). One such (j) can be chosen from ({2017 - i, 2017 - i + 1, ldots, 2016}). For these (j), we have:   [   i + j mid a_i - a_j   ]   Since (i + j > 2016), it follows that (a_i = a_j = a_{2016}).6. Conclusion:   Since (a_i = a_{2016}) for all (i), all sequences satisfying the given condition must be constant sequences.The final answer is ( boxed{ a_1 = a_2 = ldots = a_{2016} } )."},{"problem":"8.

In fact, both are possible, and each for infinitely many triangles. We shall show this for m=12, and the argument is analogous for m=frac{3}{4}. Take any right triangle with legs parallel to the axes and a hypotenuse with slope 12 div 2 = 6, e.g. the triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), and (1,6). Then quick calculations show that the medians to the legs have slopes 12 and 3. Now translate the triangle (without rotating it) so that its medians intersect at the point where the lines y=12x+2 and y=3x+1 intersect. This forces the medians to lie on these lines (since their slopes are determined, and now we force them to go through a particular point; a slope and a point uniquely determine a line). Finally, for any central dilation of this triangle (a larger or smaller triangle with the same centroid and sides parallel to this one's sides), the medians will still lie on these lines, showing the \\"infinitely many\\" part of the result.Hence, to sum up, m can in fact be both 12 or frac{3}{4}, which is exactly 2 values, i.e. boxed{C}."},{"problem":"4.

Then, by making the substitution x rightarrow x-left[frac{p}{2}right] (square brackets denote the integer part), we can assume that any polynomial has one of two forms: x^{2}+q or x^{2}+x+q.The ranges of any two polynomials of different forms intersect: indeed, the values of the polynomials x^{2}+q and x^{2}+x+q^{prime} coincide at x=q-q^{prime}. Therefore, polynomials of different forms cannot be chosen.Polynomials of the first form can be chosen no more than two, since if the ranges of f_{1}(x)=x^{2}+q and f_{2}(x)=x^{2}+q^{prime} do not intersect, then q-q^{prime}=4 k+2 for some k in mathbb{Z}. Indeed, for an odd difference of the constant terms q-q^{prime}=2 k+1, we have f_{1}(k)=f_{2}(k+1). For a difference of the constant terms divisible by 4, q-q^{prime}=4 k, we have f_{1}(k-1)=f_{2}(k+1). But if at least three polynomials are chosen, then among the pairwise differences of the constant terms, at least one does not have the form 4 k+2.Polynomials of the second form can also be chosen no more than two, since if the ranges of f_{1}(x)=x^{2}+x+q and f_{2}(x)=x^{2}+x+q^{prime} do not intersect, then q-q^{prime}=2 k+1 for some k in mathbb{Z}. Indeed, for an even difference of the constant terms q-q^{prime}=2 k, we have f_{1}(k-1)=f_{2}(k). Again, if at least three polynomials are chosen, then among the pairwise differences of the constant terms, at least one is even.Thus, more than two polynomials cannot be chosen.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices and two integers ( n ) and ( k ) such that (frac{3}{2} leq frac{1}{2} n < k < n). The graph ( G ) satisfies two conditions:   - ( G ) does not contain a ((k+1))-clique.   - Adding any edge to ( G ) creates a ((k+1))-clique.      We need to find the least possible number of central vertices in ( G ).2. Initial Claim:   The solution claims that the answer is ( boxed{2k - n} ). This can be derived by considering the Turan graph ( T_{n, k} ).3. Turan's Theorem:   Turan's Theorem states that the maximum number of edges in a graph on ( n ) vertices that does not contain a ((k+1))-clique is given by the Turan graph ( T_{n, k} ), which is a ( k )-partite graph with parts as equal as possible.4. Minimal Number of Central Vertices:   Consider the graph with the minimal number of central vertices. We claim that there do not exist three vertices ( u, v, w ) in the graph such that ( v ) is adjacent to ( w ) and ( u ) is not adjacent to ( v ) and not adjacent to ( w ). Assume for the sake of contradiction that such vertices exist.5. Central Vertex ( a ):   Consider a central vertex ( a ). We claim that any ((k+1))-clique that exists after an edge is added between vertices ( u ) and ( v ) contains ( a ). Assume the contrary, then there is a ( k-1 )-clique all of whose vertices are connected to ( u ) and ( v ) and none of whose vertices are ( a ). But then the vertices of that ( k-1 )-clique and ( a ) and ( u ) form a ((k+1))-clique, which is a contradiction.6. Modifying the Graph:   Now, delete the edge between ( a ) and ( v ) and add an edge between ( v ) and ( u ). We claim that this new graph satisfies all the properties outlined in the problem and has fewer central vertices than the graph we started with. Since ( a ) is no longer a central vertex and since clearly no vertex became a new central vertex in the new graph, it suffices to check that the new graph contains no ((k+1))-clique and adding any edge to the new graph results in a graph with a ((k+1))-clique.7. Verification:   Since all ((k+1))-cliques formed by adding an edge between ( u ) and ( v ) contained ( a ) and we deleted the edge between ( a ) and ( v ), we know that the new graph contains no ((k+1))-clique. Also, if we add an edge between ( a ) and ( v ) in the new graph, we obtain the same graph as if we had added an edge between ( u ) and ( v ) in the original graph, which by definition yields a graph containing a ((k+1))-clique. Therefore, the new graph contradicts the minimality of our original graph.8. Conclusion:   This means that \\"not being adjacent\\" is an equivalence relation between vertices, which means that our graph is complete and partite. Since it must be at least ( k )-partite, we easily obtain the desired result."},{"problem":"4.

However, given that the semicircle's radius is 2, the straight-line distance (diameter of the base of the cone) is 2 times 2 = 4, and the curved part (half the circumference of the base) is pi times 2.

This is equivalent to choosing 5 teams out of 10, which can be done in C(10, 5) ways.To find the number of ways the 2 strong teams can be placed in the same group, we can first place them together in one group and then choose 3 more teams to join them from the remaining 8 teams. This can be done in C(8, 3) ways.Thus, the number of ways the 2 strong teams can be in the same group is C(8, 3) = frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = frac{8 times 7 times 6}{3 times 2 times 1} = 56 ways.The total number of ways to split all teams into two groups is C(10, 5) = frac{10!}{5!(10-5)!} = frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6}{5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 252 ways.Therefore, the probability that the 2 strong teams are not in the same group is the complement of the probability that they are in the same group:P(text{not in same group}) = 1 - P(text{in same group}) = 1 - frac{C(8, 3)}{C(10, 5)} = 1 - frac{56}{252} = 1 - frac{5}{9}=frac{4}{9}.However, it appears that there is a discrepancy, as the options provided in the problem and my calculations do not match. Looking closely at my calculations, I realize there was a mistake in the total number of ways to split all teams into two groups, which should have been 252/2 considering the indistinguishability of the two groups upon division (as there is no differentiation between which group is first or second). Each division of teams without considering their order counts twice in 252 total ways.Let's correct this:The correct total number of ways to split all teams into two groups without considering group order is frac{C(10, 5)}{2} = frac{252}{2} = 126 ways.Now let's recalculate the probability:P(text{not in same group}) = 1 - frac{56}{126} = 1 - frac{4}{9}= frac{5}{9}.Thus, the correct probability that the 2 strong teams are not in the same group is boxed{frac{5}{9}}."},{"problem":"In a quadrilateral A B C D, a circle of radius 2 is inscribed.

By applying (2) with x=sqrt{s^{2}+t^{2}} and y=s, we obtainfleft(s^{2}+t^{2}right)+2 fleft(s cdot sqrt{s^{2}+t^{2}}right)=0,and similarly, by applying (2) with x=sqrt{s^{2}+t^{2}} and y=t, we obtainfleft(s^{2}+t^{2}right)+2 fleft(t cdot sqrt{s^{2}+t^{2}}right)=0 text {. }Consequently, we obtainfleft(s cdot sqrt{s^{2}+t^{2}}right)=fleft(t cdot sqrt{s^{2}+t^{2}}right) .By applying (1) with a=s sqrt{s^{2}+t^{2}}, b=t sqrt{s^{2}+t^{2}} and x=1 / sqrt{s^{2}+t^{2}}, we obtain f(s)= f(t)=-s^{2}, from which it follows that0=fleft(s^{2}+f(s)right)=fleft(s^{2}right)+fleft(s^{2}right)+2 fleft(s^{2}right)=4 fleft(s^{2}right),a contradiction to the fact s^{2}>0. Thus we conclude that for all x neq 0, f(x)>0 must be satisfied.Now, we show the following factk>0, f(k)=1 Leftrightarrow k=1 .Let k>0 for which f(k)=1. We have fleft(k^{2}right)=f(f(k))=f(1), so by (1), f(1 / k)=f(k)= 1 , so we may assume k geq 1. By applying (2) with x=sqrt{k^{2}-1} and y=k, and using f(x) geq 0, we getfleft(k^{2}-1+f(k)right)=fleft(k^{2}-1right)+fleft(k^{2}right)+2 fleft(k sqrt{k^{2}-1}right) geq fleft(k^{2}-1right)+fleft(k^{2}right) .This simplifies to 0 geq fleft(k^{2}-1right) geq 0, so k^{2}-1=0 and thus k=1.Next we focus on showing f(1)=1. If f(1)=m leq 1, then we may proceed as above by setting x=sqrt{1-m} and y=1 to get m=1. If f(1)=m geq 1, now we note that f(m)=f(f(1))=fleft(1^{2}right)=f(1)=m leq m^{2}. We may then proceed as above with x=sqrt{m^{2}-m} and y=1 to show m^{2}=m and thus m=1.We are now ready to finish. Let x>0 and m=f(x). Since f(f(x))=fleft(x^{2}right), then fleft(x^{2}right)= f(m). But by (1), fleft(m / x^{2}right)=1. Therefore m=x^{2}. For x0 for x neq 0 as in the previous solution, we may also proceed as follows. We claim that f is injective on the positive real numbers. Suppose that a>b>0 satisfy f(a)=f(b). Then by setting x=1 / b in (1) we have f(a / b)=f(1). Now, by induction on n and iteratively setting x=a / b in (1) we get fleft((a / b)^{n}right)=1 for any positive integer n.Now, let m=f(1) and n be a positive integer such that (a / b)^{n}>m. By setting x= sqrt{(a / b)^{n}-m} and y=1 in (2) we obtain thatfleft((a / b)^{n}-m+f(1)right)=fleft((a / b)^{n}-mright)+fleft(1^{2}right)+2 fleft(sqrt{left.(a / b)^{n}-mright)}right) geq fleft((a / b)^{n}-mright)+f(1) text {. }Since fleft((a / b)^{n}right)=f(1), this last equation simplifies to fleft((a / b)^{n}-mright) leq 0 and thus m= (a / b)^{n}. But this is impossible since m is constant and a / b>1. Thus, f is injective on the positive real numbers. Since f(f(x))=fleft(x^{2}right), we obtain that f(x)=x^{2} for any real value x."},{"problem":"Task 3.

Let the intersection points of the altitude, the angle bisector, and the median with side B C be M, F, S. Due to the assumption A B < A C, the order of the points on side B C is: B, M, F, S, C. Using the additional notations on the diagram, angle M B A = 90^{circ} - alpha, angle A C M = 90^{circ} - 3 alpha.By the Law of Sines:begin{aligned}& frac{A S}{B S}=frac{sin left(90^{circ}-alpharight)}{sin 3 alpha} quad text { and } & frac{A S}{S C}=frac{sin left(90^{circ}-3 alpharight)}{sin alpha}end{aligned}From these, considering that B S = S C,frac{sin left(90^{circ}-alpharight)}{sin 3 alpha}=frac{sin left(90^{circ}-3 alpharight)}{sin alpha}and thus sin alpha cdot cos alpha = sin 3 alpha cdot cos 3 alpha. Multiplying this equation by 2: sin 2 alpha = sin 6 alpha. From triangle A M C, we can see that 3 alpha < 90^{circ}, so alpha < 30^{circ}, and from the latter equation, 6 alpha = 2 alpha or 6 alpha = 180^{circ} - 2 alpha, and thus alpha = 0^{circ} or alpha = 22.5^{circ}. The solution alpha = 0^{circ} is not valid. The angles of the triangle are: 90^{circ}, 67.5^{circ}, and 22.5^{circ}.II. solution. It is known that one of the angle bisectors of a triangle and the perpendicular bisector of the opposite side intersect on the circumcircle. On the diagram, this point is T. It is easy to show that angle F T S = angle M A F = alpha, so triangle A T S is isosceles. Then the perpendicular bisector of A T passes through point S. Since the perpendicular bisector of B C also passes through S, point S is the center of the circumcircle. Therefore, by Thales' theorem, 4 alpha = 90^{circ}, and thus the angles of the triangle are 90^{circ}; 67.5^{circ}, and 22.5^{circ}."},{"problem":"The positive integers a, b and c satisfy frac{1}{a^{2}}+frac{1}{b^{2}}=frac{1}{c^{2}}.The sum of all possible values of a leq 100 is(A) 315(B) 615(C) 680(D) 555(E) 620","solution":"The first challenge in this problem is to find one set of numbers a, b, c that actually works.

The sum of these numbers is 555 .Can we find more starting equations by beginning with a different Pythagorean triple? If we start with 5^{2}+12^{2}=13^{2} and divide both sides by the least common multiple of 5^{2}, 12^{2} and 13^{2} (ie. (5 times 12 times 13)^{2}=780^{2} ), we get frac{1}{156^{2}}+frac{1}{65^{2}}=frac{1}{60^{2}} which gives us 65 as another possible value of a.Therefore, our running total for values of a is 555+65=620.We can't generate more possible values for a using frac{1}{156^{2}}+frac{1}{65^{2}}=frac{1}{60^{2}} since multiplying both sidesby the reciprocal of any perfect square will make both of a and b at least 130, so bigger than 100 .Can we use 6^{2}+8^{2}=10^{2} ? Here, the least common multiple of 6^{2}, 8^{2} and 10^{2} is 120^{2}, and dividing by 120^{2} gives us frac{1}{20^{2}}+frac{1}{15^{2}}=frac{1}{12^{2}}, which we have already used.Can we use any other Pythagorean triple? No, since any other Pythagorean triple is at least as big as 7-24-25, and so the smallest possible denominator that we will get on the left side by using this technique is (7 times 25)^{2}=175^{2}, which would give an a larger than 100 .Also, any triple (a, b, c) that actually works does come from a Pythagorean triple, since we can multiply both sides of frac{1}{a^{2}}+frac{1}{b^{2}}=frac{1}{c^{2}} by (a b c)^{2} to get (b c)^{2}+(a c)^{2}=(a b)^{2}.So every possible triple (a, b, c) comes from a Pythagorean triple, and no Pythagorean triples give any more allowable values of a, so we have found them all.

Check small values of (a) and (b):   - For (a = 1):     [     1! + b = 1 + b = 5^k implies b = 5^k - 1.     ]     - For (b = 1):       [       1! + a = 1 + a = 5^m implies a = 5^m - 1.       ]     - For (a = 2):       [       2! + b = 2 + b = 5^k implies b = 5^k - 2.       ]     - For (b = 2):       [       2! + a = 2 + a = 5^m implies a = 5^m - 2.       ]     - For (a = 3):       [       3! + b = 6 + b = 5^k implies b = 5^k - 6.       ]     - For (b = 3):       [       3! + a = 6 + a = 5^m implies a = 5^m - 6.       ]     - For (a = 4):       [       4! + b = 24 + b = 5^k implies b = 5^k - 24.       ]     - For (b = 4):       [       4! + a = 24 + a = 5^m implies a = 5^m - 24.       ]     - For (a = 5):       [       5! + b = 120 + b = 5^k implies b = 5^k - 120.       ]     - For (b = 5):       [       5! + a = 120 + a = 5^m implies a = 5^m - 120.       ]5. Check for integer solutions:   We need to check if the values of (b) and (a) obtained are positive integers and if they satisfy the conditions (a! + b) and (b! + a) being powers of (5).6. Verify the solutions:   - For (a = 1) and (b = 1):     [     1! + 1 = 2 quad text{(not a power of 5)}.     ]   - For (a = 2) and (b = 2):     [     2! + 2 = 4 quad text{(not a power of 5)}.     ]   - For (a = 3) and (b = 3):     [     3! + 3 = 9 quad text{(not a power of 5)}.     ]   - For (a = 4) and (b = 4):     [     4! + 4 = 28 quad text{(not a power of 5)}.     ]   - For (a = 5) and (b = 5):     [     5! + 5 = 125 quad text{(a power of 5)}.     ]7. Conclusion:   The only pair ((a, b)) of positive integers such that (a! + b) and (b! + a) are both powers of (5) is ((5, 5)).The final answer is ( boxed{ (5, 5) } )."},{"problem":"Problem 1.

An archaeologist found a prehistoric horse's pelvis in the Inner Mongolia prairie. To predict its height, they used the regression equation between the modern horse's pelvic length (x) and height (y) established after the foundation of the People's Republic of China to predict the prehistoric horse's height.   2. Carnations, Phalaenopsis orchids, and Cymbidium orchids are common flowers during Mother's Day. To cultivate these three types of flowers before the holiday, a floriculturist used the regression equation between the temperature (x) and germination rate (y) of Phalaenopsis orchids to predict the germination rate of Cymbidium orchids.3. A feed merchant, based on years of sales experience, concluded that the relationship between the advertising costs (x in ten thousand yuan) and the sales volume (y in ten thousand tons) was generally y = 0.4x + 7. They decided to invest 10 million yuan in advertising and confidently stated that this year the sales volume would definitely exceed 470 thousand tons.4. It is known that the regression equation between the height and weight of female college students is y = 0.849x - 85.7.

Using the regression equation established for modern horses to predict the height of prehistoric horses may not be accurate because the physical characteristics of horses could have changed over thousands of years due to evolution, domestication, and environmental factors. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.2. Applying the regression equation from Phalaenopsis orchids to predict the germination rate of Cymbidium orchids could be problematic, as different species may have varying responses to temperature and other environmental variables. Hence, this statement is also incorrect.3. The merchant's projection of sales volume based on the advertising cost using the equation y = 0.4x + 7 assumes a linear relationship and that other factors remain constant. However, simply investing in advertising does not guarantee that sales will increase predictably, especially if other market conditions or limits to demand are not considered. Therefore, this statement is incorrect as well.4. The regression equation for female college students’ height and weight cannot be applied to a 13-year-old boy, as their body composition and growth patterns are likely to differ significantly due to age, gender, and developmental factors. Thus, this statement is incorrect.Since all four statements have issues with the applicability of regression equations and result in incorrect predictions, the number of incorrect statements is four.So, the final answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"In the Cartesian coordinate system, there exists a hyperbola with the straight lines y = pm 2x as its asymptotes and passes through the focus of the parabola y^2 = 4x.

Given that the straight lines y = pm 2x are asymptotes of the hyperbola, the slopes of these lines (which are pm 2) would correspond to frac{b}{a} and frac{-b}{a}. Consequently, we have b = 2a and -b = -2a. This relationship tells us that the coefficient of y^2 in the hyperbola's equation must be frac{1}{4} of the coefficient of x^2. Therefore, we could initially assume that the hyperbola's equation is x^2 - frac{y^2}{4} = lambda (where lambda neq 0 because the hyperbola is not a pair of intersecting lines).Since the hyperbola passes through the focus of the parabola, which is at F(1, 0), we can plug in the coordinates of the focus into the equation of the hyperbola to find lambda:1^2 - frac{0^2}{4} = lambda Rightarrow lambda = 1.Thus, the equation of the hyperbola is x^2 - frac{y^2}{4} = 1.

How many five-digit numbers exist where the sum of the first two digits is twice the sum of the last two digits?","solution":"Answer: 2600.Solution. Let the first two digits of the number be a and b, and the last two digits be c and d. We need to find the number of combinations of these digits for which a+b=2(c+d).

The first digit can take values from 0 to i, after which the second digit is uniquely determined. Thus, x_{i}=i+1.Let y_{i}(i=1,2, ldots, 9) denote the number of pairs of the first two digits whose sum is 2i. Each time, the digit b is uniquely determined by the digit a: b=2i-a. Therefore, we need to count the number of possible values for the digit a. If i leqslant 4, i.e., 2i leqslant 8, then the digit a can take values from 1 to 2i - a total of 2i values. In other words, in this case, y_{i}=2i. If 5 leqslant i leqslant 9, i.e., 10 leqslant 2i leqslant 18, then the digit a can take values from 2i-9 to 9 - a total of 19-2i values, and y_{i}=19-2i.Let's compile the found values of x_{i} and y_{i} into one table.| i | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || x_{i} | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 || y_{i} | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 9 | 7 | 5 | 3 | 1 |The number of five-digit numbers in which c+d=i and a+b=2i is 10 x_{i} y_{i} (the middle digit can be chosen in 10 ways).

This means that the set (S) must contain all natural numbers if it contains (a) and (b).Given the conditions:1. If (x, y in S), then (x + y in S).2. If (x) is an integer and (2x in S), then (x in S).We need to ensure that the smallest element in (S) is 1. This is because if 1 is in (S), then by repeatedly adding 1 to itself, we can generate all natural numbers. Therefore, (S = mathbb{N}).Let's analyze the pairs ((a, b)) such that (a, b in S) implies (S = mathbb{N}).1. If (a = 1), then (S) must contain all natural numbers because we can generate any number by adding 1 repeatedly. Therefore, for (a = 1), there are 50 possible values for (b) (since (1 le b le 50)).2. If (a neq 1), then (b) must be such that (S) still contains 1. This means (b) must be 1, or there must be a way to generate 1 using (a) and (b). To ensure (S = mathbb{N}), we need to check if (a) and (b) can generate 1. This is possible if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of (a) and (b) is 1. If (gcd(a, b) = 1), then by Bézout's identity, there exist integers (x) and (y) such that (ax + by = 1). This implies that 1 can be generated using (a) and (b), and hence all natural numbers can be generated.Therefore, we need to count the number of pairs ((a, b)) such that (gcd(a, b) = 1).Let's count the pairs ((a, b)) for each (a) from 1 to 50:1. For (a = 1), there are 50 possible values for (b).2. For (a = 2), (b) must be coprime with 2. The numbers coprime with 2 in the range 1 to 50 are the odd numbers. There are 25 odd numbers in this range.3. For (a = 3), (b) must be coprime with 3. Using Euler's totient function (phi(3) = 2), there are (frac{2}{3} times 50 = 33) numbers coprime with 3 in the range 1 to 50.4. For (a = 4), (b) must be coprime with 4.

(1) Let the equation of the secant line be y+8=k(x-4), i.e., kx-y-4k-8=0①.

Substituting into ① gives the equation of the line as 45x+28y+44=0; verification shows that x=4 also satisfies the condition.  Thus, the equation of line AB is 45x+28y+44=0 or x=4.

In this method, after the first number is randomly selected (in this case, 003), every subsequent number is selected at a fixed interval. Since there are 600 students and a sample size of 50 is needed, the interval is frac{600}{50} = 12. This means every 12th student is selected after the first.Given that the first selected number is 003, the numbers selected would be 003, 015, 027, ..., up to the 50th number. To find out how many students from Camp III (students numbered from 496 to 600) are selected, we need to determine which of these selected numbers fall within the range of 496 to 600.The first number in the sequence that falls into Camp III's range is the one that satisfies 3 + 12k geq 496, where k is the number of intervals from the first selected student.

Note that all the terms with odd exponents in left(frac{1}{2}+zright)^5 will cancel out, while the terms with even exponents will be doubled. mathboy282"},{"problem":"The function f(x) = tan(2x) is (　　)  A: An odd function  B: An even function  C: Both an odd and an even function  D: Neither odd nor even","solution":"Given 2x neq kpi + frac{pi}{2} (where k in mathbb{Z}), we have x neq frac{1}{2}kpi + frac{pi}{4}, where k in mathbb{Z}.

From the third statement, it follows that the mandarin is also lighter than the banana. This can be schematically written as: a, m < b < p < a.We know that the apple and the mandarin are the lightest fruits, but we don't yet know which one is lighter. For the other fruits, we know that they are heavier and we know how they are ordered by weight.

The repetition interval is the least common multiple of these, which is 96 teeth rotations. In this time, the large wheel makes 3 revolutions, so the interval length is 9 seconds.From this, we also see that the faulty notch of the large wheel can only meet with 3 different teeth of the small wheel: the 8th tooth from the fault - because in one revolution of the large wheel, the small wheel makes 2 revolutions and rotates by 8 more teeth - and similarly, the 4th tooth from the fault, because 2 cdot 32 = 5 cdot 12 + 4.

Let's denote this point as (t, -{t}^{3}+frac{3a}{2}{t}^{2}-6t).1. Finding the derivative of f(x): To find the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve, we differentiate f(x) with respect to x.   [   f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(-{x^3}+frac{3a}{2}{x^2}-6xright) = -3x^{2}+3ax-6   ]2.

Analyzing the cubic equation for t: Let h(t) = 4t^{3}-3at^{2}+2. We need to find conditions on a such that h(t) has exactly two distinct positive real roots.   - Differentiating h(t) with respect to t gives:     [     h'(t) = 12t^{2}-6at     ]     Setting h'(t) = 0 yields t=0 and t=frac{a}{2}.5. Finding the range of a: We analyze the sign of h(t) at the critical points:   - At t=0, h(0) = 2 > 0.   - At t=frac{a}{2}, hleft(frac{a}{2}right) = -frac{1}{4}a^{3}+2. For hleft(frac{a}{2}right) to be less than 0, we require -frac{1}{4}a^{3}+2  2.Given that there are exactly two distinct positive real solutions for t, and considering the conditions derived from h(t) and its derivative, we conclude that the range of real number a is (2,+infty).Therefore, the final answer is boxed{(2,+infty)}."},{"problem":"2.

Let's consider m=2pi:[fleft(x+1right) = sqrt{2}sin(2pi(x+1)+n) = sqrt{2}sin(2pi x+2pi +n) = sqrt{2}sin(2pi x+n) = fleft(xright).]This shows that for m=2pi, the function satisfies fleft(x+1right)=fleft(xright), making proposition B true.Proposition C: To determine if fleft(xright) is not an even function for all min mathbb{R}, we consider a specific case where n=frac{pi}{2}:[fleft(xright) = sqrt{2}sin(mx+frac{pi}{2}) = sqrt{2}cos(mx).]Then,[fleft(-xright) = sqrt{2}cos(-mx) = sqrt{2}cos(mx) = f(x).]This shows that fleft(xright) can be an even function, contradicting proposition C, hence C is false.Proposition D: We examine if there exists min mathbb{R} such that fleft(xright) is an odd function. With n=2pi (though any integer multiple of pi would serve to illustrate the point, 2pi is chosen for simplicity),[fleft(xright) = sqrt{2}sin(mx),]and[fleft(-xright) = sqrt{2}sin(-mx) = -sqrt{2}sin(mx) = -fleft(xright).]This confirms that fleft(xright) can be an odd function, making proposition D true.Therefore, the correct choices are boxed{BD}."},{"problem":"Given that the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle are 2 and 3, the length of the hypotenuse is ______.","solution":"Given that we have a right triangle with the lengths of the two legs being 2 and 3, we can find the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem.

The problem states that the sales grew from 150 helmets in April to 216 helmets in June, with the same monthly growth rate. Since there are two months between April and June, we can model this situation with the equation:150(1+x)^2 = 216To solve for x, we first divide both sides by 150:(1+x)^2 = frac{216}{150}Simplifying the fraction on the right side gives us:(1+x)^2 = 1.44Taking the square root of both sides:1+x = pm1.2Solving for x gives us two possible solutions:x_1 = 1.2 - 1 = 0.2 quad text{and} quad x_2 = -1.2 - 1 = -2.2Since a negative growth rate doesn't make sense in this context, we discard x_2 = -2.2.

Forward Implication (p implies q): If A = B (condition p), then by the definition of sine in a triangle, sin A = sin B (condition q).

Reverse Implication (q implies p): Conversely, if sin A = sin B (condition q), then in the context of a triangle (specifically a non-obtuse triangle where angles are less than or equal to 90^circ), this implies that A = B (condition p). This is because the sine function is increasing in the interval [0, 90^circ], and thus, for two angles to have the same sine value, they must be equal.Combining these two points, we see that condition p (i.e., A = B) is both necessary and sufficient for condition q (i.e., sin A = sin B) in the context of triangle triangle ABC.

Indeed, otherwise, no matter how long the path ( L ) is, there exists a forest in the form of a very narrow strip along the path ( L ) such that its area does not exceed ( S ) (see the figure). By refining these arguments, one can show that the paratrooper must follow some closed route ( L ). To ensure that the paratrooper can exit the forest regardless of its shape, it is necessary and sufficient that the area enclosed by the line ( L ) is not less than ( S ).

By forming the difference series of our series (the change of each term relative to the one preceding it), we find that every odd-numbered difference is 6, and every even-numbered difference is 8. Thus, the sum of any two consecutive differences (the change of each term relative to the one two places before it) is 14, according to which the odd and even indexed terms of our series form arithmetic series with a difference of d=14:a_{2 k-1}=2+14(k-1)=14 k-12(since 2 k-1 is the k-th odd natural number), or, with 2 k-1=n, k=(n+1) / 2;a_{n}=2+14 frac{n-1}{2}=7 n-5, quad text { if } n text { is odd; }and similarlya_{2 k}=14 k-6, text { or } a_{n}=7 n-6, text { if } n text { is even. }We can also write the two expressions for a_{n} in a common form, if on the one hand we use the fact that the larger of two numbers deviates from their arithmetic mean by the same amount \\"upwards\\" as the smaller one \\"downwards\\", and this deviation is half the span (the absolute value of the difference) of the two numbers, - and on the other hand, the deviation must be taken with alternating signs, which we express with the factor (-1)^{n}. Thus, for any indexa_{n}=7 n-frac{11}{2}-frac{(-1)^{n}}{2}(For odd n, we need to increase, because -5>-6, hence the minus sign in front of (-1)^{n}.)If n is even, n=2 k, then in the sum we take n / 2=k numbers from each series, so denoting the sum of the odd and even indexed terms by S^{prime} and S^{prime prime}, respectively,S_{2 k}=S_{k}^{prime}+S_{k}^{prime prime}=frac{k}{2}left(2+a_{2 k-1}+8+a_{2 k}right)=frac{k}{2}(28 k-8)=14 k^{2}-4 kwith n=2 k-1, we get k odd and k-1 even indexed terms:begin{aligned}& S_{2 k-1}=S_{k}^{prime}+S_{k-1}^{prime prime}=frac{k}{2}left(2+a_{2 k-1}right)+frac{k-1}{2}left(8+a_{2 k-2}right)= & =left(7 k^{2}-5 kright)+left(7 k^{2}-13 k+6right)=14 k^{2}-18 k+6end{aligned}(Briefly: S_{2 k-1}=S_{2 k}-a_{2 k} ).

III. o. t.)Remarks. 1. The statement we made about the difference series can also be phrased as follows: the growth from term to term on average is (6+8) / 2=7, so a_{n} is approximately: a_{n}^{prime}=a_{1}+7(n-1), but we need to subtract 1 from the even indexed terms (nothing from the odd indexed ones). The necessary subtraction can be written with the expression K_{1}=left[1+(-1)^{n}right] / 2, so a_{n}= a_{1}+7(n-1)-K_{1} and this is identical to (1). Similarly: the number of even terms in the series 1,2,3, ldots n is K_{2}=frac{n}{2}-frac{1-(-1)^{n}}{4}; and thusbegin{gathered}S_{n}=frac{n}{2}left(a_{1}+a_{n}right)-K_{2} cdot 1=frac{n}{2}left[2 a_{1}+7(n-1)right]-frac{n}{2}+frac{1-(-1)^{n}}{4}= =frac{n}{2}(7 n-4)+frac{1-(-1)^{n}}{4}end{gathered}which is identical to (2).2.

The first theorem of Pappus states that the surface area formed by the rotation of a plane curve around a straight line, which lies in the same plane and does not intersect the curve, is equal to the product of the length of the curve and the length of the circumference described by its center of gravity. In our case, 4 pi r^{2}=pi r(2 pi y), from which y=frac{2 r}{pi}.[Clamkin, M.

Now assume mathrm{a} geq 11, that is, mathrm{a} is a prime number no less than 11.First, prove two lemmas.Lemma 1: a+1 is a power of 2.Proof of Lemma 1: If mathrm{a}+1 has an odd prime factor mathrm{p}, then mathrm{p} leq frac{mathrm{a}+1}{2}, so frac{mathrm{p}+1}{2} in{0,1, ldots, mathrm{a}-1}, hence 4left(frac{p+1}{2}right)^{2}+a is a prime number. But 4left(frac{p+1}{2}right)^{2}+a=(p+1)^{2}+a equiv 1+a equiv 0(bmod p), and 4left(frac{p+1}{2}right)^{2}+a=(p+1)^{2}+a>p, so 4left(frac{p+1}{2}right)^{2}+a is a composite number, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, a+1 is a power of 2.Lemma 2: a+9 is a power of 2.Proof of Lemma 2: If mathrm{a}+9 has an odd prime factor mathrm{p}, then mathrm{p} leq frac{mathrm{a}+9}{2}, so frac{mathrm{p}+3}{2} in{0,1, ldots, mathrm{a}-1}, hence 4left(frac{p+3}{2}right)^{2}+a is a prime number.

Therefore, a+9 is a power of 2.Now, return to the original problem.According to the above analysis, mathrm{a} is a prime number no less than 11, a+1 is a power of 2, and a+9 is a power of 2. Let left{begin{array}{l}a+1=2^{alpha}  a+9=2^{beta}end{array}right., then 2^{alpha}+2^{3}=2^{beta}. Therefore, it can only be left{begin{array}{l}alpha=3  beta=4end{array}right., thus mathrm{a}=2^{3}-1. This contradicts mathrm{a} geq 11.In conclusion, the values of mathrm{a} that satisfy the condition are 3 or 7.Note: In fact, for any odd prime mathrm{p}<mathrm{a},left{4 mathrm{n}^{2} mid mathrm{n} in{0,1,2, ldots, mathrm{a}-1}right} can cover all quadratic residues modulo mathrm{p}, so for any square number b^{2}, a+b^{2} cannot have an odd prime factor less than a (otherwise, if a+b^{2} has an odd prime factor p less than a, then there exists an integer n in{0,1,2, ldots, a-1}, such that p midleft(4 n^{2}+aright), thus 4 n^{2}+a cannot be a prime number).

Extend the segment B F from the side of F, and on this extension, consider the point K such that F K=14. The angle widehat{C F K} is equal to the angle widehat{D F B}, as they are vertically opposite angles by construction, so the triangles A B E and F C K are similar and, in particular, congruent, as they have two pairs of equal sides (A B=C F and A E=F K=14) and the included angle equal (widehat{B A E}=widehat{D F B}=widehat{C F K}). Since the two triangles are congruent, we have that B E=C K=10 sqrt{2}, because they are corresponding sides, and similarly widehat{A E B}=widehat{F K C}=45^{circ} because they are corresponding angles. We also have widehat{K E C}=widehat{A E B}=45^{circ} because they are vertically opposite angles, so the triangle E C K is isosceles with two angles of 45^{circ}, and therefore it is particularly a right triangle at C.

Since the distance between any pair of opposite sides of square W is greater than frac{1}{2}, if the four sides of W are lines l_{1}, l_{2}, l_{3}, l_{4}, and point M_{0} satisfies:rholeft(M_{0}, l_{i}right) leqslant frac{1}{2} quad (i=1,2,3,4)then point M_{0} must be inside W.(1) When the sides of square W are parallel to the sides of the unit square T, the center O of T clearly satisfies rholeft(O, l_{i}right) leqslant frac{1}{2}, i=1,2,3,4, so O must be inside W.(2) If the sides of square W are not parallel to the sides of the unit square T, let the incircle odot O of square T touch the sides of T at four points E, F, G, H, with radius r=frac{1}{2}.

Understanding the problem: We need to find the number of ordered quadruples ((a, b, c, d)) of positive integers such that the least common multiple (LCM) of any three of them is (3^r cdot 7^s). This implies that the LCM of any three of these numbers must have the same prime factorization.2. Prime factorization constraints: Since the LCM of any three numbers must be (3^r cdot 7^s), each number (a, b, c, d) can be written in the form (3^{x_i} cdot 7^{y_i}) where (0 leq x_i leq r) and (0 leq y_i leq s).3. 3-adic valuation: For the LCM of any three numbers to be (3^r), at least two of the numbers must have a 3-adic valuation of (r). The third number can have a 3-adic valuation less than or equal to (r).4. Counting 3-adic valuations:    - We need to count the number of ways to assign 3-adic valuations to (a, b, c, d) such that the LCM of any three of them is (3^r).    - Let (v_3(a) = x_1), (v_3(b) = x_2), (v_3(c) = x_3), and (v_3(d) = x_4).    - We need at least two of (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) to be equal to (r), and the rest to be less than or equal to (r).5. Casework for 3-adic valuations:    - Case 1: Three numbers have 3-adic valuation (r) and one number has a 3-adic valuation less than (r). There are (binom{4}{3} = 4) ways to choose which three numbers have valuation (r), and (r) choices for the remaining number. This gives (4r) combinations.    - Case 2: Two numbers have 3-adic valuation (r) and the other two have valuations less than (r). There are (binom{4}{2} = 6) ways to choose which two numbers have valuation (r), and (r^2) choices for the remaining two numbers. This gives (6r^2) combinations.    - Case 3: All four numbers have 3-adic valuation less than (r). There is only 1 way to choose this, and (r^3) choices for the numbers. This gives (r^3) combinations.6. Summing up the cases:    - Total combinations for 3-adic valuations: (6r^2 + 4r + 1).7. 7-adic valuation: The same argument applies for the 7-adic valuation. Thus, the number of ways to assign 7-adic valuations is also (6s^2 + 4s + 1).8.

Substituting (a = sqrt{2}b):   [   a^3 = (sqrt{2}b)^3 = 2sqrt{2}b^3   ]   [   b^3 = b^3   ]   Therefore:   [   frac{a^3 + b^3}{a^3 - b^3} = frac{2sqrt{2}b^3 + b^3}{2sqrt{2}b^3 - b^3} = frac{(2sqrt{2} + 1)b^3}{(2sqrt{2} - 1)b^3} = frac{2sqrt{2} + 1}{2sqrt{2} - 1}   ]   Similarly:   [   frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^3 + b^3} = frac{2sqrt{2}b^3 - b^3}{2sqrt{2}b^3 + b^3} = frac{2sqrt{2} - 1}{2sqrt{2} + 1}   ]8.

However, we need to check if F(x) = F(-x) for it to be an even function:- F(1)=f(0)=1- F(-1)=f(-2)=-frac{1}{7}Since F(1) neq F(-1), F(x) is not an even function. Therefore, option C is incorrect.Option D: f(x^{2})The function is f(x^{2})=frac{1}{{x}^{6}+1}. The domain of this function is mathbb{R}, which means it is defined for all real numbers. For a function to be even, it must satisfy f(x) = f(-x).

Clearly, the associated points of }mp@subsup{A}{i}{} are }mp@subsup{A}{i+n+1}{} and }mp@subsup{A}{i+(2n-1)-(n+1)}{} = }mp@subsup{A}{i+n-2}{}.    Below, we will consider simple cases to speculate on the minimum value of k and to find methods to determine this minimum value.    By the problem statement, n geqslant 3, so the simple cases should be when n = 3, 4, 5.    (1) When n = 3, there are 2 times 3 - 1 = 5 points on the circumference.    Clearly, Ais an \\"associated point\\".    Therefore, if we color two non-adjacent points, for example, }mp@subsup{A}{1}{} and }mp@subsup{A}{1}{} in the figure, black,    then the interior of widetilde{A_1A_4} either has one point A_5 or two points A_2, A_3, neither of which are n = 3 points, so this coloring method is not \\"good\\".        However, if we color one more point, i.e., three points, such as }mp@subsup{A}{1}{}, }mp@subsup{A}{5}{}, and }mp@subsup{A}{4}{} or }mp@subsup{A}{1}{}, }mp@subsup{A}{3}{}, and }mp@subsup{A}{4}{},    then there must be two adjacent black points, making this coloring method \\"good\\".            Therefore, when n = 3, the minimum value of k is also 3.            (2) When n = 4, there are 2 times 4 - 1 = 7 points on the circumference.            We can calculate that the associated points of }mp@subsup{A}{i}{} are }mp@subsup{A}{6}{} and }mp@subsup{A}{3}{}. Therefore, two points are \\"associated points\\" if and only if one of them is colored.            Therefore, when }mp@subsup{A}{1}{}, }mp@subsup{A}{4}{}, and }mp@subsup{A}{5}{} are colored black, no two black points are \\"associated points\\", so the coloring method with k = 3 is not \\"good\\".        When k = 4, i.e., 4 black points are colored among the 7 points, there must be two black points separated by one point, making these two black points \\"associated points\\".            Therefore, when n = 4, the minimum value of k is 4.            (3) When n = 5, there are 2 times 5 - 1 = 9 points on the circumference.            The \\"associated points\\" of }mp@subsup{A}{2}{} are }mp@subsup{A}{8}{} and }mp@subsup{A}{5}{}.            The \\"associated points\\" of }mp@subsup{A}{3}{} are }mp@subsup{A}{9}{} and }mp@subsup{A}{6}{}.            Therefore, we can divide the 9 points into three groups:                {A, , A, , , }, { }mp@subsup{A}{2}{}, }mp@subsup{A}{5}{}, }mp@subsup{A}{8}{} }, { }mp@subsup{A}{3}{}, }mp@subsup{A}{6}{}, }mp@subsup{A}{3}{} }.            If k = 3, i.e., three points are colored black, then as long as we take one point from each of the three groups, no two of these points are \\"associated points\\", so k > 3.            If four points are colored black, then there must be two black points in the same group among the three groups, making these two black points \\"associated points\\", and this coloring method is \\"good\\".            Therefore, when n = 5, the minimum value of k is 4.            From the above analysis, what can we infer?            Our conjecture is that the minimum value of k is n-1 or n. And when 2n-1 is a multiple of 3,the minimum value of k is n-1. When 2n-1 is not a multiple of 3, the minimum value of k is n.            From the analysis of n = 5, 2n-1 = 9, we also find that when 3 divides 2n-1,the indices of each \\"associated point\\" group form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3.            What is the reason for this?            Because the associated points of }mp@subsup{A}{i}{} are }mp@subsup{A}{i+n+1}{} and }mp@subsup{A}{i+n-2}{}.            Since                    (2n-1) + (n+1) = 3n,                    (2n-1) + (n-2) = 3(n-1).            This indicates that when 3 | 2n-1, the indices of each \\"associated point\\" group form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3.            The above research provides direction for our solution and the approach for solving the general case can be summarized by the approach used for simple cases.            When 3 | 2n-1, let 2n-1 = 3m (m in mp@subsup{mathbf{N}}{}{*}),            We will divide the given points into three groups based on the remainder of their indices when divided by 3, placing those with the same remainder in the same group:                S            Since 3 | n+1 and 3 | n-2, then            Therefore, each point and its two \\"associated points\\" are in the same group.            Since 2n-1 = 3m, then m is odd, so                n-2 = 3 cdot frac{m-1}{2} = 3 left[ frac{m}{2} right].        Therefore, if we color n-2 points black, such that any two black points are not \\"associated points\\",    (Coloring 3 points black is not a good coloring method.)        Additionally, if we color n-1 points black, since                n-1 = 3 left[ frac{m}{2} right] + 1,        then one of the groups mp@subsup{S}{1}{}, mp@subsup{S}{2}{}, mp@subsup{S}{s}{} must contain at least left[ left[ frac{m}{2} right] + 1 right] points.            Therefore, there must be a pair of \\"associated points\\", making this a \\"good\\" coloring method.            Thus, the minimum value of k is n-1.                When 3 nmid 2n-1, let 2n-1 = 3m pm 1, clearly m is even.                Note that    These four numbers are not multiples of 3.        Therefore, let                S = {A, j = 3k + 1, k = 0, 1, 2, cdots, n-2},    then no \\"associated points\\" of S are in S, so coloring n-1 points in S black is not a \\"good\\" coloring method. Therefore, the minimum value of k must be greater than n-1.            Below, we prove that the minimum value of k is no more than n.            In fact, if there exists a coloring method that colors n points black and is not \\"good\\", then each of these n points has two \\"uncolored\\" associated points, so there are 2n \\"uncolored\\" points in total            (including repeated counts). However, each \\"uncolored\\" point can be the \\"associated point\\" of at most two black points,            so there are at least n different \\"uncolored\\" points.                Therefore, the total number of points is n black points and at least n \\"uncolored\\" points, i.e., at least 2n points,            which contradicts the given 2n-1 points.                Therefore, coloring n points black is always \\"good\\".                So when 3 nmid 2n-1, the minimum value of k is n.\`\`\`"},{"problem":"18.

Define the Order Relation:   We define an order relation on ( n )-tuples of natural numbers ((x_1, dots, x_n)). We say ((x_1, dots, x_n) < (y_1, dots, y_n)) if either:   [   sum_{i=1}^n x_i < sum_{i=1}^n y_i   ]   or   [   sum_{i=1}^n x_i = sum_{i=1}^n y_i text{ and if } i text{ is the first index where } x_i neq y_i, text{ then } y_i < x_i.   ]2. Construct the Polynomial ( p_n ):   We claim that the function that assigns to each ((x_1, dots, x_n)) the number of ( n )-tuples smaller than it is a polynomial, denoted ( p_n ).3. Counting Tuples with Sum Constraints:   The function that counts the number of tuples ((t_1, dots, t_n)) of naturals with sum not greater than some ( k ) is a polynomial in ( k ):   [   binom{n+k}{n}   ]   Thus, the number of ordered tuples with sum less than (sum_{i=1}^n x_i) is a polynomial in the ( x_i ).4. Counting Tuples with Same Sum:   We need to count the number of ((y_1, dots, y_n)) which are smaller than ((x_1, dots, x_n)) and have the same sum. This is a sum of ( n ) functions, according to the first index in which ( y_i neq x_i ).5. Polynomial Representation:   The number of options for (forall j < i: y_j = x_j, y_i > x_i), with (sum_{i=1}^n y_i = sum_{i=1}^n x_i), is exactly the number of options to choose ( y_{i+1}, dots, y_n ) so that:   [   sum_{j=i+1}^n y_j < sum_{j=i+1}^n x_j   ]   which is a polynomial. In all, we added ( n+1 ) polynomials to get ( p_n ), so it is a polynomial. Obviously, this is a bijective polynomial.6. Composition of Polynomials:   We can compose these ( p_n ). For example, ( p_2(p_3(x,y,z),p_2(w,r)) ) is a bijective polynomial in 5 variables. We claim that all of these compositions are pairwise distinct.7. Distinct Compositions:   Assume:   [   p(*_1, *_2, dots, *_k) = p(_1, 2, dots, m)   ]   where each ( *,  ) is either a single variable or a composition of ( p_i )'s. We have ( k, m geq 2 ) because ( p_n ) is only defined for ( n geq 2 ).8. Base Case and Induction:   For each ( n ), notice that ( p_n(1,0,dots,0) = 1 ), as only ((0,0,dots,0)) is smaller than this. Similarly, ( p(0,0,dots,1,dots,0) = i ), where the 1 is in the ( i )-th spot.9. Substitution and Contradiction:   Substitute values in all variables in the equation so that the LHS is 1. Then ( *_1 = 1, *_i = 0 ) for all ( i > 1 ). The RHS is 1 too, thus (  _1 = 1,  _i = 0 ) for ( i > 1 ). By ( *_i = 0 ) for all ( i > 1 ), all variables in these polynomials must be 0. Thus, the rightmost variable in ( *_1 ) equals the rightmost variable in (  _1 ).10. Further Substitution:    Substitute variables so that both sides are 2. This implies that the rightmost variable in ( *_2 ) equals the rightmost variable in (  _2 ). Continue this until (min(m,k)).11. Equality of ( m ) and ( k ):    We now claim that ( m = k ). Assume otherwise, WLOG ( m > k ). There are two cases: ( m = k+1 ) and ( m geq k+2 ).12. Case 1: ( m geq k+2 ):    Substitute variables in the equation so that both sides are ( k+2 ). Then:    [    (_1, 2, dots, m) = (0,0,dots,1,dots,0)    ]    where the 1 is in the ( k+2 )-nd position. Also,    [    (*_1, *_2, dots, *_k) = (1,1,0,dots,0)    ]    The first equation implies that only one variable can be nonzero (the rightmost variable in (  _{k+2} )). But this is a contradiction with the second equation.13. Case 2: ( m = k+1 ):    Substitute variables in the equation so that both sides are ( k+2 ). This time we get:    [    (_1, 2, dots, m) = (2,0,dots,0)    ]    [    (*_1, *_2, dots, *_k) = (1,1,0,dots,0)    ]    As the preimage of 2 under any ( p_n ) is always ( (0,1,0,dots) ), the preimage under any composition only has one non-zero variable. Thus (  _1 ) has exactly one nonzero variable and all other variables are 0. But this is again a contradiction to the second equation.14. Conclusion:    Thus ( k = m ). As ( p_m ) is injective, we may cancel the ( p ) on each side, and by induction, we are finished (base case of only variables is obvious).15. Combinatorial Problem:    We proved that any two compositions of the ( p_n ) are distinct. We will now show that there are many ways to compose the polynomials. This will yield many bijective polynomials.16. Bracket Configurations:    This is now a combinatorial problem. Instead of writing ( p(p(., .),.) ), we'll write ( ((. .) .) ), so we erase all the ( p )'s and leave only the brackets and dots instead of variables. As there are ( n! ) ways to order the variables, we'll show that there are at least ( C(n) - C(n-1) ) distinct ways to place brackets around ( n ) dots so that:    1. There are no two pairs of brackets that are \\"the same\\" like ( ((. .)) ) (this corresponds to each polynomial having at least 2 arguments).    2. Each bracket contains at least 2 points (again, 2 arguments).    3. There also needs to be a bracket collecting everything (the outermost ( p )).17. Injective Map:    For each arrangement of ( n ) pairs of brackets, we can add ( n ) points by marking a point after every opening bracket. For example:    [    (()())()    ]    turns into:    [    (.(.)(.))(.)    ]    This will satisfy 1 automatically. To get 2, we delete all brackets containing only one point, and for 3, we add an additional big pair of brackets that surround everything. Thus:    [    (()())()    ]    turns into:    [    ((. . .).)    ]    You can check that this is an injective map from the set of legal arrangements of ( n ) pairs of brackets (of size ( C(n) )). The only problem is: if in the initial configuration there was a pair of brackets containing everything, then adding an additional pair will break 1. The number of these configurations is ( C(n-1) ) (the number of arrangements of the other ( n-1 ) brackets). Thus there are ( C(n-1) ) \\"bad\\" configurations. So at least:    [    C(n) - C(n-1)    ]    \\"good\\" bracket configurations for the original problem. This finishes the proof.The final answer is ( boxed{ n! cdot (C(n) - C(n-1)) } )"},{"problem":"* 6.

Identify the Center and Radius of the Circle:   The equation of the circle C is given by x^{2}+y^{2}-2x+4y+m=0. From this, we can deduce the center C(1,-2) by completing the square or directly using the formula for the center of a circle, which is (-g, -f) where the general form of a circle is x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. Thus, g = -(-2/2) = 1 and f = -(4/2) = -2. The radius r can be calculated using the formula r = sqrt{g^2 + f^2 - c}, which simplifies to r = sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2 - m} = sqrt{5 - m}.2. Calculate the Distance from the Center to the Line:   The distance d from the center C(1,-2) to the line l: 2x - y - 2 = 0 can be found using the formula d = frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}, where (x_1, y_1) is the point (1, -2) and a=2, b=-1, c=-2 from the line equation. Substituting these values, we get d = frac{|2cdot1 + (-1)cdot(-2) - 2|}{sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{5}} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}.3. Relate the Distance, Radius, and the Length of the Line Segment:   The length of the line segment formed by the intersection of the line and the circle is twice the square root of the difference between the square of the radius and the square of the distance from the center to the line, i.e., 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2}. Substituting r = sqrt{5 - m} and d = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}, we get 2sqrt{5 - m - left(frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}right)^2} = 2sqrt{5 - m - frac{4}{5}}.4. Solve for m:   Given that the length of the line segment is frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}, we equate 2sqrt{5 - m - frac{4}{5}} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5} and solve for m. Squaring both sides and simplifying, we find that m = 4.Therefore, the value of m that satisfies the given conditions is boxed{4}, which corresponds to choice boxed{B}."},{"problem":"If the complex number z satisfies the equation 3z + bar{z} = 1 + i, find the value of |z|.","solution":"Let z = a + bi, then bar{z} = a - bi.

On a flat plane in Camelot, King Arthur builds a labyrinth mathfrak{L} consisting of n walls, each of which is an infinite straight line. No two walls are parallel, and no three walls have a common point. Merlin then paints one side of each wall entirely red and the other side entirely blue.At the intersection of two walls there are four comers: two diagonally opposite corners where a red side and a blue side meet, one corner where two red sides meet, and one corner where two blue sides meet. At each such intersection, there is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners at which sides of different colours meet.After Merlin paints the walls, Morgana then places some knights in the labyrinth. The knights can walk through doors, but cannot walk through walls.Let k(mathfrak{L}) be the largest number k such that, no matter how Merlin paints the labyrinth mathfrak{L}, Morgana can always place at least k knights such that no two of them can ever meet. For each n, what are all possible values for k(mathfrak{L}), where mathfrak{L} is a labyrinth with n walls?","solution":"Answer: The only possible value of k is k=n+1, no matter what shape the labyrinth is.Solution 1. First we show by induction that the n walls divide the plane into binom{n+1}{2}+1 regions. The claim is true for n=0 as, when there are no walls, the plane forms a single region. When placing the n^{text {th }} wall, it intersects each of the n-1 other walls exactly once and hence splits each of n of the regions formed by those other walls into two regions. By the induction hypothesis, this yields left(binom{n}{2}+1right)+n-binom{n+1}{2}+1 regions, proving the claim.Now let G be the graph with vertices given by the binom{n+1}{2}+1 regions, and with two regions connected by an edge if there is a door between them.We now show that no matter how Merlin paints the n walls, Morgana can place at least n+1 knights. No matter how the walls are painted, there are exactly binom{n}{2} intersection points, each of which corresponds to a single edge in G. Consider adding the edges of G sequentially and note that each edge reduces the number of connected components by at most one. Therefore the number of connected components of mathrm{G} is at least binom{n+1}{2}+1-binom{n}{2}-n+1. If Morgana places a knight in regions corresponding to different connected components of G, then no two knights can ever meet.Now we give a construction showing that, no matter what shape the labyrinth is, Merlin can colour it such that there are exactly n+1 connected components, allowing Morgana to place at most n+1 knights.First, we choose a coordinate system on the labyrinth so that none of the walls run due north-south, or due east-west. We then have Merlin paint the west face of each wall red, and the east face of each wall blue. We label the regions according to how many walls the region is on the east side of: the labels are integers between 0 and n.We claim that, for each i, the regions labelled i are connected by doors. First, we note that for each i with 0 leqslant i leqslant n there is a unique region labelled i which is unbounded to the north.Now, consider a knight placed in some region with label i, and ask them to walk north (moving east or west by following the walls on the northern sides of regions, as needed). This knight will never get stuck: each region is convex, and so, if it is bounded to the north, it has a single northernmost vertex with a door northwards to another region with label i.Eventually it will reach a region which is unbounded to the north, which will be the unique such region with label i. Hence every region with label i is connected to this particular region, and so all regions with label i are connected to each other.As a result, there are exactly n+1 connected components, and Morgana can place at most n+1 knights.Comment. Variations on this argument exist: some of them capture more information, and some of them capture less information, about the connected components according to this system of numbering.For example, it can be shown that the unbounded regions are numbered 0,1, ldots, n-1, n, n-1, ldots, 1 as one cycles around them, that the regions labelled 0 and n are the only regions in their connected components, and that each other connected component forms a single chain running between the two unbounded ones. It is also possible to argue that the regions are acyclic without revealing much about their structure.Solution 2. We give another description of a strategy for Merlin to paint the walls so that Morgana can place no more than n+1 knights.Merlin starts by building a labyrinth of n walls of his own design. He places walls in turn with increasing positive gradients, placing each so far to the right that all intersection points of previously-placed lines lie to the left of it. He paints each in such a way that blue is on the left and red is on the right.For example, here is a possible sequence of four such lines ell_{1}, ell_{2}, ell_{3}, ell_{4} :We say that a region is \\"on the right\\" if it has x-coordinate unbounded above (note that if we only have one wall, then both regions are on the right). We claim inductively that, after placing n lines, there are n+1 connected components in the resulting labyrinth, each of which contains exactly one region on the right. This is certainly true after placing 0 lines, as then there is only one region (and hence one connected component) and it is on the right.When placing the n^{text {th }} line, it then cuts every one of the n-1 previously placed lines, and since it is to the right of all intersection points, the regions it cuts are exactly the n regions on the right.The addition of this line leaves all previous connected components with exactly one region on the right, and creates a new connected component containing exactly one region, and that region is also on the right. As a result, by induction, this particular labyrinth will have n+1 connected components.Having built this labyrinth, Merlin then moves the walls one-by-one (by a sequence of continuous translations and rotations of lines) into the proper position of the given labyrinth, in such a way that no two lines ever become parallel.The only time the configuration is changed is when one wall is moved through an intersection point of two others:Note that all moves really do switch between two configurations like this: all sets of three lines have this colour configuration initially, and the rules on rotations mean they are preserved (in particular, we cannot create three lines creating a triangle with three red edges inwards, or three blue edges inwards).However, as can be seen, such a move preserves the number of connected components, so in the painting this provides for Arthur's actual labyrinth, Morgana can still only place at most n+1 knights.Comment. While these constructions are superficially distinct, they in fact result in the same colourings for any particular labyrinth. In fact, using the methods of Solution 2, it is possible to show that these are the only colourings that result in exactly n+1 connected components."},{"problem":"Given that f(i,k)=i⋅2^{(k-1)} where i in mathbb{N}^*, k in mathbb{N}^*, and for example, f(2,3)=2×2^{(3-1)}=8.

Thus {0, 1/n, 2/n, ... , 1998/n} has m+1 integers, and {1/n, 2/n, ... , 1999/n} has m integers. So we are ok until n gets so large that the gap between [1998/n] and [1998/(n+1)] is 3 or more. This could happen for 1998/n - 1998/(n+1) just over 2 or n > 31. So checking, we find [1998/31] = 64, [1998/30] = 66, [1998/29] = 68, [1998/28] = 71. We can get 68 integers with {1/29, 2/29, ... , 1999/29} and 69 with {0, 1/29, 2/29, ... , 1998/29}. We can get 71 with {1/28, 2/28, ... , 1999/28}, but we cannot get 70. Note that a progression with irrational difference gives at most 1 integer. A progression with difference a/b, where a and b are coprime integers, gives the same number of integers as a progression with difference 1/b.

Given a right triangle Delta ABC with legs a and b, and hypotenuse c, we need to find the image of the function f(Delta ABC) = frac{h}{r}, where h is the height with respect to the hypotenuse and r is the radius of the inscribed circle.2. The height h with respect to the hypotenuse c can be expressed as:   [   h = frac{ab}{c}   ]   This follows from the area of the triangle, which can be written as frac{1}{2}ab and also as frac{1}{2}ch.

Therefore, points A and B lie on the circle with diameter OP, meaning AB is a common chord of circle O and circle C. The coordinates of the center of circle C are left( dfrac {9-2m}{2}, dfrac {m}{2}right), and the square of the radius is r^{2}= dfrac {(9-2m)^{2}+m^{2}}{4}.

Initial Observation: Note that none of the ( n_i ) equals 0, since taking ( k ) large gives ( prod_{i=1}^s (n_i + k) > 0 ), hence not a multiple of 0. Part (a)2.

Contradiction: Since ( |n_i| ge 2 ), we have ( n_i^2 - 1 < n_i^2 ) for each ( i ). Thus:   [   prod_{i=1}^s (n_i^2 - 1) < prod_{i=1}^s n_i^2   ]   This is a contradiction.

Since gear C makes 160 turns while gear D makes 1007 turns and gear E makes 38 turns, a similar reasoning to that used in item a) shows that:160 N_{C}=1007 N_{D}=38 N_{E}Thus, the following equations hold:begin{aligned}& 160 N_{C}=1007 N_{D} & 160 N_{C}=38 N_{E}end{aligned}Decomposing into prime factors, we find that 38=2 times 19, 160=2^{5} times 5, and 1007=19 times 53. Thus, the first equation above gives us that:2^{5} cdot 5 cdot N_{C}=19 cdot 53 cdot N_{D}From this first equation, we see that N_{C} must be a multiple of 19 cdot 53 because these prime factors appear on the right side of the equation but not in the term 2^{5} cdot 5. Similarly, N_{D} must be a multiple of 2^{5} cdot 5. The smallest numbers that satisfy these conditions are N_{C}=19 cdot 53 and N_{D}=2^{5} cdot 5.Substituting these values into the second equation, we get:2^{5} cdot 5 cdot 19 cdot 53=2 cdot 19 cdot N_{E}which gives us N_{E}=2^{4} cdot 5 cdot 53.Thus, the smallest number of teeth of gears C, D, and E are 1007, 160, and 4240, respectively, with the smallest total sum being 5407."},{"problem":"Given the following propositions: ① int_{b}^{a} text{dx} = int_{a}^{b} text{dt} = b-a (where a, b are constants and a < b); ② int_{-1}^{0} x^2 text{dx} = int_{0}^{1} x^2 text{dx}; ③ The sum of the areas of the two enclosed regions formed by the curve y=sin x, x in [0, 2pi] and the line y=0 is 2.

Moreover, since their product is even, they must both be even.In the appropriate divisor pair, one factor is equal to left(x^{3}+yright) and the other to left(x^{3}-yright), so their difference is 2 y. The following table provides the possible values of y, and from there, the possible values of |x|. Where we get an integer for |x|, the corresponding x, y pairs satisfy the equation.| x^{3}+y | x^{3}-y | left(x^{3}+yright)-left(x^{3}-yright)=2 y | y | x^{6}=648+y^{2} | |x| || ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: || 324 | 2 | 322 | 161 | 26569 | not an integer || 2 | 324 | -322 | -161 | 26569 | not an integer || 162 | 4 | 158 | 79 | 6889 | not an integer || 4 | 162 | -158 | -79 | 6889 | not an integer || 108 | 6 | 102 | 51 | 3249 | not an integer || 6 | 108 | -102 | -51 | 3249 | not an integer || 54 | 12 | 42 | 21 | 1089 | not an integer || 12 | 54 | -42 | -21 | 1089 | not an integer || 36 | 18 | 18 | 9 | 729 | 3 || 18 | 36 | -18 | -9 | 729 | 3 |Thus, the solutions to the equation are: x_{1}=3, y_{1}=9 ; x_{2}=-3, y_{2}=9 ; x_{3}=3, y_{3}=-9 ; x_{4}=-3, y_{4}=-9.II. Solution. Since x and y appear in even powers, if (x ; y) is a solution pair, then (-x ; y),(-x ;-y),(x ;-y) are also solutions.Since 648 is even, x^{6} and y^{2} must have the same parity.First, assume that both x and y are even. Then x=2 n, y=2 m.begin{aligned}(2 n)^{6}-(2 m)^{2} & =648 2^{6} n^{6}-2^{2} m^{2} & =2^{3} cdot 3^{4} 2^{4} n^{6}-m^{2} & =2 cdot 3^{4}end{aligned}m can only be even, since 2^{4} n^{6} and 2 cdot 3^{4} are both even. Thus, m^{2} is divisible by 4, so the left side is divisible by 4, but the right side is not. Therefore, there is no solution in this case.Now consider the case where both x and y are odd. The squares of odd numbers can only end in 1, 5, or 9. Therefore, the last digit of x^{6} must be 9, and the last digit of y^{2} must be 1, because only the difference of numbers ending in these digits can result in the last 8 of 648. Thus, neither x nor y can end in 5.Determine the minimum and maximum values of |x|. From the above, |x| geq 3. Since x^{6} is a square, it is worth examining the difference of two squares. The difference between the squares of consecutive integers continuously increases as the numbers increase. If we are looking for the maximum value of |x|, we can proceed as follows:a^{2}-(a-1)^{2} leq 648from which a leq 324.5. In this case, a=x^{3}, so |x| leq 6.87.According to the above, |x| is odd, cannot be 5, so it can only be 3. In this case, from the equation3^{6}-y^{2}=648we get |y|=9.Thus, the pairs(3 ; 9), quad(-3 ; 9), quad(-3 ;-9) quad text { and } quad(3 ;-9)satisfy the equality.Remark.

Then the given Diophantine equation can be transformed into c + zb^2 + z^2 = z^2cb. Therefore, there exists some integer a such that c = za.

Answer. 1000.Suppose that so many strings have been torn that the net has not yet split into pieces, but no more strings can be torn. This means that there are no closed loops of strings left in the net. Prove that in this case, the number of unbroken strings is one less than the total number of nodes (including nodes located on the edges and at the corners of the net).This can be verified, for example, as follows. Fix some node A. From it, you can travel along the unbroken strings to any other node B. Correspond to each node B of the net the last string on the path leading from A to B. This path is uniquely determined because there are no closed paths of strings. Therefore, the correspondence between the remaining strings and nodes B (different from A) is one-to-one. Thus, the number of strings left is one less than the total number of nodes in the net, which, as is easy to calculate, is 1111. The total number of strings in the new unbroken net is 2110. Therefore, to leave 1110 strings, 1000 must be torn.An example where 1000 strings are torn and the net has not yet split into pieces is easy to provide. For instance, you can tear all the horizontal strings in all rows except the top one.

According to the condition, 2(b-a)=c-b or 3b=c+2a. Considering (1), c=-5b, a=4b. Substituting into (2): -5b^{2}+4b^{2}-20b^{2}=-84, from which we find b^{2}=4.

Euler's Totient Function:   - Euler's totient function (phi(n)) counts the number of integers up to ( n ) that are coprime with ( n ).   - It is given by:     [     phi(n) = n left(1 - frac{1}{p_1}right) left(1 - frac{1}{p_2}right) cdots left(1 - frac{1}{p_k}right)     ]     where ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) are the distinct prime factors of ( n ).3.

From the equality of angles: angle CBM = angle ABP, it follows that angle PBP' = angle ABC = 60^circ, and therefore triangle PBP' is equilateral (since PB = BP'). Hence, PP' = PB = 3. Furthermore, triangle PAB = triangle P'CB (since AB = BC, PB = P'B, and angle ABP = angle CBP').Therefore, P'C = PA = 2.

From this, we can determine that a = b = sqrt{2}, and the equations of the asymptotes are y = pm x.Firstly, if line l is vertical (undefined slope), we can set x = t. This gives us points A(t, t) and B(t, -t), and their midpoint is (t, 0). Substituting into the hyperbola's equation yields t = pm sqrt{2}.The area of the right-angled triangle triangle AOB is obtained by the formula for the area of a triangle:text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}Substitute the base and height with the coordinates of points A and B:text{Area} = frac{1}{2} cdot sqrt{2} cdot 2 sqrt{2} = 2Secondly, if line l has a defined slope, let the equation of l be y = kx + m. Substituting into the equation of the asymptotes gives coordinates Aleft(frac{m}{1-k}, frac{m}{1-k}right) and Bleft(-frac{m}{1+k}, frac{m}{1+k}right). Calculating the midpoint of AB we obtain left(frac{km}{1-k^2}, frac{m}{1-k^2}right). Substituting into the hyperbola's equation gives m^2 = 2(1 - k^2). By the condition that A and B lie on the same side of the y-axis, we have frac{m^2}{k^2 - 1} > 0. Equation frac{m^2}{k^2 - 1} > 0 evidently contradicts the previous equation m^2 = 2(1 - k^2) since the signs do not match.Thus, the only possible scenario for the midpoint of AB to lie on the hyperbola is when l has an undefined slope, which results in triangle AOB having an area ofboxed{2}."},{"problem":"Let n be an integer with n geqslant 2. On a slope of a mountain, n^{2} checkpoints are marked, numbered from 1 to n^{2} from the bottom to the top. Each of two cable car companies, A and B, operates k cable cars numbered from 1 to k; each cable car provides a transfer from some checkpoint to a higher one. For each company, and for any i and j with 1 leqslant i<j leqslant k, the starting point of car j is higher than the starting point of car i; similarly, the finishing point of car j is higher than the finishing point of car i. Say that two checkpoints are linked by some company if one can start from the lower checkpoint and reach the higher one by using one or more cars of that company (no movement on foot is allowed). Determine the smallest k for which one can guarantee that there are two checkpoints that are linked by each of the two companies. (India) Answer: k=n^{2}-n+1.","solution":"We start with showing that for any k leqslant n^{2}-n there may be no pair of checkpoints linked by both companies. Clearly, it suffices to provide such an example for k=n^{2}-n. Let company A connect the pairs of checkpoints of the form (i, i+1), where n nmid i. Then all pairs of checkpoints (i, j) linked by A satisfy lceil i / nrceil=lceil j / nrceil. Let company B connect the pairs of the form (i, i+n), where 1 leqslant i leqslant n^{2}-n. Then pairs of checkpoints (i, j) linked by B satisfy i equiv j(bmod n). Clearly, no pair (i, j) satisfies both conditions, so there is no pair linked by both companies. Now we show that for k=n^{2}-n+1 there always exist two required checkpoints. Define an A-chain as a sequence of checkpoints a_{1}<a_{2}<ldots<a_{t} such that company A connects a_{i} with a_{i+1} for all 1 leqslant i leqslant t-1, but there is no A-car transferring from some checkpoint to a_{1} and no A-car transferring from a_{t} to any other checkpoint. Define B-chains similarly. Moving forth and back, one easily sees that any checkpoint is included in a unique A-chain (possibly consisting of that single checkpoint), as well as in a unique B-chain. Now, put each checkpoint into a correspondence to the pair of the A-chain and the B-chain it belongs to. All finishing points of A-cars are distinct, so there are n^{2}-k=n-1 checkpoints that are not such finishing points. Each of them is a starting point of a unique A-chain, so the number of A-chains is n-1. Similarly, the number of B-chains also equals n-1. Hence, there are (n-1)^{2} pairs consisting of an A- and a B-chain. Therefore, two of the n^{2} checkpoints correspond to the same pair, so that they belong to the same A-chain, as well as to the same B-chain. This means that they are linked by both companies, as required. Comment 1. The condition that the i^{text {th }} car starts and finishes lower than the j^{text {th }} one is used only in the \\"moving forth and back\\" argument and in the counting of starting points of the chains. In both cases, the following weaker assumption suffices: No two cars of the same company start at the same checkpoint, and no two such cars finish at the same checkpoint. Thus, the problem conditions could be weakened in this way, with no affect on the solution. Comment 2. If the number of checkpoints were N, then the answer would be N-lceilsqrt{N}rceil+1.

If he had no sons, the land went to the state. No other members of the family gained or lost any land in any other way. In total, there were 120 people in the family. What is the smallest fraction of the original plot that any member of the family could have received?Answer: frac{1}{2 cdot 3^{39}}","solution":"Solution: Consider the person with the smallest share. Let his father have a_{1} sons, his grandfather a_{2}, and so on up to the founder of the lineage, who had a_{n}. Then the share of this person is frac{1}{a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{n}}, and we know that a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{n} does not exceed 119 (since the founder of the lineage is definitely not included in this sum).Thus, we are looking for a set of numbers with a sum not exceeding 119 and the maximum product. We will prove that any set, except for the set consisting of 39 threes and one two, does not have the maximum product, as it can be increased.First, if the sum of the numbers in the set is less than 119, add another number to make it equal to 119. The product will not decrease.Second, suppose there is a number a geqslant 4 in our set. Replace a with a pair of numbers b and c greater than one, such that b+c=a. We will prove that b c geqslant b+c. Indeed, b c-b-c=(b-1)(c-1)-1, which is non-negative for b and c greater than one.Third, if there is a number 1 in the set, we can replace any number a and 1 with a+1, thereby increasing the product of these numbers by 1.Thus, any set can be transformed into a set of twos and threes without decreasing the product of its numbers.Furthermore, if there are at least three twos, their product is 8. If we replace three twos with two threes, the sum of the numbers does not change, but the product becomes 9, which is again an increase. Thus, we can ensure that the number of twos is no more than two.Since 119=39 cdot 3+2, the final set will have exactly one two.Therefore, any set of natural numbers with a sum not exceeding 119 can be transformed into a set of 39 threes and one two, and the product of the numbers in the set will not decrease. This means that the final set has the largest product, equal to 3^{39} cdot 2, which gives us the smallest inheritance share as the reciprocal of this number.## 11th Grade3rd Variant"},{"problem":"1.

If the initial number on the board is 2022, what is the largest composite number that [i]Neymar[/i] will never be able to write on the blackboard?","solution":"1. Initial Setup: We start with the number ( n = 2022 ) on the blackboard. Neymar can choose any divisor ( d > 1 ) of ( n ), erase ( n ), and write ( n + d ) instead.2. Objective: We need to determine the largest composite number that Neymar will never be able to write on the blackboard.3. Key Insight: If Neymar can write a number ( n ) on the board, he can also write ( n + d ) for any divisor ( d > 1 ) of ( n ). This means that starting from 2022, Neymar can generate a sequence of numbers by repeatedly adding divisors of the current number.4. Range Analysis: We need to check the numbers between 2022 and some upper bound to find the largest composite number that cannot be written. Let's consider the number 2033.5. Divisors and Additions:   - The divisors of 2022 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 337, 674, 1011, and 2022.   - By adding these divisors to 2022, we get the numbers: 2024, 2025, 2028, 2029, 2359, 2696, 3033, and 4044.6. Checking 2033:   - To see if 2033 can be written, we need to check if it can be obtained by adding a divisor of some number previously written on the board.   - The divisors of 2033 are 1, 7, 17, 119, 289, and 2033.   - None of these divisors, when added to any number previously written (2022, 2024, 2025, 2028, 2029, 2359, 2696, 3033, 4044), result in 2033.7. Contradiction and Conclusion:   - Suppose there exists a composite number ( n > 2065 ) that cannot be written on the board. Let ( p ) be a prime divisor of ( n ). Since ( n ) and ( p ) are odd, ( n - p ) is even.   - If ( n - p ) were greater than 2022, then ( n ) could be written. Hence, ( 2065 < n < 2022 + p Rightarrow p > 43 Rightarrow p geq 47 ).   - Let ( q ) be another prime divisor of ( n ).

If n>49, then n is at least 7 times 41, while the average pirate has 7 coins, so the initial division is impossible. So, we can have n=7, n=41 or n=49. Each of these cases is possible (e.g. if n=49, the average pirate has 41 coins, so the initial amounts are from 41-24=17 to 41+24=65 ).If n is even, then 2009 is multiple of the sum S of the oldest and the youngest pirate. If S<7 times 41, then S is at most 39 and the pairs of pirates of sum S is at least 41 , so we must have at least 82 pirates, a contradiction. So we can have just S=7 times 41=287 and S=49 times 41=2009; respectively, n=2 times 7=14 or n=2 times 1=2.

In total, n is one of the numbers 2,7,13,41 and 49 .b) If n=7, the average pirate has 7 times 41=287 coins, so the initial amounts are from 284 to 290; they have different residues modulo 7.

Let ( j ) be the number of children in the Judo class, ( a ) be the number of children in the Agriculture class, and ( m ) be the number of children in the Math class. We know that:   [   j + a + m = 32   ]   This equation represents the total number of children in the kindergarten.2. The teacher gathered 6 children to clean up the classroom. According to the problem, exactly (frac{1}{2}) of the Judo students, (frac{1}{4}) of the Agriculture students, and (frac{1}{8}) of the Math students are cleaning. Therefore, we have:   [   frac{j}{2} + frac{a}{4} + frac{m}{8} = 6   ]3. To simplify the second equation, we can multiply through by 8 to clear the denominators:   [   4j + 2a + m = 48   ]4.

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate ( m ):   [   (4j + 2a + m) - (j + a + m) = 48 - 32   ]   Simplifying this, we get:   [   3j + a = 16   ]6.

Then T subseteq S,|T|=15, and all elements in T are pairwise relatively prime; however, T contains no prime number. Thus k geq 16.

Since a full circle rotation equals 360^{circ}, we can rewrite the angle as -1500^{circ} = -4 times 360^{circ} - 60^{circ}.Now, we can apply the cosine function to the simplified angle:cos(-1500^{circ}) = cos(-4 times 360^{circ} - 60^{circ})Since cosine function is periodic with a period of 360^{circ}, we can eliminate the full rotations, resulting in:cos(-1500^{circ}) = cos(-60^{circ})Using the property that cosine is an even function, i.e., cos(-theta) = cos(theta), we have:cos(-1500^{circ}) = cos(60^{circ})Finally, evaluating cos(60^{circ}) gives us the result of dfrac{1}{2}.

Given that x > 0, we can transform the original inequality into frac{ln x - 1}{x} leq a.2. Define a function f(x) = frac{ln x - 1}{x}.3. To find the critical points of f(x), we compute its derivative: f'(x) = frac{1 - ln x}{x^2}.4. Simplifying the derivative, we get f'(x) = frac{2 - ln x}{x^2}.5. Analyzing the sign of f'(x):   - When x in (0, e^2), f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is increasing.   - When x in (e^2, +infty), f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is decreasing.6. Therefore, f(x) reaches its maximum at x = e^2, and the maximum value is f(e^2) = frac{1}{e^2}.7. Consequently, to satisfy the inequality, a geq frac{1}{e^2}.Method 2: Tangency Condition1. The line y = ax + 1 must be tangent to the curve y = ln x for the minimum value of a.2. The slope of the tangent line at the point of tangency (x_0, ln x_0) is frac{1}{x_0}.3. The equation of the tangent line is y - ln x_0 = frac{1}{x_0}(x - x_0).4. Since the line passes through (0,1), substituting gives 1 - ln x_0 = -frac{x_0}{x_0}.5. Solving the equation, we find x_0 = e^2, and thus the slope of the tangent line, which is equal to a, is frac{1}{e^2}.In both methods, we conclude that the minimum value of a is frac{1}{e^2}.

Identify the given elements and relationships:   - We have a rhombus (ABCD).   - A point (M) is chosen on side (BC).   - Lines through (M) perpendicular to (BD) and (AC) meet line (AD) at points (P) and (Q) respectively.   - Lines (PB), (QC), and (AM) are concurrent at a point (R).2. Use the concurrency condition:   - Suppose (PB), (QC), and (AM) concur at (R).   - By the properties of the rhombus and the given conditions, we need to find the ratio (frac{BM}{MC}).3. Relate the segments using the properties of the rhombus:   - Since (P) and (Q) are on (AD) and the lines through (M) are perpendicular to (BD) and (AC), we can use the properties of perpendiculars and the symmetry of the rhombus.   - Let (frac{BM}{MC} = x).4. Use the properties of the parallelogram:   - In the rhombus, diagonals (AC) and (BD) bisect each other at right angles.   - Since (APMC) is a parallelogram, (PA = MC).   - Similarly, in parallelogram (BMQD), (BM = DQ).5. Set up the ratio using the concurrency condition:   - Given that (PB), (QC), and (AM) are concurrent, we can use the fact that the ratio of segments created by the concurrency point is equal.   - Therefore, (frac{BM}{MC} = frac{PA}{AQ}).6.

In the triangle CED, we have frac {ED}{CD} = cos EDC = cos 60^circ = frac 12. Hence ED = CD/2.By the definition of D, we also have BD=CD/2, therefore BD=DE.

Then we compute angle ABE = 45^circ - 30^circ = 15^circ, thus angle ABE = angle BAE and the triangle ABE is isosceles as well.

From the conditions given, we have the system of equations:      begin{cases}   f(a) + f(b) = 1    f(a) - f(b) = 2   end{cases}      Solving for f(a) and f(b), we obtain f(a) = frac{3}{2} and f(b) = -frac{1}{2}.3. Let -1  0, so frac{x_1 - x_2}{1 - x_1x_2}  0   end{aligned}      This indicates that f(x) is a decreasing function on (-1,1).   Since fleft( -frac{1}{2} right) = 1, we also have fleft( frac{1}{2} right) = -1.   The original equation then becomes 2f(x) = -1 which leads to f(x) + f(x) = fleft( frac{2x}{1+x^2} right) = fleft( frac{1}{2} right).   Hence, frac{2x}{1+x^2} = frac{1}{2}, or x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0. The solutions to this quadratic equation are x = 2 pm sqrt{3}.   However, since x in (-1,1), we must take x = 2 - sqrt{3}.

Let x be the speed of the turtle, and y be the speed of the first lion cub. Then the speed of the second lion cub is 1.5 y. The entire path to the watering hole for the first lion cub is 6 y, and for the turtle, it is 32 x. Therefore, the initial distance between them was 6 y - 32 x, and the first incident occurred after (6 y - 32 x) / (y - x) minutes. The second incident occurred after 32 x / (x + 1.5 y) minutes. Therefore,frac{32 x}{x + 1.5 y} - frac{6 y - 32 x}{y - x} = 2.4 text{, from which } 2.4 x^2 + 75.2 x y - 12.6 y^2 = 0or 63(y / x)^2 - 376(y / x) - 12 = 0.

During this time, it was carried downstream by 36 meters. After resting and gathering strength, it returned to the same point along the same straight line, but this time fighting the current, in 10 seconds. How many seconds would it take for the crocodile to swim the same distance in still water? Round the answer to the nearest hundredth.## Answer: 7.34Solution. We will provide a general solution for the following problem statement.A crocodile swam across a river a meters wide in a straight line in t seconds. During this time, it was carried downstream by b meters. After resting and gathering strength, it returned to the same point along the same straight line, but this time fighting the current, in T seconds. How many seconds would it take for the crocodile to swim the same distance in still water? Round the answer to the nearest hundredth.In this formulation, the required time is sqrt{a^2 + b^2} / v, where v is the speed of the crocodile in still water. The longitudinal and transverse components of the speed are u_1 = b / t, w_1 = a / t in the first case and u_2 = b / T, w_2 = a / T in the second case. The above longitudinal components of the speed were obtained as the sum or difference of the longitudinal component of the crocodile's own speed and the speed of the current. The transverse and longitudinal components of the crocodile's own speed can differ in the first and second cases, but in each case, the sum of their squares is equal to v^2. Let u be the speed of the current. Then we have the systemleft{begin{array}{l}left(u_1 - uright)^2 + w_1^2 = v^2 left(u_2 + uright)^2 + w_2^2 = v^2end{array}right.Subtracting these equations, we get the equation from which we can find the speed of the current:u = frac{w_1^2 - w_2^2 + u_1^2 - u_2^2}{2(u_1 + u_2)} = frac{a^2left(frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{T^2}right) + b^2left(frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{T^2}right)}{2 bleft(frac{1}{t} + frac{1}{T}right)} = frac{(a^2 + b^2)(T - t)}{2 b T t}After this, we can find the square of the crocodile's own speed:begin{array}{r}v^2 = left(frac{b}{T} + frac{(a^2 + b^2)(T - t)}{2 b T t}right)^2 + left(frac{a}{T}right)^2 = frac{(2 b^2 t + (a^2 + b^2)(T - t))^2 + 4 a^2 b^2 t^2}{(2 b T t)^2} = = frac{4 a^2 b^2 t^2 + 4 b^4 t^2 + (a^2 + b^2)^2(T - t)^2 + 4 b^2 t(a^2 + b^2)(T - t)}{(2 b T t)^2} = = frac{(a^2 + b^2)}{(2 b T t)^2}(4 b^2 t^2 + 4 b^2 t(T - t) + (a^2 + b^2)(T - t)^2)end{array}and then the required time:sqrt{frac{a^2 + b^2}{v^2}} = frac{2 b T t}{sqrt{4 b^2 t^2 + 4 b^2 t(T - t) + (a^2 + b^2)(T - t)^2}}## B-6A crocodile swam across a river 30 meters wide in a straight line in 6 seconds.

This is because the suspension of bacteria in the counting chamber has a certain height (0.1mm), and it is necessary to allow the cells to settle to the grid lines at the bottom of the counting chamber to avoid missing cells distributed at different depths of the liquid layer during counting, so ⑤ is correct.  Therefore, the correct operations are ①④⑤.  Hence, the answer is: boxed{D}.  Analysis: The principle of the experiment to explore the dynamic changes in the population of yeast in the culture medium:  (1) Yeast can be cultured in a liquid culture medium. The growth of the yeast population in the culture medium is related to the components, space, pH, temperature, and other factors of the culture medium. We can plot a curve with the number of yeast in the culture medium and time as the axes to understand the changes in the yeast population.  (2) Using a hemocytometer to count cells under a microscope is a common cell counting method. This method can directly determine the total number of cells in a sample, so it is generally used for counting the number of single-cell microorganisms. Since the volume of the counting chamber of the hemocytometer is fixed after covering with a cover slip, the total number of cells per unit volume can be calculated based on the number of cells observed under the microscope."},{"problem":"## Task 7 / 84A man says: \\"The birth year of my grandson is the product x y of two natural numbers x and y.

Since the length of the segment intercepted by circle C is 4sqrt{3}, the distance from line l to the center of the circle is 2.  When the slope of the line exists, let the slope of L be k, passing through P(0, 5), let the equation of line l be y=kx+5, i.e., kx-y+5=0;  Since the distance from line l to the center of circle C is 2, we have d= frac{|-2k-6+5|}{sqrt{k^2+1}}=2, solving this gives k= frac{3}{4}, thus the equation of the line is 3x-4y+20=0;  When the slope of the line does not exist, the equation of the line is x=0, which also meets the requirements.

Extend the hexagon A B C D E F to a rectangle A B M F (see Fig. a). We use the fact that any line passing through the center of symmetry of a figure divides it into two equal parts.

From the above, we know that \\"m=-1\\" leads to the lines mx+(2m-1)y+1=0 and 3x+my+3=0 being perpendicular;  From the condition that the lines mx+(2m-1)y+1=0 and 3x+my+3=0 are perpendicular, we can deduce m=-1 or m=0,  Therefore, m=-1 is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the lines mx+(2m-1)y+1=0 and 3x+my+3=0 to be perpendicular.  Hence, the answer is: sufficient condition.  Based on the given conditions, this problem can be studied in two steps: first, investigate whether the lines mx+(2m-1)y+1=0 and 3x+my+3=0 being perpendicular when m=-1 holds, and then explore the possible values of m when the lines mx+(2m-1)y+1=0 and 3x+my+3=0 are perpendicular. Finally, make a judgment based on the definitions of sufficient and necessary conditions to arrive at the answer.  This problem examines the judgment of sufficient and necessary conditions and the condition for two lines to be perpendicular. The key to solving the problem is understanding the definitions of sufficient and necessary conditions and the condition for two lines to be perpendicular. The difficulty in this problem lies in deducing the value of the parameter m from the condition that the two lines are perpendicular. This is also a common mistake, as it's easy to forget to verify the case where the slope does not exist, leading to erroneous judgments.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{sufficient condition}}."},{"problem":"Let f(x)= frac {1+x}{1-x}, and denote f_{1}(x)=f(x), f_{k+1}(x)=f(f_{k}(x)), where k=1, 2, …, then f_{2012}(x)= 　　()A:  frac {1+x}{1-x}B:  frac {x-1}{x+1}C: xD: - frac {1}{x}","solution":"From the problem, we know  because f_{1}(x)=f(x), f_{k+1}(x)=f(f_{k}(x)), where k=1, 2, …,  therefore f_{1}(x)=f(x),   f_{2}(x)=f(f_{1}(x))=- frac {1}{x};   f_{3}(x)=f(f_{2}(x))= frac {x-1}{x+1};   f_{4}(x)=f(f_{3}(x))=x;   f_{5}(x)=f(f_{4}(x))= frac {1+x}{1-x};  …  We can induce a pattern: f_{k}(x) is a periodic sequence with period T=4,  therefore f_{2012}(x)=f_{4}(x)=x,  Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{C}.

We start with the function ( f(n) = n^2 + 6n + 11 ) and need to find the sum of the first three prime values it takes on.2. The smallest possible value of ( f(n) ) is when ( n = 1 ):   [   f(1) = 1^2 + 6 cdot 1 + 11 = 1 + 6 + 11 = 18   ]   Since 18 is not a prime number, we need to find other values of ( n ) for which ( f(n) ) is prime.3. To determine when ( f(n) ) is prime, we consider the congruence properties of ( f(n) ). Note that:   [   f(n) = n^2 + 6n + 11 equiv n^2 + 6n + 11 pmod{6}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   f(n) equiv n^2 + 0 + 5 equiv n^2 + 5 pmod{6}   ]   For ( f(n) ) to be prime, ( f(n) equiv pm 1 pmod{6} ). Thus:   [   n^2 + 5 equiv pm 1 pmod{6}   ]   This implies:   [   n^2 equiv -4 pmod{6} quad text{or} quad n^2 equiv 2 pmod{6}   ]   Since 2 is not a quadratic residue modulo 6, we only consider:   [   n^2 equiv 0 pmod{6}   ]   Therefore, ( n ) must be divisible by 6.4.
