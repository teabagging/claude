First solution. Let O be the center of the main square K, and O_{1} and O_{2} be the centers of the non-overlapping squares K_{1} and K_{2} attached to it (Fig. 135, a). Since the smallest distance from the center of a unit square to its boundary is frac{1}{2}, the segments O O_{1}, O O_{2}, and O_{1} O_{2} are not less than 1. Furthermore, since the squares K and K_{1} touch at some point A, we have O O_{1} leqslant O A + O_{1} A leqslant sqrt{2} (since the greatest distance from the center of a unit square to its boundary is frac{sqrt{2}}{2}). Therefore, the points O_{1} and O_{2} lie within the annulus centered at O and bounded by circles of radii 1 and sqrt{2}; and since O_{1} O_{2} geqslant 1, the angle O_{1} O O_{2}, by the result of problem 46, is not less than 2 arcsin frac{1}{2 sqrt{2}} approx 41.4^{circ}.

That eight squares can be attached is evident from Fig. 135, b.Note. This problem can also be solved without using trigonometric tables. 2 arcsin frac{1}{2 sqrt{2}} is the angle at the vertex of an isosceles triangle with legs sqrt{2} and base 1. If we attach nine such triangles to each other as shown in Fig. 136, the sum of the lengths of the bases of all these triangles will exceed the length of the circumference of radius sqrt{2}; indeed, 2 pi sqrt{2} < 360^{circ}, which is what we needed to show.Second solution. Let A B C D be the original square K; we will take the length of its side as the unit. Consider the square A^{prime} B^{prime} C^{prime} D^{prime} with side 2, having the same center as the square K and the same orientation of sides (Fig. 137, a); the perimeter of the square A^{prime} B^{prime} C^{prime} D^{prime} is obviously 8. We will show that the length l of the part of the perimeter of the square A^{prime} B^{prime} C^{prime} D^{prime} cut by the side of one attached square cannot be less than 1; from this it will follow that no more than eight non-overlapping squares can be attached to K.

If in this case only one vertex of the attached square falls inside the square A^{prime} B^{prime} C^{prime} D^{prime} (as in the case of square E F G H), then, denoting the angle between the sides B C and E F by alpha, we havebegin{aligned}& l = M K + K N = E K operatorname{tg} alpha + E K operatorname{ctg} alpha = frac{1}{2} left( operatorname{tg} alpha + frac{1}{operatorname{tg} alpha} right) = & = 1 + frac{1}{2} left( sqrt{operatorname{tg} alpha} - frac{1}{sqrt{operatorname{tg} alpha}} right)^2 geqslant 1end{aligned}If two vertices of the attached square fall inside the square A^{prime} B^{prime} C^{prime} D^{prime} (as in the case of square E_{1} F_{1} G_{1} H_{1}), then obviously l = M_{1} N_{1} geqslant N_{1} L_{1} = 1.2^{circ} Suppose one vertex of the square A^{prime} B^{prime} C^{prime} D^{prime} falls inside the attached square (squares A F_{2} C_{2} H_{2}, E_{3} F_{3} C_{3} H_{3}, and E_{4} F_{4} G_{4} H_{4} in Fig. 137, b).

He alternates between a normal move and a short move where he moves to any diagonally neighbouring cell.The limping knight moves on a 5 times 6 cell chessboard starting with a normal move. What is the largest number of moves he can make if he is starting from a cell of his own choice and is not allowed to visit any cell (including the initial cell) more than once?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - The knight alternates between a normal move and a short move.   - A normal move is a standard knight move in chess (L-shaped: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular).   - A short move is a move to any diagonally neighboring cell.   - The knight starts with a normal move.   - The knight cannot visit any cell more than once.   - The chessboard is 5 times 6.2. Constructing a Sequence of 25 Moves:   - We need to show that it is possible to construct a sequence of 25 moves.   - Since the knight starts with a normal move and alternates, the sequence will have 13 normal moves and 12 short moves.   - We can construct such a sequence by carefully planning the knight's path to ensure it does not revisit any cell.3. Proving that 26 Moves are Not Possible:   - To prove that 26 moves are not possible, we use a coloring argument.   - Color the second and fourth rows of the chessboard red.   - Note that there are 12 red cells in total (6 cells in the second row and 6 cells in the fourth row).4. Analyzing the Moves:   - Let the cells visited by the knight be denoted by 0, 1, 2, 3, ldots.   - Between moves 2k-1 and 2k, the knight makes a short move.   - A short move always lands on a diagonally neighboring cell, which means it will land on a red cell if it started from a non-red cell, and vice versa.   - Therefore, in each pair of moves (2k-1, 2k), exactly one of the two cells is red.5. Counting the Red Cells:   - Since there are only 12 red cells, the maximum number of pairs (2k-1, 2k) is 12.   - This implies that k leq 12.   - Since k represents the number of pairs, the total number of moves is 2k.   - Therefore, the maximum number of moves is 2 times 12 = 24.6. Conclusion:   - The knight can make at most 24 moves if he alternates between normal and short moves and does not revisit any cell.The final answer is boxed{24}"},{"problem":"## Problem StatementWrite the decomposition of vector x in terms of vectors p, q, r:x={2 ;-1 ; 11}p={1 ; 1 ; 0}q={0 ; 1 ;-2}r={1 ; 0 ; 3}","solution":"## SolutionThe desired decomposition of vector x is:x=alpha cdot p+beta cdot q+gamma cdot rOr in the form of a system:left{begin{array}{l}alpha cdot p_{1}+beta cdot q_{1}+gamma cdot r_{1}=x_{1} alpha cdot p_{2}+beta cdot q_{2}+gamma cdot r_{2}=x_{2} alpha cdot p_{3}+beta cdot q_{3}+gamma cdot r_{3}=x_{3}end{array}right.We obtain:left{begin{array}{l}alpha+gamma=2 alpha+beta=-1 -2 beta+3 gamma=11end{array}right.Add the second row multiplied by 2 to the third row:left{begin{array}{l}alpha+gamma=2 alpha+beta=-1 2 alpha+3 gamma=9end{array}right.Add the first row multiplied by -2 to the third row:left{begin{array}{l}alpha+gamma=2 alpha+beta=-1 gamma=5end{array}right.begin{aligned}& left{begin{array}{l}alpha+5=2 alpha+beta=-1 gamma=5end{array}right. & left{begin{array}{l}alpha=-3 alpha+beta=-1 gamma=5end{array}right. & left{begin{array}{l}alpha=-3 -3+beta=-1 gamma=5end{array}right. & left{begin{array}{l}alpha=-3 beta=2 gamma=5end{array}right.end{aligned}The desired decomposition:x=-3 p+2 q+5 r## Problem Kuznetsov Analytic Geometry 2-14"},{"problem":"Given that (alpha) is an acute angle, and (tan alpha= dfrac{3}{4} ), then (sin 2alpha=)        .","solution":"AnalysisThis question tests the basic relationship between trigonometric functions of the same angle and the application of the double-angle formula.

So we get an infinite sequence of distinct solutions for n > 2. For n = 2, lhs = (x+y) 2 , so we have infinitely many solutions (x,y) = (k+1,-k). If (x,y) is a solution for n, then (x,-y) is a solution for -n. So we also have infinitely many solutions for n ≤ -2. It remains to consider n = -1, 0, 1. n = 0 obviously has no solutions except (±1,0) and (0,±1), since both x 2 and y 2 are non-negative. We show that n = 1 has no solutions with |x| or |y| > 1. Clearly such a solution must have one of x, y negative. wlog x > 0 > y. So x, -y are positive and hence -2xy ≤ x 2 + y 2 . So x 2 + xy + y 2 ≥ (x 2 + y 2 )/2 > 1, since at least one of x 2 , y 2 ≥ 4. Thus n = 1 has only finitely many solutions. Since any solution (x,y) for n = 1 gives a solution (x,-y) for n = -1, there are only finitely many solutions for n = -1 also. 8th Irish 1995 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 1 February 2004 Last updated/corrected 1 Feb 04"},{"problem":"Fernando is a cautious person, and the gate of his house has 10 distinct padlocks, each of which can only be opened by its respective key, and each key opens only one padlock.

How many p-element subsets A of {1,2,ldots  2p} are there, the sum of whose elements is divisible by p?","solution":"1. Define the sets and their properties:   Let ( X = {1, 2, ldots, p} ) and ( Y = {p+1, p+2, ldots, 2p} ). Note that ( X ) and ( Y ) form a complete residue system modulo ( p ). This means that every integer from ( 1 ) to ( 2p ) can be represented uniquely modulo ( p ) by an element in ( X cup Y ).2. Translation and trivial subsets:   For a subset ( A subset X ) and ( z in mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z} ), define ( A + z = {a + z mod p mid a in A} ). Similarly, for a subset ( B subset Y ), define ( B + z = {b + z mod p mid b in B} ).   A subset ( A subset X ) is called trivial if ( A = emptyset ) or ( A = X ). Similarly, a subset ( B subset Y ) is trivial if ( B = emptyset ) or ( B = Y ).3. Nontrivial subsets and translation:   Consider a nontrivial subset ( P subset (X cup Y) ). Define a translation for ( P ):   - If ( P cap X ) is nontrivial, define ( P + z = ((P cap X) + z) cup (P cap Y) ).   - If ( P cap Y ) is nontrivial, define ( P + z = (P cap X) cup ((P cap Y) + z) ).4. Sum of elements modulo ( p ):   When ( z ) goes through all possible residue classes modulo ( p ), the sum of the elements of ( P + z ) also goes through all possible residue classes modulo ( p ). Therefore, there is exactly one value of ( z ) for which the sum of the elements of ( P + z ) is divisible by ( p ).5. Counting the subsets:   There are exactly ( binom{2p}{p} ) subsets of ( {1, 2, ldots, 2p} ) with ( p ) elements. Among these, 2 subsets are trivial (the subsets ( X ) and ( Y )). The nontrivial subsets can be divided into equivalence classes of ( p ) sets each, where each class has exactly one subset whose sum of elements is divisible by ( p ).6. Final calculation:   The number of nontrivial ( p )-element subsets is ( binom{2p}{p} - 2 ). Since each equivalence class contains ( p ) subsets, the number of equivalence classes is ( frac{binom{2p}{p} - 2}{p} ). Adding the 2 trivial subsets, the total number of ( p )-element subsets whose sum is divisible by ( p ) is:   [   frac{binom{2p}{p} - 2}{p} + 2   ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{binom{2p}{p} - 2}{p} + 2})"},{"problem":"[ [ CaseAnalysis quad]Find all odd natural numbers greater than 500 but less than 1000, for each of which the sum of the last digits of all divisors (including 1 and the number itself) is 33.#","solution":"For an odd number, all its divisors are odd.

Define the set and the problem:   Let ( S = {1, 2, 3, ldots, 100} ). We need to find the maximum value of integer ( k ) such that there exist ( k ) different nonempty subsets of ( S ) satisfying the condition: for any two of the ( k ) subsets, if their intersection is nonempty, then the minimal element of their intersection is not equal to the maximal element of either of the two subsets.2. Construct a candidate solution:   Consider all subsets of ( S ) that contain the element ( 1 ), except for the subset ({1}). There are ( 2^{99} - 1 ) such subsets because each subset of ( S ) containing ( 1 ) can be formed by choosing any subset of ( {2, 3, ldots, 100} ), and there are ( 2^{99} ) such subsets in total, including the empty subset. Excluding the subset ({1}), we have ( 2^{99} - 1 ) subsets.3. Verify the condition:   For any two subsets ( A ) and ( B ) in our collection, both contain ( 1 ). If their intersection is nonempty, it must contain ( 1 ). The minimal element of their intersection is ( 1 ), which is not the maximal element of either ( A ) or ( B ) (since ( A ) and ( B ) are not ({1})). Thus, the condition is satisfied.4. Prove optimality using induction:   We need to show that ( 2^{99} - 1 ) is the maximum number of such subsets. We will use induction on ( n ), the cardinality of ( S ).   - Base case ( n = 2 ):     For ( S = {1, 2} ), the subsets are ({1}, {2}, {1, 2}). The pairs (({2}, {1, 2})) form a \\"horrible\\" pair because their intersection ({2}) is the maximal element of ({2}). Thus, we can only choose one subset from each pair, giving us ( 2^{1} - 1 = 1 ) subset.   - Inductive step:     Assume the statement holds for ( n = k ). For ( n = k+1 ), consider the set ( S = {1, 2, ldots, k+1} ). By the induction hypothesis, we can pair all nonempty subsets of ( {1, 2, ldots, k} ) into \\"horrible\\" pairs. We need to pair all nonempty subsets of ( S ) containing ( k+1 ) into \\"horrible\\" pairs. For any subsets ( A, B ) of ( {1, 2, ldots, k} ) such that ( A cup B = {1, 2, ldots, k} ) and ( |A| + |B| = k ), we can pair ( {k+1} cup A ) with ( {k+1} cup B ). This completes the induction.5. Conclusion:   Since we can pair all nonempty subsets of ( S ) except for ({1}) into \\"horrible\\" pairs, we can pick at most one subset from each pair. This gives us an upper bound of ( 1 + frac{2^{100} - 2}{2} = 2^{99} ). However, to achieve equality, we need ({1}) to be chosen, which would prevent any other subset containing ( 1 ) from being chosen. Thus, the maximum number of subsets is ( 2^{99} - 1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 2^{99} - 1 } )."},{"problem":"9.

Understanding the Problem:   We have (2^{2n+1}) towns and (2n+1) companies. Each pair of towns is connected by an airline operated by one of the companies. We need to find the maximum number (k) such that we can close (k) companies and still have a connected graph.2. Graph Representation:   Represent the towns as vertices of a complete graph (K_{2^{2n+1}}). Each edge in this graph is colored with one of (2n+1) colors, each representing a different company.3. Edge Coloring and Connectivity:   We need to construct an edge coloring of (2n+1) colors on (K_{2^{2n+1}}) such that removing any (n+1) colors results in a disconnected graph. This means that the graph remains connected if at most (n) colors (companies) are removed.4. Constructing the Edge Coloring:   The construction of such an edge coloring is non-trivial and relies on combinatorial design. One known construction is based on the properties of finite fields and projective planes. Specifically, for a prime power (q), the projective plane of order (q) has (q^2 + q + 1) points and the same number of lines, with each line containing (q + 1) points.5. Application to the Problem:   For (q = 2^n), the projective plane of order (2^n) has (2^{2n} + 2^n + 1 = 2^{2n+1}) points. Each line in this projective plane corresponds to a color (company), and each point corresponds to a town. The properties of the projective plane ensure that any (n+1) lines (colors) will cover all points, meaning that removing (n+1) lines will leave some points (towns) disconnected.6.

Then triangles ( A H O_{1} ) and ( B F O_{1} ), ( B F O_{1} ) and ( B G O_{1} ) are right triangles and are equal by the hypotenuse and acute angle. From the equality of the triangles, it follows that ( H O_{1} = G O_{1} ). Therefore, ( O_{1} ) is equidistant from the sides of angle ( C ), which means ( C O_{1} ) is the bisector of angle ( C ).

For the same reason, angles angle LMX, angle MVO, and angle NVX are also congruent.

These are the interior angles of triangle KLM, whose third angle is known. The measures of angles angle KLM and angle KML are left(180^{circ}-70^{circ}right): 2=55^{circ}.Notes. The congruence of angles angle KLM and angle KML means that triangle KLM is isosceles with base LM. This fact can be directly derived as follows:Line NO is parallel to side LM, so it is perpendicular to the altitude to this side. Since line NO is the angle bisector of angle XVL, angles angle NVX and angle OVZ are congruent, and since this line is perpendicular to the altitude KY, angles angle K VX and angle K VZ are also congruent.

The interior angles of these triangles at vertices K and V are therefore congruent and have a measure of 70^{circ} (from the problem statement).

However, it is not advantageous to burn the fuel faster than at the rate of (lceil V rceil).

Therefore, under this homothety, circle omega maps to gamma, so point T maps to point K, and TM / MK = 1 / 2.Third solution. Let O and Q be the centers of the circumcircles Omega and gamma of triangles ABC and ATC, respectively, and let H be the orthocenter of triangle ABC. Since angle AOC = 2 angle ABC = 120^{circ} and angle AHC = 180^{circ} - angle ABC = 120^{circ}, points O and H lie on gamma. Since angle AQC = 360^{circ} - 2 angle ATC = 120^{circ}, point Q lies on Omega. As in the first solution, note that line BT intersects gamma again at point X, which is diametrically opposite to point O.Note that OQ parallel BH and BO = OQ = QH. Since angle QHB > 90^{circ} > angle OBH, it follows that BOQH is a rhombus. Therefore, BH = OQ = OX / 2.Let BX intersect OH at point L; triangles OLX and HLB are similar with a ratio of OX / BH = 2. Therefore, HL = HO / 3. Recall that point H maps to point O under a homothety with center M and coefficient -1 / 2, so OM = OH / 3, which means OM = ML = LH.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_88961667a024e1987dddg-05.jpg?height=628&width=438&top_left_y=635&top_left_x=855)Therefore, TM is the median of the right triangle OTL, so TM = MO. Therefore, similar triangles OMK and TMH are equal, so MK = MH = 2OM = 2TM. This leads to the answer.Remark. From the last solution, it is clear that OTHK is an isosceles trapezoid."},{"problem":"2 cdot 73 Let positive integers a, b make 15a + 16b and 16a - 15b both squares of positive integers.

Integration of Differential Equations Using Series1^{circ}. Expansion of the solution in a power series. This method is particularly convenient for linear differential equations. Let us illustrate its application using a second-order differential equation.

The coefficients c_{0} and c_{1} remain arbitrary and play the role of arbitrary constants. The first equation (5) gives c_{2}, the second gives c_{3}, the third gives c_{4}, and so on. In general, from the (k+1)-th equation, we can determine c_{k+2}, knowing c_{0}, c_{1}, ldots, c_{k+1}.Practically, it is convenient to proceed as follows. We will determine two solutions y_{1}(x) and y_{2}(x) according to the above scheme, choosing c_{0}=1 and c_{1}=0 for y_{1}(x), and c_{0}=0 and c_{1}=1 for y_{2}(x), which is equivalent to the following initial conditions:y_{1}(0)=1, quad y_{1}^{prime}(0)=0, quad y_{2}(0)=0, quad y_{2}^{prime}(0)=1Any solution of equation (1) will be a linear combination of the solutions y_{1}(x) and y_{2}(x).If the initial conditions are of the form y(0)=A, y^{prime}(0)=B, then obviously,y=A y_{1}(x)+B y_{2}(x)The following theorem holds.Theorem.

Identify the coordinates of key points:   - The rectangle (ABCD) has vertices (A(0,0)), (B(a,0)), (C(a,b)), and (D(0,b)).   - The center (O) of the rectangle is at (left(frac{a}{2}, frac{b}{2}right)).2. Determine the coordinates of point (E):   - Since (E) is on (AD) and (AE/ED = 1/2), we can set (AE = x) and (ED = 2x).   - Therefore, (AD = AE + ED = x + 2x = 3x), which implies (b = 3x) and (x = frac{b}{3}).   - Thus, the coordinates of (E) are ((0, frac{b}{3})).3.

In a convex polygon, each angle must be strictly less than 180 degrees.  Six acute angles can only sum to less than 90cdot 6 = 540 degrees, so six acute angles could not form a hexagon.Five acute angles and one obtuse angle can only sum to less than 90cdot 5 + 180 = 630 degrees, so these angles could not form a hexagon.Four acute angles and two obtuse angles can only sum to less than 90cdot 4 + 180cdot 2 = 720 degrees.  This is a strict inequality, so these angles could not form a hexagon.  (The limiting figure would be four right angles and two straight angles, which would really be a square with two \\"extra\\" points on two sides to form the straight angles.)Three acute angles and three obtuse angles work.  For example, if you pick three acute angles of 80 degrees, the three obtuse angles would be 160 degrees and give a sum of 80cdot 3 + 160cdot 3 = 720 degrees, which is a genuine hexagon.

The zeros of the function occur when cos omega x = 1. Step 1: Determine the period of the functionThe period of the function f(x) = cos omega x - 1 is given by T = frac{2pi}{omega}. This is because the cosine function completes one full cycle every 2pi radians, and scaling the input by omega changes the period to frac{2pi}{omega}. Step 2: Analyze the condition for having exactly 3 zerosFor the function to have exactly 3 zeros within the interval [0, 2pi], it must complete just under 1.5 cycles within this interval. This is because each cycle of the cosine function (from 0 to 2pi) has exactly 2 points where cos omega x = 1 (at the start and end of each cycle). Therefore, to have exactly 3 zeros, we need just under 1.5 cycles of the cosine function within [0, 2pi]. Step 3: Set up the inequalityGiven the period T = frac{2pi}{omega}, we can say that two periods (2 cycles) should be greater than or equal to the length of the interval (2pi) for there to be at least 3 zeros, but less than three periods (3 cycles) to avoid having more than 3 zeros.

The following considerations lead to this answer: the first player aims to maximize the difference between the remaining numbers and should always try to \\"thin out\\" the remaining set of numbers as much as possible, while it is advantageous for the second player to cross out numbers \\"from the edges.\\" Of course, these considerations do not constitute a rigorous proof. To fully justify the answer, in this problem (as in the analysis of any game situation), two statements need to be proven: 1) no matter how the second player plays, the first can achieve no less than 32; 2) no matter how the first player plays, the second can lose no more than 32. To prove statement 1), we will indicate a strategy for the first player that guarantees, regardless of the second player's moves, that the difference between the two remaining numbers will be no less than 32. This strategy is described very simply: at each move, cross out every other number, i.e., the second, fourth, sixth, ... number from the remaining ones (we assume that the numbers are arranged in ascending order). Then after the 1st move, the difference between any adjacent remaining numbers will be no less than 2, after the 2nd move - no less than 4, after the 3rd move - no less than 8, after the 4th move - no less than 16, and after the 5th move - no less than 32. To prove statement 2), it is sufficient to indicate a strategy for the second player that will allow him, regardless of the first player's moves, to lose no more than 32. It consists of the following. On the first move, he crosses out all numbers less than 512 or all numbers greater than 512 (it is clear that either of these sets will not exceed 256). After this, the difference between the extreme remaining numbers will be no more than 512. Similarly, on the second move, he can ensure that all remaining numbers are in one of the segments [0, 256]; [256, 512]; [512, 768]; [768, 1024], that is, reduce the difference between the extreme numbers to at least 256. In the same way, on the 3rd move, he can reduce this difference to 128, on the 4th move - to 64, and on the 5th move - to 32. Of course, similarly, it could be proven that if the game consists of n moves and starts with the numbers 0,1,2, ldots, 2^{2 n}, then the \\"cost of the game\\" is 2^{text {n }}. However, a detailed study of a similar game starting with an arbitrary set of numbers (not necessarily an arithmetic progression) represents a significantly more difficult task.## AnswerWith correct play, the difference between the remaining numbers is 32 (as they say, the \\"cost of the game\\" is 32)."},{"problem":"2.

We need to verify that this satisfies the functional equation:   [   f(a, b) + f(a+1, b+1) = (2^a + 2^b - 1) + (2^{a+1} + 2^{b+1} - 1)   ]   [   = 2^a + 2^b + 2^{a+1} + 2^{b+1} - 2   ]   and   [   f(a+1, b) + f(a, b+1) = (2^{a+1} + 2^b - 1) + (2^a + 2^{b+1} - 1)   ]   [   = 2^{a+1} + 2^b + 2^a + 2^{b+1} - 2   ]   Both expressions are equal, confirming that ( f(a, b) = 2^a + 2^b - 1 ) satisfies the functional equation.4. Finding the Number of Positive Integers ( n leq 2016 ):   We need to find the number of positive integers ( n leq 2016 ) such that ( n = 2^a + 2^b - 1 ) for nonnegative integers ( a ) and ( b ).   - For ( a = 0 ), ( f(0, b) = 2^b - 1 ). The maximum ( b ) such that ( 2^b - 1 leq 2016 ) is ( b = 10 ) (since ( 2^{11} - 1 = 2047 )).   - For ( a = 1 ), ( f(1, b) = 2 + 2^b - 1 = 2^b + 1 ). The maximum ( b ) such that ( 2^b + 1 leq 2016 ) is ( b = 10 ).   - For ( a = 2 ), ( f(2, b) = 4 + 2^b - 1 = 2^b + 3 ). The maximum ( b ) such that ( 2^b + 3 leq 2016 ) is ( b = 10 ).   - Continue this pattern up to ( a = 10 ).   Summing the number of distinct values:   [   1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 10 = frac{10 cdot 11}{2} = 55   ]   Additionally, for ( a = 10 ), we have 10 values of ( b ) (since ( 2^{10} + 2^b - 1 leq 2016 )).   Therefore, the total number of distinct values is:   [   55 + 10 = 65   ]The final answer is (boxed{65})"},{"problem":"In a geometric sequence {a_{n}}, where all terms are positive, and a_{1}, frac{1}{2}a_{3}, 2a_{2} form an arithmetic sequence, find frac{{a}_{13}+{a}_{14}}{{a}_{14}+{a}_{15}}.","solution":"Given that in the geometric sequence {a_{n}}, all terms are positive, and a_{1}, frac{1}{2}a_{3}, 2a_{2} form an arithmetic sequence, we aim to find the value of frac{{a}_{13}+{a}_{14}}{{a}_{14}+{a}_{15}}.First, let's analyze the given conditions.

From the problem statement, it follows that point O lies at the intersection of the angle bisector of angle A and the perpendicular bisector of side BC.

Let the angles of triangle ABC be: angle A = alpha, angle B = beta, angle C = gamma. (see Fig. 9.6a) Then angle OCB = angle OAB = alpha / 2, angle BHC = 90^{circ} - beta, angle OCH = angle OCB + angle BHC = 90^{circ} + alpha / 2 - beta.In triangle OHC: OH = OC (radii of the same circle), so angle OHC = angle OCH = 90^{circ} + alpha / 2 - beta. Similarly, angle OHB = angle OBH = 90^{circ} + alpha / 2 - gamma. Therefore, angle BHC = angle OHB + angle OHC = 90^{circ} + alpha / 2 - gamma + 90^{circ} + alpha / 2 - beta = 180^{circ} + alpha - gamma - beta = 2alpha.Since angle BHC = 180^{circ} - alpha, we get the equation 2alpha = 180^{circ} - alpha, from which alpha = 60^{circ}.Second method. We use the fact that the circumcircle of triangle BHC is symmetric to the circumcircle of triangle ABC with respect to line BC (see Fig. 9.6b). Then the center P of the circumcircle of triangle ABC lies on arc BHC. Therefore, angle BHC = angle BPC = 2 angle BAC.

Let (a = 2k) for some integer (k):[b = frac{3(2k) - 2}{2} = frac{6k - 2}{2} = 3k - 1]Now, we need to check if this pair ((a, b) = (2k, 3k - 1)) satisfies the first condition (3a + 1 mid 4b - 1):[3(2k) + 1 = 6k + 1][4b - 1 = 4(3k - 1) - 1 = 12k - 4 - 1 = 12k - 5]We need (6k + 1 mid 12k - 5).

The possible values for (6k + 1) are (pm 1, pm 7). Since (6k + 1) must be positive, we have:[6k + 1 = 7 implies 6k = 6 implies k = 1]Thus, (a = 2k = 2) and (b = 3k - 1 = 2). Case 2: (3a + 1 = 4b - 1)From this equation, we can solve for (a) in terms of (b):[3a + 1 = 4b - 1 implies 3a = 4b - 2 implies a = frac{4b - 2}{3}]Since (a) must be an integer, (4b - 2) must be divisible by 3. This implies:[4b - 2 equiv 0 pmod{3} implies 4b equiv 2 pmod{3} implies b equiv 2 pmod{3}]Let (b = 3m + 2) for some integer (m):[a = frac{4(3m + 2) - 2}{3} = frac{12m + 8 - 2}{3} = frac{12m + 6}{3} = 4m + 2]Now, we need to check if this pair ((a, b) = (4m + 2, 3m + 2)) satisfies the second condition (2b + 1 mid 3a - 1):[2b + 1 = 2(3m + 2) + 1 = 6m + 4 + 1 = 6m + 5][3a - 1 = 3(4m + 2) - 1 = 12m + 6 - 1 = 12m + 5]We need (6m + 5 mid 12m + 5). Let's check if this is true:[12m + 5 = 2(6m + 5)]Thus, (6m + 5) divides (12m + 5) if and only if it divides 0. Therefore, (6m + 5) must be a divisor of 0. The possible values for (6m + 5) are (pm 1, pm 5). Since (6m + 5) must be positive, we have:[6m + 5 = 5 implies 6m = 0 implies m = 0]Thus, (a = 4m + 2 = 2) and (b = 3m + 2 = 2). Case 3: (4b - 1 ge 6a + 2) and (3a - 1 ge 4b + 2)If we assume (4b - 1 ge 6a + 2) and (3a - 1 ge 4b + 2), we get:[4b - 1 ge 6a + 2 implies 4b ge 6a + 3 implies b ge frac{6a + 3}{4}][3a - 1 ge 4b + 2 implies 3a ge 4b + 3 implies a ge frac{4b + 3}{3}]Combining these inequalities, we get:[b ge frac{6a + 3}{4} quad text{and} quad a ge frac{4b + 3}{3}]Substituting (a ge frac{4b + 3}{3}) into (b ge frac{6a + 3}{4}), we get:[b ge frac{6left(frac{4b + 3}{3}right) + 3}{4} = frac{8b + 6 + 3}{4} = frac{8b + 9}{4}][4b ge 8b + 9 implies -4b ge 9 implies b le -frac{9}{4}]Since (b) must be a positive integer, this is a contradiction.

Let ( P(x) ) be one of the ten 5-degree polynomials and let ( f(x) ) be the linear function modeling the arithmetic sequence. Since the sequence is arithmetic, ( f(x) ) can be written as:   [   f(x) = ax + b   ]   where ( a ) and ( b ) are constants.2. For the sequence to be arithmetic, the difference between consecutive terms must be constant. This implies that for each called number ( x ), the value ( P(x) ) must fit the form of ( f(x) ).3.

Therefore, statement A is correct.- Statement B: For x > 0, we examine how y changes as x increases. Since y=frac{2}{x}, if x increases, y actually decreases because the value of frac{2}{x} becomes smaller as x becomes larger. Thus, the statement that y increases as x increases is incorrect. - Statement C: The function y=frac{2}{x}, with k=2 > 0, implies that the graph will have branches in the first and third quadrants.

A monomial is defined as an algebraic expression with only one term. Therefore, since x+2 has two terms, it is not a monomial but a binomial. Hence, option A does not meet the requirements.- Option B: The expression frac{x}{4} represents a term where x is a variable and 4 is a constant. Since the term includes a variable, it cannot be considered a constant term. A constant term would not include any variables. Therefore, option B does not meet the requirements.- Option C: The expression frac{y-1}{2} can be seen as a fraction where the numerator y-1 is a binomial (since it consists of two terms, y and -1) and the denominator is 2. This makes the expression a polynomial, not a monomial, because a monomial consists of a single term. Therefore, option C does not meet the requirements.- Option D: The expression frac{xy}{2} is a single term that includes a product of variables x and y divided by a constant 2.

Thus, the number of ways is boxed{120}.(2) To include both internists and surgeons, we subtract the number of teams with only internists or only surgeons from the total possible teams. The total ways to select 5 members from 10 doctors is binom{10}{5} = 252. The ways to select 5 internists (which is not possible since there are only 6 internists) or 5 surgeons (also not possible since there are only 4 surgeons) are 0. However, selecting all members from one specialty would be binom{6}{5} + binom{4}{5} = 6 + 0 = 6. Therefore, the number of ways is 252 - 6 = 246.

The total ways to select 5 members from 10 doctors is binom{10}{5} = 252. The ways to select 5 members without including the chiefs (from the remaining 8 doctors) is binom{8}{5} = 56. Therefore, the number of ways is 252 - 56 = 196. Thus, the number of ways is boxed{196}.(4) To include both a chief and surgeons, first consider the teams with at least one chief. As calculated in (3), there are 196 ways. From these, we need to subtract the teams that include chiefs but no surgeons. There are 2 chiefs, and selecting the remaining members from the 6 internists gives binom{6}{4} = 15 ways for each chief, totaling 15 times 2 = 30 ways. Therefore, the number of ways is 196 - 30 = 166. However, this calculation does not account for the possibility of including both chiefs, which adds additional valid configurations. Including both chiefs and selecting the remaining 3 members from the 4 surgeons gives binom{4}{3} = 4 ways, and selecting the remaining 3 members from the 6 internists gives binom{6}{3} = 20 ways.

Find the maximum value of the expression a+b+c+d-ab-bc-cd-da, if each of the numbers a, b, c and d belongs to the interval [0 ; 1].","solution":"Answer: 2.Solution. The first method. The value 2 is achieved, for example, if a=c=1, b=d=0. We will prove that with the given values of the variables a+b+c+d-ab-bc-cd-da leqslant 2.Notice that a+b+c+d-ab-bc-cd-da=(a+c)+(b+d)-(a+c)(b+d). Let a+c=x, b+d=y, then we need to prove that x+y-xy leqslant 2, if 0 leqslant x leqslant 2 and 0 leqslant y leqslant 2.Indeed, x+y-xy=(x+y-xy-1)+1=(x-1)(1-y)+1, where -1 leqslant x-1 leqslant 1 and -1 leqslant 1-y leqslant 1. Therefore, (x-1)(1-y) leqslant 1, so x+y-xy leqslant 2.By introducing new variables, we can reason differently. Fix the variable y and consider the function f(x) = (1-y)x + y, where x in [0; 2]. Since it is linear, its maximum value is achieved at one of the endpoints of the interval [0; 2]. But f(0) = y leqslant 2 and f(2) = 2 - y leqslant 2, so for all x in [0; 2] the inequality f(x) leqslant 2 holds.The second method. The same idea of linearity can be used initially. The given expression can be considered a linear function of one of the variables if the other three variables are fixed.For example, fix the values of the variables b, c, and d and consider the function f(a) = (1-b-d)a + b + c + d - bc - cd, where a in [0; 1]. Due to monotonicity, its maximum value is achieved at one of the endpoints of the interval [0; 1]. The same situation will arise for similarly defined linear functions of the variables b, c, and d.Therefore, the maximum value of the original expression can only be achieved when the variables a, b, c, and d take one of two values: 0 or 1. Considering the symmetry of the given expression, it is sufficient to check the following cases:1) if a=b=c=d=0 or a=b=c=d=1, the value of the expression is 0;2) if a=b=c=0, d=1 or a=b=c=1, d=0, the value of the expression is 1;3) if a=b=0, c=d=1 or a=b=1, c=d=0, the value of the expression is 1;4) if a=c=0, b=d=1 or a=c=1, b=d=0, the value of the expression is 2.Thus, the maximum value of the given expression is 2.## Grading Criteria:+ The correct answer and a fully justified solution are providedpm The correct answer and generally correct reasoning are provided, but there are minor gaps or inaccuracies (e.g., the estimate is proven, but an example is missing)干 The correct line of reasoning is provided, but a computational error is mademp The idea of linearity is present, but it is not fully developed干 The correct answer is provided, and the values of the variables at which it can be achieved are indicated, but the estimate is not conducted- Only the answer is provided"},{"problem":"Given a sample of x, 1, y, 5, if the average of this sample is 2, then the minimum value of its variance is (　　)  A: 5  B: 4  C: 3  D: 2","solution":"Since the average of the sample x, 1, y, 5 is 2,  we have x + y = 2, thus xy leq 1,  therefore, S^2 = frac{1}{4}[(x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2 + 10] = frac{5}{2} + frac{1}{4}(x^2 + y^2) geq frac{5}{2} + frac{1}{4} cdot 2xy geq frac{5}{2} + frac{1}{4} times 2 = 3,  thus, the minimum value of the variance is 3,  hence, the correct answer is: boxed{text{C}}.

One evening, the grocer decided to redistribute all this money into 7 bags so that the number of dollar bills and coins of each denomination remained equal in all bags. The next evening, he similarly redistributed all the money into 6 bags.Then the unfortunate madman tried to redistribute everything into 5 bags, but after hours of hard work, he died in complete exhaustion, bitterly mourned by his neighbors. What is the smallest amount of money that the grocer could have set aside for a rainy day?","solution":"22. The grocer set aside 168 paper dollars, 168 half-dollar coins, and 168 quarter-dollar coins for a rainy day, totaling 294 dollars.

The allowed moves are:   - Replace ( HM ) with ( MH )   - Replace ( MT ) with ( TM )   - Replace ( TH ) with ( HT )2. Observing the Moves: Notice that the moves do not change the relative order of ( H ) and ( T ). Specifically:   - ( H ) can never move to the right of ( T ).   - ( T ) can never move to the left of ( H ).3. Placement of ( M ): The positions of ( H ) and ( T ) are fixed relative to each other. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the placement of the ( M )'s among the ( H )'s and ( T )'s.4. Counting the Arrangements: We need to count the number of ways to place 4 ( M )'s in the 8 positions of the string ( HHMMMMTT ). This is a combinatorial problem where we choose 4 positions out of 8 for the ( M )'s.5. Using Binomial Coefficient: The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient:   [   binom{8}{4} = frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!} = frac{8!}{4!4!}   ]6.

The condition of the problem means that for all x in [1; 3], the inequality |f(x)| leqslant frac{1}{2} holds. By making the substitution t = x + 2, we obtain the inequality left|t^{2} + (p+4)t + (2p+q+4)right| leqslant frac{1}{2}, which holds for all t in [-1; 1]. Consider the functions g(t) = left|t^{2} - (at + b)right|, G(a, b) = max_{t in [-1; 1]} |g(t)|, and the points A = left(-1, frac{3}{2}right), B = left(-1, frac{1}{2}right), C = left(0, frac{1}{2}right), D = left(0, -frac{1}{2}right), E = left(1, frac{3}{2}right), F = left(1, frac{1}{2}right) on the coordinate plane Oty (see figure).If the line y = at + b does not intersect at least one of the segments AB, CD, EF, then G(a, b) geqslant max(g(-1), g(0), g(1)) > frac{1}{2}. The only line that intersects all three segments is the line y = frac{1}{2}. Therefore, for any a and b, we have G(a, b) geqslant frac{1}{2}, and G(a, b) = frac{1}{2} only when a = 0, b = frac{1}{2}.

Therefore, the function expression is: y=sqrt{2} sin left(frac{7 pi}{8} x+frac{3 pi}{4}right).In summary, the function expressions that meet the conditions are: y=sqrt{2} sin left(frac{pi}{8} x+frac{pi}{4}right) or y=sqrt{2} sin left(frac{7 pi}{8} x+frac{3 pi}{4}right).Explanation: To find the expression of the function y=A cdot sin (omega x+varphi) from points on a sine-type curve, the key is to determine the values of omega and varphi. This is often a tricky task. From this example, we can see that if the concept of period is used appropriately, this problem is not difficult to solve. Generally, let Aleft(x_{1}, y_{1}right), Bleft(x_{2}, y_{2}right) be any two points on the sine-type curve y=A sin (omega x+varphi). When A, B are within the same period, by the concept of period, the period T geqslantleft|x_{2}-x_{1}right|. When A, B are within frac{k}{n}left(n, k in mathbf{N}^{*}right) periods, frac{k}{n} cdot T geqslantleft|x_{2}-x_{1}right|. When A, B are outside frac{k}{n} periods, frac{k}{n} cdot T<left|x_{2}-x_{1}right|. In the solution above, this simple fact is used to accurately and conveniently determine the function expression of the curve y=A sin (omega pi+varphi) based on the coordinates of points on the curve."},{"problem":"B5.

Due to symmetry, the line segments from M to the vertices divide the decagon into ten congruent triangles. The angle at M of such a triangle is equal to frac{360^{circ}}{10}=36^{circ} (indicated with circ in the figure) and the other two angles, which are equal, are frac{180^{circ}-36^{circ}}{2}=72^{circ} (indicated with x in the figure). From this, it follows that the angles of the original decagon are each 2 cdot 72^{circ}=144^{circ}.

See the picture below.First, we look at quadrilateral A B C D. The sum of the four angles is 360^{circ}. The angles at B and C are 144^{circ} and the angles at A and D, which are equal due to the symmetry of the decagon, are thus 36^{circ}. This means that the line segment A D divides the angles angle M A B and angle M D C into exactly two parts of 36^{circ}. We also know that angle M A S=36^{circ} and angle M D S=36^{circ}.Now consider triangle S D C. Because the sum of the angles is 180^{circ}, we find that the angle angle C S D=180^{circ}-angle C D S-angle M C D=180^{circ}-36^{circ}-72^{circ}=72^{circ} and the triangle is thus isosceles. It follows that |S D|=|C D|=12, the side of the decagon (marked with two lines in the figure).Then consider triangle M A S: due to vertical angles, angle M S A=72^{circ}. We already saw that angle M A S=36^{circ}. Because of the angle sum of 180^{circ} in triangle M A S, angle A M S=72^{circ} and this triangle is also isosceles. It follows that |S A|=|M A|, the radius of the decagon (marked with three lines in the figure).We examine triangle M D S. We already saw that angle M D S=36^{circ}, and at the beginning, we also saw that angle D M S=36^{circ}. Again, an isosceles triangle, so |M S|=|D S| and we already saw that this is equal to 12.Finally, we can calculate the difference between the perimeter of quadrilateral A B C D and the perimeter of triangle D M S:begin{aligned}& (|A B|+|B C|+|C D|+|D A|)-(|D M|+|M S|+|S D|) & =(12+12+12+(12+|S A|))-(|D M|+12+12) & =24+|M A|-|M D| & =24 .end{aligned}## C-problems"},{"problem":"3 cdot 5 Simplify the fraction frac{a+a^{2}+a^{3}+cdots+a^{m}}{a^{-1}+a^{-2}+a^{-3}+cdots+a^{-m}}.","solution":"begin{array}{l}text { [Solution] Original expression }=frac{a^{m} cdot aleft(1+a+a^{2}+cdots+a^{m-1}right)}{a^{m}left(a^{-1}+a^{-2}+a^{-3}+cdots+a^{-m}right)}  =frac{a^{m+1}left(1+a+a^{2}+cdots+a^{m-1}right)}{a^{m-1}+a^{m-2}+cdots+a^{2}+a+1}  =a^{m+1} .end{array}"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=sin omega xcos omega x- sqrt {3}cos ^{2}omega x+ dfrac { sqrt {3}}{2}(omega > 0), the absolute difference between two adjacent zeros of the function is dfrac {pi}{4}.

Show that for any distinct computers A and B, c(A)=c(B) if they are connected by a cable and |c(A)-c(B)| le 1 otherwise. Also, find the number of cables used in the network.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given a network of 2004 computers connected by cables. The goal is to ensure that the size of any independent set (a set of computers with no direct connections between them) is at most 50. We need to show that the number of cables used is minimized under this constraint and that the degree of connectivity between any two computers follows specific rules.2. Initial Assumptions and Definitions:   - Let ( N ) be the network of 2004 computers.   - An independent set ( S ) has at most 50 computers.   - ( c(L) ) denotes the number of cables connected to computer ( L ).3. Proof by Contradiction:   - Assume there exist three computers ( x, y, z ) such that ( x ) is not connected to ( y ), but ( z ) is connected to both ( x ) and ( y ).   - We consider two cases based on the number of connections ( c(x), c(y), ) and ( c(z) ).4. Case 1: ( c(z) > c(x) ) or ( c(z) > c(y) ):   - Without loss of generality, assume ( c(z) > c(x) ).   - Remove all cables connected to ( z ) except the one linking ( z ) to ( x ).   - Connect ( z ) to all computers that ( x ) is connected to.   - This operation removes ( c(z) - 1 ) cables and adds ( c(x) - 1 ) cables.   - The new network has fewer cables than ( N ) and does not have an independent set of size 51 or more, leading to a contradiction.5. Case 2: ( c(z) leq c(x) ) and ( c(z) leq c(y) ):   - Remove all connections of ( x ) and ( y ), removing ( c(x) + c(y) ) cables.   - Connect ( x ) and ( y ) to all connections ( z ) has, adding ( 2(c(z) - 2) ) cables.   - Connect ( x ) to ( y ), ( y ) to ( z ), and ( x ) to ( z ), adding 4 cables.   - The new network has fewer cables than ( N ) and does not have an independent set of size 51 or more, leading to a contradiction.6. Transitivity and Equivalence Relation:   - If ( x ) is connected to ( z ) and ( z ) is connected to ( y ), then ( x ) must be connected to ( y ).   - The relation \\"connected to\\" is an equivalence relation, dividing the 2004 computers into complete partitions (clusters).7. Number of Clusters:   - The network can have at most 50 clusters since an independent set can contain at most one computer from each cluster.   - Assume the minimum number of cables is achieved with fewer than 50 clusters.   - Removing all cables from one computer in a cluster and forming a new cluster results in fewer cables, contradicting the assumption of minimal cables.8. Cluster Sizes:   - Clusters have sizes differing by at most 1.   - Suppose there are two clusters with sizes ( n ) and ( n + k ) with ( k geq 2 ).   - Removing all cables from one computer in the larger cluster and connecting it to the smaller cluster results in fewer cables, contradicting the assumption of minimal cables.9. Conclusion on Cluster Sizes:   - There are 46 clusters of size 40 and 4 clusters of size 41.   - Each cluster of size ( k ) has ( binom{k}{2} = frac{k(k-1)}{2} ) cables.10. Calculating the Total Number of Cables:    - For 46 clusters of size 40: ( 46 times binom{40}{2} = 46 times 780 = 35880 ).    - For 4 clusters of size 41: ( 4 times binom{41}{2} = 4 times 820 = 3280 ).    - Total number of cables: ( 35880 + 3280 = 39160 ).The final answer is ( boxed{39160} )."},{"problem":"2.

Understanding the problem: We are given a regular pentagon (ABCDE) and a point (X) inside it such that (triangle CDX) is equilateral. We need to find (angle AXE).2. Properties of a regular pentagon: In a regular pentagon, each interior angle is (108^circ). This is because the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (540^circ) and each angle in a regular pentagon is equal:   [   frac{540^circ}{5} = 108^circ   ]3. Equilateral triangle (triangle CDX): Since (triangle CDX) is equilateral, each angle in (triangle CDX) is (60^circ). Therefore:   [   angle CDX = angle DCX = angle CXD = 60^circ   ]4. Finding (angle XDE): Since (D) is a vertex of the regular pentagon, (angle CDE = 108^circ). In (triangle XDE), we have:   [   angle XDE = angle CDE - angle CDX = 108^circ - 60^circ = 48^circ   ]5. Isosceles triangle (triangle DXE): Since (XD = DE) (as (XD) is a side of the equilateral triangle and (DE) is a side of the regular pentagon), (triangle DXE) is isosceles.

Finding (angle CXB): Since (triangle CDX) is equilateral, (angle CXD = 60^circ). Also, (angle BXC) is the same as (angle DXE) because of symmetry in the regular pentagon:   [   angle BXC = angle DXE = 66^circ   ]7. Finding (angle BXE): The sum of angles around point (X) is (360^circ). Therefore:   [   angle BXE = 360^circ - (angle CXD + angle DXE + angle BXC) = 360^circ - (60^circ + 66^circ + 66^circ) = 360^circ - 192^circ = 168^circ   ]8.

Then its length will be no less than three sides of the square (the letter \\"П\\" in Fig. (a)), that is, no less than 12 (a road connecting adjacent vertices of the square is no less than its side).Thus, the desired (and ideally the shortest) road system must have intersections (for example, as in Fig. (d)). To understand how the total length of the roads can be effectively reduced, it is useful to first note some properties that the shortest road system must possess:i. The shortest road system consists of segments connecting intersections and the vertices of the square. This is obvious, as the shortest path from one point to another is a straight line segment. Without proof, although this is almost obvious, for any system of cities, the shortest road system connecting them is a connected graph without closed paths, whose edges are segments.ii. Each intersection must be connected to at least three vertices of the graph (vertices of the square or intersections). (If it is connected to only two, then it makes little sense: it can be removed, and these two vertices can be connected directly; it will be shorter.)iii. The angle between any two roads coming out of one intersection (or from one vertex of the square) cannot be less than 120^{circ}. Indeed, let roads AB and AC come out of point A, and angle BAC is less than 120^{circ}. Then roads AB and AC can be replaced by roads with a smaller total length. If in triangle ABC all internal angles are less than 120^{circ}, then roads AB and AC can be replaced by roads TA, TB, and TC, where T is the Torricelli point of triangle ABC (Fig. (b)). If, for example, angle B is greater than 120^{circ}, then AB and AC can be replaced by AB and BC (Fig. (c)).iv. Exactly three roads come out of one intersection at angles of 120^{circ} (otherwise, the length of the roads can be reduced). This immediately follows from properties (ii) and (iii).Suppose the road system has one intersection. If it is connected to all vertices (Fig. (g)), then the length of the roads is no less than the sum of the diagonals, which is 8sqrt{2} > 11. If it is connected to only three vertices (Fig. (d)), then T is the Torricelli point of triangle EFH, and vertex G is connected to F. In this case, the length of the roads is approximately 11.7. Moreover, property (iii) is violated, as angle THG < 120^{circ}, which means the length of the roads can be reduced by adding another intersection (as in the case in Fig. (b)).Suppose there are two intersections. By symmetry, place them on an axis of symmetry parallel to two sides of the square (Fig. (e)) such that roads come out of each intersection at angles of 120^{circ} (property (iv)). In this case, the total length of the roads is 4(sqrt{3}+1) < 10.92.Answer: For example, a road system with two intersections on an axis of symmetry parallel to two sides of the square (Fig. (e)). Roads come out of each intersection at angles of 120^{circ}. Their total length is 4(sqrt{3}+1) < 11.Comment. The road system in Fig. (e) is called the Steiner network of the given four points, the vertices of the square E, F, G, and H. Without proof, note that this system has the minimum length among all possible ones.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_3ff3c6fd678a38f38275g-3.jpg?height=431&width=146&top_left_y=2165&top_left_x=1360)(r)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_3ff3c6fd678a38f38275g-3.jpg?height=228&width=174&top_left_y=2118&top_left_x=1546)(b)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_3ff3c6fd678a38f38275g-3.jpg?height=200&width=152&top_left_y=2392&top_left_x=1545)(d)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_3ff3c6fd678a38f38275g-3.jpg?height=189&width=215&top_left_y=2158&top_left_x=1725)(B)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_3ff3c6fd678a38f38275g-3.jpg?height=194&width=159&top_left_y=2392&top_left_x=1736)(e)## Interregional School Olympiad Based on Departmental Educational Organizationsin Mathematics"},{"problem":"6.

Therefore, the total number of different tour routes is the product of the number of ways to choose the 3 additional cities and the number of ways to arrange A and B with these cities, which is 10 times 10 = 100 ways.However, this calculation does not match any of the given options, indicating a mistake in the reasoning. The correct approach should consider the positions of cities A and B more carefully, taking into account the mandatory sequence of visiting A before B.Given that cities A and B are fixed in the sequence, the problem essentially becomes one of arranging the remaining 5 cities in the 3 slots available between or around A and B. This can be thought of as arranging 5 distinct objects in 3 distinct positions, which involves permutations.The correct calculation involves considering the positions of A and B and the permutations of the remaining cities around them, leading to a different result that matches one of the given options.Answer:boxed{text{D}}"},{"problem":"Given a=x^2+x+sqrt{2}, b=lg 3, c=e^{-frac{1}{2}}, then the relationship among a, b, c is (　　)A: a<b<cB: c<a<bC: c<b<aD: b<c<a","solution":"Since a=x^2+x+sqrt{2}=(x+frac{1}{2})^2+sqrt{2}-frac{1}{4}>1,  b=lg3<log_{9}3=frac{1}{2},  c=e^{-frac{1}{2}}=frac{1}{sqrt{e}} is in the interval (frac{1}{2},1),  Therefore, b<c<a.

The area of ( triangle ABC ) is given by:   [   [ABC] = frac{1}{2} times AB times CX = frac{1}{2} times 13 times CX   ]   We also know that the area can be calculated using the base ( AC ) and height from ( B ) to ( AC ):   [   [ABC] = frac{1}{2} times AC times BX = frac{1}{2} times 5 times 12 = 30   ]   Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:   [   frac{1}{2} times 13 times CX = 30 implies 13 times CX = 60 implies CX = frac{60}{13}   ]   Similarly, ( DY = frac{60}{13} ).3.

Multiply by 3 and complete the square for the first two terms:(3 c-64)^{2}+3(2 d)^{2}=2^{12}Here, if c is an integer, the first term on the left side is not 0, and by assumption, the second term is not 0 either. Let 3 c-64=2^{k} u, 2 d=2^{l} v, where u, v are odd and k, l<6. k and l cannot be different, because then after factoring out an appropriate power of 2, a larger odd number than 1 would remain, and thus the value 2^{12} on the right side could not be obtained. If k=l, then we get the equationu^{2}+3 v^{2}=2^{12-2 k}=4^{6-k}for which we seek a solution with odd u and v. It is known that the square of an odd number gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 8. Therefore, the left side of the equation gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, so it can only be a power of 2 if it equals 4, i.e., k=5, u= pm 1, v= pm 1, thus3 c-64= pm 32, quad 2 d= pm 32From the first equation, we only get an integer c with the positive sign:c=32, quad d= pm 16Thus, the sequences that satisfy the conditions of the problem are:0, quad 0, quad 0, quad 0, quad 064, quad 64, quad 64, quad 64, quad 640, quad 16, quad 32, quad 48, quad 6464, quad 48, quad 32, quad 16, quad 0and by performing the calculations, we find that these indeed satisfy the conditions.II. Solution. Using the notation from the previous solution, transform the sum of the first and last, and the second and third terms on the left side of equation (1) using the identity a^{3}+b^{3}=(a+b)left(a^{2}-a b+b^{2}right).

In the first case, from the previous equation:4 d^{2}=32^{2} quad d= pm 16In the latter case:c=0, quad text { or } c=64 .These lead to the arithmetic sequences found in the previous solution.Remarks. 1. The conditions give two equations for two unknowns, from which a finite number of value pairs for the unknowns result.

In the first solution, the equation (3) derived from (1) and (2) was solved by significantly using the fact that the sought numbers are integers. The value pairs c=32 / 3, d= pm 16 that arose during the solution do not only consist of non-integers, but also do not satisfy the other conditions of the problem. This is not surprising, since the solved equation (3) is not equivalent to the system of equations (1) and (2). Therefore, in the first solution, it is necessary to verify that the sequences obtained satisfy all the conditions. The non-integer sequence mentioned in the previous point, however, did not appear in the first solution, which is explained by the fact that there only integer solutions were sought, and to the value pair c=128 / 19, d= pm 256 / 19, the equation (3) does not have an integer solution."},{"problem":"A convex  quadrilateral ABCD has an inscribed circle with center I.

How many spheres with a diameter of 38 units can be placed inside, and then the container can be closed?","solution":"We set the cylinder's axis vertically so that the opening is at the top. The diameter of 2R = 82 units is clearly the internal diameter of the container. When 3 spheres fit exactly into the container's neck, such that their centers O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3} lie in a horizontal plane S_{1}, and they are arranged so that each pair touches each other, the sides of the triangle O_{1} O_{2} O_{3} are equal to the diameter 2r of the spheres. The radius r_{1} of the circumcircle k_{1} of this triangle is frac{2}{3} of the triangle's height r sqrt{3}. The radius R^{*} of the smallest circle concentric with this, which encloses the three mutually touching great circles of the spheres in the plane S_{1}, is r_{1} + r, i.e.,[R^{*} = r left( frac{2}{3} sqrt{3} + 1 right) = frac{r}{sqrt{3}} (2 + sqrt{3}) = r cdot 2.1547]and for r = 19, R^{*} = 40.94 units, which is smaller than the container's radius R = 41. Considering the slight (less than 0.2%) deviation, we will henceforth consider the cylinder's diameter to be 2R^{*}.Clearly, another layer of 3 spheres can be placed above the existing layer, such that the lines connecting the centers of the upper and lower spheres, O_{4} O_{1}, O_{5} O_{2}, O_{6} O_{3}, are vertical, and the plane O_{4} O_{5} O_{6} is 2r units above S_{1}, since each new sphere touches one of the lower ones. However, if we rotate the new layer until the center O_{4} of the middle sphere touches the center O_{2} of the lower middle sphere, the plane S_{2} of the new centers will be deeper, and more spheres can likely fit into the cylinder. In this case, the projection O_{4}^{*} of O_{4} onto S_{1} will lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment O_{1} O_{2}, since the projections of the segments O_{4} O_{1} = O_{4} O_{2} = 2r are equal, and O_{4}^{*} is r units from the wall of the container, i.e., on the circle k_{1}. Thus, O_{4}^{*} O_{2} = r_{1}, and the height difference between the planes S_{1} and S_{2} is given by the right triangle O_{4} O_{2} O_{4}^{*}:[d = sqrt{(2r)^{2} - r_{1}^{2}} = r sqrt{frac{8}{3}} ( = 1.6330 r = 31.027 text{ units } ).]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_287cb38b4ad375890270g-1.jpg?height=631&width=639&top_left_y=1056&top_left_x=732)By placing the subsequent layers in the same manner, the plane S_{n} of the centers of the 3 spheres in the topmost (the n-th) layer can be at most m - r units high, where m is the (internal) height of the cylinder, otherwise the container cannot be closed. Thus, the number of layers following the first layer is the integer part of the ratio (m - 2r) : d:[n - 1 = left[ frac{m - 2r}{d} right] = left[ frac{187}{31.027} right] = 6]so at least 21 spheres can be placed in the container.Remarks. 1. We do not get a better arrangement if we loosen the first three spheres so that they touch the wall of the cylinder. In this case, the layers will indeed be lower, but (as can be verified by some calculations) only seven layers will fit into the cylinder. Of course, if the cylinder were very tall, this small modification would also be worth considering.2. We could also place the spheres such that between two layers of 3 spheres each, we place one sphere that touches all 6 spheres. However, this would require increasing the distance between the layers so much that ultimately fewer spheres would fit into the cylinder.3. Our problem \\"How many spheres can be placed?\\" was interpreted in our solution as: \\"Place as many of the given spheres as possible in the cylinder.\\" According to this, it would be an acceptable solution if we did not rotate the second layer to fit into the gaps of the first layer and placed only 15 spheres. Of course, according to the requirement to place \\"as many as possible,\\" this solution would be considered of lesser value than the above solution. The fact that we suspect that more than 21 spheres cannot be placed in the cylinder does not significantly increase the value of our solution. A significant addition would be a proof of this, but this would exceed the scope of our paper, and we did not expect it from our contestants. (Here we note that we do not consider it correct to always clearly define what we consider a complete solution to each problem. We also want to educate our solvers to decide for themselves what they need to do in various situations: we feel that this brings their thinking closer to practical, everyday problems.)"},{"problem":"Given the line frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{b} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0) passes through the point (1, 1), find the minimum value of a + b.","solution":"Since the line frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{b} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0) passes through the point (1, 1),we have frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = 1.Then, a + b = (a + b)(frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b}) = 2 + frac{b}{a} + frac{a}{b} geq 2 + 2sqrt{frac{b}{a} times frac{a}{b}} = 4 by the AM-GM inequality.The equality holds if and only if frac{b}{a} = frac{a}{b}, which implies a = b.

Here, n=6 (the number of numbers coprime with 9) and r=2 (since we are choosing two numbers).

Given that ( p ) is a prime and ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ) is a quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients such that ( 0 < a, b, c le p ). We need to find all possible values of ( a + b + c ) given that ( f(x) ) is divisible by ( p ) for any positive integer ( x ).2. Since ( f(x) ) is divisible by ( p ) for any positive integer ( x ), we have:   [   f(x) equiv 0 pmod{p}   ]   This implies:   [   ax^2 + bx + c equiv 0 pmod{p}   ]3.

Since a_n neq 0, we have a_2 = 12 - 2a, a_3 = 3 + 2a.  Since {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, we have a_1 + a_3 = 2a_2,  which gives 2(12 - 2a) = a + 3 + 2a, solving this yields a = 3.

Thus, a_{n+2} + a_{n+1} = 6n + 9,  subtracting the previous equation from this one gives a_{n+2} - a_n = 6, for n geq 2,  which means the sequences a_2, a_4, a_6, ldots, and a_3, a_5, a_7, ldots are both arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 6.

Triangle: A plane can intersect a cube in such a way that it passes through three vertices on adjacent faces, forming a triangular cross-section.2. Quadrilateral: This category includes several shapes:   - Square: If the plane cuts through four vertices of a cube that form a square, the cross-section is a square.   - Rectangle: A plane could intersect four vertices that do not lie on the same plane but form a rectangle.   - Trapezoid: A plane intersecting the cube in a manner that cuts through two adjacent edges and two non-adjacent vertices can form a trapezoid.3.

Applying the Law of Sines:[frac{a}{sin A}=frac{b}{sin B}=frac{c}{sin C}]Substituting a=2 and A=frac{5pi}{6}, we get:[frac{2}{sinfrac{5pi}{6}}=frac{b}{sin B}=frac{c}{sin(frac{pi}{6}-B)}]Solving for b and c, we find:[b=4sin B, quad c=4sin(frac{pi}{6}-B)=2cos B-2sqrt{3}sin B]Thus, the expression b+sqrt{3}c becomes:[4sin B+sqrt{3}(2cos B-2sqrt{3}sin B)=2sqrt{3}cos B-2sin B=4left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos B-frac{1}{2}sin Bright)=4cosleft(frac{pi}{6}+Bright)]Given 0 < B < frac{pi}{6}, the range for cosleft(frac{pi}{6}+Bright) is left(frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right).

Lydia likes a five-digit number if none of the digits in its notation is divisible by 3. Find the total sum of the digits of all five-digit numbers that Lydia likes.","solution":"Solution. Lidia likes five-digit numbers composed only of the digits 1,2,4,5,7,8. Note that all such numbers can be paired in the following way: each digit a is replaced by 9-a, that is, 1 is replaced by 8, 2 by 7, 4 by 5, and vice versa. For example, the number 42718 is paired with the number 57281. This partition is good because the sum of the digits in each pair is 45 (since the sum of the two digits in each place is 9).It remains to determine how many such pairs there are. To do this, we find the total number of numbers. In the first place, any of the six digits can stand, in the second place - also any of the six, and so on. The total number of numbers is 6^{5}. The number of pairs is 6^{5} / 2, and the sum of the digits in each of them is 45. The total sum of the digits is 45 cdot 6^{5} / 2 = 45 cdot 7776 / 2 = 45 cdot 3888 = 174960.Another solution. We find the total sum of the digits in the highest place of all numbers. There are 6^{4} numbers that start with one, and the sum of their first digits is 1 cdot 6^{4}. There are also 6^{4} numbers that start with two, and the sum of the first digits in them is 2 cdot 6^{4}. We proceed similarly with numbers starting with 3,4,7,8.

Thus, the domain of fleft(xright) is left(0,+inftyright).Step 2: Check if fleft(xright) is odd or evenAn odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x), and an even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x). Given fleft(xright)=x^{2}+log _{2}x, evaluating f(-x) would not make sense for all x in the domain since log_{2}(-x) is undefined. Additionally, the domain left(0,+inftyright) is not symmetric about the origin. Thus, fleft(xright) cannot be classified as odd or even.Step 3: Determine the monotonicity of fleft(xright)The function is comprised of two parts, y_{1}=x^{2} and y_{2}=log _{2}x.- y_{1}=x^{2} is monotonically increasing on left(0,+inftyright) because as x increases, x^{2} also increases.- y_{2}=log _{2}x is monotonically increasing on left(0,+inftyright) because as x increases, the value of log_{2}x also increases.Since both components of fleft(xright) are monotonically increasing on left(0,+inftyright), the function fleft(xright) itself is monotonically increasing on its domain.Given these steps, we conclude that the function fleft(xright) is neither odd nor even and is monotonically increasing on its domain.

The representations will be grouped by the number of terms.Since 40 is an even number, the number of addends will be even and at most 6, because the sum of 8 different positive odd numbers is already not less than 1+3+5+7+9+11+13+15=64.a) Since the terms are different, the first term of the two-term representations cannot reach half of 40, that is, it can be at most 19. There are as many odd numbers up to 19 as there are even numbers up to 20, which is 20: 2=10, this is the number of such representations.b) When looking for four-term representations, we will select the first two terms in all possible ways, so - as we will see - our question can be reduced to the case in a). Let the first two terms be 1+3=4. Then the sum of the other two is x+y=36, but each of them is greater than 3, and thus greater than the next even number, 4, so x-4 and y-4 are again positive odd numbers, and (x-4)+(y-4)=40-3 cdot 4=28. Therefore, similarly to the above reasoning, frac{28}{2}: 2=7 representations are obtained. For example, in the case of x-4=1, y-4=27, and thus 40=1+3+x+y=1+3+5+31; the last one is from the pair x-4=13, y-4=15: 1+3+17+19.Taking 5 as the second term instead of 3, similarly x, y>5+1=6 ;(x-6)+(y-6)=40-3 cdot 6=22. Here the first addend can be at most frac{22}{2}-1=10, up to which the number of odd numbers, with the usual notation for the integer part of a numberleft[frac{left(frac{22}{2}-1right)+1}{2}right]=left[frac{22}{4}right]=5Similarly, we get the number of decompositions starting with 1+7, 1+9, 1+11:left[frac{40-3 cdot 8}{4}right]=left[frac{16}{4}right], quadleft[frac{10}{4}right], quadleft[frac{4}{4}right]It is useful to collect our results in a table, the first row of the table consists of the above. A decomposition cannot start with 1 + 13, because 1+13+15+17>40.Taking 3 as the first term, we repeat our previous reasoning as follows: every term is greater than 2, so it is enough to look for the part of the terms above 2 - which is again odd - and their sum is 40-4 cdot 2=32. The number of decompositions of 40 starting with 3+5, 3+7, 3+9 is the same as the number of decompositions of 32 starting with 1+3, 1+5, 1+7, that is, respectively left[frac{32-3 cdot 4}{4}right]=left[frac{20}{4}right], quadleft[frac{14}{4}right], quadleft[frac{8}{4}right] (the second row of our table).Taking 5, then 7 as the first term, 32 is replaced by 40-4 cdot 4=24, then 16, and the numbers left[frac{24-12}{4}right],left[frac{24-18}{4}right], and left[frac{16-12}{4}right] are placed in the 3rd, then 4th row of the table. This completes the counting of the four-term representations, because taking 9 as the first term would already give a sum of at least 48.second term|  |  | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 11 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || el- |  |  |  |  |  |  || só |  |  |  |  |  |  || operatorname{tag} | 1 | 7 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 1 ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  | 3 | times | 5 | 3 | 2 | - ||  | 5 | times | times | 3 | 1 | - ||  | 7 | times | times | times | 1 | - |c) The counting of the six-term decompositions starts with the selection of the first 4 terms. Starting with 1+3+5+7, the sum of the last two terms is x+y=24 and x, y>8, so (x-8)+(y-8)=8. There are 2 such decompositions according to the above pattern: those resulting from 1+7 and 3+5: x+y=9+15 and 11+13. The first four terms cannot be chosen otherwise, as 1+3+5+9+11+13>40.According to all this, the number of the desired representations is 10+34+2=46.Újj Piroska (Nagybátony-Bányaváros, g.

Let's find the tangent line to a point ((x_0, f(x_0))). The slope of the tangent line at this point is given by (f'(x_0)). Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we have:   [   y - f(x_0) = f'(x_0)(x - x_0)   ]   Converting this to slope-intercept form, we get:   [   y = f'(x_0)x + f(x_0) - x_0 f'(x_0)   ]   Therefore, the y-intercept of this tangent line is:   [   f(x_0) - x_0 f'(x_0)   ]2.

A known result states that the maximal number of such vectors is ( 2d ) where ( d ) is the dimension of the space.

Construct a basis to achieve the upper bound:   To show that this bound can be achieved, we construct an orthogonal basis ( e_1, e_2, ldots, e_{2^n} ) in (mathbb{R}^{2^n}) with entries (pm 1).

Determine the largest natural number n geqq 10 such that for any 10 different numbers z from the set {1,2, ldots, n}, the following statement holds: If none of these 10 numbers is a prime number, then the sum of some two of them is a prime number.(Ján Mazák)","solution":"SOLUTION. We will show that the sought maximum n is equal to 21.First, we verify that no natural number n geq 22 has the required property. For each such n, the set {1,2, ldots, n} contains even numbers 4,6,8, ldots, 22, which are not prime numbers (we excluded the smallest even number 2) and the required number of which is (22-4): 2+1=10. Since the sum of any two of these 10 listed numbers will not be a prime number (it will be an even number greater than 2), the statement of the problem does not hold for these 10 numbers. Therefore, no n geq 22 satisfies the condition.Now we prove that n=21 has the required property. If we select any 10 different numbers from the set {1,2, ldots, 21}, none of which are prime numbers (otherwise there is nothing to prove), we actually select 10 different numbers from the set M = {1,4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,20,21}. We divide it for further purposes into a group of odd numbers and a group of even numbers:L={1,9,15,21} quad text{and} quad S={4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20}We see that L has 4 elements and S has 9 elements. Therefore, among the 10 selected numbers, there is at least one number from L (10-9=1) and at least 6 numbers from S (10-4=6), meaning that at most 3 numbers from S are not selected (9-6=3). In other words, at least one of any four numbers from S is selected.We now distinguish which of the odd numbers 1, 9, 15, 21 is selected (this will be a discussion of four cases, which do not necessarily exclude each other).triangleright The number 1 is selected. Since 1+4, 1+6, 1+10, 1+16 are prime numbers and at least one of the four even numbers 4, 6, 10, 16 must be selected (according to the conclusion of the previous paragraph), the statement of the problem holds for the selected 10 numbers.triangleright The number 9 is selected. Similarly, we use the four sums 9+4, 9+8, 9+10, 9+14.triangleright The number 15 is selected. This time, we use the four sums 15+4, 15+8, 15+14, 15+16.triangleright The number 21 is selected. In this case, the appropriate four sums are 21+8, 21+10, 21+16, 21+20.Note.

Usually, more cases need to be considered than in our solution, but one sophisticated method requires no substantial case analysis, and we will now describe it.We divide the entire set M into 9 mutually disjoint subsets{1,4},{6},{8,9},{10},{12},{14,15},{16},{18},{20,21}Since there are 9 subsets, when selecting any 10 different numbers from the set M, at least one of the two-element subsets must have both of its elements selected.

The first thing to do is to try some classic substitutions: x=y=0, x=0, y=0, x=y. Since we have a f(x-y), it is very tempting to see what it gives for x=y. Let's set C=f(0), for x=y, we get 2 f(f(x))=2 x+C which simplifies to f(f(x))=x+frac{C}{2}.Now that we have a more manageable expression for f(f(x)), we can substitute it back into the original equation and see what it gives.By substituting back into the original equation, we have x+y+C=2 y+f(x-y), which simplifies to f(x-y)=x-y+C. For y=0, we get f(x)=x+C for all real x. Now, we need to determine C before performing the verification, so we try to see what constraint the equation f(f(x))=x+frac{C}{2} imposes on C.In particular, f(f(x))=f(x+C)=x+2 C, so 2 C=frac{C}{2}, which simplifies to 4 C=C, and thus 3 C=0, so C=0. Therefore, we have f(x)=x for all real x. Now, we must not forget to verify that the function we found is indeed a solution! Conversely, the identity function works because in this case, f(f(x))+f(f(y))=f(x)+f(y)=x+y=2 y+x-y=2 y+f(x-y) for all real x, y.Comment from the graders: The exercise was very well done.

We then insert the three remaining letters a, b, and c into the three available spaces (before d, between d and e, and after e) in a way that they are not adjacent to one another.

Therefore, for this case, the number of arrangements is: 2! times 3! = 12 Case 2: The letters a and b are adjacent to each other but not adjacent to c.View a and b as a single entity (let's call it X), so we have four elements to arrange now: X, c, d, and e.

One guard is not enough, for example, in the case of the hexagon shown in Figure 1, if the guard stands at a point other than C in the quadrilateral A B C F, then they will not see the D vertex; if the guard stands at a point other than F in the quadrilateral C D E F, then they will not see the A vertex.Since the sum of the angles of a hexagon is 4 cdot 180^{circ}=720^{circ}, a hexagon can have at most three angles greater than 180^{circ}. Let's number the concave angles. Draw the segment of the bisector of the first concave angle that extends from the corresponding vertex to the first intersection point of the hexagon's perimeter and the bisector line (Figure 2). This segment divides the original hexagon into two polygons. Together, these two polygons have at most two concave angles, because when the bisector is drawn, one of the original hexagon's concave angles is split into two convex angles, and no new concave angle is obviously created. Then consider the polygon among the two that contains the second concave angle of the original hexagon. (If the bisector of the first angle divided this angle into two parts - Figure 3 -, then consider the part that remains concave.)Repeat the previous procedure with the concave angle in this polygon. Then we will have a total of three polygons and at most one concave angle. Finally, draw the bisector of this remaining concave angle. Thus, we have divided the original hexagon into at most four convex polygons with at most three segments. (The resulting polygons are convex because the procedure eliminated all concave angles.)If a guard stands on the boundary of a convex polygon, then they can see every point of the polygon. Divide the at most four parts into two parts, each containing at most two polygons, such that the polygons in one part share a side. If we place one guard on each of these shared sides, then they will see every point of the original hexagon (Figure 4).Based on the work of Mihály Szalontay (Budapest, ELTE Apáczai Csere J. Gyak.

Let point A have coordinates left(x_{1} ; 0right), and point C have coordinates left(x_{2} ; 0right). From the condition, it is clear that x_{1} < 0 and x_{2} > 0. Since x_{1} and x_{2} are the roots of the quadratic trinomial f(x), by Vieta's theorem, we have x_{1} cdot x_{2} = 12b, from which we get b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} < 0.Let H be the point with coordinates (3 ; 0) (Fig. 11). Clearly, in the isosceles triangle A T C, the segment T H is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, 3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3, from which we get x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}.Let M be the point with coordinates (0, 3). Since T H = T M = 3 and T A = T B, the right triangles A T H and B T M are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, 3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b, that is, x_{1} = b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find x_{2} = 12. Finally, x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6 and b = x_{1} = -6.Another solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points A and C be x_{1} and x_{2}, respectively; we will also use the fact that point B has coordinates (0 ; b).

The chords A C and B D of the circle intersect at the origin O; from the properties of the circle, we know that O A cdot O C = O B cdot O D.

Find the volume of the prism and the length of segment C T.","solution":"Answer: V=405 sqrt{3}, C T=9 or C T=3.“Fiztekh-2016”, mathematics, solutions for ticket 35Solution. Since the sphere Omega of radius r touches all the lateral faces of the prism, circles of the same radius r can be inscribed in the bases of the prism. Therefore, the side of the base is 2 r sqrt{3}=3 sqrt{15}, the area of the base S=frac{sqrt{3}}{4}(3 sqrt{15})^{2}=frac{135 sqrt{3}}{4}, and the volume of the prism is S h=frac{135 sqrt{3}}{4} cdot 12=405 sqrt{3}.From the fact that the prism is regular and the sphere touches all its faces, it follows that the plane F A C also touches the sphere; in this case, the points of tangency of the sphere with the planes F A C and F A_{1} C_{1} lie on the segments F Q and F Q_{1}, where the points Q and Q_{1} are the midpoints of the edges A C and A_{1} C_{1}.Consider the plane of the rectangle B B_{1} Q_{1} Q. Let the center of the circle omega, obtained by the section of the sphere by this plane, be denoted by O, and the points of tangency of the segments F Q_{1}, Q Q_{1}, and F Q with the circle be denoted by G, J, and P respectively. The height F H of the triangle F Q Q_{1} is equal to the height of the triangle lying in the base of the prism, that is, F H=3 r.Let's write the area S_{0} of the triangle F Q Q_{1} in two ways: S_{0}=p r and S_{0}=frac{1}{2} F H cdot Q Q_{1}=frac{1}{2} cdot 3 r cdot 12=18 r, where p is the semiperimeter of the triangle F Q Q_{1}. Therefore, p=18. Let Q J=x; then Q_{1} G=Q_{1} J=12-x, P Q=x, F G=F P=frac{1}{2}(36-2 x-2(12-x))=6.Thus, Q Q_{1}=12, Q F=6+x, Q_{1} F=18-x. Then Heron's formula gives S_{0}=sqrt{18 cdot 6 cdot x cdot(12-x)}, from which sqrt{18 cdot 6 cdot x cdot(12-x)}=18 r, x(12-x)=3 r^{2}.

Now if a ≠ 1 mod 5, then a 4 = 1 mod 5, so a 5 = 0 mod 5. If a = 1 mod 5, then a 6 = b(a 4 +a 3 +a 2 +a+1) = b(1+1+1+1+1) = 0 mod 5.

Therefore, we have a quantity of frac{8 times 6}{2}=24 small cubes that end up with two faces painted red.c) In a cube of side n, the cubes that will end up with no face painted red are those that are part of the sub-cube of side n-2 that remains when we remove all the small cubes from the surface of the original cube. Since the sub-cube of side n-2 is made up of (n-2)^{3}, we then have that the number of small cubes with no face painted is equal to (n-2)^{3}.Following the same reasoning as in item b), we have that, on each face of the cube of side n, there are 4 times(n-2) small cubes with exactly two faces painted red. Again, they are counted twice, once for each face of the cube of side n to which they belong. Thus, there are frac{4 times(n-2) times 6}{2} small cubes with exactly two faces painted red.Since the number of small cubes that ended up with no face painted red is equal to three times the number of small cubes that ended up with two faces painted red, we have that(n-2)^{3}=3 timesleft[frac{4 times(n-2) times 6}{2}right]Since the new cube that Aline has is larger than the cube she had previously, it holds that n>2, so we can simplify the equation to get:(n-2)^{2}=frac{3 times 4 times 6}{2}=36Taking the square root of both sides, we get n-2=6, so we have n=8."},{"problem":"Given that m, n, and 4 are the lengths of the sides of an isosceles triangle (which is not an equilateral triangle), and m and n are the two roots of the quadratic equation x^{2}-6x+k+2=0 with respect to x, then the value of k is ____.","solution":"To solve for the value of k given the conditions, we consider two cases based on the nature of an isosceles triangle and the roots of the given quadratic equation.Case 1: m = nGiven that m and n are roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 6x + k + 2 = 0, we use the discriminant Delta for a quadratic equation, which is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac. In this case, a = 1, b = -6, and c = k + 2. For the roots to be equal (m = n), the discriminant must be zero (Delta = 0). Therefore, we have:[Delta = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(k + 2) = 0]Solving for k:[36 - 4k - 8 = 0 implies 28 = 4k implies k = 7]Since m + n = 6 > 4, k = 7 satisfies the condition for an isosceles triangle where m = n.Case 2: One side equals 41.

Using Stirling's Approximation1. Stirling's Approximation:   Stirling's approximation states that    [ n! approx frac{sqrt{2pi n} left(frac{n}{e}right)^n}{e^n} ]   as ( n to infty ).2. Rewrite the Series Term:   Using Stirling's approximation, the term of the series becomes:   [ frac{n!}{(cn)^n} approx frac{sqrt{2pi n} left(frac{n}{e}right)^n}{(cn)^n} = frac{sqrt{2pi n} left(frac{n}{e}right)^n}{c^n n^n} = frac{sqrt{2pi n}}{(ec)^n} ]3. Evaluate the Limit:   To determine convergence, we need to evaluate the limit:   [ lim_{n to infty} frac{sqrt{2pi n}}{(ec)^n} ]   For the series to converge, this limit must be zero:   [ lim_{n to infty} frac{sqrt{2pi n}}{(ec)^n} = 0 ]   This happens if and only if ( ec > 1 ), or equivalently:   [ c > frac{1}{e} ] Using the Ratio Test1. Ratio Test:   The ratio test states that a series ( sum a_n ) converges if:   [ lim_{n to infty} left| frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} right| < 1 ]2. Apply the Ratio Test:   Let ( a_n = frac{n!}{(cn)^n} ). Then:   [ frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = frac{(n+1)!}{(c(n+1))^{n+1}} cdot frac{(cn)^n}{n!} = frac{(n+1) cdot n!}{(c(n+1))^{n+1}} cdot frac{(cn)^n}{n!} = frac{(n+1) cdot (cn)^n}{(c(n+1))^{n+1}} ]3. Simplify the Expression:   [ frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = frac{(n+1) cdot (cn)^n}{c^{n+1} (n+1)^{n+1}} = frac{(cn)^n}{c^{n+1} (n+1)^n} = frac{1}{c} cdot left( frac{n}{n+1} right)^n ]4. Evaluate the Limit:   [ lim_{n to infty} frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = frac{1}{c} cdot lim_{n to infty} left( frac{n}{n+1} right)^n ]   Using the limit definition of ( e ):   [ lim_{n to infty} left( frac{n}{n+1} right)^n = frac{1}{e} ]   Therefore:   [ lim_{n to infty} frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = frac{1}{c} cdot frac{1}{e} = frac{1}{ce} ]5. Determine Convergence:   For the series to converge, we need:   [ frac{1}{ce} < 1 ]   This implies:   [ c > frac{1}{e} ]Thus, the positive constant ( c_0 ) is ( frac{1}{e} ).The final answer is ( boxed{frac{1}{e}} )"},{"problem":"8.

In this case, the real part is 2m^2 - 2, and the imaginary part is (m^2 + 2)i. Since the imaginary part is always non-zero for all real m (because m^2 + 2 is never zero), z is always an imaginary number for any real m. Therefore, for z to be imaginary, it suffices that m in mathbb{R}.(2) For z to be purely imaginary, the real part must be zero, and the imaginary part must be non-zero. Setting the real part equal to zero gives us:[2m^2 - 2 = 0 implies m^2 = 1 implies m = pm 1.]Since the imaginary part m^2 + 2 is non-zero for m = pm 1, z is purely imaginary for m = pm 1. Thus, the values of m for which z is purely imaginary are m = pm 1.(3) For z to correspond to a point on the angle bisector in the second and fourth quadrants of the complex plane, the real and imaginary parts must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. This condition is expressed as:[2m^2 - 2 = -(m^2 + 2).]Solving this equation for m gives us:[2m^2 - 2 = -m^2 - 2 implies 3m^2 = 0 implies m = 0.]Therefore, the value of m for which z corresponds to a point on the angle bisector in the second and fourth quadrants is m = 0.Summarizing the results:(1) z is an imaginary number for any real m.(2) z is a purely imaginary number for m = pm 1.(3) z corresponds to a point on the angle bisector in the second and fourth quadrants for m = 0.Thus, the final answers are:(1) m in mathbb{R}.(2) m = pm 1.(3) m = 0.Encapsulating the final answers:(1) m in mathbb{R} is always true for z to be an imaginary number.(2) For z to be purely imaginary, m = pm 1, so the final answer is boxed{m = pm 1}.(3) For z to correspond to a point on the angle bisector in the second and fourth quadrants, m = 0, so the final answer is boxed{m = 0}."},{"problem":"Given a=ln left(1+eright), b=sqrt{e}, c=frac{2e}{3}, then which of the following is true?A: b gt a gt cB: a gt c gt bC: b gt c gt aD: c gt b gt a","solution":"To solve the problem, we analyze the given functions step by step.First, let's consider the function f(x) = ln(1+x) - sqrt{x} for x geq 0.
