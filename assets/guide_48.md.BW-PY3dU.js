June 14 I experienced the most excruciating pain when I tried to stand. I was rushed by ambulance to the ER to find the stem had slipped down into the femur and my femur was fractured. Surgery was repeated, I went through lots of physical therapy, and then developed a large blood clot in the leg. Recuperating still, now I experience LOTS of heel pain and major burning in both heels. People have said it s pressure sores developing. I only see the skin peeling on my heels but no open sores appearing. Can you help?","Doctor":"Cannot directly diagnose, treat, or prescribe without being there but can give general information.Pressure sores occur in the context of not being able to move and having all the weight bear down and hurt the circulation to an area and to mechanically abrade it. Furthermore, there can be INTERNAL soreness of the muscles when there is pressure onto the muscles as they are pressed onto bones inside. There are standard treatments:Not having continuing pressure on the area by repositioningNot having continuing pressure on the area by having a soft compressible spongey thing over it to absorb pressure. If there are open wounds putting medicated salves on it; possibly needing antibiotics.Aspirin like drugs help the pain often."},{"Patient":"When stepping on the ball of my left foot I get severe pain across the top of my foot. It started as just annoying pain whenever I was on my feet for long periods of time ( I am a waitress) Now I cannot even make it three hours into my shift without it becoming unbearable pain","Doctor":"cannot say what in your particular case without direct examination.But I can say everything that is in the foot includes bones, joints, tendons, circulation, and muscle. WIth a lot of pressure there can be stress fractures of the bone. They give intense, constant pain. The joints and tendons can get strained. This occurs most in the part of the foot with the most bend (the middle at the top or in the arch). This area goes up and down in pain during the day. It goes up with use, It hurts when that part is bent etiher by flexing the foot or by directly moving that area. Muscle can hurt; they have a particular muscle ache. There are not prominent muscles in the top middle of the foot, more joints and tendons. Circulation can make the whole foot ache and there has to be signs of poor circulation. The pain comes either with use, with blue swelling, or with lack of blood, being pale/white/cold and achy with use but would be the whole foot (really really doubtful in this case).Joints and tendons are helped with changes  in shoes and activity, wtih aspirin like drugs, and rest with gradual buiding up use with physical therapy."},{"Patient":"I HAVE TERRFIC PAIN IN MY RIGHT HEEL AND HAVE BEEN ICING IT REGULARLY BUT I DO NOT SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE PAIN LEVEL. IS THERE SOMETHING I AM MISSING","Doctor":"If  you have been having more pain in the early morning hours andif it is at bottom of the heel and not at the back of heel ,most likely you are suffering from a condition known as plantar fascitis, which is not a worrisome condition.The soft tissue at the bottom of heel because of aging becomes inelastic and tight and cause pain ;more while walking.If the complaints are of short duration (less  than six weeks) you will be benefitted with a short course of painkillers like diclofenac,physiotherapy including local ultrasonic rays and stretching exercises for the lower calf and plantar fascia .However you will need xrays and blood investigations like CBC,ESR, Blood Sugar, Sr.uric acid ,if you fail to get relieved after a week to ten days of the treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi there. About 30 hours ago now, I was hit in the chin with a basketball really hard. I felt my head rattle in an unnatural way, and pain in my head. I brushed it off and kept playing for about 15 more minutes. When I got home, I felt pain in the front of my head, I felt a bit weak and disoriented. I slept a few hours later, for 8 hours, woke myself up every three to two hours. My symptoms now are fatigue, slight disorientation, and most recently, stomach pains, almost like cramps. I didn t go to the hospital, so I d like to know what else I should do to help myself?","Doctor":"Cannot say in your particular case. Certainly signs of concussion include headache, disorientation, fatigue, wanting to withdrawal, being irritable and being irritated by light/noise/other sensory inputs. Concussions last at least hours and more likely days. There is increased risk for SERIOUS consequences if further injuries occur DURING a concussion and so, rest and avoiding further risk of concussions is strongly advised.But, this isn't irritation of the stomach. That can certainly occur with any stress. And in this case minor treatments like antacids are somewhat helpful."},{"Patient":"I had a blood test taken 3days ago and it was the most painful blood test is ever had, I had a sharp needle pain in lower to where the blood was taken and a sharp shooting pain.

Please help me ?","Doctor":"this is very unusual, obviously. The type of pain and 'shooting' imply a nerve is hit. THere are not major nerves in that area but certainly everywhere there are SOME nerves. With neuropathic pain:1) short run any nerve pill such as a lidocaine patch (you need ONE, cut into 2 cm squares, apply one 2x2 daily), anti-seizure med, or amitryptiline are likely to work at quite low cost2) long term minor nerves usually grow back ok.cannot say in your particular case."},{"Patient":"I am an amputee and have been so quite a long time. My problem is severe pain in the stump. On a scale of 1to10 it is a 10. These pains come on rather quickly about every few months and last at least a day.

Thank you, Bobby","Doctor":"quite  a lot. Any 'nerve pill' is likely to work:lidocaine patchanti-epileptics such as gabapentinamitryptilineand many others.

The gas is still in my body CO2 is it in my muscle tissues. I m still taking pain meds and I just think it s too long? What or how long is this body aching going to last","Doctor":"No, the carbon dioxide, a gas, goes out with breathing. We breathe a lot per minute so the gas moves very quickly out after surgery. The pain issue would depend on where the pain is. \\"The Body\\" implies the ache is everywhere. There really really rarely can be muscle breakdown after surgery due to a very rare interaction if the medications were right and your genetics were wrong (it is a rare interaction of genetic predisposition and some anaesthesia medicines). You don't have it; if the muscle break down from RHABDOMYALYSIS, the muscle goes into the urine and the urine is muscle colored. You would have noticed.Then, movement is changed by surgery and people invariably lay wrong with it. You did have this. It goes away generally in 1-3 days. If longer, it can in general be helped by over the counter aspirin like drugs, but anyone after surgery needs to have clearance that these drugs are safe to take.Increasing movement, warm showers, some physical therapy are all beneficial."},{"Patient":"Hi, my girlfriend woke up this morning with chronic neck pain. At first i thought it was just a stiff neck from sleeping funny,But she was unable to get out of bed or get dressed with out the pain just bringing her to an halt. The pain is in the left side of the neck, and no where else. It s more concerning that she was unable to move with out the pain which then shoots into the neck.","Doctor":"Hi there. Thanks for your question at HCMThe term chronic neck pain is usually used to describe neck pain which has lasted for more than 6 weeks at the least.I think in your girl friends scenario it can be termed as acute onset sever neck pain.Neck pain can usually caused due to varied etiologies involving the structures in neck mainly the nerves, muscles, disc, joints and abnormal posture. Pain restricted to neck only and which is not shooting down the arms is suggestive of pain arising from the muscles, joints, bones or disc.Pain arising from the nerves usually shoots down the arm into fingers and associated with numbness. Analgesics either taken orally as tablets or as local applications in the form gel or lotions have soothening effect and relive pain most of the times. Ice gel application can help during the initial few days. If the pain still persists after medications for a week physiotherapy under prescription in the form of neck strengthening exercises, ultrasonic massage can help provided your girl friend has no contraindications to such therapy. If the pain persists for a over 6 weeks, I would suggest her to visit an Orthopaedic, so that at least a baseline X ray and thorough examination can be done . Based on these and her response to medicines and physiotherapy, she might require an MRI. But neck pain usually resolves with medicines, rest and physiotherapy in majority of patients suffering from the same.Hope this helps youAll the best.

It is advisable for to try 3 to 4 months of non-operative treatment in the form of physiotherapy, analgesic, injections when indicated , activity modification before advising surgery for pain that is manegeable. IF you have tried these and you are able to manage with your pain, there is no need of urgent surgery. On the other hand surgery is warranted if 1.Your daily activates of daily living are affected due to the pain. 2. Your pain is unresponsive to the non-operative measures over 3 to 4 months. 3. You have new onset weakness or sensory loss. 4. Severe stenosis or pressure on your nerves seen on your MRI which correlates with your pain pattern. 5.

The cervical neck pain usually reduces over 2 to 3 months. Since you are already progressing so well, it can be expected that you will get better with time. If you are working on a computer, there are several posture related adjustments, which can help you to fasten your recovery and help you maintain your cervical spine strength over time .Ergonomics is the field of science which deals with such adjustments. I would suggest you to go through websites which deal with ergonomics for working on a computer and adopt those postures.

What do I do about it? It was really bad yesterday. Scale of 1-10, it was an 8 pain level.  I have been doing physical therapy but was told by my surgeon to stop the PT for a week and see what happens.  What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi there Thanks for your question at HCM Groin pain is most commonly associated with strain of of the muscles, ligaments, or tendons present in that area. This is more likely if the onset of your pain is associated with any injury which happened while playing or after you slipped or twisted.Such pain would usually respond over 2 to 3 days to rest, pain killer medicines and ice applicationAnother common cause of groin pain is an inguinal hernia. An inguinal hernia occurs when internal tissues push through a weak spot in the groin muscles. This can create a bulging lump in your groin area and cause pain. Kidney stones (small, hard mineral deposits in the kidneys and bladder) or bone fractures can cause groin pain as well.On the other hand if you have been having pain for more than week and it has not responded to the above measures then other cause of one sided groin pain have to be considered. These include urinary tract infection, any inflammation in ovaries ( in females) and testes (in males), intestinal inflammation, hip joint related pain etc Groin pain due to pinched nerve in the spine is relatively uncommon and  is usually associated with involvement at higher spinal levels mainly L2/3/4 levels. An L4/5 and L5/S1 problem is less likely to be associated with groin pain. At present there is not enough evidence to say that your L5/S1 disc is the reason for you groin pain.I would suggest you to see an orthopaedic surgeon , so that any lesion around the hip area can be ruled out and once that is done other less common cause can be ruled out in a step wise manner based on your response.

To detox, I went to a pain management clinic and was prescribed 0.1 mg. clonidine HCL TID the first day and was told to start buprenorphine 8-2 mg SL BID the following morning. I had to stop the suboxone after the first day as I developed severe itching (mostly face and scalp). I had two C-sections (the last in 2000) and experienced the same side effect (severe itching) after being given morphine. My questions: How long is typical for someone to detox from the amount of hydrocodone I was taking and length of time I was on it? Is it necessary to take both clonidine and suboxone to detox from hydrocodone? Can I detox on clonidine alone? Is severe itching a side effect of either/both suboxone and/or clonidine? Many thanks.","Doctor":"There are several stages in detox. For the acute withdrawal symptoms 1-2 weeks. But there are several other features of addiction such as the altered mentation, cravings, triggered use that require a longer period of time. clonidine helps some people with the initial symptoms of withdrawal (such as agitation, and goose flesh). But that is all clonidine does. Suboxone blocks the effects of other narcotics taken legally or illegally along with it. As such it provides a safe haven for evaluating ones relationship to narcotics. Severe itching is not a common reaction to either clonidine nor suboxone, but it is more common with suboxone."},{"Patient":"My 11 year old daughter s knee hurts when she puts weight on it or when she dances.

In the short run aches and pains can be treated by rest, ice, appropriate aspirin like drugs for age and size.BUTthere are overuse injuries in growing people that are more complex, serious, and trickier to judge than for people who's bones/tendon/joints are all where they are supposed to wind up.

Should I see a doctor or just give the injury more time to heal?","Doctor":"cannot say in your particular case, but generally,sprains and strains are not severe pain and limiting movement with an ace helps the pain.

I don t seem to have any relief with the pain and was wondering if there was any other medication that can help with chronic pain thank you","Doctor":"Hello and welcome.Besides actual NARCOTIC pain relievers, TRAMADOL 50mg (8 and 8 hours) is a very good substitute.Doctors usually give Gabapentin because, in my opinion, they are pompass and stupid. Gabapentin is NOT a pain killer (yes it helps with pain) but in my professinal opinion should NOT be used as such.TRAMADOL 50mg is a much better solution. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR. Tell him you want something stronger.If you are not afraid of the Opiate route with \\"harder\\" opiates, you can try a Codeine Phosphate based medication (not sure of your country so I can't say a brandname) but they have pills that contain ONLY Codeine Phosphate in 30mg and 60mg pills (most countries) which are NOT AS ADDICTIVE as Hydrocodone and Oxycodone, so this is my recomendation.HOWEVER YOU NEED A PLAN as you can NOT STAY ON THESE FOREVER.I would reccomend PHYSICAL THERAPY together while taking medication, and then a withdrawal plan to come off of the medication and then go to typical Over The Counter meds like Ibuprofen (Advil) and Tylenol.I hope this helps - I do not like to promote opiate use, but some people DO NEED THEM - Also opiates do not generally cause weightgain.It is very common for Gabapentin/Neurontin to be prescribed for pain when doctors are against opiates, and I love to argue with them as they are stupid for not caring about their patient. YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO CONTROL YOUR PAIN.I really think TRAMADOL 50mg x 02 a day should be a good starter trial. Perhaps try it for 30 days and see how it works out, then maybe move down to only one pill at night.I CAN NOT LEGALLY DIAGNOSE OR TELL YOU TO DO THIS - YOU MUST DO THIS VIA YOUR PERSONAL GP/DOCTOR!Thank you, but I hope i did help you with your decisions.Stay away from Lyrica....Always - I don't think it is a good drug for people, it can cause more problems than not."},{"Patient":"Hi I have fibromyalgia, crohns disease, Rls, degenerative disc disease , manic depressive, hashimotos thyritis.i also hav e adhd and manic depressive headaches, belly pain bleeding rectally.

It can make you more productive, and working with a benzodiazipine with a long half-life like Clonazepam (Other BRAND names worldwide = RIVOTRIL, KLONOPIN, CLOPAN) and combine that with PRN (as needed) Tramadol or perhaps \\"Tylenol 03) (Codeine Phosphate 30mg with 500mg of APAP (paracetemol)My opinion of course.

He has a lot of pain in his back shoulders and hip. He has lost fourth pounds. He cannot walk without a cane and falls often. He has very high blood pressure even though he is on three blood pressure meds. He has no appetite and has been unable to function sexually for over ten years. He has sweats throughout the day. His blood tests have come back normal but his chest xray showed a shadow. The dr wanted him to wait six weeks and take another chest xray which he did. We are still waiting for results. He also has adrenal tumor. What could be wrong?","Doctor":"Quite a lot of possibilities. First on the back pain a list of some of the highlights. The spinal nerves that go to the back, also go to the sexual organs. Also, cancers can do quite a lot of things BUT they grow fairly fast so, a cancer causing problems for 10 years seems very unlikely. An adrenal tumor that is NOT cancer can go for many years affecting blood pressure, giving sweats and making someone feel very uncomfortable, BUT would not invade bone and spine.Therefore ONE thing is unlikely to be the cause of all the issues, and they didn't all come on at one time 10 yrs ago. Back pain can be one cause (see linkage) and other problems could come from adrenal, lung, or other tumor or cancer. Measuring adrenal hormones and other simple blood tests can augment imaging studies(which should also include the adrenals AND chest)"},{"Patient":"I had a wisdom tooth extracted on the bottom left and have dry socket now, my dentist packed it with a medicated gauze yesterday and  now I'm hurting with lots of pressure in jaw and temple area and jaw running down my jaw line and the front of my neck.

You should not touch that area while brushing and don't touch with finger or tongue. Do warm saline gargles as it will suppress infection soon. Maintain proper oral hygiene. Do rinses with Listerine mouth wash. Take pain killer such as Motrin for pain relief. Apply  numbing gel and Lignocaine over the stitches for numbing the area and causing relief discomfort. Don't open mouth too wide. Visit oral surgeon once and get it examined and start treatment accordingly.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"I work as a route salesman in a truck, so I m pretty active for twelve hours a day running my route getting out from my truck to and from houses.

I am a 23 year old boy who is a native of India currently living in UKI have been having pain in the inside of the right side cheek for the past five days. There is no pain either in the teeth or gums. It seems like inflammation. But If I touch in that area with my area, I cannot feel any inflammed part or I cannot see any inflammation if I look through the mirror. One doctor here checked whether it is mouth ulser and she said it was not. however she was not able to suggest a cure.This thing is painful all through the day and especially painful when I eat and extremely painful when I yawn. I used to get this condition sometimes when I was a child. My mom used to tell me that it is because of the body getting heated up and used to give me some food that she said would cool the body. But I don't remember what she used to give. I am from India (hot climate) and so used to get this condition often. but it has never stayed more than two days. Now I am in UKI don't have any other medical condition presently and I am not taking any medicine regularly. Hope I gave enough information to help you diagnose what the cause may be. I am extremely thankful for this service. I just found this website accidentally and I like it very muchRegards,Srikanth","Doctor":"Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concern...As per your complain if there is no apparent inflammation or ulceration on the inner cheek where you have pain and the pain aggravates on eating and yawning it seems most probably a NEUROPATHIC PAIN due to nerve inflammation and irritation..You need not to worry and apply a numbing gel over the painful area containing Lignocaine..You can take Ibuprofen for reducing inflammation and pain..Gradually as the irritation will reduce pain will subside..In case if there is no improvement consult a Neurophysician who can do a thorough clinical evaluation and if required he can advise you to take anticonvulsant painkillers like Gabapantin as it helps in relieving nerve induced pain..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora.."},{"Patient":"I have facial swelling on the right side of my face and sore gums and tooth that is bugging me.

I am married since 4years and we have been trying for babies since last 2years now. We haven't yet succeeded. My scan reports are normal and I have undergone through all necessary medication and tests recommended by my Gynecologist. Also, my husbands Semen Analysis report was normal till the recently tested now but, the last test made said that his semen count is low (14million) and the motile/active cells are low. Hence a doctor here suggested him to take Proficient 5000UI.M injection once a week and two tablets (Fertly M - 25mg and Carnimed - 500) daily for 2 months. It's been one month he took and no improvement. May I please know whether the suggested medicines are apt for Men? Because once my Gync. suggested me to take the Fertyl M - 25mg medicine. I am skeptical about my husband taking it. Please help me!Thanks, V.P","Doctor":"Hi, Good day and thank you for being with healthcare magic! Yes Fertyl-M is used also in men to improve semen parameters. Mostly the life cycle of sperm to reach maturity is 72 days on the average roughly after three months. That being said you have to take the medicine for three months then repeat the semen test. Also it is also advised to lose weight, eat healthy food and exercise. Hope I have answered your query.

During this time (within first year) I developed Fibromyelgia, Chronic Fatigue, Anxiety, a feeling that I ve lost some sensation and co-ordination in my hands and patches of skin that occasionally become supersensitive. I used to feel intoxicated while working in the lab but by the time I got home was super aggressive and angry. I no longer feel intoxicated when working with it. After 4 years I noticed when working with Xylene my face began to burn/itch. In the last two weeks I have developed irritation in the Trachea immediately after commencing a major project with Xylene. It settles down when I go home but immediately on entering the lab the trachea gets irritated and I cough. How do I know if it is the Xylene causing me problems?","Doctor":"Xylene is a pretty toxic organic solvent. It certainly affects the liver, and liver function tests are necessary. Likely also to affect nerves. A nerve conduction test can show if the nerves are sick BUT, there isn't good treatment for it except stop exposure and hope. It would take months for the nerves to correct themselves. Then lung exposure to xylene can cause lung fibrosis. This is testable with lung function tests (x ray, spirometry, but mainly diffusion testing)."},{"Patient":"Hello, I slipped and fell on some ice on Mondaybut I felt fine that evening.

This is where CT myelogram helps us spine Surgeons since the artifacts are less and severity of stenosis can be assessed independent of the screws. The injection in your back is essential to inject contrast fulid into your spine which will line up or light up the areas of interest.

Despite the advances of modern spine surgery we still don't have formidable treatment options for axial neck pain. Axial pain is pain exactly at the area of your spine. Though the pain radiating to arms and shoulders subside, some amount of nexk pain does remain after cervical spin e surgeries. Some times this can be attributed to arthritis of joints at the back of Spine. In such scenarios radio frequency ablation can be used to ablate the small nerve fibers whcih supply these pain causing joints. This has been found to go ve some pain relief in axial neck pain .Hope this helps. All the best. Regards. Dr.SBK"},{"Patient":"I have a question about wrist pains.

I don't think it would bother me as a dcotor if you presented with this kind of pain. As the solution is to avoid doing movements which cause you pain.

I'm sorry for your situation. If I understood it well, you injured your finger more than two months ago. Usually, this type of injury are very painful, but tend to heal fully within a couple of weeks. Since you are still experiencing pain and lack of functionality it means that there is still some damaged inflamed tissue. I suspect that the injury was more severe then you thought. In order to prevent chronic issues with your finger, I recommend to not ignore anymore this problem. First of all you should do an x-ray to rule out any possible fracture or healing in the wrong position. One other possibility is ligament injury.

I understand your concern. Initial therapy for anal fissure is relieving the constipation and the associated pain. Softer bowel movements are easier and less painful to pass. So, first line therapy include stool-bulking agents (fiber supplementation and stool softeners). Laxatives are used as needed. Mineral oil might facilitate passage of stool without as much stretching of anal mucosa, but is not recommended for indefinite use. I recommend to you to try Sitz baths since it provides symptomatic relief. If the above measures and conservative therapies don't help, you can try the second line therapies, like intra-anal application of glycerol nitrate (0.4% nitroglicerin) ointment directly in the anus. WARNING: Nitroglicerin ointment is often untolerated by patients, due to side effects like headaches and dizziness. If after 3-4 weeks of medical therapy anal fissures remain symptomatic, that I recommend to consult a surgeon for possible surgical treatment.Feel free for additional questions.

I read your question carefully and I understand your concern. From the information you gave, the first thing I suspect is muscle strain. The suspicion for this condition is even higher after you have done examination, even a CT scan. Regarding the Amoxicilin therapy, it is an antibiotic and I can't find a reason for taking that, but for sure the doctor that prescribed it had a reason for that. I do have some questions though. Is the pain localized in you abdomen or between the lower ribs in your right side. The pain is steady or it begins or worsens with movemens? Do you have any swelling or bruising? Is it tender when you touch it? If it is more localized between your ribs, it gets worse with movements or sneezing or deep breathing, it might be tender when you touch it than probably it is just muscle strain (as I said you excluded major conditions with examination. Beside this, the condition how it started (stretching to much to get something) and an acute onset, all lead to muscle strain. In general, muscle sprain can be treated with RICE therapy - rest, Ice application, Compress and Exercise. To alleviate the pain you could take pain medication like ibuprofen or naproxen. It is necessary to limit the movement of the torso (rest, but just the firs days). Gentle stretching exercises can help strenthen the muscles. Pain can be alleviated applying an ice pack for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times a day (ice should not be in direct contact with the skin). For a full recovery it can take 4-6 weeks. Feel free for additional questions. I hope the answer helped you. Best regards"},{"Patient":"Hey, I slipped while I was walking onto the porch today. It was raining and I caught myself but when I did my big toe slammed into the side of the step and my toe nail pushed up my toe really hurts even after ice and the nail place it self back what do I do or what can I do about it","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern. Actually, I need more information regarding your problem, for example how many days have passed since your big toe trauma, is there a blue/black discoloration of the toe, have you noticed any pus around or beneath the toe nail, is your big toe all red and warm? I will try to include all possible options. Since it's a trauma, I don't think that you have an ingrown toenail (unguis incarnatus). The pain you have is due to trauma of the toenail itself and the surrounding tissue by the toenail.    You can take over the counter pain killers but I don't think it will help to much. In order to get the best management you can consult your primary doctor, so he/she can see objectively  your issue, since the treatments include from simple local wound care to removal (partial or total) of your toenail, antibiotics and regular local wound dressing (it depends on severity of trauma, weather it is infected or not). Your doctor also have to visit you objectively, to rule out also a possible bone trauma of your big toe (but in the way you describe the trauma, I don't think that's your situation)I'm at your disposal if you have additional questions. I hope my answer helped. Wishing you a good health If you can, in order for me to give you the best advice, is to send me a picture of your traumatized toe."},{"Patient":"Stopped tramadol cold turkey 19 days ago.

I am using a fiber powder. Nothing helps. My stomach is hard and looks like a beach ball. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"First, tramadol has narcotic effects on teh bowel like any other narcotic. Constipation during taking it and diarrhea after stopping with other withdrawal effects. This would typically settle down 1-2 weeks after quitting, but varies somewhat.Bowel narcotics like imodium stop diarrhea from narcotic withdrawal. And, obviously there is potential for tolerance, addiction and withdrawal from it too even if it does not get out of the gut (return of the withdrawlal gut symptoms when quitting it). Also, stomach pain with increased tone is often a sign of a serious condition that is NOT related to tramadol... This can include serious problems like bowel infection/inflammation or other serious bowel conditions. A lot of pain medication can mask pain from a bowel condition and only appear afterwards, but the hardness of the abdomen is typically present even if the pain is suppressed."},{"Patient":"My wounded warrior brother was fx with fibromyalgia now he can t get out of bed, can t get into bathroom he is up high steps a big guy in a lot of pain, I flew in from Los angles to this country town just outside of New Orleans. He is on neoproxin can he take his nor on also","Doctor":"Hi and . Your question is very unique and requires a unique treatment. Treatment programs for individuals with fibromyalgia have been diverse and varied, and as yet no one single treatment has worked for every patient. Some patients have reported partial symptom relief with tricyclic drugs , while others have experienced success with traditional modalities such as heat and ice. Treatment through active stretching, postural education, body mechanics, and other forms of therapy has also provided some benefits. Specifically, it has become apparent that persons with fibromyalgia benefit from aerobic conditioning and other exercise programs. According to standards for fitness developed by the American Heart Association for a normal population, showed that 80% of patients with fibromyalgia are physically unfit.For your brother it is important to start with simple , painless excercises , initially, by a method called Feldenkrais method. In Feldenkrais method individuals perform small, gentle movement patterns, usually in a group setting, in response to verbal or written cues. The movements are self-directed and performed within each person's comfort range. Mental imagery of the movements is encouraged if the movements are perceived by the patient or the instructor to be too difficult. Mental imagery is also occasionally used as part of the lesson for all participants. Mental imagery has been widely studied and documented for its positive effects on learning. Also, the individual is guided hands-on by a Feldenkrais practitioner, who may be a physical therapist, through gentle and slow movements.I hope this information is helpful to you.

Can I wait to see a doctor or should I go to the emergency room, or just wait to see if it gets better. This has happened before about 3 times in the last few months. I am on my feet all day on a hard concrete floor and am quite a bit overweight","Doctor":"A sudden stabbing pain in the thigh is not only painful, but it shoots through the leg causing discomfort. It could happen when you twist the leg, sit in a wrong position, or because of muscle dysfunctions. Early diagnosis of the condition prevents chronic conditions that can impede movement and routine operations. Some symptoms could be signals of serious infections.Clinical TreatmentsOften, when symptoms persist, it is advisable to consult a medical expert in the area. Such pains have different underlying causes which determine the mode of treatment. Prolonged severe pain is particularly a medical concern. A medical doctor will diagnose, and recommend the appropriate treatment. Some of the clinical solutions include:Pain Killers. For pain relief, an anti-inflammatory drug is appropriate. You can take aspirins or ibuprofen to ease the pain and reduce the inflammation.Thigh Wraps. A physiotherapist could recommend the use of elastic bands in the case of muscle pulls. This reduces the swelling and muscle strains. Thigh wraps are effective in sports related muscle pains.Injection. An injection to reduce pain is one solution to the inflammation. A corticosteroid injection reduces the risk of severe swelling and pain. It should be offered by a doctor. In case of severe pain, the physician can administer an injection of a corticosteroid preparation to reduce the risk of inflammation.Surgery. Sometimes surgery is an option in the treatment of thigh pain. It is often recommended for cases of growth, benign cancer, and compartment syndrome. In such conditions, surgery becomes an effective solution to ease the pain in the affected area."},{"Patient":"I just started nicotine replacement patches today and placed the patch on my hip.

These products do not contain the toxins found in smoke. The goal of therapy is to cut down on cravings for nicotine and ease the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.Nicotine replacement therapy is of the most help for people who smoke more than 15 cigarettes a day. It is not yet proven to help people who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day.Facts about using nicotine replacement therapy:You have 10 times higher chance of quitting permanently if you do not cheat on the first day of use. The more cigarettes you smoke, the higher the dose you may need to start.Do not smoke while using nicotine replacement. It can cause nicotine to build up to toxic levels.Nicotine replacement helps prevent weight gain while you are using it.

Sometimes I hold my urine because I dont like going to the bathroom in some places, and my mom said that could be a possible reason. But I need a definately answer. The pain can last from 3-5 minutes to half a day.","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concerns. The pain in pelvic area you feel when you have to pass the wind or take a poop might be because gas or fecal mass makes the end of colon (rectum) become distended. Most possibly, your urinary vesicle has gone inflammed/infected as you have the habit to hold the urine. Holding the urine will make you more prone to urinary tract infections (UTI). Thus, distended colon can press to inflamed vesicle causing the pain. Colitis itself can also be a cause to the pain you feel in the pelvic area. To my opinion, you need an immediate evaluation and further diagnostic tests including:- urine analysis- abdominal ultrasoundHope it was of help!Dr.Albana"},{"Patient":"Hello, I dropped a very heavy oak bench on my foot about two months ago. I watched the entire top of my foot just blow up with blood/swelling with in seconds after right before my eyes, it grew, to the point it stretched the skin taunt. I did go to the ER as it was very painful. I had an xray done and was told it was not broken, however I did feel like I was being treated as tho I was only seeking pain meds, which I did not ask for and will not even take. I felt rather foolish to begin with, and I ve tried to ignore the pain since and its made me not want to seek further medical care for it. Its been a little over two months, and while most of the bruising is gone, there is still bruising and swelling present, all the way up into my ankle.

I was told to use crutches and to follow up with an ortho but again, I felt completely dejected after my er visit, and embarrassed. I did not take the crutches because I was told it wasn t broken, and I was given a shoe for it but the shoe was too incredibly painful to wear (as it buckles over the top and is very heavy).

My doctor prescribed Cymbalta, but after reading the long list of side effects I really don't want to take it. I'm supposed to meet with him this week. Is there an alternative medicine you can think of for me to ask for? Right now, I'm just taking ibuprofen which does very little. I just want something to cut the pain enough for me to sleep. I'm searching for a new neurologist. This one is not very good.","Doctor":"Pain from MS can be very difficult to treat and for the patient to deal with. I like to try and control the pain with a multi-modal approach, that way you attain the most benefit. For starters I think you should definitely start taking some neuropathic, or nerve pain controlling, medications. A good start would be with gabapentin. Typically you will start at 300mg daily and slowly increase overtime to a dose which helps you and avoids side effects. Another excellent option is a tricyclic antidepressant, called pamelor. Pamelor is very old, cheap, and highly efficacious. Typically i start at 25mg nightly. This will not only help with pain, but will help you to sleep better as well. Now other than pharmaceuticals solutions, another great option is nutraceuticals ( vitamins and supplements). I would recommend a vitamin regimen that includes vitamin D3 ( cholcalciferol) 1000 units twice a day to help with pain, inflammation. Also start taking a vitamin B complex ( containing B3, B6, B12) as this helps with nerve related pain and helps decrease further nervous system damage. Lastly I would start taking magnesium citrate 500mg nightly, to aid in better sleep and help with pain ( magnesium citrate is absorbed the best by your body, so be sure it is this formulation). If the pain persists and you begin having more tingling/unpleasant sensations, another option would be alpha lipoic acid 600mg twice daily. These suggestions are all proven to be effective in the medical literature and I use them on a daily basis for my MS patients. I hope that this helps and I hope you feel better soon! Good luck!"},{"Patient":"The last few times I have ate beef (usually tacos at a Mexican restaurant) I have pain around my umbilical area.

For starters, I definitely do not recommend going to a chiropractor or a urgent care. My main concern is that you fell onto the back of your head and also that you are unable to lift your arms. This could be due to multiple causes : rotator cuff injury or tear, cervical disc bulge, subdural hematoma, or even a epidural hematoma. You should definitely make an appointment to see your primary care physician or even just go to your nearest ER for evaluation. If you start having symptoms of nausea, vision changes, lethargy or somnolence than this is even more concerning and you need to go to the ER immediately.

I would avoid any narcotics. Depending on which theory you believe on fibromyalgia either it is a syndrome of depression (narcotics bad), dysregulation of the opiate receptors so they don't work (narcotics useless and bad) or some odd inflammatory condition (narcotics bad). Antiinflammatories should be tried. Amitryptiline often helps. muscle relaxants often help.

During childhood, I had recurrent UTI s and had both and urologist and nephrologist that did every test imaginable, without any answers. They ended up keeping me on antibiotics for a hear and a half continuously and that seemed to fix the problem for a long time. Starting in early adulthood I started having chronic hematuria usually accompanied with protien with occasional UTI s. They wanted to repeat all the tests and did with still no answers. I have continued having microscopic hematuria for about the last ten years but otherwise unsymptomatic. However, the past three months has been another story. I thought I have had several serious UTI s but go and urinalysis and culture reveal it s not but there is the highest amount of gross hematuria there can be. They do an in and out catheter each time thinking I m on my period but it is same with catherization. There is low back pain and dull abdominal pain with pulsating urinary pain (which is currently the cause for me to be awake at 3 am), increase in frequency (particularly at night). Also a few nights ago I fell asleep hurting and woke up urinating on myself (not leaking but full urinating). I have gone to urologist and he said perhaps to do another cystiscope and for me to continue to take peridian. I have never encouraged any testing, every time before has been at the doctor s prompt demand but I feel like maybe it is time to run all the tests again? By the way, I have had ultrasounds, ct scans, cystiscope, ivp dyes, etc. in basically two waves, once when young and once a few years after chronic hematuria and protein. What tests would you recommend? Any insight? Also, should I be following up with urologist or nephrologist? I haven t seen the nephrologist since I was 13. Thanks.","Doctor":"hi with this chronic urinary tract infectiom &  haematuria, you have to regularly visit the urologist or nephrologist, so that you may not land up in urosepsis,or hydroneprosis or later going for contracted kidneys which can be dangerous.

It is like squeezing type and more over inside the chest and associated with sweating. Sometimes radiating to neck shoulder.

I also have a weird sensation down the side of my hand when I touch it. I have taped the 2 fingers together for the 3 weeks but it doesn t seem to be getting any better. Any Advice please","Doctor":"I suggest to take a x-ray of your finger and get it checked by orthopedic to rule out hair line crack. If there is crack then need to plaster it properly. And you should not move it for 3 weeks.If there is no crack and only soft tissue strain, with out having any open wound I suggest to use cold pack. As well visit a physiotherapist for ultrasound therapy treatment which helps to heal soft tissue.This will take some more time to give relief but as you have told swelling is reduces and there was a skin color change at the time of injury and that is also reduce. And now you have only pain in fingerThat means it is healing but taking some time. If there is no hairline crack then you can take some pain killer at night before you sleep and make sure you Dont sleep on your affected finger.If one thing you have not mention is about pain, is it reducing , increasing, or the same.?At anytime you feel the pain is increasing then do contact orthopedic doctor because you may need anti biotic medication also to prevent infection.Take care"},{"Patient":"thank you I am diagnosed with fm and rheumatoid spec twenty years ago in newmarket and dr bykerk Mississauga I am desparetly in need of something for pain I thought I could get along without the med walk in clinic dr sent in blood work to a pain spec in barrie do not knowhow and have not heard anything for a month thanks Helen jarvi","Doctor":"The basic resion of fibromylgia is stress, anxiety, improper sleep, and disturb lifestyle with mental stress.There are three drugs which can be given for fibromylgia:1. Pregabaline : helps to reduce anxiety and sleep disturbance.2. Cymbalta and 3. Savella: both this are anti depressant.  For permanant good relief I suggest my patient to improve their life style have good balance diet, proper sleep and rest, keep positive attitude towards any thing, and exercise regularly.Here for fibromylgia regular exercise like stretching of pain full muscles and progressing towards strengthening the same muscles also help a lot for pain relief. But here the exercise has to be started on a gradual mode.Apart from this, regular body warm up exercise like cycling and walking also helps for fibromylgia patient.Your next question was for treatment on rheumatoid: here understand what happens with patient who are rhematoid positive. There will be auto immune inflamation in body which will damage not only the harmful cells but also the normal body cells and so that patient will have complain of pain and inflammation, swelling etc.Here again the best treatment I suggest my patient is keep your self active. Do different joints and muscles mobility and flexibility exercise it will help a lot to reduce the inflammation and so that the condition will not progress.Here for both fibromylgia as well rheumatoid also there is anti inflammatory diet available. Talk to your dietician to have more idea on it.For detail exercise program. you can again check with your physiotherapist.And for medication do not start on your own but check with your doctor.

No need to take her to urgent care.Now for her neck pain I suggest to give her hot pack frequently for 15 minute each time with light heat. And post use of hot pack apply some pain relieving ointment. If this together give her relief then its fine. If not then you need to visit a orthopedic or physiotherapist take x ray and see there is nothing wrong.

Along with this I suggest to do regular basic yoga, and paranayama, keep your food habit healthy, take proper rest and do regular cardio exercise like walking or cycling up to the possible level.

Have following issue after I went appendix surgery in the month of oct 2013. Recently for last 2 weeks experiencing following 1) stools are black. 2) not having feel of complete motion. 3) sometimes pain in testicle and in lower abdomen. Down full abdomen scan. No fault found. Took medicene for testicle pain and abdomen infection but still no go. Pls advise on treatment and medicines.","Doctor":"I am sorry to hear about your pain. First off, having black stools is very worrisome as this commonly is referred to as melena, or bloody stool ( digested blood from your upper Gi tract causes your stool to become black in color). If this is persistent you need to see your primary care physician immediately for further evaluation. Now i also see you recently had some type of abdominal infection, hopefully you completed your antibiotics for this and have followed up with the prescribing physician. In regards to pain in the lower abdomen and into the testicle following any lower abdominal surgery, the a common cause is ilioinguinal or genitofemoral neuralgia ( nerve pain). Another possible cause would be a inguinal hernia, which can develop from straining. I would recommend seeing your primary care for a careful physical exam to help differentiate between these two possible causes. I hope you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"I tried water skiing last Sunday and I did the splits most if the time when I fell. Now the pain is so bad where I did the splits it hurts to walk! Do you have any suggestions on how I can ease the pain? I work thirds and it almost makes my job impossible to do!","Doctor":"Ouch, that sounds painful. Sorry to hear about the pain. Based on your symptoms, the cause is likely due to a muscle strain or pull in the adductor muscles of your thigh ( groin muscles). This is a common injury when you have a fall in the position in which you have fallen. Your best bet at this point is to stretch the area regulalry, holding each strecth for 15-30 seconds and performing this as much as possible during your waking hours. I would also suggest using a Over the counter anti-inflammatory such as aleve or ibuprofen. In the next few days you should use more regulalry and then you can gradually stop using these. If the pain persists for longer than a week, I suggest you go to your primary care and have a full evaluation to rule out things such as a hernia, hip fracture, or hip labaral injury. I hope this helps and i hope you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"In a bout of sneezing I damaged something in my lower back fourteen days ago. From mild back pain in the early days it has now got much more severe and has gone down in my right ankle. I can't now walk properly or put weight on my right foot. I have only been taking over the counter pain tablets which have no effect. What can I do?","Doctor":"Im sorry to hear about your worsening pain. The symptoms , and circumstances of your pain are making me think this pain is actually coming from one of your spinal nerve roots. The name for such symptoms is lumbar radiculopathy, and specifically in your case it seems you have compression/irritation of the L5 nerve root on the right side. The radiculopathy is typically caused by a disc bulge/protrusion, and these can occur or worsen with increased intrabdominal/intrathoracic  pressure, such as when you sneeze. I would suggest you see your primary care and obtain a MRI of the lumbar spine to better get an idea of what is exactly going on in your low back. Based on the MRI you may benefit from either physical therapy, treatment by a interventional pain physician, or a neurosurgery referral. I hope you feel better soon , wish you thes best of luck."},{"Patient":"hello i have a question a friend has a lot of pain in his back just like my husband and both has had surgeries and they both have been to the doctors to see why the have so much pain but all was given to both was a few shots and meds for the pain but my friend say he has done and taken everything for the pain and still hurts i feel he has pain but not as much pain as my husband and feel like he is lying to just get high off a high dose of meds what do you think?","Doctor":"Im sorry to hear about your friend and husbands pain issues. unfortunately it is true that following back surgery, up to 50% of patients will have worsened pain. This is a syndrome known as failed back surgery syndrome or more appropriately post-laminectomy syndrome. The best options for these gentlemen would be to see a interventional pain physician. Most times opioid medications are not the best option to treat their pain as these medications have long term side effects such as : medication tolernace, addiction, abuse, opioid induced hyperalgesia, hormonal dysfunction and many more. the best option would be to obatin an MRI and see where the patients pain correlates with MRI findings and then to make a targeted plan of care. Sometimes when patients do not respond to procedures or medications and excellent option can be a device known as aspinal cord stimulator. These devices have been shown to help up to 70% of patients with post laminectomy syndrome. I hope this helps and good luck to your husband and friend. If you happen to live in Michigan I would be glad to care for either of them."},{"Patient":"My doctor that is treating my condition (Epidiymitis) TOLD me to masturbate.  I would prefer not to.

Within several months she was hospitalized with the same symptoms and tested again. This time they took her gall bladder. 13 days later she was hospitalized again with acute constipation (no BM since the surgery). They got this problem taken care of but now 1 week later she is having abdominal pain again and can not keep any food in her system. We are trying to get her an appointment with an internal medicene physcian but we are having problems finding a physcian that will accept her insurance. Please help!","Doctor":"Im sorry to hear about your daughters pain. Abdominal pain can be very tricky to control and even more troublesome to attain the correct diagnosis. I would definitely make an appointment to see you Primary care physician and have a physical exam performed. I would also suggest a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out any underlying pathology. If both of these are inconclusive but she is still having pain, you may want to see a interventional pain specialist. Options I would offer, assuming no pathology, would be to perform a differential epidural. A differential epidural is when a pain specialist places a epidural catheter into the space right outside of the spinal cord. The catheter is then dosed with specific concentrations and amounts of different local anesthetics. This method will allow your pain physician to tell if the pain is muscular ( abdominal wall related), visceral ( organ related) or if there is some other underlying cause to the pain. I hope she feels better and I hope this naswer was helpful to you."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am using Penidure 12 Lac Units Deep IM from 8 years and now I am used to it like I do not take test doses.

What is it and What to do next...?","Doctor":"As you are taking injection penidura I can guess most probably you have rheumatic heart disease. First of all even though you are taking penidura since last 8 years never ignore its test dose even when you are very sure that no any reaction appears. Now as far as your problem is concerned panidura is definitely a quite painful injection and if this pain is unbearable along with swelling of the local area than you can take tab combiflam or tab ibugesic-plus three times daily after meals. In addition to that nothing much you have to do, apply ice if swelling and redness is more."},{"Patient":"I took a hard fall this morning onto my left knee. It is now very swollen.

But this fall is the worst pain I ve ever felt. im worried I may have torn somthing.","Doctor":"Here there is only one way of checking it, that is visit a ortho or physio doctor. With out checking it physically we can not guide you. Knee is one joint where even if there is a internal damage of ligament or menisci injury person can use the cold pack frequently and can recover up to some extent  But complete recovery may not be possible. So I suggest to visit a doctor get it evaluated properly since you have swelling and pain and if there is range block then I am sure there must be internal damage to. Doctor may ask to go for MRI if needed. You can go ahead with this and based on report orthopedic will give you either surgical or conservative physiotherapy plan along with some medication which you can follow as it is. And I am sure you will recover if this is followed step by step.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor I have a Dull nagging pain like if I m sitting and turn slowly I can fell it in my back left side but more like left side middle and I have had a massage about a month ago and they could pin poit a sore spot on my back right to the spot does this make any sense ?

As well need to check the same with lower limb too. So do you have any pain or numbness radiating from back to your legs.if yes then it can be related with respected disc problem either cervical or lumbar.But if its pain and stiffness at local area only then it can be only muscular pain for which you can use  frequent hot pack on your painful stiff area. You should also take physiotherapy treatment along with stretching, strengthening  and mobility exercises to have some more relief.At any point if your pain increases and starts radiating to your legs or arm then I suggest take a visit of orthopedic doctor and go ahead for evaluation ( mri or x ray )as per his suggestion.

Treat the cause of pain not the symptoms. As well do regular exercise, take good sleep, have balance diet and keep a positive attitude. This four things will help you I believe in your life to fight against the pain better way then just taking a pain killer.

Any way since the explanation is not clear let me suggest you in general.I suggest to check whether do you have any kind of radiating pain or numbness in your legs or hands? If yes then it can be related to cervical or lumbar level disc or spinal cord problem. And it will be affecting the nerves coming out from that particular area. And so that it pains where ever it goes in body.But if there is no radiating pain and pain only at back then it can be only muscular pain. How ever the conformation can be given only after MRI and x-ray. So I suggest to visit the orthopedic doctor and do the needed test. Based on results doctor will suggest you for surgical option for severe issues in report or he will give you some medication and conservative management with physiotherapy treatment which will be useful to reduce inflammation at muscular level as well relaxing the soft tissues. As a physio I will also suggest the spinal exercise program based on patient condition which will again help to improve strength and stamina of the spinal muscles.You can also use hot and cold pack for some more muscle relaxation and reduce inflammation which will help again for some more pain relief.Take care."},{"Patient":"I was closing the hatch door to my car when I whammed the door into the bridge of my nose.

Shoulder pain has to be diagnose properly and should be treated accordingly. I am sure the physiotherapy treatment what she is taking will be according to her diagnosis and will help her to get relief.You can also ask her to use hot and cold pack frequently to get some more soft tissue healing with relaxing soft tissue, increasing blood circulation, and reducing inflammation.Here just wanted to update you to check whether she has frozen shoulder or its a soft issue damage (rotator cuff) .because many times it is diagnose wrong and treatment for both is different.For frozen shoulder more over as a physio I  do treatment with shoulder manipulation. And for soft tissue injury the manipulation is not suggested and only the soft tissue relaxing and healing treatment only can be given.To check if your mother able to move her hand up standing against wall as well take hand on her back with little pain then it is related to soft tissue pain. And if she is not able to move hand up complete with range block feeling then it can be frozen shoulder.If still confuse then still can be diagnose properly with MRI.Here my only advise is treat the cause of the pain and painkiller should be for time being.Hit the thanks if it is useful.

Now to answer your question for reflex sympathetic dystrophy I suggest you consult first neuro physician and based on his advise and medication take a view of physiotherapist as well pain management doctor for further improvement.As per my view I believe the major issue with rsd is pain, swelling, and vasomotor dysfunction. And this can be treated well with regular exercise use of hot and cold pack for swelling and reduce inflammation too. As well with regular exercise work out body releases certain hormones to regulate the imbalance within the body and helps to heal the inner body.

Like all the brands of betamethasone injectables, it is a corticosteroid anti-inflammatory. It works by reducing the inflammation and swelling that is putting pressure on nerves and causing pain. It can be used for numerous indications including joint injections, gouty arthritis, inflammatory skin lesions and many other problems that are responsive to corticosteroids. Actually it is good if you take vitamin b along with this. It will help for the nerves as well your body state to be in a active mode. As well if you are taking any other multi vitamin and multi mineral is also fine. Once you must check with physiotherapist for some more exercises to strengthen your spine and improve your muscle stamina. Because treating just a pain will not be useful you have to treat the cause of pain. So here physiotherapist can hive you some treatment as well exercise for strengthening, stretching and twisting which will improve your condition over all.Hit the thanks if its useful.Take care."},{"Patient":"I had a D & C and bleeding was not stopping for around 2 months, so the doctor prescribed me Primolut N for 3 months, which I have now been taking for around 2 months and 22 days.

I m a veteran that goes through the VA for medical and am afraid that they either minimize the severity of my issue and or they don t really know what to do about it?","Doctor":"Here I suggest to do more of strenghmthening exercise with mobility exercise based on your knee problem and knee bio mechanics. You have mention here there is a knee pain. And you are not comfortable using knee braces. But I need to know what kind of knee issue you have?is it early stage or chronic stage of knee oseo arthritis?, or is it pain related to knee cap movement disorder?. Based on this only I can suggest specific things. But still I must suggest you to visit a good physio and take proper treatment which can reduce inflammation and relax your soft tissue. As well also take a good exercise program to strengthen the knee joint. In very sever knee pain I also suggest to take MRI and check what is going wrong inside. And based on the report do visit orthopedic for having opinion on surgery or for minor issues on medication.Also use hot and cold pack regularly and frequently to have more of antiinflammatory, relaxing and soothing effect on joint. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I tripped in the garden3 days ago and at the time only had pain in my big toe but a day later and since I have had a mild pain on my right under my ribs. Thinking on as I tripped the wash basket I was carrying may well have pushed into my side. I have no pain when breathing only when bending or if I touch when there is discomfort.","Doctor":"Here good if you Dont have pain while breathing in. This shows there is no internal damage. But as you have mention that there is pain while bending this shows there is a soft tissue micro level damage. Here nothing to worry even if there is a crack in rib because the rib is supported with other   bones like sternum in front and spine in back. As well it is well bundled with soft tissues to support it.  So now you need to use regular hot and cold pack to reduce inflammation and relax the soft tissues. Chances are rare but at any time if you have breathing difficulty with sever pain at affected rib area then do visit a orthopedic take an x ray to test the damage level too. And last do not do activity which pains and take rest. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi,  I am having the Infertility probelm.

But here your doctor is also right if you are very much over weight then post surgery the rehabilitation may become difficult. Here I suggest to start physiotherapy first and take a dietician consultation to plan your diet. Now here with physiotherapy treatment it will help to relax your soft tissue and knee inflammation. At the same time do take suggestion on how to reduce weight with out doing weight bearing exercises? One way is by cycling. Also take a complete exercise program on knee strengthening exercise and follow it. This will help you to recover fast after surgery.

Shortly after this I started to get pain on the top of my left foot near the ankle. When I go to bed I toss and turn to find the best sleeping position. Do you these problems are connected in some way?","Doctor":"Im sorry to hear about your pain and how it is affecting you physical activity. Now hip pain can be tricky. Many times patients feel they have hip pain when actually the pain is from the sacroiliac joint. To differentiate, first imagine where you would point to if someone asked you where the most pain occurs. If the pain is in the groin and worsened with walking, climbing stairs, getting in and out of the car or a seat, it is likely hip joint pain. If the pain is actually out to the side and above your buttocks ( picture someone placing their hands on their \\"hips\\"), it is likely sacroiliac joint pain. Many times patients with sacroiliac joint pain can have symptoms radiate down the leg, while hip pain typically radiates into the groin and sometimes to the same sided knee. The best way to figure the problem out is to have an xray of your hip and also of your low back and sacroiliac joint. I hope this answer is helpful. In either case, the good news is that stretching, anti-inflammatory medications and even a joint injection can be very helpful. I hope you feel better and get out golfing again soon!"},{"Patient":"At 3 am this morning I was woken up to use the restroom (I had to poop). As I was using the bathroom I started sweating. Don t know if I was hot or if it was cold sweats. As this happened. My arms got tingling and I felt like I was going to pass out. I also felt nauseated. This lasted about 10 minutes. Then I felt a little better. Got up at 5 to go to work. While at work I didn t feel so hot. Not nauseated. Or like headache. I can t explain how I felt. I just felt off. Not quite right. This lasted till about 1/2 this afternoon. I feel ok now.","Doctor":"Im sorry to hear about your ordeal. Tingling in the arms can come from multiple causes: cervical radiculopathy ( pinched nerve in the neck), peripheral neuropathy ( typically related to diabetes, AIDS, or alcoholism), or from peripheral nerve compression ( sleeping in a strange position or on an extremity). In your case with the constellation of symptoms you felt it is likely you may have had a vasovagal reaction from using the washroom. This type of reaction can occur when you strain and increase the tone to a nerve called the vagal nerve. Typically this causes sweating, nausea, and a uneasy feeling like you described. Im glad the symptoms dissipated and hopefully this will not occur again. If the symptoms do return it is best to see your physician for a thorough physical exam. I hope this answer helps."},{"Patient":"broke tailbone 9 years ago, and the pain is still so severe after sitting , i can hardly get up... any suggestions? also, electric shocks down my arm and tinkling and numbness in my right wrist and arm, had a flake fracture 4 years ago, and feel it never healed?","Doctor":"Sorry to hear about your tailbone pain. Tail bone pain, also known as coccydynia, can be quite debilitating. I would suggest obtaining x-rays of the sacrum and coccyx and then seeing a interventional pain physician. Many times a procedure known as a ganglion impar block can help reduce the pain from coccydynia. If the block helps but is of short duration you may be a candidate for ganglion impar radiofrequency thermocoagulation ( burning the nerves of the ganglion impar). these procedures are safe, take a short time, and are all outpatient based. Good luck to you and i hope this answer helps."},{"Patient":"I ve take Norco 10/325 mg for long but then sudden I had bad hips.

Norco helps my pain go away fast for pain neck and migraine, but I am not sure about Tramadol for my hip with small arthritis/tendonitis. Should I take one pill of Tramadol and the other half of Norco? It is safe or not?","Doctor":"Here you need to know that tramadol is also a good pain killer, as per you hip, neck and any other body part if there is pain first you need to know why it is paining? What is the basic cause of this pain? Until and unless you Dont treat the basic cause of pain it will not help you so much taking pain killer all the time. So get your pain evaluated with x ray or scan of respected body part and checked it with orthopedic doctor. You can also check your complete blood count as well calcium and vitamin d test to know there should not be any thing wrong here.For your question on drug interaction. Let me tell you, your doctor must have given you medication after evaluating your condition properly and do not change drug dosage or the drug on your own. If you think this is not working for you talk to him and ask him to change the drug or dosage as per your body requirements with complete evaluation of basic cause of pain.Take care."},{"Patient":"hi doc i am 24 and suffering from jaundice sice 5 days and before that i had viral feaver.

It was very little and very itchy but, as days passed, 2 or 3, it extended rapidly. So I went to the ER of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and their report was: Attended with rush over hands, feet and back of legs and arms. Imp-vesicular palmoplantar eczema. Discharched with px for eumovate and emollient cream.That was on 05/08/2014 at 17:57 hrs. On 08/08/2014 at 04:30 hrs. went back again to the same facility. Clinical Notes: Vesicular rush for 5 days. No improvement. Felt faint this am. Hands and knees sore. Vesicular rush on hands, thighs, axillae and lower leg. No arthropathy on examination. Normal vital signs. Examination otherwise normal. Home with advice re antihistamine and supportive management. I continued having the same symptoms, that is itching and pain, stiffness and numbness in right hand that was very swollen. Those symptoms were aggravated in am hours, after having slept for one or two hours. On August 11, 2014 I went back home in Spain. As I couldn t sleep and was tired of being in pain, I went to the ER of a private Clinic in Torremolinos. They gave me a shot of Urbazon. That same morning I had an appointment with a dermathologist who took a biopsy from skin of my arms and order lab test. Please see attached file with lab tests results and biopsy results. (Sorry they re in Spanish but I think you can figure it out) On August 19, 2014 I went to the rheumatologist. Her diagnostic: Arthargias + skin lesions probable from a viral process. I continued with the same symptoms and feeling really bad. On August 21, 2014 I went to the general practitioner at the Seguridad Social. He ordered 3 shots. One that same day, next one, next day and the last one on Sunday August 24. Celestone Cronodose 2 ml intramuscular.

Trigon Depot 40 mg intramuscular. Now I´m feeling a lot better but the only thing that remains is in my right hand. It is still numb and can´t close the fist. Not enough strength. What should I do? What do you think it is happening in my right hand? Should I visit a neurologist?","Doctor":"As per your explanation looks like you had a skin infection as well the inflammation on the affected area and that's why there was too much of pain and swelling. As a result of this you was not able to move your hand.  Now as per my suggestion I advise to continue the treatment by doctor with whom you are feeling good.  And I am sure he must have given you anti allergic,  anti inflammatory, anti fungal or anti biotic drugs as per your report of skin biopsy and other evaluations.  Here your problem is you still have numbness feeling in your affected arm and hand.  Let me tell you one thing since from past few days you was not moving or using your hand as normally as you was there will be weakness.  And numbness could be due to pressure on nerves due to extra find accumulation in affected part, you also call it as swelling. Now here I suggest to wait for some more days if your numbness does not go then do a cervical mri as well nerve conduction  test for the nerve coming from cervical and supplying to hands.  That the doctor will guide you best to know more where there is a problem still.  And then take treatment accordingly. Take care"},{"Patient":"Sir, I am selvin from India.

Here you need to check do you have any breathing difficulty along with this pain?. Do you get this kind of chest pain with any strenuous activity or running as well walking for long or few steps.?

But if you say this was the 1st time and you never had any pain in chest even with strenuous activity then relax don't worry it's just a pain because you have played a lot and all body muscles are tired.  In medical language we say there will be micro bleeding in muscles as well muscle soreness due to over use.  But this gets all right on its own once you give some stretches and relaxes your muscles.

Do you have pain while walking or doing some activity immediately after that.?.,also do you have breathing difficulty along with that? If yes then it could be related to your heart.2.

Another MRI was performed in July and I was told the body seems to be absorbing the disk. My question is: How long will this pain continue.

If you have pain only at back and not radiating to your legs as well no symptoms of numbness in legs then it can be mascular back pain.

But triggering points will be too much of physical stress,  mental stress, improper sleep,  improper lifestyle as well food habits. So I suggest you need to get checked properly if you also have feeling of generalize body weakness.  For all this kind of my patients I strongly recommend the antioxidant supplement like vitamin c and vitamin e,  along with omega 3.

When the pain and tingling arising from only shoulder level and there is no pain at neck level it can be due to shoulder soft tissue strain. 3.it may also be related to frozen shoulder.  To check just stand with your back supported with wall and lift the hand up if you are able to touch the wall with your hand on upside then it's negative.  As well also try taking your hand on back and moving up.  If this also is complite and no pain or numbness then again it's negative.  Means it is not frozen shoulder.  In all above 3test you can try on your own but the specialist if does will be more effective or doing under specialist guideline under his observation will be more effective.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"As per your explanation for self check,  You can try to hold the muscle belly of your left leg  calf muscle and squeeze it. If the muscle is pain full then it shows it can be related to atherosclerosis (clotting) in your blood vessels under the muscles.  Another test is sit in straight leg position press your knee down and stretch the feet towards you.  It some one can help to stretch then it will be better.  And again you have to see if there is pain then the test is positive and there might be a problem with vascularity for the affected leg.  Here the test will give suspected result how ever the conformation can be done with dopler test so you may need to go for it when above two test are positive. And then visit a vascular doctor who can suggest you medication based on the result. Now when the physical test are negative means no pain with stretching or squeezing calf muscle means there might be weakness or soreness of muscle.  In this case you should use hot pack or deep your leg in hot water with added salt,  you can also use cold pack to reduce inflammation.  Do this for 2to 3 times a day and check.

The radiologist said a had a small bulging disc, But last year the same radiologist read mri done then and reported moderate size herniated disc at L 5. So I have anxiety that the disc maybe altered. Would that be possible?","Doctor":"I went through your explanation and realise you have got disc bulge as per the mri report.  Now here one thing you need to understand disc bulge or herniation can not go back in its normal position on its own.  There is only way to set it back is by surgery.  But even after surgery the chances of recurrence are high and patient are suppose to follow all spinal exercise with precautionary care like posture and do and don't. As well before surgery also if you do the same and take physical therapy for few days it will be fine.Now disc bulge means it's in starting stage and disc herniation can also be called same.  Many of time the advance stage like disc proteution or slip disc are also called as disc herniation so it's a common word which can be use for all disc related condition if it's coming out from its normal position.  You can get confirmation by looking in your mri. By comparing the previous one and recent one with the help of your radiologist. Hope this was useful for you.

Understand one thing scoliosis is a structural problem with spine and it will be affecting the surrounding muscles as well the nerves near by the spine.

A few years ago in high school I was in a car accident and did physical therapy for my SI joints and was fine after a month, I also did competitive cheerleading for 10 years, and occasionally had back problems.Both reasons which probably explain the arthritis that MRI showed in both SI joints that I got when my back had been hurting for a month.

Symptomatic treatment will include release of  muscle spasm or trigger points in the muscles  if any ( which I would generally expect in such a case )  and  which is a cause of pain during movement , stretching of the affected muscles , taping to keep those muscles in the optimal function and exercises further on to improve muscle balance . your physiotherapist will be able to evaluate it differentiate between a muscular pain or  a nerve compression from a discopathy . the treatment in either cases, starts with symptomatic relief of affected structures, with some advanced  physiotherapeutic techniques in case of nerve or disc involvement. please go to your physio for an evaluation who will refer you to appropriate specialty if needed.

He also says he s experiencing numbness at times. He also has worse than usual flatulence and a sore tummy off and on through the day and especially at night. We moved house recently and he did a lot of heavy lifting and then worked hard insulating our new house etc so a lot more physical exercise than he would normally do so not sure if it s all related. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello ! Thank you for your question ! In my opinion the symptoms you describe may be probably related to the intervetebral discs in the lower part of the lumbar vertebral column of your husband. You say that he has been holding heavy lifting recently. This may have caused his intervertebral discs to displace and compress the spinal nerves that are responsible for his lower limbs. The numbness and the pain in the groin area are not related to physical exercise. They must be related to a herniated disc. So I would highly recommend you bring your husband to the doctor and have e good physical examination and further exams for the vertebral column like spinal CT scan or MRi  .

The patient can consult a certified Urologist to get a fresh sperm analysis done. Only after determining the actual count, morphology, and motility of the sperms the course of treatment can be determined.

In such situation there are 2 common possibilities. first is that you must be suffering from acute gastritis if you are on any pain medications.

She has gone thru severe armpit pain about 5 months ago. Our family physician had given her a couple of pain killers which actually subsided the pain. I'm now quite worried because the pain has reoocured after these many days. The Doc says that this pain is occuring due to swollen lymph nodes. She feels the pain most while driving a two wheeler or while crossing a road bump etc. Please advise. Kind regards..","Doctor":"Pain can occur under your arm for a number of reasons1.Certain infections can cause pain under the arm ,Lymphangitis is caused by an acute streptococcal infection of the skin that infects the lymph node ducts, and many of these ducts exist under the arm. This can cause pain  Other infections, such as skin abscesses, can cause lumps to form under the arm that are painful. Hair follicles can become infected and a large lesion can develop. Sometimes these abscesses require drainage and an antibiotic.2.Lumps under the armpit are often painful, and they have several causes. Cancer, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma and metastasized breast cancer, can cause a painful lump to form in the armpitsuggestions If the lump is due to infection caused by bacteria, it should go away with a course of antibiotics in few cases, an extremely painful knot under the armpit may need to be surgically removed.Hope this is helpful"},{"Patient":"MY LEFT BIG TOE STARTED HURTING YESTERDAY ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE DAY.

Toe pain is a fairly common symptom, since our feet are constantly exposed to injury by walking and moving around.common causes of toe pain include ingrown toenails, cuts or scrapes, other injuries, blisters, and corns and callusesOther causes of this includes Arthritis and infections! in your case since the pain is excruciating we will have to rule out GOUT , which cause swelling of the big toe with extreme pain!Suggestion : Get you uric acid levels checked and xray foot to see if there is any other abnormalities! analgesics and some ice pack should relive your pain temporarily!"},{"Patient":"Hi, my daughter age 19 just returned from Uganda. She is experiencing pain at her back rib on lft side. A phys therapist that was on the trip thought she may have popped a rib. She has no insurance. We can go to an urgent care facility but they don't have xray. Would that be required for treatment?  Thanks.","Doctor":"GREETINGS! ANSWER : Fracture or dislocation of the rib can be only confirmed through XRay. if its a fracture or dislocation then , There is no specific treatment for rib fractures, but various supportive measures can be taken. In simple rib fractures, pain can lead to reduced movement and cough suppression; this can contribute to formation of secondary chest infection. Adequate analgesia can avoid this! Flail chest is a potentially life-threatening injury and will often require a period of assisted ventilation. Flail chest and first rib fractures are high-energy injuries and should prompt investigation of damage to underlying viscera (e.g., lung contusion) or remotely (e.g., cervical spine injury).Other treatment includes  internal fixation of rib!"},{"Patient":"Four weeks ago I recieved a cortizone injection for what was diagnosed as bursitis in my right hip. I had relief for about a week. I now am having constant pain in same hip and groin that radiates to the knee and down to the ankle. It is disrupting my sleep and limits mobility.","Doctor":"none of the possiblities is easily fixed.the simplest is a plain pull of a tendon or muscle without any serious injury. Still, groin pulls cannot be put in a sling, cannot be fully rested and therefore take weeks or a small number of months to get significantly better.Then, worse, arthritis of the hip (found with xrays while standing on one foot) would be from the cartilege lining being permanently GONE and fixable really only by joint replacement. Your ballet days are over!And, one of the more likely is a problem in the lower back that is hitting the sciatic nerve that runs from the back out through the buttocks, around the hip, down the back of the knee to the foot. Any pressure on the nerve by a disk or arthritis in the back etc will cause the entire nerve to hurt.sorry"},{"Patient":"DOCTOR I THE MORINIG I EXPERIENCED A JERK IN MY NECK NEAR TO MY BACK TOOTH AROUND MY TOUNGE.

What they do is allow someone to have a life at all. So, if someone is finding themselves out on the floor on an hourly or daily or even monthly basis (and driving!) then a pacemaker is a really good idea. It used to be they were put in everytime someone had a heart, but the insurances caught them at it and there are now severe restrictions on that.The question is whether the arm pain would be fixed with a pacemaker. By itself a REGULAR pulse of 46 can be a sign of very good health and certainly by itself does NOT necessarily indicate a problem (it can be due to a blood pressure medicine that is just working fine). If a stress test doesn't trigger the pain or if the holter shows the arm pain doesn't fit iwth the bpm or if when you move the arm it hurts, then that goes against it being the pulse, cannot say in your particular case without directly examining."},{"Patient":"65 yr old husband nfw w/ low grade fever and a pain on his left side he says feels like in his rib cage.

For at least 5 years now, I've had these bumps on my scrotum that don't seem to go away. From what I can tell, they haven't really increased in number, but I think what is already there has been there for a long time. These bumps were there long before I was ever sexually active in any capacity, so I know it's not an STD or something caused by sexual contact. The bumps themselves are usually fairly hard. Just recently I found an unconventional method of extracting a couple to try and help figure out what they are. The bumps seem to be caused by these tough sacs or 'balls' that are filled with a whitish/yellowish substance. Not liquid, but a soft \\"cheesy\\" sort of consistency. Each bump occurrence only has one of these sacs, but there are a fair number of them which causing me to fairly self-conscious. Any ideas? I used to think it might be molluscum contagiosum, however the bumps don't really have the 'indent' in the middle that seems to be classic of molluscum contagiosum, and they've been there for 5 years at least. I've read that molluscum usually clears up in 2 years at most without treatment.","Doctor":"Hello, It could be a sebaceous cyst. Consult a general surgeon and evaluated.

The muscle there from about the end of my butt to the bottom of the scrotum in extremely sore and swollen.  May even be some slight bruising.  It hurts to walk, lay down, and sit.  The only time I don't really feel anything is when I'm standing.  I have no idea how this occurred.  I began playing basketball on monday and wednesday of last week and I did not stretch.  I just started running.  I did not feel any pain afterwards.  Then, on thursday afternoon I began feeling some discomfort and then beginning friday afternoon I began experiencing a lot of pain, tightness, and swelling and since then it has been a progressing or steady pain and the area is still swollen.  I'm not sure what happened.  Do you have any idea?  Or any idea how I can get better by myself because I currently don't have the insurance to cover me and anything I can do on my own to relieve this pain will be greatly appreciated.  Also, do you know what that muscle is called?  I don't think its the groin because my inner thigh or the muscle that is between my leg and torso are fine.  It basically feels like a pulled muscle under my scrotum and in front of my anus and on the left side of the line of skin that runs from the bottom of the scrotum toward the anus.

Neuro or Ortho? please advise","Doctor":"Hello. I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.The fact that you've started to feel pain radiating to your fingers and weakness suggests that there is involvement of the cervical nerve roots and/or the cervical spinal cord. The medical treatment prescribed by neuro or ortho I think would be similar with antiinflamatory drugs, muscle relaxants, collar, exercise.However since there is the possibility of involvement of the above structures I think a neurological evaluation is necessary at this point determine whether an MRI is indicated, because depending on the degree of involvement at times a surgical procedure might be required.Hope to have been of help.

You can undergo MRI hips to assess the extent of inflammation.Additionally you may undertake the followings:-Activity modification-Avoid the activities that worsen symptoms.Assistive devices-Use of a walking cane or crutches for a week or more when needed.Physical therapy-exercises to increase hip strength and flexibility. You may do these exercises on your own, or a physio-therapist may teach you how to stretch your hip muscles and use other treatments such as rolling therapy (massage), ice, heat, or ultrasound.Steroid injection-Injection of a corticosteroid along with a local anesthetic may also be helpful in relieving symptoms of hip bursitis. It involves a single injection into the bursa. The injection may provide temporary (months) or permanent relief. If pain and inflammation return, another injection or two, given a few months apart, may be neededGenerally, no surgical intervention is required for cases of trochanteric /hip bursitis, because most patients respond well to nonsurgical treatment.Only rarely does a patient with trochanteric bursitis need a bursectomy and partial resection of the greater trochanteric process.Regards Dr. T.K.

( I have a Dr. appointment in four weeks.)","Doctor":"hi,what you are describing is typical of a few diseases.it could be due to causes in the neck itself, most commonly arthritis in the neck bones (also known as cervical spondylosis) may be causing compressing on a nerve of two around them leading to pain, or they may be compressing the blood vessels carrying blood to your brain, causing pain and blurring of vision. the blurring of vision could also be due to a low blood pressure if you ran too much without replacing body fluids properly causing your blood pressure to drop.or it could be something in your brain itself causing blurring or maybe even glaucoma (a disease of the eye >> which can be an emergency)you have to ask yourself if this is the first episode of such symptoms or have they been recurring.i do recommend getting examined by a general physician first to get a hint into what may be the cause of the problem and if required a specialist referral to an orthopedician for the neck problem or a neurologist for the headache , or even an ophthalmologist for the eyes could be organised. regards/"},{"Patient":"I have headaches all the time, my jaw hurts, my knees hurt, and I have been having pain that starts from my thumb, up my arm, elbow, neck and shoulder.

A cervical rib is an extra rib that forms above the normal first rib, growing from the base of the neck just above the collarbone. The defect is present at birth, but usually not noticed until later in life. A cervical rib can sometimes squash one of the nearby blood vessels or nerves, causing problems such as neck pain and numbness in the arm. If this occurs, it causes a condition called a thoracic outlet syndrome. Most people diagnosed with a cervical rib will find that their symptoms get better with time, without treatment.First line treatment is physiotherapy for shoulder exercises designed to stretch and strengthen the neck region and correct any poor posture.Pain-killers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen may help.If these measures do not work then surgery may be an option to remove the rib.I hope this is of help to you.

I haven't smoked since Thursday and now my upper back aches, I have chest pain and an upper abdominal stab like feeling. What could it be?

In addition the activation of that fight or flight feeling can casue muscle spasms/pain.

I am getting treatment from various doctors but no relief.  Kindly advise me. Arshad Husain, Lucknow.","Doctor":"Hello, I hope that I can answer your question. To answer your question, you may need an MRI to determine if these disc bulges are actually pushing on a nerve and likely dynamic x-rays of your spine to see if the bones are sliding past one another and your spine is unstable (spondylolisthesis). The real question is what is worse, you leg pain or your back pain. If you are having mainly leg problems that is due to discs and may be remedied by weight loss, steroid medications, physical therapy and surgery if need be. If the back pain is worse, your options are more limited. If your spine bones are sliding past one another you will still need physical therapy but also might need spinal fusion as well.

I have been having terrible leg pain in my inner legs that makes walking difficult. I have been reading about the leg pain that many people have experienced with crestor I am seeking an alternative. What do you suggest?","Doctor":"Hi There are 3 reasons for leg pain with the history that you have given.Of course it would have been even better if had told us about your smoking habits. 1) since your pain is present on the inner side of your thighs, there is a possibility of AVN of the hip joints. What it means is that blood supply to the ball of hip joint socket decreases, causing death of the femoral head(ball bone). This can give rise to pain primarily and also secondarily due to arthritis in the hip 2) PVD. Peripheral vascular disease means narrowing of  blood vessels due to high cholestrol. This is the same phenomenon that occurs due to a heart attack, but this is albeit happening in the peripheral vessels. Also a combination of cigarette smoking, alcohol, and atherosclerosis can give rise to what is called as 'claudication pain' or simply pain due to narrow vessels  3) Crestor can cause muscle pain. this is a well known cause of  muscle pain in people using anti-lipid lowering agents. Either way you will require a full assessment by an orthopod with x rays of the pelvis with both hips, and perhaps MRI of the pelvis looking for AVN, and an arterial duplex looking for narrow blood vessels, if any. If you are diabetic it is imperative that sugars are under control and if you smoke, quit it as soon as you con.Hope this helps,Do let me know if you have any more queries on this one,Dr Purushottam Reddy Padala MS(Ortho) FRCSConsultant orthopaedic and joint replacement surgeonHappy Joints Orthopaedic centre.

Further on prolonged use the effect of the drug will be reduced and it can depress the respiratory system. Hence it is preferable to reduce the dose of the drug gradually and then stop and then substitute with safer pain relieving medicines such as high dose paracetamol or anti inflammatory drugs such as aceclofenac.

I dont eat  greesy foods and no pop and I am in really good shape. I take no medications, but i do take protein powder before and after I workout, a muti vitamin and 900 mg of omega-3  in the morning, creatine after I workout, and ZMA supplement before bed. The creatine and ZMA I cycle one month on and two months off, just to be safe. I also talked with my doctor and he said these were all fine products to take.Even though I am very healthy, for about the last year and a half I have been experiencing a problem with my erections. I have no problem getting an erection and I can maintain it as long as I am recieving stimulation, but as soon as I stop recieving stimulation I lose my erection. It doesnt matter what kind of stimulation either, if im masterbating and stop the stimulation the erection goes away and if I am with my girlfriend and stop recieving stimulation the erection goes away. I have been with my girlfriend for two years now, and we just bacame sexully active about a month ago, when she turned 18. During intercourse I maintain an erection the whole time. Even before we had sex and she would do things like give me blow jobs and hand jobs I would still have an erection unless she stoped and it would go away as soon as my dick didnt recieve stimulation. I know this isn't a relationship problem because I am very attracted to her and love her very much. I also know it isnt performance anxiety because I have the same problem when I masterbate, and it happens everytime, with my girlfriend and when I'm alone, and I don't feel nervous either, I am just frustrated with this problem. I never have a problem reaching orgasm, or staying hard while recieving stimulation, so I'm not sure I have erectile dysfunction or something else. I used to masterbate about once everyday, until about 4 months ago when I decided that masterbation could be apart of the problem. I also used to watch porn when I would masterbate but i stoped watching porn when I decided to masterbate less. I orginally thought porn could be apart of the problem, because up until about 4 months ago I would watch it everyday. Up until about four months ago I watched porn everyday and that had gone on for about a year, previous to that, I would only watch porn about 2-3 times a week, and would only masterbate when I watched porn. The problem did occur after I started watching porn and that is what made me think porn was the problem, but now I havent watched porn for 4 months and I still have this problem. Currently I watch no porn, have a very heathy diet/ lifestyle, I have sex about twice a week and masterbate 0-1 times a week. I also have a wonderful girlfriend and a wonderful relationship except for this problem. We talked about the problem and she doesnt seem to mind giving me constant stimulation, but I just want to be better for her, and I hate that I have this problem. I also never smoke or drink and have done everything I can, short of herbs or sex pills and other devices, to figure out and fix my problem but nothing has worked.

I do not indulge in sex, because I believe in a long term relationship in order to have an intercourse(there are other ways to satify each other, I don´t give my dates blue balls). But recently, I have stared liking an Indian boy, who was actually not my type, besides being a heterosexual. I fancy him a lot these days. We spend a lot of time together and I can´t really avoid him. Whenever I get back home, he shows up and finds a reason to hang out together. He probably sees only a good friend in me, but I can see only a good manly figure in him.It is not so obscure about my sexuality, but he doesn´t seem to read it on me. I personally did not feel to urge to justify my sexuality to anybody. He is not the best looking nor with the best body, but he possesses a good brain and a nice heart. He is also selfish at time, but since I am the only one around with whom he can share and/or discuss the books we read, he is nice to me and makes it up for his occasional stupid behaviour with me. I want to have him as a good friend but I often drift into thinking of him sexually even if I am with my good looking dates. What can I do? Secondly I have stopped masturbating for a more than a week, but I have many arousals each day. If I musterbate, I automatically shift into thinking of him, which I want to consciously avoid.

I was prescribed cipro for 3 days and was told it is lichto sclerosis, not sure of spelling","Doctor":"Ice would help some, but might not cover the internal pain in the urethra.

The pain is worst by laying down on right side or sitting and putting pressure on it. It,s  been going on for a few years on and off. Sometimes the way I move the pain gets worst.","Doctor":"This sounds musculoskeletal in nature. I would use topical ice, but if it has been going on for years, then you should seek a referral for physical therapy as well as massage therapy. This could also be accompanied by local muscle trigger point injections. And if those don't work, then a trial of acupuncture would be beneficial. And once you do see your doctor, a chest x-ray would be warranted just to rule out any rib or lung abnormalities."},{"Patient":"severe pain on the right side of my neck just below the skulland the shoulder area have taken medications such as pain meds,inflamation ,muscle relaxers,heat patches .ice packs .nothing seems to help.having alot of constant pain,trouble sleeping ,loss of appetite.unable to function without pain .","Doctor":"A course of physical therapy or chiropractic would likely help.

Hurts to walk and it also has a shooting pain which started down thigh but is now in shin instead of thigh! I am also pregnant. Do you think i should do anything other than ice it?","Doctor":"Because of the hormones of pregnancy, your soft tissue is more relaxed and more prone to injury. So, the tissue is likely simply inflamed, and would benefit from ice, as you have been doing, and topical over-the-counter rubs. You could also take Tylenol, but do not take any anti-inflammatories (such as advil/alleve) as they are contraindicated during pregnancy.

You should seek out an MRI of the brain from your doctor to rule out any brain lesions. If that is normal, care may have to be coordinated by a neurologist, who could do nerve conduction studies to evaluate the spinal cord and peripheral nerves."},{"Patient":"My abs hurt, and I can't remember doing anything that would cause this level of soreness.

Especially if there was no history of trauma to account for a possible strain of the abdominal muscles. The cold is not likely related. Are your bowel habits abnormal (constipation? diarrhea?), to point to gastrointestinal problems?

This seemed to be accentuated when you tried to mow the grass. Even though it acted up during your meal, it does not sound like reflux. First try regular anti inflammatory medications (ibuprofen/naproxen), as well as a topical anti inflammatory like Aspercreme. Topical ice would help also.

Over the last 10 (or so) years sexual intimacy has diminished and now disappeared. I thought that this was a natural adjustment, especially for my husband, at this time of life. 3 years ago he resumed a relationship by phone and letter with his girlfriend from school days, arriving at the point where he was convinced they were in love (again) Although painful (for both of us) I saw it through on the understanding that there was a definite element of mid-life crisis going on. As we talked I was able to regain hope of  the possibility for finding renewed love, openness and intimacy. However, during this time he turned to self gratification via pornography on the internet. I have endeavored to be patient and understanding whilst also making sure that my own desires and needs are recognised. I have tried everything I can think of from humour to love to opening my heart to tears to seduction. Nothing works and my husband will not open up or let me in on what is going on for him. Perhaps he is at sea himself and yet I do feel let down that he cannot make some effort for my sake. I know the behavior is not in the 'normal' spectrum of behavior. Looking back I can see that although my husband has shown love and affection to me in many ways, I do not think he has ever found it easy to be truly intimate. I could say the same for me to some degree and have tried to acknowledge my own insecurities but I do genuinely think that the lack has been rather more on his side. Even in early courting he would rarely hold hands and he has never really wanted to engage in kissing or caressing or to engage in pleasant shared activities such as sharing a bath (for example) This has in turn restricted my own responses or ability to take initiative as I have felt like I was trying to push something that wasn't required. This goes to the deepest core of my being and who I am. Now I feel I'm getting on a bit and find it increasingly hard to know what to do or to expect from our relationship. I try and stay positive but sometimes I just cry myself to sleep. Sometimes my husband hears it and does nothing. Then I feel bereft. I recently heard the term 'sexual anorexia' used. I'm not particularly keen on labeling but thinking about it,from what is said, many factors seem to make sense. Is this a good way to seek to understand the problem? How can I find support and the best way forward? Can you help me? Thankyou for listening.","Doctor":"Hi, First, let me tell you that sexual anorexia is a term where sexual appetite has lost due to fear of sexual activity. In your case, as your husband met his girlfriend and then established relationships. I think it's emotional anorexia as he is not taking care of you and not emotional attachment with you. So it can be solved with a calm and cool approach. You should not behave and act but listen and have time to spend with him. Have a conversation of past happy and romantic time spent together. Also, talk to him about your great trips to gather etc. This will encourage him to again bound with you. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Nirav Nimavat, General & Family Physician"},{"Patient":"Hi. Since a car accident in Sept 09, I have had problems which seem to eminate from about half way down the shoulder blade but hard up against the spine. It will begin with a pin prick sensation which seems to just go puff and as it changes from that pin prick, that whole quarter of my torso will either go tingly like my arm might if I had slept on it or as is often the case it will give pain. Late last spring, my gp finally admitted that perhaps it is not just wear and tear as he had diagnosed, after I experienced my first ever level 10 pain. For me, a level 10 does 1 of 2 things. Knocks you right out or kills . Obviously, it knocked me out. But after waking face down in a puddle of my own sick, I called my doctor and he began giving me pregabalin capsules. They help a bit and I have progressed to 2 x 300mg per day by fall last year. I feel that there is some kind of on going nerve damage happening around that area, because the pain that had been brought to manageable levels a few months back, is now beginning to seriously hurt. Apart from increasing the dose of pregabalin- again! - what are my options? Can they some how kill the nerve which is causing this sciatic like pain in that quarter of my torso? I spent much of last year trying to get an MRI of that area done, but no joy. My last hoop to jump through, last year, before finally getting to see the guys who can order the mri and I was just referred back to my gp (square one) and months of depression and a hugely growing lack of faith in both the NHS and my gp for actually getting something done about it. Being disabled through lower and middle spinal injuries and damage (permanent and progressive, to quote my doctors), I cannot help but feel inside that they simply think that his body has had it anyway, so why waste the money trying to fix one problem when there are so many others which we just give him drugs for in the hope that he will suffer quietly. Many thanks Andy","Doctor":"I am sorry to hear you are having such difficulties.  I believe your pain is as a result of a \\"pinched nerve\\" in your neck.  You can actually check this by tipping your head back as far as it will go.  If this reproduces your pain, or increases your pain, you have your diagnosis!  Fancy word for this is cervical radiculopathy, otherwise known as a pinched nerve.  There is a specific type of physical therapy for this called cervical traction.  You can go to a physical therapist and they will show you how to use the device.  Once you have done that you can take the device home and use it in the comfort of your own home.  Twenty minutes a day for two weeks and you will feel significant relief if this is indeed the cause of your discomfort.

Cervical spondylitis involving lower part of the neck bones. 2. pressure on the nerves at the junction of shoulder and neck 3. if you have had an injury to your hand or arm any time before. if there is any change in colour/temperatre around the area where it pains it will come under third option. if you have sort of giddiness or vertigo along with pain and numbness feeling it comes under first heading and if this pain or discomfort along with arm goes to the outer side of your chest or breast, then it is likely the second one."},{"Patient":"I have the condition hirsute penis while erect because I'm circumcised.

It appears that you are having sciatica due to \\"disc bulge\\" causing nerve root compression. Often this may require stronger pain medications such as Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Duloxetine and sometimes even narcotics like hydrocodone or oxycodone. Physical therapy is often helpful at least partially with the pain. If all these fail, then surgery may be necessary. Since these medications need to be prescribed by a specialist and need adjustment, I would recommend you see a Neurosurgeon to discuss various treatment options."},{"Patient":"In 2009 I was diagnosed with MS. I have had several courses of treatment that made me significantly ill. In 2010, I made a quality of life decision to discontinue treatments, as I was having no success with any of them. This was a horribly emotional decision, but I made it and have been living with symptoms, changed my lifestyle, my job, my address, everything to eliminate stress, as stress is a main contributor to relapses. I went last week for an MRI, and the doctor told me I was misdiagnosed in 2009, and there is no evidence of lesions or plaquing. He wants me to go through testing for auto immune diseases, etc. From 2002 through 2009, I had gone through every test imaginable. Starting over has me swirling emotionally. I should mention that this is a new doctor. My doctor says that this should be good news, that I don't have MS. and it is. but, I am back to stage one. My symptoms are exactly like ms. I have had double vision, i lost sight in one eye for 3 months. I have had black spots in my field of vision that caused me to be unable to drive for nearly a month, I drag the right foot, I am in pain all day every day. I get very weak muscles that at times, cause me to use a cane. I have also gone completely unable to stand, to the point where my daughter had to carry me to the bathroom. I have memory problems, cognitive thinking issues, My skin often feels like it is sunburn, but there is nothing there. It also gets very itchy, but is not at all dry. There are times I can not even lift my arms over my head, they are too weak to do anything. I was unable to hold my granddaughter when she was born in fear that I would drop her. My biggest problem is the pain and weakness. The pain makes me so exhausted that by the end of the day, I go to bed by 7:30 to lay and watch a movie or something.  I am not an over-weight person, and try to stay busy through hiking, kayaking, fishing.  I am limited as to the type of exercise I am capable of doing due to my lack of good balance. So, My question is, does any rare medical condition come to mind that can manifest itself as MS does?  I have been tested for many more notable autoimmune diseases such as lupus. I am desperate to not have this take another 10 years. I have been through so much!","Doctor":"Hi, I am sorry to hear that you are suffering from pain and weakness. I agree it must be very difficult having been told you have MS for nearly a decade and now being told it may be something else. I would recommend a few things1. Get your old records - everything including tests, progress notes, imaging results and medications from your previous doctors office. 2. I would suggest getting a second opinion- the reason is that if you were treated for MS for so many years there must have been a reason to diagnose you with the condition. If your new doctor thinks its not MS and wants to embark on a whole new set of investigations, I think its worthwhile getting a second opinion before spending thousands of dollars on costly tests3. Since pain and weakness are your main symptoms, I would recommend seeing a Physical therapist. Physical therapy is often very helpful to improve strength and endurance. Also, consider seeing a pain specialist to discuss other ways to manage pain. Consider alternative ways to reduce stress including meditation and yoga. Please let me know if that was helpful.

Physical therapy: This I have found is often very helpful for patients like yourself to decrease pain and increase functioning on a day to day basis. This can include things like water therapy- exercises in a pool for those who cannot walk due to joint or muscle pain2. Pain specialist: You can consider seeing a pain specialist for close management and adjustment of medications. 3. Behavioural therapy: This is usually given by a psychologist- often chronic pain is associated with depression (from pain itself) and counseling and psychotherapy are helpful to decrease pain. The therapist can also refer you to a psychiatrist if they think you have symptoms of depression for medications. Please let me know if that was helpful. Thanks!"},{"Patient":"I have been going through some tough times and haven t been eating right, I also haven t been sleeping right and now i smell blood and have a light pain in my forhead near my nose. I ve been feeling weak as well, I ve been feeling like this for a week now. Do you know what it may be?","Doctor":"Hi, I am sorry you are feeling like this. There are a few possibilities to explain your symptoms1. Sinusitis: This can cause pain in the forehead near the nose and bleeding from the nose which could be the reason you smell blood. 2. Depression/Anxiety: This could explain the multiple different symptoms that you are experiecing. It could be due to your current stressful events. My recommendations would be1. Consider Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed for the forehead pain. Do not take more than 3,000 mg of Acetaminophen over a 24 hour period. 2. If you have symptoms of congestion, you can try an over the counter decongestant like Cetrizine 5mg at bedtime or Loratidine 10 mg at bedtime until symptoms resolve3. Consider seeing a psychologist (behavioral therapist) to discuss about how to cope with current stress. If they feel that you have anxiety/depression they can refer you to a psychiatrist. 4. Consider methods to decrease stress such as deep breathing exercises, medication and yoga. Please let me know if that was helpful.

Along with those pains came chills and sensations of being cold.. then after bad hot flashes. I've been nauseated and my lower right back has been hurting on and off for a series of five days.","Doctor":"Hi, I am sorry you are feeling like this. There are a few possible reasons for your symptoms1. Viral infection: These can often present with a multitude of symptoms that are often non specific. Viral infections usually improve on their own and do not need antibiotics2. Urinary tract infection: Pain in the lower back with chills and diarrhea could be due to a urinary infection. The first thing there is to get a urine analysis looking for white cells and bacteria. If you have an infection you may need oral or intravenouls antibiotics depending on the severity of the infectionAt this time, I would recommend1. Plenty of fluids to keep yourself hydrated2. Get a urine analysis- urine microscopy with culture to rule out an infection3. Since urinary infection particularly if it involves the kidneys is quite a serious condition if not treated promptly, I would recommend you also see a primary care doctor as soon as possible to rule out infection.Please let me know if that was helpful.

After reading what you have said I feel your symptoms could be from several causes. These could include1. Hepatitis C: This disease is currently curable in most patients if treated. If untreated it can cause scarring of the liver with time (called cirrhosis) and ultimately lead to complete loss of liver function (called \\"end stage liver disease\\"). Liver disease can cause the symptoms you have right now. An important complication of Hepatitis C is liver cancer. Your loss of weight makes me extremely concerned and I recommend you see a Hepatologist (liver specialist) to rule out an underlying cancer. 2. Anemia: Hepatitis C, age and other factors can cause anemia. If untreated and severe it can cause loss of energy and loss of appetite. The diagnosis is made using blood tests- these need to be ordered by a physician- so I would recommend seeing your primary care doctor at the earliest. Anemia is treatable but the underlying cause needs to be figured out first3. Depression: Can cause many of the symptoms you are experiencing. Other symptoms include a lack of interest in things that you like and sleep disturbances. Symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and counseling. I would recommend seeing your primary care doctor first to determine if depression is the cause of your symptoms and then he can either prescribe you medicines or refer you to a specialistSummarizing everything, I recommend you see either a primary care doctor (preferably) or a Hepatologist to get a thorough check up and necessary tests to determine what is causing your symptoms. Meanwhile, healthy lifestyle changes like stopping alcohol, smoking, drugs, exercise as tolerated and healthy food choices (fresh fruits and vegetables over fast food) should be undertaken.Please let me know if that was helpful.

I am concerned that he has pain all the way down his back and on one side of the buttock down to his legs. This could be from injury to the bones of the spine (vertebrae) or the cushions in between them (intervertebral discs). There are nerves that come out in between the bones of the spine and any displacement of the bone or the cushions between them can compress the nerves and cause pain that shoots down one or both legs. The swelling in the legs is concerning because it could be from several causes including a fracture, sprain, or less likely a blood clot. I would recommend that you see either a primary care doctor or an orthopedic surgeon at the earliest. I think he will need at the least an Xray of the spine and hips. He will need to be examined carefully to look for any nerve damage. If nothing serious is found, treatment usually comprises of medicines to decrease pain (tylenol, ibuprofen, naproxen) with physical therapy. Please let me know if that was helpful. If it was, please take a moment to provide a rating. Thanks!"},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with degenerative disk disease.  I was taking morphine and oxycodone for the intense pain.  I recently got a new doctor and he stated that the pain medications were increasing the pain and stopped the morphone and is weading me off of the oxicodone. Is it true that pain medications can cause more pain?","Doctor":"no, but they can cause \\"physical\\" tolerance to develop wherein your body gets accustomed to the effects of the medicines and now you need more and more medicine to achieve the same degree of pain relief. I think your doctor did the right thing though because narcotics are not the best answer for pain of joint disease. I often encourage patients to try Physical therapy and if that doesn't help you could see a pain specialist about steroid injections into the joints. if all fails, then would need to see an orthopedic surgeon to discuss surgical options. hope that was helpful. if you found the answer helpful please take a moment to provide a rating- thank you!"},{"Patient":"Hi im a 29 year old male and and i have erectile dsyfunction...in my early 20s i started using penis enlargement pumps...and overdid it! I use to pump my penis huge! And burst a lot of blood vessels and tissue! Stretched it also! For years now my penis doesnt get hard by itself...i have to manually make it hard by hand! It only gets semi hard...and it wont stay hard 4 long! It goes down quickly!  I have weaker erections and not much blood flow everyday down there! Its shrank. Can the damage ive done with the pumps be repaired and the nerves fixed? I masturbate a lot all the time. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, Penile pumps usually are safe. Even though you overdo it, they do not pose any serious problems. I suggest you consult a urologist for investigation of your case. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. K. V. Anand, Psychologist"},{"Patient":"HELLO:  A few weeks ago I awoke with a pain in my groin.  Thought it was a sports injury and eventually visited my GP.  She ordered an Xray, physio and Tylenol.  The physio therapist said it was an injury to the pectineous muscle and the Xray indicates osteoarthritis.  I have been very active for many years and enjoy swimming and weight lifting.  Do you think this is a combination of both or could it simply be the pectineous muscle and is there any hope of the pain going away?  Thank you for any comments you might have.  Barbara","Doctor":"hi there, sorry to hear about the pain. osteoarthritis is a disease that progresses with age, so the pain and stiffness would likely get worse with time. however, if think pain control and physiotherapy are the right way to go. At some point, I would recommend seeing an orthopedic surgeon to discuss about possible surgical options particularly hip replacement. another option is injection into the hip - this is a specialized procedure usually done by orthopedic surgeons or special radiologists and provides temporary pain relief."},{"Patient":"I am 52, disabled female, who for the past few years have having difficulty in walking.  My entire right leg feels heavy and stiff.  My right thigh has been constantly in pain and the nerves in the thigh seem like they are asleep all of the time.  Last night I thought was not going to make it home, because of all of the issues I am having with right leg.  At night my right foot and hamstring have tendencies to cramp and it affects my sleeping.","Doctor":"your symptoms of numbness and weakness in the right leg are concerning. I would recommend you see a physician immediately."},{"Patient":"My daughter has been having sharp lower right pelvic pain.  She went to the ER and had a CT scan that came back normal.  Urinalysis shows small amount of bacteria.  Bloodwork shows an AST of 1209 u/l and ALT of 363 u/l.  All other liver tests look ok.  What could this be?","Doctor":"hi, it sounds like she has a urinary infection- this responds to usually three days of antibiotics. since that requires a prescription, I would recommend seeing a primary care doctor for that. although the ct scan is negative, other possibilities should be considered including an ectopic pregnancy or \\"pelvic inflammatory disease\\". both can be diagnosed with a special pelvic ultrasound. I would recommend seeing a primary care doctor or gynecologist to order and evaluate it. the increase in AST and ALT is more worrisome. there are several possibilities, most likely being alcohol induced liver inflammation. other causes include viral hepatitis. if it's alcohol, then the treatment is watching closely for signs of withdrawal and abstinence from alcohol. to rule out viral infections, we need to do blood tests. an ultrasound of the abdomen is also recommended to look for abnormalities in the liver. I would say with all of these symptoms, you should make an appointment with a primary care doctor to investigate the underlying conditions at the earliest."},{"Patient":"My leg or knee gave out on me after that happen my whole leg as slowly turned outward, especially my foot, very noticeable...pain in opposite buttock...nothing shows on Mri of the hip, the spine shows facet disease, an old fracture. Nothing on the pelvis...What could cause this?","Doctor":"Hi, after going through what you have written, it is possible that you have an arthritis (inflammation of the joints) or misalignment (called listhesis) of the spine. This can cause pressure on the nerves that supply the legs in turn causing weakness and pain. If I was seeing you in clinic, I would recommend an MRI of the spine. Treatment initially involves pain control with Acetaminophen (Tylenol) :25-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not take more than 3,000 mg of Acetaminophen over a 24 hour period. You can also try Ibuprofen (400-800 mg three times a day with food)- it has an anti inflammatory effect. Do not take Ibuprofen if you have a history of chronic kidney disease, bleeding from your gut or severe reflux. If this does not help other pain medicines for nerve related pain (like gabapentin, pregabalin and duloxetine) can be tried. I would recommend physical therapy and based on what the MRI shows refer you to a neurosurgeon. Since MRI's and pain medications need to be ordered by a doctor (except Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen which are over the counter), I would recommend seeing a general physician or an orthopedic surgeon as a start.Please let me know if that was helpful.

Depending on the type of ulcer, it can be either improved or worsened by food. It can be also associated with sour taste in the mouth/burning in the chest (reflux). If the pain is worse after she put pressure on it, it most likely is muscular pain (although it could be from worsening of the ulcer pain too). If you are not already taking any medicine, then I would suggest taking Omeprazole 20 mg twice daily for 2 weeks to see if it improved. You can also try Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not take more than 3,000 mg of Acetaminophen over a 24 hour period- this will help if it is a muscular pain. Do not take Ibuprofen/Naproxen if you have ulcers. If pain is not improving, or if you notice dark colored stools, or feeling otherwise worse, please see a general physician at the earliest.Please let me know if that was helpful.

I do have a rod in my left thigh from a femur fracture that occurred over 40 years. The pain does ease somewhat whe I walk.Most prominent after sitting or lying down","Doctor":"Hi, I am sorry about the pain. It appears from your description that you may have \\"sciatica\\"- pain caused by pressure on the sciatic nerve that travels along the buttock region down the back of your legs. It is usually caused by arthritis of the lower spine or of the hip joint. If I was seeing you in clinic, I would recommend getting an Xray of the spine. For treatment of pain, I would you could try Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not take more than 3,000 mg of Acetaminophen over a 24 hour period. You can also try Ibuprofen (400-800 mg three times a day with food)- it has an anti inflammatory effect. Do not take Ibuprofen if you have a history of chronic kidney disease, bleeding from your gut or severe reflux.Physical therapy is another treatment I would recommend. If pain is still not controlled, then options would be stronger pain medicines that are used to treat nerve pain (gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine), MRI of the spine to determine in more detail the cause of the nerve pain and referral to a neurosurgeon. While Acetaminophen (Tylenol/Paracetamol) and Ibuprofen are available over the counter, other medications and imaging studies need a doctor to prescribe and interpret.

Usually, it will go from being red to yellowish tipped- this yellow color is due to the immune system cells fighting the infection/inflammation.

It will be burning in nature in the epigastric region.Pain is due to excess amount of gastric acid production and reflux of acid into esophagus due to low esophageal sphincter tone (which help preventing acid reflux into esophagus). Crohn's disease is a different entity. Your pain is not related to Crohn's disease.Take pantaprazole tablets twice daily for 10 days.

Can I use Endone long term to manage pain as I still experience pain?","Doctor":"Oxycodone or Endone is a narcotic. Generally, its not a good idea to be on long term narcotics due to multiple problems particularly developing a physical dependence on them. Also, they can cause constipation.

I was a professional water skier aka professional fool at ABC Marine World/ Africa U.S.A in Calif. I obtained a spinal cord injury. My husband retired and we moved to Washington state, Since moving to our Dream Retirement property I have been unable to find a pain Doctor. My Pain Dr.s neurosurgeons had told us this was the Meca of Pain Management . I have been forced to be almost totally bedridden or in our hot tub due to the fact that Washington State has some new laws on pain meds. Sitting in a hot tub for 4-6 hours a day is not much of a life, I am unable to walk without forearm crutches. I am fused from L2 to the sacrum anterior and posterior with screw Instrumentation (Harrington rods). I was hospitalized due to naseau which would last up to 16 hours at a time. While I was hospitalized the Doctors at the hospital NOT ME set up an appointment for me to be seen by a general practishioner which Washington State requires. I went to the appointment as scheduled then all hell broke loose. I was discharged from the general practicioner because I was seen by another Doctor. Total shock to me since I was only doing was the Hospital had set up. I did NOT request pain meds, but the doctor wrote me a for Norco at the rate of 4 day. since in Calif. my pain management doctors had me on 9 a day (I understand about the Tylenol) I had a DEFECTIVE Medtronic Pain pump which stuck out of my stomach like a tuna can. I am considering it again as well as a spinal cord stimulator.","Doctor":"Your situation seems to be complex. From what I understand, because you had obtained a narcotics prescription from another physician, your GP may have considered this as a violation of the narcotics contract and thats why discharged you.
