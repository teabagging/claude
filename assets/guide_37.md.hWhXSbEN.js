I have gone through your question and I can understand your concern about your toothache and facial swelling. You need IV (intravenous) route antibiotics like Ceftriaxone one gram after allergic test and for that, you must visit either a dentist or an emergency room.

This looks like a cellulitis (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it is an infection of subcutaneous tissue. He needs antibiotics and blood test. Convince him for visit. He will need a hemogram test, and blood culture to look for the extent of infection. In treatment, he will need antibiotics like Amoxicillin Clavulanate combination 625 mg three times a day along with some antacid like Pantoprazole 40 mg once a day. For pain and swelling, you can continue Ibuprofen, you can use Magsulf ointment for local application for swelling. He will need higher antibiotics as it appears severe cellulitis.

I also feel immense pressure at my RLQ like someone is sitting on my stomach constantly. I had an ultrasound to find appendicitis. But, they found enlarged lymph nodes and said they would become normal soon. I did not have cold or anything in the past two to three months before this happened. It stopped hurting for about three days and then started hurting again, this time without the pressure. Within the last two weeks it has become worse than ever it hurts. I am always feeling nauseous, even when it is not hurting. It hurts daily and sometimes causes me to double over for 10-15 seconds. It has nothing to do with monthly cycle at all and does not seem to react with food. This Monday morning I had to stop my fitness training as it was so bad and could not complete the session, which is very unlike to me as I enjoy fitness. I have had two ultrasounds and could not find appendicitis or anything else wrong. Also, I have had two blood tests done for appendicitis and that showed slightly higher amounts of white blood cells, but that is not enough for doctors to diagnose as appendicitis.

Now I do get cold sores once in a blue moon on my right side lingual gum and palate. I am still having numbness and tingling. So now my doctor thinks it may be trigeminal neuralgia and never was shingles. I am a healthy active 39-year-old woman. I am looking for a second opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. You should know that trigeminal neuralgia is a common complication of shingles or herpes infection. As blisters appeared the first time, it means that the herpes infection was present (probably HSV1 (herpes simplex virus, which is typical in this region). It is quite common to have symptoms before the blisters appear. The fact that the numbness persists, it means that the trigeminal nerve remains irritated by this past infection, causing the trigeminal neuralgia, although less typical (trigeminal neuralgia is typically associated to short periods of shooting nerve pain, alternated with persistent numbness in the same region). Anyway, I would recommend performing IgG and IgM for HSV1 virus and also a brain MRI study.

So, it is unlikely going to spread and will heal completely in two weeks. Prednisolone is a steroid and can cause reactivation of Shingles.

Good, you have done a rapid HIV test, and it is negative. But normal results are negative. This means that no antibodies were found and that you may not be infected with HIV. Most people who become infected with HIV will develop antibodies to the virus within two months. During this time, you may have an HIV test, but this test cannot detect it.

I have gone through the description you mentioned and understand your concern totally.

I understand that scans were performed and the beta hCG test on 8th May is 178 and on 10th May it was 247. On 13th May you got the scan as you had a spotting, right? See, as your previous cycles have been irregular, it is difficult to predict when you would have ovulated exactly. So we cannot go by your dates to calculate the duration of the pregnancy. May I know when did the urine pregnancy test turn positive for the first time? It would be advisable to recheck your urine pregnancy test now again, as you had spotting, if the levels are falling then it would be suggestive of a miscarriage, and mostly this could be like a biochemical pregnancy, where pregnancy is detected only in the blood tests, but on the scan I cannot find the gestational sac development, which has ultimately got aborted.

Rising PSA is a sign that there is some tissue alteration which has resulted in breach of this barrier. Hence, do not be under the impression that rising PSA always means malignancy. But it is better to confirm the absence of malignancy by biopsy as, at a PSA level as low as 5.7, even in a unlikely event of report being malignancy, the chances of organ confined lesion is very high, which is easy to treat and chances if cure are high. Hence, it is better to undergo biopsy and get your fears allayed. As such, the biopsy is a very small procedure and safe in experienced hands. Wish you a safe biopsy and I hope the results will be benign."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Recent health check (which I do it by myself routinely and I do not have any diabetes, BP or any other disorder), I found abnormal values of the following hematological parameters, Hb- just normal, RBC- low, MCHC- low, MCV- high (lab has marked all the last three items under bold). Liver , kidney and other blood parameters are normal. Cholesterol- normal, except TGL, which has slightly gone up. My age is 53, BMI- 23, active and fit. Kindly advice whether I need to worry.

I have checked your attached reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your hemoglobin level is within normal range. So you may need not to worry about that. You need not worry regarding slight low red blood cell count. For slight high MCV, you can investigate further with serum B12 estimation. Your triglyceride level is slight high. For that you can continue with prescribed medication that is Atorvastatin.

I need some suggestions to get rid of it. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that the chickenpox scars have been disconcerting to you. The treatment approach would depend on the depth of the wounds. Very deep scars would need a procedure like dermabrasion. For superficial scars, you can try Tretin 0.025 (Tretionin) cream daily night. Apply it in small amounts and very lightly over the scars, daily night for two months. It will not lead to a 100 % reduction in the scars, but it would gradually make the scars less visible by tightening the skin. If you are not satisfied with the results after two months, consult a local dermatologist for dermabrasion."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had heart palpitations for two weeks. 3 to 6 times a day. Feeling of one hard heatbeat. I bought a holter monitor and catched it today. Seeking advice.","Doctor":"Hello. This is an atrial ectopic or extra beat in other words. These occurs intermittently, so, ECG may be normal in between. These are not worrisome usually and most of the times without much significance. However, we need to rule out the possibility of structural heart disease before calling them benign. So, echo should be obtained to rule out possibility of structural heart disease. Also, thyroid problems can cause these, so thyroid profile should be obtained. Also, too much coffee, sleep deprivation, stress, alcohol and other addictions may cause those, so should be minimized, if any. If too frequent and symptomatic, then one can have beta-blockers medicine like Metoprolol which suppress these. Otherwise these settles with time."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have fever and leg pain since last night. I had preauricular sinus infection pus drainage three weeks back. I was on different antibiotics for the last 45 days. Taxim O, Centil, Augmentin, and Lizobact 600. I stopped taking them two days back.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your query. As per your query, you have taken multiple antibiotics for a long time which is not good. I need to know whether you have done a culture sensitivity test for the pus draining out of the sinus or not, because if you take antibiotics according to the culture then chances of recurrent sinus infection and fever are very less. Can you send me the photos of your infected area (preauricular sinus)? Mostly pus discharging sinuses are caused by tuberculosis infection in most of the cases. In my opinion, you should go for a detailed physical and systemic examination along with some blood tests and chest x-ray. Also, if discharging sinuses is still persisting then you need to do a pus culture sensitivity test both for bacterial culture and Acid fast bacilli (AFB) culture and other advanced tests for tuberculosis. Now you can take tablet Paracetamol 650 mg whenever you develop a fever. Please do not ignore your problem as it can lead to deterioration of your health. I suggest you to consult a physician and get a detailed physical and systemic examination done and detailed evaluation along with the above tests."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

A few days later, my left eye had some weird blurred vision which turned out to be corneal ulcer that is in the center and relatively big. I got treated immediately with heavy antibiotics Ceftin or Vigamox. After two to three weeks there was some improvement in vision, redness and the loss of epithelial cells is about 1.2 mm, after which I started taking eye steroids, and vitamin C three times a day. Unfortunately, I found out today that there is another small epithelial defect that opened under the first one (both are still very small). I have bad light sensitivity, and I would like to know if there is anything to be done now apart from waiting to get better. I have been told to be patient at least three months since the scarring is still prominent and central, although it is getting slightly better every time I see the doctor. I am currently on, antibiotic eight times a day with steroids three times and Sythnomyine twice a day. Most of the scar is in the front stroma. But central, and it has been slightly getting brighter every time.","Doctor":"Hello. Indeed a corneal ulcer requires patience, time, and continuous monitoring until it is fully healed or scar forms. Sometimes it might take up to a year and more. It is however mandatory that you add to the list of eye drops that you are using a lubricant (artificial tears) because dryness is inevitable after any refractive surgery and once you are using eye drops that contain preservatives. You can use the lubricant every hour if you need but except the last hour before going to sleep. That is also very important if your job includes intense visual activities at the PC and or use of mobile devices.

I am trying to learn EKG reading and was wondering if you can help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Look for right bundle branch block and axis deviation. If left anterior or posterior hemi-block is also present, this makes it bifascicular block. If AV block also, this makes trifascicular block. If left anterior and posterior blocks combine, it is called left bundle branch block, if left and right both bundles block, this is called complete heart block and third degree AV block. If you are a medical personnel, it is easy to understand, if layman, then it may take some time to get used to EKG."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am wondering how serious is bifascicular block? Is it common among younger people? I am only 30 years old and this came up on EKG. I was very surprised as I live a pretty healthy life. Any ideas what caused this and what steps I should take next?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your worries. It is not common in general population. It occurs mostly in those who have heart attack, angina, have high blood pressure or some valvular disease, especially aortic valve. Other cause is fibrotic degeneration of conduction channels, but it occurs usually in old age as age-related degeneration. It may progress slowly and lead to trifascicular block or complete heart block. Treatment is not advised if heart rate is normal. If in future heart rate decreases or block progresses than cardiac pacemaker may be necessary to implant. Risk of this condition is that if it is due to fibrosis, then it may spontaneously progress which may take years. Other risk is that if anytime in future you have angina or heart attack, then there are more chances of further progression of block as compared to those who do not have this block. I advise you to repeat ECG, have an echocardiography done to see valvular disease, if present, monitor blood pressure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is 86 years old. He is a hypertension patient and on Metosartan 25 mg, Ecospirin 75, and Nexpro. For prostrate, he is on Maxvoid 4 mg for the past 10 days. He is complaining that while passing urine there is an urge and sometimes he passes stool. On medical advice, he took Imodium four tablets for two days and Ofloxin 200 mg for five days but still the problem continues. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome you to icliniq.com. I can understand you must be very concerned about your father's health. Well I have reviewed his medical history, which he has been taking for hypertension, prostate, and recent use of antibiotics and Imodium. So typical symptom you mention that whenever he urges to pass urine, stools passes by itself which is suggestive of stool incontinence-means loss of control stools. With his age, it is possible that he has weak anal sphincter. The anal sphincter is a muscle around the anus which contracts and control the stool output. In older age, it become weak and lack sustained contraction hence get loosened. With every attempt to pass urine, which increases abdominal pressure, would also lead to evacuation of stools. This stool incontinence because of loose sphincter at times perceived as diarrhea, however, it is not actual diarrhea. For diarrhea, once has to have stool volume more than 200 ml/24 hour, and significant change in consistency of stools like watery stools, or greenish unformed stools containing food particles. If none of these signs which are suggestive of diarrhea I suggest you to stop Ofloxacin if given for perceived diarrhea. The drug he has been taking for prostate also causes external anal sphincter and hence partly contribute to his stool incontinence. I want to know if he is feeling mucus (thick jelly like material) in stools, blood in stools or rectal pain, or repeated visits to toilet when nothing comes out? This information is important to rule out any inflammatory process beside loose anal sphincter. I suggest you few investigation for stool studies, which will tell if he has active infection of bowel and if present can be treated with antibiotics then. For treatment he can take Imodium, two tablets thrice daily for two more days. Excessive use of this medication would cause constipation and can worsen patient discomfort. I want you to help him learn pelvic muscle strengthening exercises. There are many youtube videos available to learn how to do pelvic floor strengthening exercises while sitting on a common chair. Lastly biofeedback therapy which is a computerized software which help him to control his anal sphincter while passing urine or otherwise. This treatment is offered at physiotherapy department of a hospital. Avoid excessive fibers and modify liquids (1 to 1.5 liter maximum) intake in a day. This would reduce the overall bulk of stools formation in the bowel and hence decreased stool output. Stop or reduce alcohol intake if taking. This also causes diarrhea and loose sphincter controls. I hope this helps. Stool incontinence secondary to age with loose sphincter, plus drug side effect. Digital rectal examination (performed by gastroenterologist in person). Norectal manometry (not usually required if digital rectal examination is suggestive of the diagnosis). Stool detail report. Stool fecal calprotecin and stool for occult blood. Stool for ova and parasites. Stool for fat globules and reducing substance. Complete blood count. Stool incontinence secondary to older age and drug-related. Follow up to disclose other parts of history as mentioned above. Otherwise follow above regimen and see me in one week time after investigation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have white patch on my face.

My doubts are, 1) Will there be any side effect due to the extra dose given within 24 hours? 2) Will, it make any difference in giving, first-day Rabipure and subsequently Rabivax? 3) Is there any food restriction after a dog bite? 4) Do I require booster vaccination every year?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, there is no problem in injecting two dosages within 24 hours. Usually, the first, two shots are given after one another. Apart from that Tetanus toxoid is must that you have taken. It is not the case that the vaccine is ineffective. This is the usual protocol that is followed for safety concerns. Overall, five shots are given within one month.

I am taking the Progestin only birth control pill as I cannot take the combination pill due to my migraines with aura. I talked to my gynecologist a couple of weeks ago to see if there is a way to adjust my period date so that I do not get it during my honeymoon. She told me to go off of my pill this week so that I will get it this week (which I did) and my period would not come for my honeymoon. However, I am certain that she told me the wrong dates as now I am right on schedule to get it again for my honeymoon. I am just wondering if there is anything I can do now. Would it work to go back in the pill for the next week and then go off again and get my period again so that I can push it back and I do not get it in my honeymoon? Or will that probably mess with my system too much?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? As you have already stopped the pill, you should be getting the periods any day next week. In that case, it was a right advise. Once you get the periods start the same pills again, without any break, till the date you want to postpone the periods. This will be a good cycle controller and a contraception. But, if you feel the periods are going to be delayed to the end of this month, then better start the same pill till the date you want to postpone the periods. Do not forget any pill in between or you will have periods in between.  Just for an information, migraine can be cured by clearing the cause. Noone has found the etiology of migraine. Predisposing factors are lack of good sleep, sleeping too late, using the screens with bright blue light at close distance for long (tab, mobile, laptops, TV, etc.), missing timely meals, sweating a lot, taking too much of physical or mental strain, etc. So trying to make few changes will relieve you of this migraine. You can even start on combined pills, which are more effective than these Progestin pills."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 17 weeks pregnant. In my USG report a blood collection is found of 52 mm x 20 mm at internal os. I am very worried. What is to be done with the problem?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? After 12 weeks pregnancy, the risk of bleeding is low. Only a bleed from the margins of placenta is to be worried about. Cause of this collection could be: 1. Erosion and thereby minimal bleed from the raw surface of erosion. There may be mild discharge with or without some altered blood. You can have vaginal antifungal or antibiotics like Cansoft CL or Candid V or Clingen Forte once at night for 5 to 7 days. 2. If you have had sex recently. Above medications can be used. 3. I hope cervical length is greater than 2.5 cm and internal OS is closed. If not, you may need a cervical cerclage stitch.  To be on a safer side, you can have:  A. Injection Proluton depot 500 mg IM once in two weeks for 1 to 2 months. B. Capsule Susten or Dubagest or Naturogest or Vagestone 200 mg twice daily vaginally for 1 to 2 months.  These both can be used simultaneously. They both are Progestrone hormone. They relax the uterus and if the blood has any chance to irritate the uterus, these two will stop it. So can prevent preterm labor pains. It is not easy to prevent pain once it starts, so better to use it before any risk factors. I do not think there is anything to worry, avoid any strenuous work, journey and sex."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can you please tell me the difference between left and right bundle branch block? And why is left considered far more dangerous?","Doctor":"Hi. Heart needs current to beat. Current is generated in sino-atrial node. It is like electric generator. It travels via bundle branches, which are like wires. Current goes from SA node to AV node via atrial bundles. Then from AV node to a small bundle called HIS bundle. Then goes to right ventricle via right bundle branch and to left ventricle via left bundle branch. Then it further divides down.  When there is interruption in right bundle, it is called rbbb and same for left bundle branch. Right bundle branch may not always be dangerous because right ventricle is a low pressure chamber, pumps blood to lungs which is also low pressure. Left ventricle has to pump blood to whole body, it has to force more. When lbbb occurs, left ventricle is contracted via current coming from right bundle branch and it takes some time to reach left side although only milliseconds of difference but that is significant. Thus, there is dys-synchrony between ventricle which may lead to ineffective output from left ventricle, because whole vascular circuit is interconnected and should work in rhythmic synchronized way. Moreover, lbbb usually occurs due to heart attack. But all this is not as simple as mentioned. It is more complicated. It needs much time to make you properly understand the whole working of heart and its connections. Hope you got a little idea about lbbb and rbbb."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

The first-trimester ultrasound scans done before 12 weeks are the most accurate ones in the assessment of gestational age with an error of only + /- 5 to 7 days in the assessment of gestational age. So they are used for obstetric dating and determination of expected date of delivery. Moreover, if you have done 6 ultrasounds and the date calculated from each of them corroborates and does not lag behind then probably your baby is growing well and it is not small as you apprehend. The date we calculate from the first day of last periods is accurate only if the periods were regular for the last 3 months and there was no history of miscarriage or ovulatory disorder like PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) or contraceptive pill intake. In case of any discrepancy the date from dating scan at 6 weeks are accurate and to be considered.

Last week before all this happened I got a master health checkup done and my uric acid level was 9.1 and traces of albumin were there. Just to mention, that was my sixth day of keto diet when I got the checkup done. Later, I stopped Keto. Kindly guide me.","Doctor":"Hello. As you know, asthma is the chronic inflammatory airway disease with waxing and waning episodes. If you have asthma, your airways are always inflamed. They become more swollen, and the muscles around the airways can tighten when something triggers your symptoms. This makes it difficult for the air to move in and out of the lungs, causing symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness.There is no permanent cure for asthma, and current guidelines suggest to keep it under control with the inhaler medicines. Foracort 400 mg is the best inhaler, and you should continue using it two puffs twice daily. As far as the diet is concerned, diet can increase or decrease inflammation in the airways, depending on what you eat. But the ketogenic diet per se is not responsible for worsening underlying asthma. Rather in some cases, it seems beneficial for the patients. So, the ketogenic diet is not at blame for asthma worsening. Might be there is another reason for the change in asthma pattern that is causing uneasiness or difficulty in breathing. So, it is advisable to see your treating physician and get the necessary investigations done to find out exact control of your asthma. Also as you said, the master check up uric acid value is high and needs evaluation by the doctor. Environmental changes as high pollution, colds, drop in temperature might cause asthma flare-up, and you may need to take inhaler like Levolin (Levosalbutamol) for the time being. So overall, only after proper physical evaluation, we can decide the exact cause of your discomfort.

Go for healthy fats and proteins like whole boiled eggs, steamed chicken, cottage cheese, raw olive oil, and avocados, etc. You can include vegetables like carrots, peas, broccoli, spinach, kale, and mushrooms, etc. Do it for one month, and if it shows good results, you can continue further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For three years, I have been taking 12.5 mg of Atenolol and 80 mg of Diovan to control blood pressure. Readings over the years have been good and average. 120/60 was the blood pressure 55 to 60 was the pulse rate. I have a good blood pressure monitor, and I take readings three to four times a day. Last month while taking a regular reading, we noticed a reading of 136/60 blood pressure and pulse 32. A few minutes later, the bp was 141/68 and pulse 32. We went to the emergency room at the local hospital during a trip that took about 25 minutes. The readings had gone up to 60 bpm, and the blood pressure readings were satisfactory. I was in the emergency room for about 12 hours, where they did several blood tests an ECG and a chest X-ray. I was discharged the next day because they said my condition was fine and they recommended dropping the 12.5 mg of Atenolol completely. (I am attaching a 24 hour Holter monitor report that was done two or three days later). I took 0.4 mg of Flomax for 18 days for BPH. The readings were normal from the last month till the mid of this month. Then suddenly on a fine day, the readings of pulse rate and blood pressure were high, so the family doctor recommended resuming the Atenolol at 12.5 mg. After four days, we then found that the pulse rate was going down into the 30 bpm again, so the family doctor recommended cutting the Atenolol in half to 6.25 mg after which the readings of the pulse rate were high 30’s and blood pressure going up to 191/85. So the family doctor recommended taking 6.25 Atenolol in needed basis if the pulse rate and blood pressure started to spike. So we monitor blood pressure and pulse rate each morning before we go out to see if it is necessary to take the Atenolol and it is very stressful.","Doctor":"Hello. So the problem you mentioned are two 1. High blood pressure and 2. Heart rate 1. For BP, continue Diovan (Valsartan) 80 mg. Regarding Atenolol, it does not has many effects on BP, but has an effect of lowering heart rate. If your BP remains elevated, you may increase the dose of Diovan to 120 mg. 2. Take Atenolol 6.25 mg, if heart rate without it remains more than 80 to 90. If the heart rate is below 90, no need to take Atenolol. Moreover, count heart rate manually by counting beats or pulse. Do not rely on what the BP measuring device tells. Remember one thing, sudden stopping of Atenolol increases heart rate beyond normal for a few days, but later it settles to normal. So, be patient."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 23, and I have too much problem. I have depression, anxiety, and many sexual problems. I watch extreme pornography daily. I think I damage my penis by rough and abnormal masturbation. I am too much worried about it because I face too many complications. How to diagnose whether my penis is damaged or not? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. Why do you think you have damaged your penis. Is there anything abnormal in the penis? Too much of thinking about it may lead you in depressive mood state. Masturbations is normal thing, maximum persons in your age practice it. If I talk about prevalence you will be shocked, nearly 100 % of male and 70 % female practice masturbation (standard psychiatric book). There is no harm in masturbation, semen is an ordinary fluid like saliva, and in male sperm, it is produced daily. If we do not perform sex or do not masturbate, semen will come spontaneously in the form of nightfall, but that is not again a problematic thing. It is a harmless practice until if you become an obsession, and start hampering your daily life. Thinking about near one in fantasy is also not uncommon, it happens. If you want to quit it first set in your mind that you have not committed any crime, you are going to leave a habit that was trying to conquer you. You can do it. Do not remain in guilt, move ahead and involve yourself in other activities. Try to be with friends and family. You can take help of religious thoughts. Do moderate exercise, reschedule yourself, be active. You can contact some psychiatrist nearby you. Take proper sleep and a healthy diet. Practice yoga and meditation that will help you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am pregnant with my second child. According to my LMP, I am supposed to be about 10 weeks. However, I had a scan about 3 weeks ago which showed 6 weeks 5 days and another scan this week and it showed 6 weeks 3 days. Baby is also sitting on the uterus lining making the baby very easy to miss if the sonographer is not thorough. There is also a strong heartbeat. Is it possible that due to the baby's current position in the uterus we are not able to get the right measurements to see if the baby is growing well? I do not think it is possible for a baby to decrease in size with a strong heartbeat. Please help. I am emotionally stressed due to this. I have another follow-up scan in a week.","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, is your period regular or irregular? Were you breastfeeding or taking any pills? In these cases, LMP is not considered as accurate, and scan is the main thing to determine the gestational age. Secondly, the baby position does not play a role in hindering having measurements. The baby would sit on the lining because it gets nutrition from there, and that is what is called implantation. Thirdly, what concerning is that if measurements were the same three weeks ago why the baby has not progressed in these three weeks. Possibly one of these scans is not correct either this recent one or the last one. This thing is worrying for me, and it is good that you are having a follow-up scan, and if the baby's heartbeat is there, then you have nothing to fear. Hopefully, everything would be clear by next week. I am wishing you all the very best."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been having these eruptions on my forearms since past two months. They are not painful and cannot be popped. But they take a long time to disappear and look prominent. What are these and can they be stopped from re-occurring?

From these two photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it is visible that lesions are little inflamed and red. It is indicating folliculitis. Non-bacterial folliculitis can be non painful. Specially pityrosporum folliculitis. Keratosis pilaris is a condition where you may have dry hard covering surrounding hair opening. Sometimes it may also get inflamed, so it can be related to this also. Arms are common site for such bumps.

He does not feel like eating from 2 to 3 days. Have checked with local doctors, after a few tests they found nothing but his bloating has not gone down. He also feels pain in stomach. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to iclinq.com. There are different conditions that can cause abdominal bloating that goes from non-urgent to serious conditions. If he is not passing bowel movements or gas and has remarkable abdominal pain, it can be a serious condition like bowel obstruction and needs to be taken to hospital emergency department. On the other hand, if he is passing gas and bowel movements, he needs to be checked for H. Pylori which is a stomach bacteria and has a specific treatment. If H.Pylori is negative then next step is to see a gastroenterologist for potential gastrointestinal endoscopy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My dad is 78 years old and was diagosed with stage 4 transitional cell carcinoma of left kidney for which he underwent a neprourectomy. It is six months now and he took immunotherapy for the same. He had three doses of Ketruda but with third dose he developed pneumonitis and changes in lung. He had blood culture but no infection was present so they treated with steroids for 10 days, after stopping steroids he developed some tiredness and fever for which he was put on antibiotic Bactrim. But after he took that for a few days, he was better but just two days back he developed extreme drowsiness, slurring of speech and confusion. He was advised to rush to a nephrologist because his creatinine was 3.7 and his HB was 7. His potassium levels were high too and ESR was 120, lymphocytes were low. So, they took out all the drugs he is presently on to stabilise his creatinine and potassium levels and transfused blood. My question is he was on maintainance drugs for 40 years of which Sartel 40 for hypertension, Glyciphage for diabetes, Liofen and Gabantin for trigeminal neuralgia and Ativan for anxiety have been withheld. Do these drugs cause any interference with his kidneys? Please let me know because I want a second opinion and be double sure that this is the right thing to do.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the details about your history. Cause of deranged renal function is multifactorial. First of all, Ketruda that is Pembrulizumab can cause interstitial nephritis, that can cause damage to kidney and rise of creatinine. Sartel is for blood pressurebut it can cause rise in creatinine in acute setting such as after surgical stress, so stopping is a good decision. When there is a damage to kidney, drug such as Gabapentin get accumulated in body and can cause neurological symptoms as you told. It will subside gradually as kidney function improves. So, from current medicines, you stop Parozep until his kidney recover, for blood pressure take Amlodipine 5 mg (as the blood pressure is normal now) (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Get urine routine done and urine protein creatinine ratio and if creatinine continue to rise, a kidney biopsy may be needed. Otherwise, control of potassium and urine output as per regular protocol of treating nephrologist. Take care and would like to know further detail and progress, wishing him a speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 36-year-old woman with family history of heart disease.

Chlamydia infection persistence or recurrence can definitely cause an apparent increase in the pus cell and WBC count in the seminal fluid which can easily decrease the total sperm count and its quality. If you have been treated it is good, but again it takes 90 days for new spermatids to form adults and become functionally mature for fertilization.

The birth control pill will actually thin the lining of the uterus over time, and many women barely have any bleeding during the placebo week, we sometimes call these pill periods as it is often just some very light spotting or brown discharge.

I was not sexually active at all either. Just a couple years ago I realized I might have something called bacterial vaginosis. I went to the doctor for it a couple years ago and got prescribed Metronidazole and it did nothing for me. Ever since then I have not really gone to the doctor about it again. I am worried because I have read that BV left untreated can make you infertile. How common is it that this could happen? And do you have any tips for me?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, you have heard right that if vaginal infections are left untreated they may lead to PID and infertility. It is a serious issue which must be dealt with promptly and appropriately. Bacterial vaginosis leads to change in vaginal flora and pH which results in fishy odor and discharge. Metronidazole is the recommended treatment for it but as you say it has not affected you then I would suggest that you must not neglect it and get yourself fully checked by having vaginal swabs tested and getting exact diagnosis and treatment.

I am having balanced diet with plenty of meat and kale chips. Since 3 months, I have started taking raw food and prenatal vitamins because of cracks in mouth that would not heal and it seemed like hair was falling out. After over a year of severe insomnia, exhaustion, mouth sores, constant itchiness and RLS issues that made my husband wonder, I went to my doctor last week wondering if it could be hypothyroid. As I have not had periods since 4 years, I did not suspect any anemia. Doctor has done two CBC's. The second one had even lower hemoglobin and hemotocrit levels. My last CBC that was taken 4 years back showed a hb of 14.4 but vitamin B12 results were within normal range. I am attaching all my reports for your reference. Please guide.","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query and reports (attachments removed to protect patient identity), my opinion is as follows:The low hemoglobin at present is not due to blood loss, it is nutritional. If you look at the iron studies, the iron levels are very low, indicating inadequate iron in body. They can be possibly secondary to reduced intake and may be a cause of malabsorption. As the other vitamin levels are normal, it is more likely reduced iron intake or absorption. The reticulocyte count would increase in case of anemia, if the nutrition too improved. It is staying within the normal range. If you start iron supplements along with vitamin C (for better absorption of iron), you will find your reticulocyte count increasing within 2 weeks. There is no hemolysis or hemorrhage, as in both conditions, if nutrition was adequate, the reticulocyte count would have also increased. At present, all studies including red blood cell volume distribution (RDW), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are iron studies that are pointing towards iron deficiency. Good to know your thyroid profile is good. Insomnia and exhaustion can be easily explained by anemia. Also improve the hydration (take at least 5-6 liters of water per day). Avoid coffee or tea along with food, as it inhibits iron absorption. Adding citrus fruits or vitamin C rich diet during food intake improves iron absorption. At present, nothing to worry except iron deficiency. Supplements of iron with iron fortified food and iron-rich diet should help. Also, take vitamin B-complex supplements, as early changes like ovalocytes are also seen in blood. Both iron and vitamin B-complex supplements to be taken, and within two months, you will return to your normal self. Repeat the reticulocyte count after 15 days to check if it is increasing. 1. Both iron and vitamin B-complex supplements to be taken. 2. Most importantly iron-rich foods to be taken along with vitamin C supplements. 1. Iron-rich diet, iron fortified foods. 2.

If any abnormalities found on this, then what treatment can be suggested by doctors?","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for the query. Holter monitoring is done to identify rhythm problems, to diagnose the type of arrhythmia, and its relation to daily activities, to detect heart blocks and to monitor treatment. Now depending upon sign and symptoms and rhythm identified, the treatment plan may be devised by a cardiologist. In general, for fast rhythms, medicines are given to slow down the heart rate and also reversion of rhythm to normal can be attempted via medicines or invasive intervention. For slower heart rates such as heart block and its symptoms such as loss of consciousness or dizziness, pacemaker (which is an electronic device than generates a pulse for the heart) may be implanted. Depending upon rhythm detected, further tests may be advised such as cardiac electrophysiology study. So, possibilities are many; if you provide some history of the patient, I can guide you properly.

It means any cycle length between 21 to 35 days is normal."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 51 years old. I had a severe allergic reaction when I was 7 years old, after eating a crab meat sandwich. It was made with canned crab meat, and I cannot be sure if it was real or artificial. I found large round red hives all over my body, which turned to rings before healing. I never ate crab or lobster since then. I have always eaten shrimp, scallops, clams, and many other types of seafood without issue. I continue to wonder if my allergy all those years ago was a crab meat allergy. I have been avoiding crab and lobster for no reason. Does all seafood belong to the the same family?","Doctor":"Hello. Allergy reaction is due to a specific particular protein or substance. Each group has a different type of protein. It varies from each. There are several types of shellfish, each containing different proteins like crustaceans include crabs, lobster, crayfish, shrimp, and prawn. Mollusks include squid, snails, clams, oysters, and scallops. Some people are allergic to only one type of shellfish but can eat others. Other people with shellfish allergy must avoid all seafood. So one may need not get an allergy to all group and family."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 11 months old. He is suffering from cough and cold, and his BCG spot has also turned red. He received his vaccination long back. Then why did it turn red now? He is currently on Levolin. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. There is no issue with the BCG spot turning red at 11 months of age. It is alright. As long as it is not swelling up and ulcerating completely, it is fine. Sometimes, some children may scratch it making it red. In this regard, I would advise you to get the BCG scar evaluated physically by a pediatrician. As regarding cough and cold, you can give syrup Levolin 2 ml twice a day along with syrup Montair LC 2.5 ml once a day for 5 to 7 days. SOS, you can use nebulization with Duolin if the cough is very severe."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am having red rashes on the glands of the penis. I used Candid Total and it disappeared completely. Again after seven days it again appeared and it seems red patches on right and left side of the penis. I continued using it and then got an advise form one of my friend for using Surfaz SN along with Doxt SL 100 which I am using it since last 15 days. It was improving slowly. I was using very hot water for cleaning the penis but suddenly day before yesterday, the color of the penis became red and the patches have also become red. I am having pain on the glands of the penis and seeing some white discharge. I do not know why it has happened suddenly, due to usage of hot water or for some other causes. I consulted local doctor and he advised to take LNZ 600 one tablet twice daily for five days and T-Bact ointment twice daily for 10 days. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. You have erosions on the glans penis that is more consistent with candidal balanitis, other possibilities are chancroid, herpes. Please stop using Surfaz SN, it has steroid in it. Steroid helps to bring down the inflammation, itching will get better but it will not cure the fungal infection further makes the fungal infection worse. I believe that is what happened for you now. Can you please answer these questions so that I can rule out other possible conditions and suggest you appropriate medications. When did it start? Do you have similar red rash on foreskin as well? Any history of unprotected sexual intercourse? Any history of white discharge in the female partner? Did you have fluid filled blisters when it started? Is this the first time you are experiencing this kind of lesion? Do you have any allergies to medications? Do you have any other medical conditions? Diabetes? Do not use hot water for genitals.

Please look at my pictures and inform me the solution.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that you are concerned. Looking at your photographs, I can appreciate that you have two things (attachment removed to protect patient identity). 1. Acanthosis nigricans: The darkening of the neck and underarms is due to thickening of the skin, known as acanthosis nigricans. It is a manifestation of insulin resistance and is usually associated with diabetes mellitus, weight gain, obesity, thyroid disorders and certain drugs. Sometimes no cause can be identified. 2. The arms darkness seems simple tanning due to sunexposure as I can appreciate the sharp cut off at the arm, where sunexposure ends the skin is fairer. Use the following medications: 1. Kojic acid cream apply once at night for pigmentation. 2. Suncros sunscreen lotion apply three times every three hourly on sun exposed areas during day time. 3.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Whatever it was, medication took care of it for her. Now she is 31, has had three kids, and for the last few months has spotted and cramped for one day right after her period ends. She has a pap smear appointment for next week, but I am extremely worried in the meantime. What are the chances that the symptoms are because of cancer? Are there other benign conditions that are more likely causing this?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for sharing this information here. First of all I would like to see her reports from the previous diagnosis and treatment and only then I would be convinced that it was a tumour. Secondly, from your point, it sounds that it was only a cervical polyp which is totally benign and after removal of it patient does not have any symptoms. And thirdly, pap smear does not detect cancer. It detects only early changes which Iead to cancer. So get relaxed now as nothing is wrong with your wife as she has given birth to three healthy kids. She must go for a pap smear without any hesitation and I hope it would be fine as well."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have problem in one cord and it is for about a month now.

As per the picture, it has been there on only one cord. If it is early stages, conservative management can be tried. Did your doctor tell you about it? One month duration is a bit less to decide on surgery I feel. You should go for conservative treatment. Conservative treatment means antireflux and antacid measures along with control of allergy. Dietary precautions are to be taken. Absolute voice rest should be maintained. What is your job? Do you speak a lot or sing?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can I start Unwanted 21 after my periods? Four days back was my last day of period. My period cycle is usually for five to six days. Please suggest as I want to start my oral contraceptive.","Doctor":"Hello. Oral contraceptive pills are normally taken cyclically from day-5 of menses to day-24. I suggest taking tablet Norethisterone 10 mg twice daily similarly in every cycle. Oral contraceptives are ideally started from the start of a cycle, but if you want to start, start now from today and then stick to it regularly. Take the 21 tablets and then the placebos or choose the pill-free period for withdrawal bleed. The body takes some time to get used to it. Side effects could be headache, breast tenderness, high BP, clot formation, on long-term use irregular bleeding, carcinoma of the breast and endometrial hyperplasia that can lead to endometrial cancer. Hormonal contraceptives are better not used for many years. Better to change the method to prevent long-term side effects like after taking it for a year, you can have injection Medroxyprogesterone (three monthly) for few months, etc. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife is in the 14th week of her pregnancy. During a routine checkup, we came to know that she was infected from HEV. What will happen? Do we have to abort the child?","Doctor":"Hello. There is no need for the abortion as HEV (hepatitis E virus) does not cross the placenta, but you need to have a close follow up for the pregnancy. Also, you have to get in touch with fetomaternal doctors (baby-mother doctors) and get a regular check-up of your liver function test. You would need to be delivered in a hospital setting as HEV may infect the baby at the time of birth. HEV is not harmful to the baby during pregnancy but needs close monitoring, and vigilant care of mother as mother's condition may deteriorate if not addressed properly. I hope it has helped you.

It could be sign of autism, though he turns when his name is mentioned, plays with his siblings, etc.","Doctor":"Hi. Even though the child turns when his name is mentioned I would advise you to first get a hearing screening done to rule out hearing issues. Next, about the autism. Generally autism cannot be diagnosed in children below the age of 3 years. So it would be very harsh to label this child as autistic. Not just that, an autistic child generally does not play well with others. If the hearing is normal and other developmental milestones are normal, you need to wait for another 3 to 6 months. Some children are slow. Also, another thing that needs to be evaluated is a tongue tie. Kids with a tongue tie (depending on the extent) have difficulty in creating speech."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

For the ulcer, you can apply a topical antibiotic like T-Bact cream daily thrice. It will help it heal if it is a simple bacterial infection.

I have recently graduated my bachelors and got accepted to medical school. I previously thought the acne was due to stress, but since graduating I have still been having breakouts and tried Benzoyl peroxide, Retin A products, and salicylic acid treatments. All of which clear up temporarily but then get worse. I am not on any medications (no birth control either) but currently started taking a few supplements to see if it would help. I take fish oil, probiotics, and turmeric for the past week and now it seems to be helping a little, but I also just got off my period and had some flare-ups on my cheeks. I am in the military, and out of all honesty I have tried getting appointments with my doctor, but she always recommends the same treatment with Benzoyl peroxide and Retin-A. She even had me on Spironolactone a few years ago, but I have a low natural BP, and that just made me dizzy from lowering my BP more. I wish to see a dermatologist, but the military makes that difficult to do unless I wanted to pay out of pocket to see one. My skincare routine consists of using Glowbiotic MD face wash, diluted apple cider vinegar toner, and plain Aloe vera for moisturizer. I try to keep it simple to not irritate my skin more than it is. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand acne is very frustrating. Many factors play a role in acne, they are, 1. The hormone is the main factor. Here acne is seen mainly on the chin and neck. A most common cause is the polycystic ovarian disease that presents with acne, increased hair on the face, hair loss from the scalp, irregular menstrual cycles. If you have any one of these symptoms along with acne, I strongly recommended evaluation by a gynecologist. 2. Stress. 3. Occlusion due to thick face creams, and foundation that block the pores on the face causing ductal block then inflammation. People from 13-30 years are more prone to acne. You have cystic acne, considering the distribution around chin and jawline, Spironolactone is the best medication in your case. Since you have a problem with blood pressure, I can suggest you other treatment options. Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestions and take the treatment with consent. 1. Aczone (Dapsone) 7.5 % topical gel, it is anti-inflammatory medicine but slow acting. 2. Oral Doxycycline or Minocycline for two to three months. These antibiotics are very useful for cystic acne. 3. Topical Fabior (Tazarotene) 0.01 % foam, this is the strongest topical retinoid. 4. Oral isotretinoin (Accutane) is the most effective treatment available for acne. It is weight based treatment, depending on your weight you will have to take Isotretinoin capsules for four to six months. It needs monthly blood work monitoring for serum lipids, liver enzymes, monthly urine, and a pregnancy test. Follow a monthly visit to the dermatologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30-year-old female with weight 95 kg.

Because my husband is getting frustrated and depressed day by day. I love him more than anything in the world, so I am too much worried about him. He works at home since he is a freelancer. We got married four years back and his problem started a year back. He became almost detached from all of his friends and family. So can you imagine his regular life? He wakes up at 12 PM. After that, he starts working on laptop till midnight. This lifestyle continued for almost one year. In the meantime, my mother-in-law and father-in-law both passed away suddenly within two months. My husband could not take this shock and he was going absolutely abnormal. Now he cannot feel any happiness, any rhythm or any charm. He acts just like a robot. As a wife, I am trying my best to make him normal and happy. But nothing can change him. Here is another difficult problem in our life. I tried to do freelancing job so that we can synch our life together. But I failed badly. Now I have no income and I am totally unemployed. This thing also a big reason of his disturbance. I am trying my best to do something, but what can I do in this sector? Except this one thing, I think I fulfill every responsibility to my husband as a wife, as a best friend. In this situation, I am also becoming frustrated. I am really afraid of our current situation. We love each other for more than 11 years and struggled so much to get together. We were a very happy couple and want to live some more time happily. Will you please help us to recover this situation?","Doctor":"Hello. From what you have described, your husband has not been his usual self for more than a year. Did his problems start after his parents passed away or was he feeling low and detached even before this? It looks like he has some features of depression which have been perpetuated by adverse life events. Do not worry, it will gradually get better with some support. It is highly positive that you are understanding his situation and taking steps to get better. It is quite natural to get frustrated but try to remember that this tough period will not last forever. Try following these self-help measures: 1. Encourage your husband to open up and talk about his difficult feelings. Do not get into arguments, just try to listen and look for constructive solutions. When someone is depressed, they can be more irritable and easily frustrated. So do not try not to take critical comments personally. 2. Encourage him to do some exercise daily. It will help to lift his mood. 3. Make sure he eats healthily and sleeps well. 4. Try to make him reconnect with his close friends and family. Avoid getting isolated. But do not force it too much, needs to be done gently. 5. Try to distract by going for cinemas once in a while. If the problems persist, it may be helpful to consult your doctor locally and have some counselling to manage the difficult life situation.

It could be telogen effluvium (stress induced) or early androgenetic alopecia or visibility of scalp could be because of your short hair. Androgenetic alopecia or male pattern baldness starts with receding hair line on the temporal and frontal area of scalp then there will be thinning in the crown of scalp. I will have to see pictures taken from the front to visualize hair line receding to confirm androgenetic alopecia. Are you actively losing hairs everyday? Do you see more hairs while taking shower? Do you have family history of baldness? Any history of illness in the recent past? Any surgeries? Hospitalization? Hair needs protein for growth, diet rich in protein say 40 to 60 g of protein per day is very helpful. It depends on the body weight. Avoid hot water, use lukewarm water to wash scalp."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to grow more hair and hair thickness and avoid losing hair and thinning hair. Please check my pictures and advise me a perfect solution.","Doctor":"Hello.  I understand your concern. Your condition is known as androgenetic alopecia or male pattern baldness, which has genetic as well as hormonal factors as the causative factors. You need to use treatment for this condition regularly and it takes about 3 to 4 months to start showing the results as hair cycle itself takes this much time. Start the following medications: A. Tablet Finpecia/Propecia 1 mg, take one tablet once a day. B. Rogaine (Minoxidil) 5 % lotion apply 1 ml twice a day. C. Nizoral shampoo three days per week. Do this initially for two months and follow up after that."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Please review my ECG report. I am on Diltiazem.","Doctor":"Hello.

She started to feel irritated and we consulted one of our family doctor and he suggested to start Stalopam plus. But now a days even after taking the same medicine she is not getting proper and sound sleep. Currently, she is on Stalopam plus one capsule a day. I have attached the prescription. Please suggest us what to do?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the prescription attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Diagnosis was anxiety with insomnia for which Stalopam plus (Escitalopram) was prescribed. It seems she has developed tolerance to this drug. So, either dose should be increased or new drug should be substituted. To manage her insomnia and anxiety you need drug therapy such as starting on a sleep aid drug which also lessens anxiety like Clonazepam at dose of 0.5 mg to be taken half an hour before bedtime and continue to take the same. This will ensure quick relief of your mother's anxiety and insomnia but it has to be taken after consultation with a psychiatrist.

It mostly was being expelled via my throat with sputum. The cauterized site was yellow and there was yellow pus like all over. I have been prescribed Amoxyclav 625 for seven days, Cefuroxime 500 for seven days. The cauterized site was still not healed and was still having yellow discharge. I then consulted an ENT doctor who took a look at it and gave me Linezolid 600 for 10 days.

I have now been on Z-pak as well as Flonase and steroids for four days. My left ear feels substantially better. My right ear, however, is still a little plugged, and now I am experiencing pressure in my temple and jaw area on the right side of my head. Should I be worried? I have one more day left of Z-pak and steroids.","Doctor":"Hello. How do you feel now? Are you better? Did the pressure in the temple and area around the right jaw resolve? The reason for those two is the block of the eustachian tube on that particular side. This is the tube that equates pressure on either side of the eardrum by connecting back of the nose to the ear. When it gets blocked due to sinus or nasal problems we feel a sense of block and pressure classically in the area between jaw and ear. If the two have resolved and you are feeling better, then it is good. Otherwise, we have to check if the infection is persisting. Probably, the organism would be resistant to that particular antibiotic. In that case, I would suggest you take a course of Ciprofloxacin and Tinidazole and send a swab from the nasal cavity for pus culture sensitivity. Based on the report, we can change the antibiotic again. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Good supportive treatment is required - steroid sprays for the nose, systemic decongestants (Phenylephrine), and an antihistaminic (Allegra) to help keep the ear dry. A persistent sinus infection with ear problems requires a nasal endoscopy with documentation of ear findings also. Do revert with more details so that we can help you further.

I started having frequent panic attacks and debilitating anxiety after my grandmother's death. Before all this, I had been on Paxil. Six months before, my doctor switched me to Zoloft 50 mg and increased to 100mg and 150mg in the following consecutive months. I am very worried about the possible QTc prolongation and sudden cardiac death. I struggle daily to take Zoloft. I had three ECG. First one was taken before six months, the second one before a month and the third one in this month in which my QTc was 400 to 420. Is Zoloft safe? Will it cause me sudden cardiac death?","Doctor":"Hello. Zoloft (Sertraline) is an effective and safe SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) for managing anxiety disorder. Zoloft is generally considered a low risk for QTc (is an electrocardiogram representation of ventricular depolarization and repolarization) prolongation in healthy people. I can see that you had three ECGs in the last few months with QTc between 400 to 420 which is within normal limits. Zoloft in traditional doses (up to 200 mg daily) usually does not cause any significant increase in QTc. You are only on 150 mg once daily. So highly unlikely to have an adverse reaction. Can I ask why you are particularly worried about QTc prolongation and sudden cardiac death? Do you have any relevant risk factor like a previous heart problem or family history of arrhythmias and heart problems? Were these repeat ECGs done for any specific reason or only because of your anxiety? If you are otherwise healthy, Zoloft is generally safe. If you need any other medication for other reasons, remind your doctor that you are on Zoloft so that they can avoid prescribing medication that can potentially interact together. Also, street drugs are not advisable. Regarding your other query about Ativan (Lorazepam), you can continue gradually weaning till you are off completely. When reduced gradually chances of withdrawal effects are much lesser. It is good that you are stopping Ativan as it is not recommended for long term use. I note that you are currently in therapy. It will help to address your longstanding anxiety and develop better psychological coping strategies. It is common to experience worsening of your symptoms when you lose a loved one. Hopefully, you will recover gradually from the loss. You can also try deep breathing techniques and progressive muscular relaxation for managing stress and anxiety. I will also advise you to discuss your worry about QTc prolongation with your prescribing doctor. He will be able to monitor and advise you accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Two months ago I started feeling tingling and itching sensation between my thighs and then up to my chest.

My height is 5'11'' and I weigh 91 kg. I plan to get married this year. I am currently on no medication. I currently have the following problems for which I desire to seek some solution for premature ejaculation. I think so, there is some kind of problem on the forehead of the penis because of which my foreskin cannot get retracted. Some sort of skin attachment is present at one end of the foreskin and the head of the penis due to which the foreskin is getting hurt at times when I tried to push back. I apologize that I am not able to make myself clear enough at this point in words. I request you to provide some remedy to the problems that I am facing. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I completely empathize with you. The problem of premature ejaculation is quite common and is distressing to a young man but is seldom discussed. See most of the time the problem is secondary to the anxiety attached to your expectations in the bed. It has been wrongly projected by unscientific magazine articles and porn that a man can last for 30 minutes or more. Honestly, most of the male ejaculate before 5 minutes. When you are anxious about not lasting long in bed, you actually do not enjoy the act of intercourse and keep on thinking about prolonging the act without enjoying it. The preoccupation and anxiety about not lasting enough, in fact, cause hyperarousal and lead to premature ejaculation. Moreover, when the male start to thrust himself into the partner the moment he undresses leads to early termination of the coital act (the sexual union that takes place between male and female during insertion of the penis into the vagina). There are also lots of young men who are suffering from premature ejaculation without any associated anxiety or apprehension. Such men as well as you may benefit by taking oral medication like tablet Dapoxetine or Paroxetine before the sexual act. But in your case, I would like to suggest relaxation techniques like breathing exercises and progressive muscular relaxation. Regarding your problem pertaining to the non-retractable foreskin, my opinion is that you must consult a surgeon. It is always better to remove foreskin if it is causing inflammation or itchiness. Non-retractable foreskin is often associated with problems of genital hygiene that may subsequently lead to chronic infections. So make an appointment with a general surgeon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have left-sided pain in waist and groin region.

Also, bloating is very uncomfortable. Should I again consult a urologist? I feel there are gastric problems and there is also a pain in the groin during bowel movements. I am currently on Alfoo. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms of groin pain while sitting or during bowel movements is likely due to an inguinal hernia. The pancreatic irritation is unlikely to cause such a pain. It causes periumbilical pain and also there is no cause for it. Now, next is there a hernia or not is unsure. If it is present then you need to visit a general surgeon, confirm it and get operated as it can cause complications. In patients with hernia, they have groin swelling, sometimes only seen on standing and coughing. Just check if it is present for you or not. For your bloating problem, you should avoid fatty, oily and spicy diet. You need to have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. You need to have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Have lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits and avoid smoking and alcohol if any. Try to achieve some weight loss through diet and regular exercise. I suggest you take tablet Pantodac DSR (Domperidone and Pantoprazole) 40 mg before breakfast once a day for two weeks. Also, you should get dewormed yourself with tablet Bandy-Plus (Albendazole and Ivermectin) at bedtime once and another dose should be repeated after two weeks. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the above medicines.

After a couple of days, I used a rigid gas permeable contact wear. I have now woken up with pain in the same eye and it is now bloodshot around that one side. I decided not to wear the contacts today and I have worn the glasses only. I visited my optometrist and he has prescribed a steroid drop. I am looking for a second opinion. Of note, I have worn glasses for 25 years. I have used the RGP lenses for 12 years. Had a white patch on the edge of the cornea approximately five years back. This was attributed to contact irritation and healed after a few weeks of not wearing RGPs. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. This is a corneal ulcer. The probable cause is trauma due to lenses or infected contact lens solution. Please do not use the steroid drop. You can have devastating consequences. The steroid drops will give you very mild relief but it will stop healing and promote the growth of the ulcer. Investigations to be done include cultures of lenses and its solution. You should refrain from wearing the contacts in future. I suggest you use spectacles only. I suggest you take the following. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the following medicines. Have this treatment until the ulcer heals completely. Visit an ophthalmologist. Follow up every week. For more information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a very dark skin. One of my friends used skinlite cream and she has turned very fair. Can I also use that cream to get a fair and glowing skin?  I really want a fair skin. I am just tired of my skin. Please help me doctor.","Doctor":"Hi. Natural complexion is the best. Melanin, the pigment responsible for the skin color has protective effects. Use cleanser like cetaphil to wash your face. You can use sunscreen lotions like shade lotion regularly 2-3 times a day. Skinlite is a combination cream with steroid too. It may do more harm than good. Once you stop using, it may worsen the situation or rashes may erupt. You can use peeling agents like glyaha lotion to begin with and later with glyaha-hq lotion in the night after consulting you doctor.

I have been to the sexual clinic. They say that all my tests were negative. They keep saying it is a non-sexual rash.

What is it? I have attached the images. All the STD and HIV tests were negative.","Doctor":"Hello. The spots near the tip are a normal variation perhaps due to the keratinized mucous membrane near the tip as it is exposed and therefore it has a slightly rough texture. They are not warts.  I am more concerned about the rash on the corona of the glans. It looks like eroded skin along the circumference of glans. I would like to rule out the possibilities of either candida or yeast infection or STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) like genital herpes.

I think she had HIV, and can I get infected in this way? What is the period of the virus in the water?","Doctor":"Hello.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

And, I took an emergency pill that contains Ethinylestradiol and Levonorgestrel, three days after intercourse. I know it would not affect much because it happened the day after ovulation. But I am hoping for a different approach.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, pregnancy can occur with just precum as well but as you had taken I-pill within 72 hours then hopefully it would be effective and would prevent pregnancy. It does not matter if it was your ovulation day or not that you had unprotected act, but i-pill works in every circumstances. And second option which you could avail to totally eliminate the chance of pregnancy (as if you have not had taken pill within 72 hours) is to opt for coil (intrauterine device) in this cycle. It can be inserted up to 10 days after unprotected episode and can be kept as a long term contraceptive method or be removed after period gets started. It all depends on your choice.

As you have decribed, it was not there almost a year ago but now it has grown to this much size. I am not making you tensed but any mole which grows rapidly is a matter of great concern. You need to get a biopsy report as early as possible. The great concern is to see if any melanoma is developing in it. Any mole which has any of the following sign must need an urgent biopsy. 1. A: asymmetry. 2. B: borders irregular. 3. C: color change. 4. D: diameter greater than 5 mm. 5. E: evolving. My advice to you is to see your local dermatogist as early as possible. Do not take it easy until unless melanoma is ruled out. Skin biopsy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I met with a mountain biking accident about two years ago.

It still looks bumpy and elevated in the picture, and it can be flattened with intralesional Kenalog (Triamcinolone Acetonide) injections. You may need two to three sessions to bring it to the skin level. There are scar gels like Serica (Pracaxi oil), you can use it along with intralesional Kenalog injections to improve the texture.

How long have you been experiencing these symptoms like extreme anger, sadness, and other difficult emotions? Has there been anything ongoing stressors in your life that affects you negatively? From the information you have provided, it appears that you are stressed, experiencing depressive thoughts, and need support to cope with the emotional difficulties. Speak to a trusted family member/friend about your difficulties so that they can understand and support you. Do not keep things to yourself as it will add to your stress. Having fantasy thoughts of wanting to hurt the person you hate and self-harming thoughts can happen if you are overwhelmed by your situation and not having positive coping strategies.

Before I begin, let me assure you that there is no evidence that Finasteride causes malignancy when used for short term such as four weeks. As such, both Finasteride and Dutasteride can be used for reducing the vascularity of the prostate. Dutasteride is a good alternative. But Finasteride has better action in reducing vascularity in the short term. In short, let me assure you, there is hardly any chance of malignancy by using either Finasteride or Dutasteride.

The delusions have become very absurd and in her story, her immediate family is the culprit. She has very vivid auditory hallucinations and sometimes visual hallucinations. She has refused to see a doctor as she believes they are in on it. Her stage of psychosis is very violent in which she screams and shouts and also turns violent. This has been going on for 16 years, but now the episodes of psychosis are becoming more intense.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

An average hip x-ray is supposed to be 20 mAs/.07 mSv. So if my hip x-ray was 35 mAs, how many more mSv have I received? Was I overexposed?","Doctor":"Hello. The x-ray power output depends on mAs (milliampere-seconds) and kVp (kilovoltage peak) parameters. The average hip x-ray can be done at about 20 to 30 mAs and 70 to 80 KVp. The general rule is that the percentage increase in mAs causes a similar increase in radiation dose. In your case we can take the average tube current as 25 mAs and dose given to you is 35 mAs. Therefore you might have received 30 to 40 percent over the dose if given a 25 mAs exposure. As x-ray dose for hip x-ray is less when talking about the harmful effects of radiation, so you do not have any significant increase in radiation dose risks."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My 22 months old baby has a very high fever.

In view of such high-grade fever in such a small child, I would advise you to take the child to the nearest pediatrician in order to get the child physically evaluated and blood investigations like CBC, CRP (and others as per physical examination be done).

His fever will subside in another two days. Viral fevers last for five to seven days. A cough will remain for a few days. I suggest instead of giving syrup Levolin (Levosalbutamol/Levalbuterol), nebulize him with 1.2 mg of Levolin every six hours. This is a much lower dose than syrup and acts on lungs directly.  Apart from this, use syrup Benadryl (Syrup Diphenhydramine, Ammonium Chloride, Sodium Citrate) 5 mL thrice daily.

It does not usually affect WBC, but very rarely (like all the drugs) it can cause suppression of the blood cell formation in the bone marrow. The low WBC count can be related to different possible causes like viral disease, an autoimmune disorder, drug adverse effects, etc. A myelogram may be needed to exclude a possible hematological disorder. In the meantime, I recommend taking Eptoin, as it is well known that high fever can lead to seizures. I would also recommend taking steroids, because they can increase WBC and also help fight the fever."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was exposed to a loud noise (gunshot).

Your issues like being negative, sad, tensed, tiredness, decreased interest, weakness, decreased emotional control, sleepness, the eating problem are the core symptoms of a depressive episode.

Do you have any recent psychological trauma like breakup, examination results, or financial problem? Are you taking any medicine for any other issue? Do you have a history of self-harm? Can you reveal if there is any past medical history, the effect on you, and taken full treatment or not? I assure you that all your symptoms will disappear after treatment of depression with antidepressants and psychotherapy, CBT - cognitive behavioral therapy. The investigations to rule out a medical cause of depression are CBC (complete blood count), TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), blood sugar, serum calcium, and serum B12. Take a healthy diet, avoid junk food, do moderate exercise and relaxation technique (yoga, meditation, etc.,) which may help you.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am attaching the picture.","Doctor":"Hello. She is allergic. The allergy can be due to food, sunlight, pollens, soap, moisturizer, or powder. So she can be allergic to anything. As you mentioned that only areas that are not covered by clothes are affected, which points to photosensitivity which is an allergy to sunlight. It can be an allergy to something else as well. It is very difficult to say only on the basis of history. I would suggest to look for any particular food if she develops itching after eating something. Change soap, moisturizer, and powder. Cover the whole body while going out which will protect if she is allergic to sunlight. You can also go for skin allergy testing which will confirm the diagnosis. Take tablet Montair LC (Montelukast and Levocetirizine) whenever she has itching. Stop Allegra. It is basically prevention from allergens she is allergic to.

It can be treated, but I need to know how deep was the wound and is the mark accompanied by any scar? It will be helpful if you could provide a photo of the same. For the time being, apply Aloevera gel (natural) over the mark daily twice as it helps in healing. Regarding oily skin and dandruff, you can apply a Ketoconazole shampoo like Nizral weekly once and bath. Keep your scalp dust free. For oily skin, you can use good neem based facewash twice daily.

Your transferrin saturation and iron level are mildly decreased, and your hemoglobin level is normal. So you do not have iron deficiency anemia, but it can be an early sign of iron deficiency. You need to investigate with serum ferritin level because that indicates iron storage level.

You may be aware that Risperidone (a dopamine antagonist) is prescribed as an antipsychotic and also helps to stabilize mood whereas Wellbutrin (Bupropion- norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor) is used as an antidepressant. You need to be monitored for any potential side effects when you are taking a combination of these two medications.

My last periods was on the 25th of last month, and I started ovulating on the third of this month, and it ended on the 12th. My husband and I had sex on the fifth. Despite my history of irregular periods, I was expecting them to come this time around the same date as I was put on Cabergoline to control my high prolactin (22 on the last report) for regularity of periods. I did not get periods on 25th, but I did not worry too much, as I could have been late in general. However, I checked pregnancy on 20th of this month, which was negative, but I kept the kit. I checked the pregnancy again on 28th and found it negative again, and kept the kit again. After a few hours, I went back to throw the kits, and I found a very faint line on the 28th one, and checked the other one also and found a very faint line on that also. The one on 20th was more fade than the one on 28th. I thought it is urine or evaporation line, and did not take it seriously. I went to the hospital, and the doctors did not find any gestational sac or ectopic pregnancy in ultrasounds also. Nothing at all. But as I had a faint line, they asked me to come back after 10 days. Yesterday morning, I again did a home pregnancy test. Within 2 to 3 minutes, I got another faint T line. This time it was a bit darker as compared to the previous one. I do not understand what is going on. The doctors said that there is nothing called as false positive if the test is checked within prescribed time frame, and a T line appears only when there is some hCG hormone, however, nothing on the ultrasounds. My all four I-can strips show faint lines, but the Prega news kit does not show anything at all. Complete negative. My ultrasound shows nothing. What could be happening with me? My medications since last month are Cabergoline, Metformin, and Folic acid. The doctors say that it could be too early to say something, or it could be ectopic, which could not be verified in the ultrasounds. Could you please give me some opinion on this, as to what could have been the reasons for faint T line appearing within 2 to 3 minutes, while ultrasounds say I am not pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello.

That is the reason I am concerned. Please suggest. Also, I would like to add that the consistency is normal, not too hard or too watery.","Doctor":"Hello. The color of the poop does not matter much unless it is dark black, which is a possible sign of occult blood. Usually poops in babies on formula feed is dark green. A breastfed baby will have golden yellow poop. So, do not be worried at all. I also suggest you take some medicines to increase your milk supply as every mother gets milk at least until the baby is six months old. You can try supplements like Lactare or Lactonic granules in milk. If this does not work, I suggest trying Domstal (Domperidone) tablet and it will surely increase milk supply.

But when I was about 9 or 10 a spot came up on my penis where the glans and shaft meet. It was flesh colored, painless, and round. There was no dimple in it. I was never sexually abused or sexually active at this age. I did not even masturbate the first time until I was 12 or 13. My mom took me to the doctor and they said like just come back if it gets bigger. She had likened it to a wart, but it was not very hard or dry. Anyway, it stayed for a couple of years after that it shrinks down. It no longer appears as if it is above the skin but appears as a small pin-sized bump underneath a skin bridge. I am curious if it cannot be an STD and I have never found anything similar online. So what could it be? I would not think a wart would stick around that long. And it really does not look like that at all. That was there over 12 years so I would not think it is anything fatal. To be even more specific, it is on the top side to the right. As I said, it looks like a skin bridge with a little bump underneath. But it really has no sort of texture. And the only problem it really causes is some skin rubbing when that extra skin rubs my underwear.","Doctor":"Hello. This was likely a wart only. Warts can have very varied morphology and most plausible explanation is for wart only. Because, considering it was a single lesion, was not painful or itchy, flesh colored and it persisted for a long time and resolved on its own. So all these factors favor it. Morphology can be variable. The negative factor was not sexually active. Although most common causes are sexual contacts, but significant number of individuals may have it with non-sexual contacts as well, it can be transmitted vertically during childbirth and remain dormant for a long time activating later in life. It can be transmitted with usual contacts and can be transmitted through clothing like underwear (if came in direct or indirect contact with infected individual clothing), sharing toilets, etc., can also transmit it. So being not sexually active is not a strong factor against it. Rest all causes like skin tags which would persist without treatment or fall off suddenly, PPP (pearly penile papules) would be numerous papules, other infectious causes would be short-lived and multiple lesions and symptomatic like painful tender or red. Malignancies are unlikely at this age and would progress. So the probability is high for wart only. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

When my anger reaches a point I start crying and I have an ache in my right head. Also, I feel weak. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. It is good to know that you are insightful about having anger issues and seeking help to address the same. How long have you been having problems with anger? Have you always had an angry temperament or is it something you developed in recent years? What do your parents and friends say about it? Some people get angry in response to stressful situations; some get angry even with minor frustrations in their day-to-day life. People have different thresholds when they get angry. Uncontrolled anger outbursts happening regularly is not healthy as the body releases stress hormones which can make you emotional and also cause a headache. If you also have emotional problems, then they can be exacerbated during angry outbursts. I will recommend taking active steps to manage anger. These simple steps can help. 1. Exercise regularly. 2. Learn relaxation techniques. 3. Try yoga or meditation. 4. Have an open talk with your parents or trusted friends. If the problem is persistent, then you will benefit from counseling or anger management. You can contact again if any further advice is needed. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been suffering from itchy skin since early this year. My doctor does not know the reason for this itching. I had a blood test a few weeks ago, which came back fine. It is mostly itchy on my scalp, upper arms and back. I have been on Telfast to help with the itching and Daktacort to help with a red patch on my foreskin that my doctor said was thrush. Also, he thinks that the thrush may be the root cause of itchiness. The Daktacort has taken this patch down and almost goes away within a week but if I stop using the Daktacort the patch comes back. I have also developed a red spot on the tip of my foreskin, as well as two on the inside of my penis on the shaft. These are not itchy or sore but are just worrying to see as I am generally a healthy person. I also recently had an STI test which came back negative. My partner also had an STI test done and this came back negative as well. Any help would be great!","Doctor":"Hi. Please send the photographs of other affected areas too to help you better.

From what you describe, you have become addicted to your glasses. Your age permits you to wear lenses, and that will provide you with even better correction and vision.

What homeopathy medicine can I give him? Please suggest the recommended dose. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi. It is essential to understand the cause of a concentration problem. Based on the limited information provided here I can think of a few remedies. If your son has taken too much stress of his studies and due to which he is not able to perform well or unable to concentrate, then you can give him Kali Phos 6x two tablets twice a day for 15 days. If Kali Phos 6x is not available, then get Phos 30c three pills once a day in the evening for seven days. You can give him Five Phos 6x if he is generally not able to concentrate and the cause is not known. Five Phos 6x two tablets can be given twice a day for 15 days. I would suggest you seek help from professional homeopath either face to face or online consultation on icliniq.com. It is very important to understand the details of his problem to prescribe any homeopathic remedy correctly. I hope he will feel better with this remedy. Let me know if you have any questions or else report back in 15 days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,Five days ago, when I woke up, I felt dizzy, and my vision was off. I was sluggish all day and had a headache upon waking. I figured I was coming down with something and laid around all day on the couch. When I woke up the next, I had no headache and was no longer lethargic, but my vision was still off. I noticed that I was having double vision when I looked at objects both close and far away. I closed one eye, then the other, and my vision was perfect (binocular double vision). I also noticed that if I looked at something with my head and eyes straight, it was there and got worse if I looked down. But, when I look up with my eyes, it went away. Keeping my head pointed slightly down and looking up at something made it go away. I also noticed that it seems to be my right eye because if I gently pull the corner of my eye outward towards my ear, my vision goes back to normal.I went to the eye doctor, and she said it is because I am 44 and I need readers. I bought a pair from the local pharmacy, and it does help with my reading on the phone, computer, etc. Even though it is blurry looking at a distance, there is no double vision. Granted, maybe I do need them at my age, but that does not explain the double vision or how I can get it to go away by looking up or pulling the corner of my eye. My vision was tested along with all of the other standard tests, and it was all fine. I have 20/20 vision still after having Lasik to correct nearsightedness 13 years ago. I am not nauseous and no longer have a headache, but the problem persists. And, it is 15 days since starting the Keto diet, and I thought that maybe that could be causing this. So today I carb-loaded to replenish my glycogen stores, yet the problem persists. I flew back from a trip and read that maybe something could have happened with the pressure. I am not diabetic and do not have high blood pressure. I have no idea of what is going on and if it is severe or not. I do have an appointment with an Ophthalmologist coming week, but I am getting worried. Do you have any idea on what could it be? What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. The fact that your vision becomes better upon changing the position of the head or pulling your eyelid towards your ear proves that this is only related to your newly acquired age-related refraction. By reducing the area of the eye slit (changing the position of the head leads to the being covered more by the upper eyelid and reducing it manually by pulling your eyelid to the side), you reduce the refractive changes in your eye. The fact that the specs provide you with better vision while reading and relieves you of your main symptom is enough to make you feel calm towards this newly acquired physiological (it always starts after 40) change in vision. However, please refrain from using that correction to see distant objects because it is not designated for that distance, taking into consideration that you do not need it for distant objects, and might lead to headaches if you do. Otherwise, you should be good to go and start adapting to this newly acquired condition because from now on, every five years it is going to change and you will need more correction to correct that age-related deficit. Some additional recommendations would be to increase the size of the fonts on your devices to evade the necessity of using the specs every time you need to visualize your devices at a near distance. Also, lubrication of the eyes with artificial tears can also help maintain an absolute clarity during visual activities."},{"Patient":"the bottom part of my abdomen hurts, and i can't poop.","Doctor":"Hello, I welcome you to icliniq.

Also, I would like to know why my back keeps hurting right where the spine meets the pelvis, i.e., at the bottom of my back but above my butt. I am 18. Will it make any difference?","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for providing a brief history. It sounds to me as the SI (sacroiliac) joint dysfunction. Due to which, there will be a kind of biomechanical changes in the bone and the joint compression leading to pressure on the joint receptors. Also, there might be a weakness of the muscles of the hip and lower back which may be leading to this discomfort. I would recommend you to take up an x-ray because it will reveal if there is any structural or anatomical alignment change. Also, having a hot water fomentation and exercises will help strengthen the muscles of the core, lower back, and hip and help reduce the symptoms.

Apply it daily twice over the area and see that it is undisturbed for at least four hours which means you should not apply oil or any other cream over it, and you should not sweat much in that time because those things will dilute the medicine.

According to your height, your weight is average. In bulimia, CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) is helpful. If Prozac (Fluoxetine) is not working, then you have to increase the dose of Prozac or shift to another medicine. It is a learning process so that you have to change this to a better one. Continuous thought of purge will come to mind, but you have to stop the though by not reacting to that.

Effexor (Venlafaxine) and Trazodone are good drugs for depression and anxiety but will have some side effects. You may take Ashwagandha 600 mg (morning and night), Centella Asiatica (morning and night) as a supportive therapy.

I have a single gallstone which is 10 mm in size that was noticed incidentally in ultrasound. Is it necessary to undergo cholecystectomy before planning my second pregnancy? I had nonspecific episodes of abdominal pain in the last two years which were not typical of gallbladder pain because the pain was more located in the center and lower abdomen. But the intensity of the pain was severe and was associated with nausea, and vomiting which relieved only after taking intramuscular painkillers.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your case and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This looks like a symptomatic uncomplicated gallbladder stones. Even though you say that the symptoms have not been typical of biliary colic but the repeated episodes of pain, need for parenteral analgesics, and no other attributable cause leads to consider gallbladder stones as the cause for your pain. Without surgery, there is 50 % chance of recurrent pain episodes per year, 2 % chance of biliary complications per year, and 30 % will have no further pain if there was only one episode of biliary pain previously. The best option in this situation is laparoscopic cholecystectomy especially if you are planning a pregnancy. Since during pregnancy, the risk of recurrent pain and complications are higher. The other issue is that risk of surgery in the first and third trimester is significantly higher with the preferable period for surgery in pregnancy being the second trimester. You can consider medical dissolution therapy of gallstones but the efficacy is 30 to 49 %. And this is mainly based on the unimpaired motor activity of gallbladder, which has to be assessed before therapy (only with good motor activity of gallbladder the efficacy of 30 to 49 % can be predicted). The best option in your case is laparoscopic cholecystectomy."},{"Patient":"Lower back pain unable to put pressure on legs to walk. 3 weeks ago I was lifting my dog into the car.

Then while bending down to get a dish out of the dishwasher I got a horrible pain in my lower back. The pain knocked me to the ground. My husband had to help me off the ground to the bed . Since then I have not been able to put pressure on my legs to walk without horrible pain.","Doctor":"Hello, You need to be examined to determine if this is a back strain or a sciatica from a pinched nerve. Is there any numbness in the leg, does the leg feel weak apart from the pain you feel while trying to walk, can you control your bladder well ,does the pain worsen upon straining ? If the answer to the questions is yes then you have a disc prolapse and you will need to see a doctor and perhaps a MRI too.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

In my whole life, I had a lot of bad things that have happened to me and my family, but I have never dealt with them. This past year a lot of bad personal situations have happened, and now I am starting to notice the blackouts. What can I do?","Doctor":"Hello. You should get yourself investigated for the blackouts and memory problems you face. First, you should consult a neurologist for that. Once every other neurological issue are cleared, then only we can diagnose whether it as related to your anxiety, depression or PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) if so then it is psychogenic. In most cases, a psychogenic blackout is an involuntary reaction of the brain to pressure or distress. Psychogenic blackouts sometimes develop after people have experienced ill-treatment or trauma and such conditions are treatable and curable. But we need to identify the severity of anxiety and PTSD and then the treatment slowly starts with medicines, psychotherapy and relaxation therapy. You can be cured completely, but it takes some time. Consult a psychologist or psychiatrist. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A few months ago I had a right side upper molar issue. I went to a clinic and was given an antibiotic, but it did not help. I went to the clinic after some days, and I asked for Clindamycin and still there was no result. The dentist tapped on the tooth, and there was no pain. He surmised it as chronic sinusitis. I purchased a lavage apparatus and all kinds of nasal sprays. The pain was really bad because I thought it might be a viral infection. I used Tylenol after reading how to deal with the pain. Though I know that Tylenol is not the correct drug for my pain, it worked for some time. Now I get unbearable pain (burning sensation) above the molar on both sides. I started using Tylenol many times a day. I am not addicted to it but thought of getting relieved from pain for at least six hours. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. You need to get a professional evaluation because your symptoms may lead to septal perforation, nasal bleeding and permanent loss of sense of smell. I would advise going for nasal endoscopy if you were to do that then follow it up if needed with a CT scan of nose and sinuses. If there is any sign of infection go for a sample culture sensitivity and take the most appropriate antibiotic after the culture sensitivity report comes from the microbiology lab which usually takes three days. If there are no signs of infection, you can have some nasal saline douching with steroid nasal sprays and nasal anti-inflammatory steroidal sprays."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is 59-years-old and has mitral stenosis. CMV was done 35 years back. Now recently she had a heartbeat of 150 and atrial flutter, and she was on Acitrom previously. She has undergone DC cardioversion shock. Now latest ECG shows atrial ectopic and her heart rate is 70 to 80. Can she undergo operation soon? If yes, which valve would be best for her biological or mechanical? Which is the best and latest generation biological valve in the world market?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, she is now a candidate for mitral valve replacement. However, you should make a note that valve replacement is not a complete solution. Firstly, at this age, a mechanical valve is better considering the durability of the valve. Bileaflet valve is the preferred one. Next, she has to be on regular blood thinners. Otherwise, there is a risk of valve dysfunction which may lead to a repeat surgery if blood is not adequately thinned.  Also, this heartbeat problem may not go even after valve replacement and has to be controlled on medicines. Even now she should be on beta blockers like Metoprolol, then Diltiazem to keep heart rate controlled, which are quite effective. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am having problem of acute flaky dandruff and also itching in my hair.

I have attached the reports of blood test done a couple of days back. This blood test report includes other tests too apart from hs-CRP. I have previously been advised that high lipoprotein and hs-CRP can cause cardio related issues. How do I get the hs-CRP back into range? And do I need to go for further checkup to find the actual cause of inflammation? I have no other medical condition except lower back pain. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern regarding the raised hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) and lipoprotein levels (attachment removed to protect patient identity). These biomarkers are predictors of future events. They tell you that there is an inflammatory state that is going on and that will contribute to your blood vessels to the heart and brain possibly getting blocked. So, you need to take steps to prevent a heart attack in the future. They have done a study called JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention : an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) where they used an anti-cholesterol medicine called Rosuvastatin 20 mg for patients like you with a raised CRP and normal cholesterol levels. They have found it causes a 50% reduction in future heart attacks. You may benefit by taking tablet Rosuvas (Rosuvastatin) or Rozat 10 mg once daily for at least 2 years. This will prevent heart attacks, stroke and bring down your hs-CRP levels. But you need to also know that there is a very small risk of new onset diabetes for patients taking this drug. Second you need to change your lifestyle. You need to lose weight. Just going on medications is not the answer to these diseases. You need to get yourself a personal trainer in a gym and work with him to lose weight. You may also consult a dietitian to reduce your calories. Is there any family history of heart disease? If you smoke, you need to quit smoking at the earliest."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I was on Ritalin from 9 years to 14.

I have a major problem with being over sexual to the extent that I would harm myself for gratification. I want to be humiliated and struggle with what is called small penis humiliation. I have never harmed others, but I am afraid that I will make myself into risk by doing self-harming and repeating it for the needs. I want to stop it, so I tried lowering my testosterone, but it just comes back occasionally. And it masks the problem that there must be something wrong in my brain.","Doctor":"Hello. If you think that your sexual need is increased by Concerta (Methylphenidate), I have a few advice for you, which you should discuss with your psychiatrist. 1. Can he slightly decrease the dose? Till your symptoms of ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) does not flare-up. 2. Add some second-generation antipsychotic like Risperidone which ultimately increases your prolactin level and decrease sexual urge. 3. Avoid porn and do not watch such type of videos. 4.

It is suggested that you should get your hormonal profile for day-2 of cycle done and also take to sequential ultrasonographic follicular and endometrial thickness monitoring which would indicate the state of endometrialization due to estrogens and also the correct time of ovulation. This can be corrected by starting estradiol pills in the first half of the cycle followed by progesterone-only pills post ovulation, which shall prevent these bleeding episodes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had mucus from the throat, and it had minor blood in it.

For three days, I had light cramps on and off in lower abdomen. Since two days, I am having nauseous feeling. Took a home pregnancy test and got negative result. Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Irregular periods are not only be associated with thyroid but few other conditions too. Check this time for your periods. Suppose, you are still not getting, but having nauseous feeling and vomiting sensation, then I would suggest you to get a beta-hCG test done to rule out pregnancy. Beta-hCG test is a blood test carried out that gives more confirmatory and accurate results even after home pregnancy test is found to be negative. No matter whether the results of beta-hCG is found to be positive or negative, I would recommend you to get an ultrasound of pelvis done. If the ultrasound scan shows negative result, we can rule out the possibility of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). If the ultrasound scan turns out to be positive, we can know the pregnancy details. Medicine to get periods can be prescribed if pregnancy is ruled out. 1. Beta-hCG and 2. Ultrasound of pelvis.

I have been itching all over for months and constantly covered with bruises, petechiae and livedo reticularis. I was diagnosed with erythromyalgia. I also have severe bone pain. My blood work came back with elevated RBC, Hb, Hct, low alkaline phosphate, low BUN and creatinine. My vitamin B12 levels are in 1000s and not under 200. The neurologist says that I have fibromyalgia and changed my seizure medicines for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Do I think that I should visit a hematologist and figure out why my bones hurt so badly in my legs and why I am so itchy? My current medication includes Oxycodone and Lamotrigine for epilepsy.","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: The elevated hemoglobin, red blood cell count and hematocrit signify polycythemia. Elevated Vitamin B12 level is one of the markers of myeloproliferative disorder. I would strongly think of polycythemia vera. Other values are within normal range (attachment removed to protect patient identity) suggest no renal or liver disorders. Increased hematocrit will slow down blood flow due to increased viscosity and this can cause few RBC to move out and lead to these symptoms. Even migraine, bone pain and increased itching can be attributed to sluggish blood flow. Polycythemia vera is a cancerous condition and requires evaluation. I would strongly urge you to meet hematologist. Hope there are no other causes of polycythemia like lung disorders or staying in hilly regions, etc. With high vitamin B12 and polycythemia, polycythemia vera needs to be seriously evaluated.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My doctor has prescribed me tablet Moxclav 625 antibiotic for cough and infection. I also take progesterone tablet. Are these tablets safe for my baby? Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Ideally, till 14 weeks of pregnancy, no antibiotics are prescribed. Symptomatic and natural methods of management of cough and sore throat (if present) are advised. This is because these are the organ forming weeks for the fetus and hence all antibiotics are usually avoided as a safety precaution. But if the infection has increased and the situation is such that fever is continuous with a bad sore throat, yellow sputum and cough, then pregnancy-safe antibiotics like Amoxicillin alone without Clavulanic acid combination is considered safe before 14 weeks. Another antibiotic being Azithromycin 500 mg single dose daily can be taken for 5 days safely. Progesterone, on the other hand, is an absolutely safe medication and given during the first trimester to support the pregnancy in the form of adequate placentation into the uterus and sufficient trophoblastic invasion into the endometrium for better uteroplacental flow. So, progesterone at this stage is absolutely safe.  However, it is advised that before using antibiotics you may try warm saline gargles thrice a day and steam inhalation twice a day accompanied with adequate hydration as symptomatic management. If this fails, you can then resort to antibiotics."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 30 years old. I observed something on the penis. It is like it burns and is red in color.

No burning, just slight urethra burning. I went to a urologist. He told me nothing was wrong, maybe an overactive bladder. I go to the toilet every two hours or three. I never knew what was wrong, but I started to obsess over it and it got worse to a place that my mind is in urination 24/7. I almost gave up until I went on a vacation and during that vacation, I forgot about it totally. The frequency was gone and even the burning urethra. Also, I had to remove my wisdom teeth and when I did, I was so occupied thinking about it that I forgot about urination and I noticed that I do not use the bathroom like I used to. But, I got back obsessing about it again and it got to a point that I urinate a lot of high volumes every hour. It comes suddenly and goes on its own.

None of the remedies we tried have produced relief such as wet wraps, bleach baths, ointments, eczema creams, cortisone, etc. Is there a product that is good and available OTC?

Need to abstain from alcohol on an immediate basis as liver would take another six months to possibly recover. Repeat the test after three months. Also start Vitamin B12 and Folic acid supplements.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Is it a wrong way of doing? I do not get excited during sex and unable to ejaculate. Only, rubbing the tip of the penis gives me excitement. Also, two weeks ago, I have undergone circumcision as my foreskin did not retract. Before circumcision too, I have the same problem. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. For further doubts consult a sexologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 26 year old female. At the beginning of this year, I had a bad cold, and two weeks later, I had a tingling in the wrists, feet, and legs, which the doctor said was reactive arthritis which lasted a few weeks. Then, the first time my left hand felt weak was five months back. It felt weak, more so at rest but, when I had to grip things, I was able to. I went to a physio and had a neck massage as my back was also tense and the next day, the weakness was gone. So, the massage helped it. Now, more recently, I had foot weakness on the left side and a weakness and very mild tingling in hand. Again, my back is very tense and tight from gym and work position. As soon as I get this, I get very anxious, and I feel the tingling gets worse. The only difference in daily activities is lifting weights at the gym, weighted squats, and heavier arm exercises. I used the foam roller on my foot last night, and today the foot weakness was gone. The foot weakness lasted 12 hours on and off. There are no problems walking or anything like that. It just felt weaker but, it was not. The weakness always comes randomly but, I do seem to always have a tight back when the weakness occurs as well. Could this be MS? Does it sound like it? I am extremely worried now. I have never been diagnosed with it. I have just read about it online. What could this be from? I went to the opticians last week, and my eyes were fine. There were no eye symptoms. It was just a standard check-up. My eyes were said to be perfect. I do not have any bladder or bowel symptoms and no other weakness anywhere else.","Doctor":"Hello. For more information consult a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an 18 year old boy. Last year, I made a very best friend. He was like my second half. He used to share each and everything with me. A few months back, I saw him with his ex-girlfriend, and they were in a relationship now. He never told me that. She lives near my home, and my friend always drops her to her home, but whenever I asked him to come to my place he used to tell that it is too far away. Then we had a major fight without any violence, and we both stopped talking. Then I started realizing that I like him so much. I miss him as he used to hold my hand in public places always. I started remaining sad the whole day. I was depressed, and I tried to commit suicide. After that, it is like at sometimes during the night I express all my warm feelings with anyone on chat, and after a few minutes, I regret it. I feel like there are two persons inside me. First I thought that it is split personality, but I do not have memory loss. Please help me. What should I do? I hate his girlfriend. But, I am not sure whether I love my friend or not. Sometimes, I feel like I love him and after a few minutes, it is like just friendship. Am I gay? But, but I have a crush on girls also. I think I am attracted to both boys and girls. I am totally confused. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your problem. This is completely normal at the age of 18 years. You like your friend as a friend and not as a partner. He was very close to you, but it does not mean you are gay. This is a very common feeling at your age. At this age, we can get attracted towards both the sexes, but this feeling is temporary. As your friend is in a relationship with a girl, it is evident that he will less interact with you. So do not get hurt. You should respect your friendship and his decision. Presently you are irritable because of depression, and you miss your relationship. You have suicidal ideation. To avoid this situation get involved yourself in some outdoor games and other hobbies. Make new friends, interact socially and stop negative thinking. If this thought sustains, then you can visit a local psychiatrist for treatment with medicines. But, do not worry. You will be fine.

She weighs 55 kg, non-diabetic, no previous history of dyslipidemia and she is quite active. What investigations should be done immediately? And how to proceed?","Doctor":"Hello. Well, a single episode with the symptoms of uneasiness and weakness is most of the times nonspecific or due to a mild anxiety attack. If such is the case you should not be worried about it. But, if such episodes are frequent and comes repeatedly, then definitely it should be thoroughly investigated. Though her BP (blood pressure) is slightly on the higher side, it is not as high as to cause sudden onset and prolonged uneasiness. To be on the safer side, I would like to suggest her very mild antihypertensive and anxiolytic for a short duration. But before that, I would like you to get few investigations done on empty stomach and let me know the reports. Another important factor to consider for her is that it may also be related to menopause, which can lead to hormonal disturbances, anxiety, uneasiness, hot flushes, mood disturbances and intolerance to mild/moderate heat and cold. So, kindly let me know about any recent changes in her menstrual cycles, so that I can evaluate that aspect too. Revert back with the investigation reports to a general medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from loose motions since last three days. I have visited a doctor. He advised me Oflox 200, Entroquinol and Deulac forte for three days. I have taken the medicines as prescribed until today but even then they have not reduced. I am traveling, so it is difficult for me. Kindly suggest the course of action.","Doctor":"Hello. Since there is no response, you need to change the medicines. You should have Oflox OZ (Ofloxacin and Ornidazole) 200 mg or 500 mg twice a day for five days along with tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast for five days. Also, for symptomatic relief, you should have tablet Racecadotril (Redotil) 100 mg up to three times till stools stop. This will reduce stool frequency and output but need to continue above mentioned antibiotics for five days. More importantly, you need to have plenty of water and ORS (oral rehydration solution) 100 to 200 ml with each stool output.

I am extremely allergic to Fentanyl, Propofol, and Versed. Are there any alternatives to these anesthetics? I am currently on Synthroid.","Doctor":"Hello. If you are allergic to these agents, I suggest you undergo a detailed allergy test with various agents so that you will be able to know which agents are safer for you. There are so many agents and techniques available nowadays in the field of anesthesia. If you are allergic to Propofol, Thiopentone (Sodium Thiopental) or Etomidate is a safer option. For analgesia, the multimodal technique will be a safer option including regional anesthesia, various blocks, NSAIDS, etc. Versed (Midazolam) can be avoided at all during surgery. So my suggestion to you is to inform your anesthetist about this and leave your worries on him."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 39-year-old male with a history of hypertension. My BP medication was changed for the past six months and doctor put me on Metosartan 50, and Amlodipine 5 mg. For four to five weeks, my ankle joints are swollen. I went to an orthopedic, and he asked for a venous Doppler lower limb. Other results CRP, vitamin B12, ANA, uric acid, are normal. ESR is 20. There are remarks in venous Doppler, and he suggested for a physician opinion. I am attaching the Doppler report. Please give your opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your Doppler report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Before making the diagnosis, I want a few things pertaining to your problem, like your complaining of swelling of both ankles joints like on and off. 1. Do you have a fever with regards to swelling? 2. Do you have any history of injury? 3. Whether the swelling is continuous or is there any joint pains? 4. It is better if you can attach your picture of ankle joint. And do you a history of varicose veins? From the above Doppler, I can make an inconclusive diagnosis. Bilateral inguinal lymph node signifies infection that can be treated with proper antibiotics. And another one with prominent perforators of GSV (great saphenous vein) as it means initial stages of developing varicose veins might eventually lead to swelling of the leg."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 20-year-old female.

From the past four days, I am having lower back ache, lower abdominal pain (sometimes cramps), and leg pain. I had done a home pregnancy test yesterday (which is two days after a missed period), and the test was negative. Is there anything to worry about?","Doctor":"Hello. No, there is nothing to worry about. That was a usual vaginal discharge which usually increases during mid-cycle due to estrogen surge in the body. It is a normal phenomenon. I would advise you to get a regular birth control method for your peace of mind."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Yesterday while preparing food, a spoon full of hot oil splashed on my hand.

Good your father is under treatment, continue without any break, that is the most important thing. Diet also plays a vital role in TB treatment. Consume fruits, and vegetables like orange, mango, sweet pumpkin, carrots, guava, amla, tomato, nuts, and seeds are an excellent source of Vitamin A, C and E. Protein-rich foods, and foods rich in B complex Vitamins should be taken. Ask him to have a boiled egg daily. He needs more protein because they aspirate effusion fluid from the chest, that is rich in protein. So there will be protein loss. To compensate add more protein-rich food."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My wife is pregnant. Her hb level is 8.7 and delivery due date is 4th may. The doctor suggested blood transfusion.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

In my opinion, your daughter got some insect bite reaction as in pictures all pinpoint boils are in curved fashion as most commonly seen when any bug or insect crawl bite on skin.

I would recommend you to mix Hydrocortisone cream with Fucidin cream (Fusidic acid) in an equal amount and apply twice daily for seven days. Do not use any cream alone.

No specific test is usually required in such cases."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Over the last three days, the tip of my penis has become very tight and looks swollen.

It was an arranged marriage, so we took the time to understand each other before making love we took five months, and we did not do it. But after five months period, he tried for one year and could not make it. He can only ejaculate for some seconds. Is this because after marriage we took five months and so he is not able to make it now?","Doctor":"Hello. It is not because of the five-month gap. He might be suffering from premature ejaculation disorder. Why did you wait for five months? Does your husband have any bad previous sexual experience? If he had a failed sexual intercourse, he will try to avoid it, because he thinks it is going to be a failure again. And he woulod be afraid of getting humiliated infront of you. So he thinks it is better not to have sex. On management part, first try to relax him, and make him understand that you love him even without sex. Now start working on a treatment. 1. SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) antidepressants and Clomipramine. 2. Anesthetic spray on glans penis before sex (only a few studies support it). 3. Weak pelvic floor muscles sometimes contribute to it. Kegel exercises may help strengthen them. Wear a condom as it may desensitize him.

This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It started about three weeks ago when my fiance and I had multiple sexes in a day for almost a week. At first, the bleeding was very little, only during intercourse, and stopped immediately after the intercourse. We had sex before three days, and the bleeding was minimal. But now the bleeding continues. I can tell that it is coming from my vagina wall (near the entrance) instead of the uterus. Neither of us has STI or STD. I am on combination pill Rigevidon for almost a year. The pain goes away immediately after intercourse, and it is not that intense. What could be the problem? I also do not have a yeast infection.","Doctor":"Hello. The most common cause of post-coital bleeding is either vaginal mucous frictional lesions, and the other is cervical erosions or cervicitis (lesions over the cervix which bleed due to frictional injury during intercourse). It is essential that you should get speculum examination, and pap smear done to check for cervicitis, and any vaginal mucous lesions if any. Please avoid intercourse. If diagnosed then this may require a course of antibiotics for the next 10 days as would be advised by a gynecologist after evaluation. Please consult your gynecologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a pink eye. An allergy specialist advised me medications, and my eyes improved a lot. But I used Visine for a year every day, and that made my eyes addicted to that, and every time they became more red now.

I understand your concerns and have gone through your photo attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The brown patches are suggestive of benign melanosis, and the red lines are blood vessels. The blood vessels can reduce in size and number when Visine (Tetrahydrozoline HCI) drops are used, but due to the mechanism of action, the drops will lose their potency over prolonged periods of use. Other than that your eyes look fine. The benign melanosis, as the name suggests is a harmless patch of pigmentation and the blood vessels although a bit prominent are not suggestive of any disease. There are no signs of serious infections. I hope this helps you. In case you have any further questions, please let me know."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 35-year-old female.

She has tried different creams and ointments such as Hydrocortisone, Hydrocortisonum Oceanic, Bactroban 2 %, Freederm, Duac, Virupos, Fusidic Acid, Oilatum, and even Elocom.

Obstruction of the veins prevents the flow of blood from the liver to the heart. Obstruction is due to the formation of a fibrous web in the blood vessel or blood clots.

It is very rare that Paracetamol causes allergy. And you are also giving Paracetamol for the last three years, and there was no allergy. Generally, allergies increase by repeated exposures.

I had large blood clots, and I soak through a sanitary pad every one to two hours. My last normal period was before five months. After that, I did not get a period for the next two months. I got a period on the third month but it only lasted for one day, and it was light. In the fourth month, my period was strange. It was a mixture of spotting, light bleeding, and moderate to heavy bleeding which lasted for 11 days. It stopped because I took a Plan B emergency contraceptive pill not because I had unprotected sex but because I read that it will stop the period. My period ended after that for three days. I had spotting before seven days which continued as a normal period after two days. From the next day of my normal period and till now, I have been bleeding very heavily and passing large clots. I had a surgical abortion last year at 13 weeks. My period came back on the very next month of my abortion. After three months, my gynecologist did a transvaginal ultrasound to check me for PCOS. The ultrasound showed that I had polycystic ovaries, but blood work showed normal hormones, so PCOS diagnosis was not confirmed. The ultrasound was otherwise normal. Before three months, my endocrinologist wanted to do a scan because she still believed I had PCOS. The scan was normal, and It just showed polycystic ovaries. She did another round of hormone testing, and my hormones were normal after which PCOS diagnosis was not confirmed. I am 5’9 in height and 270 lbs in weight. I gained over 50 lbs since last year due to depression from abortion. Now I have been reading a lot about uterine (womb or endometrial cancer), and I am worried that I might have cancer. Can uterine cancer develop that quickly?","Doctor":"Hello. I doubt that you have PCOS which is the most common cause of irregular cycle in young age like you. Secondly, it is not necessary that hormonal levels become abnormal always to make a diagnosis of PCOS. It could be a clinical diagnosis as well as based on the presence of irregular cycles and ultrasound evidence of polycystic ovaries. The main cause of heavy bleeding is that when one does not get periods regularly the lining of the womb becomes thicker and when it sheds it causes heavier and prolonged bleeding. And the thick endometrial lining is one of the risk factors for the development of endometrial cancer in later life. But it does not develop at early ages commonly. It is usually a problem of menopausal women, but PCOS is one of the risk factors for development. So it has been recommended to regularise your cycle with the help of pills to avoid heavier bleeding and regular shedding of the lining of the womb. I hope it has helped you.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. If you have a low sex drive, then this should be evaluated properly. Medical causes like diabetes and hypertension should be ruled out. This might be due to hormonal issues. Your serum prolactin and progesterone levels should be checked. Normal levels will rule out the hormonal cause. Do you have pain during sex? Because pain could be one reason for low sex drive. Using a good lubricant during sex will reduce pain and will also help to increase pleasure which in turn will improve the drive with time. You should spend more time in foreplay. This will increase the chances of good orgasm which will make sex more pleasurable. This will also increase sex drive with time. As such there are no specific drugs for female sex drive. Drugs containing L-Arginine have some roles in improving drive. L-Arginine in a dose of 500 mg per day help to increase engorgement of the clitoris which will increase sexual pleasure and drive with time. I hope this helps.

HIV tri dot antibody test is having good sensitivity and specificity in ruling out HIV as like that of fourth generation ELISA.

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Now, I am facing a fluttering sound in my ear. What should be done?","Doctor":"Hi. Generally, polyp in sinus needs to be removed. If ethmoidal polyp, then it can be treated with steroid spray. Ear problem can or cannot be due to a polyp. You need to tell your complaint in detail. Sometimes, polyp can block the eustachian tube and ears and it can cause ringing or fluttering in the ear. Kindly tell me in detail so that I can guide the treatment. If you have got a CT scan done, then you can send me or else you must get a CT scan PNS (paranasal sinus) done.

After trying to get rid of it using Neti pot and Flonase, I started taking antibiotics. I had my sinuses scraped about four years ago due to a recurrent sinus infection. I went to a dentist because of a broken tooth, that was causing me pain. The dentist put me on two more antibiotics to treat the pain. So, currently I am under Alprazolam 0.5 mg (four times a day), Truvada (once daily), Quetiapine and Buspirone at bedtime. I have horrible diarrhea and nausea every morning and wake up with a terrible sinus headache still. I am at my wit's end, and cannot see my regular doctor for a month. I am getting the tooth extracted in two days, hope it will help. Any guidance would be so much appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. So you have two issues, one is your sinusitis, and the other is diarrhea. Gastritis is probably antibiotic associated, so you need to discuss with your doctor and change the antibiotics that are causing your diarrhea. I would suggest the following for your gastric problems. For sinusitis along with antibiotics I would suggest you try the following. For a headache, you can have Paracetamol or Ibuprofen whenever needed. If it is not helping, then you need to discuss with your local doctor for a short course of oral steroids.

So, a few days back I did a CT scan PNS, and the report says there is predominant ethmoidal sinusitis and DNS deviated towards left. Kindly tell me how serious is my condition as per the above description of CT scan PNS. I am not willing to do surgery. Let me know whether it can be taken care of without doing surgery or not, and also kindly advise me with medicines and other measures to take care of my illness.","Doctor":"Hi. It is not a severe condition, and the surgery is not always required if there is a response to treatment. You appear to have two issues, one is allergic sinusitis, and another one is DNS (deviated nasal septum). Your predominant symptoms are likely due to allergic sinusitis. So treatment depends upon the frequency of the symptoms. If the symptoms are occurring on a daily basis or most of the days of a week, then you may need a long course of treatment. If you are having symptoms on and off, then you may require a short-term treatment. It is advisable to get yourself examined by a local doctor once. We usually prescribe Duonase nasal spray (Fluticasone propionate with Azelastine) which is given two times a day for four to five days if the symptoms are occasional. It is not advisable in persons having infections like fever and body ache. Also, we also ask to have tablet Solvin cold (Paracetamol with Phenylephrine) at bedtime whenever required. Steam inhalation done during a significant period for three times will help. Usually, patients respond well to medicines and surgery is not always needed.

The allergy that you may be talking about is probably milk dripping from the sides of the lips onto the cheeks and chin. This milk may be causing those allergic rashes on the cheeks and chin. Please observe, and if it is so, please wipe off the milk that is dripping. Another thing that you mentioned is that he has trouble breathing and nausea. Generally, children below the age of six months make certain sounds from the nose and mouth that makes us feel they are breathless. However, these children can take feeds well. If such is the case, then your child is normal with respect to your sense of breathlessness. Do not worry. Please note that even after taking the above steps if there is no improvement or worsening over the next few days, it is best to get the child evaluated physically by a pediatrician."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have questions concerning about the skin on my face.

It subsided in about three days. Before a week, I remember her throwing tantrums and crying hard for every small thing and again developed a hoarse voice. I gave warm water and honey, and it has subsided a lot. Sometimes her voice sounds normal, and when she screams or cries, I can still feel her voice is a little hoarse. Is this hoarseness due to crying or could be any other infection? I read that hoarseness could occur due to cancer. I am a paranoid mother who gets scared after reading the stuff. She does not have any cold, cough and eats normally. In spite of her hoarse voice, she is taking ice creams and cold stuff. If the hoarseness is due to any serious medical condition, would she have any accompanying symptoms? My main concern is cancer. What would be the symptoms of laryngeal cancer other than hoarseness? She is a very adamant kid and still screams if things do not go her way. Suggest remedies to get rid of hoarseness. Please remove my anxiety towards cancer.","Doctor":"Hello. Relax do not worry. She does not have laryngeal cancer (vocal cord cancer), it is a vocal cord abuse. It is due to screaming she is having hoarseness of voice, so it is temporary. Give her warm water and if she can gargle then let her do it with salt water gargle. Based on your history I can understand that she has a minor behavior issue, typical of a toddler. When she starts screaming then try to divert her attention, so you can stop her screaming. A positive note is that the child forgets quickly and so you can do it. If you still have some queries, then please visit ENT doctor and get her vocal cord checked."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I feel like I have water in my chest,and neck which goes down to the stomach, underarms. The precise explanation is like a sweat inside my body that travels in those areas (chest, stomach, underarms, and abdominal wall). What can this be?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, this does not appear to be a life-threatening or severe issue. Most probable diagnosis goes with your explanation is of dyspepsia (indigestion) or gaseous issues. Does your upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, and burping increase while taking food? Do you have sour water feeling in the throat or chest burning? If yes, it further supports the diagnosis. You should avoid fatty, oily, and a high-calorie diet. Go for a walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Eat lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. You can get prescribed tablet Pan DSR 40 mg (Domperidone, Pantoprazole) before breakfast once a day for a week. Do you feel any palpitations or chest pain along with it? If yes then we should rule out the cardiac issue. Anyway, you should get yourself examined and auscultated to rule out any other issues. So, overall, does not appear to be a worrisome matter, and your symptoms do not indicate any severe disease.

He is gassy and cries mostly from evening till midnight. Spits up even after burping for 30 minutes. I give exercise, and tummy time, but there is no change. He gets reflux which makes him uncomfortable. His spits are watery. My pediatrician suggested Colicaid and Yamoo which I am using four times a day. Still, he gets gas and spits up. And now he did not poop for the past two days and trying very hard and cries in between feeds by trying to poop. Is this an effect of enzymes? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Please note the following, 1. The clinical picture that you are giving is most suggestive of reflux. It is advisable first to get a reflux study done to find the grade of reflux. 2. The initial medications to be given in reflux are Zantac (Ranitidine) and Perinorm (Metoclopramide). In most cases, this works. The next step beyond this is Gaviscon (antacid) and feed thickening. 3. Also very important is to keep the child in a slightly upright position (30 degrees to ground) after feeding (and most of the time) to reduce the amount of discomfort the child may be facing due to reflux. This one method goes a long way in helping children. As the child grows bigger, the need for this reduces eventually. 4. As regards to the crying episodes during stools, if the stools are hard or if there is gas the child may cry. Both are less likely due to the enzymes. They are mostly physiological considering the clinical scenario of the child."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is currently taking treatment from a psychiatrist for depression.

I would recommend taking daily baby Aspirin 80 mg to help the progression of these changes. In my opinion, her current therapy is quite complicated, and many interactions between drugs can worsen her situation. I would recommend stopping Mirnite (Mirtazapine) and Sertee (Sertraline) because they both interact with Ventab XL (Venlafaxine). Increasing the dose of Ventab XL may be necessary.

But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

It gives a crackling sensation because of the air pressure underneath and looks like a smooth swelling of the face. Root canal flare-up might result in swelling but with severe pain. Visible periradicular changes start two to three days after endodontic treatment. To my knowledge, air trap in a medicated canal would not directly cause complications but the major reasons are improper canal irrigation, preparation, and over instrumentation.

I am having spinal surgery on L4 and L3 next month. I have been on 90 mg of Nardil,an MAOI, for the last 32 years. Is there any general anesthesia that can be used so that I do not have to come off this medication, or do I have to be off it two weeks before surgery?","Doctor":"Hello. The anesthetic drugs and their dose are carefully chosen after considering patients age, general health, condition of vital organs, previous history of diseases, concomitant medications, and duration of surgical procedure, etc. Hence, before any elective surgery, the anesthesia specialist will do a thorough examination and necessary investigations to fix the anesthetic drugs. Rarely in some case, it becomes very difficult to fix safe anesthetic drugs. Only in such cases, the anesthetist may deny the surgery. In your case, many good safe anesthetic drugs will not interact with your MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) drugs so that you can continue the current medication. If your anesthetist feels that those safe anesthetic drugs are not suitable for you (based on your body condition and duration of surgery), then he may use anesthetic drugs that may interact with MAOI. In such a case, alternative to MAOI will be started with the help of a psychiatrist. The anesthesiologist will coordinate all these. Hence, you do not worry about this part. With the current details given by you and without doing a personal examination, I am not in a position to discuss further drug details. But, I can assure you that your concern will be solved when an anesthetist examines you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 40-year-old male. Recently I was diagnosed with LVH in ECG (possible LVH).

When the heart has to exert more against raised BP, it hypertrophies just like an athlete when exercises, his muscles undergo hypertrophy, same is with heart.

My in-laws are planning a trip after three months, and I am trying to verify if there is still a risk for pregnant women in regards to the Zika virus. The CDC states to consult with our physician, which I, unfortunately, do not have one currently, especially a gynecologist. I am hoping to get even just pointed in the right direction if it is safe for a newly pregnant woman to travel for a week as I have read that pregnant women are at the highest risk during the first trimester. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, Zika virus is affecting pregnancies and does have adverse effects on your baby if the mother gets exposed to it in her first trimester or either later in pregnancy. Unfortunately, no precautionary measures are available other than avoiding the exposure to it. I would suggest you to better avoid it in the first place rather than having remorse afterward. I hope it has helped you. If you require any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having loss of libido, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, and extreme fatigue. I am currently on Lipicard 200, and Esomeprazole. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your problem. Your weight in proportion to height is almost near the normal range. But in lipid profile, the cholesterol levels are high, and HDL levels are low (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Deranged lipid profile is one of the common reasons for reduced libido and sexual dysfunction. You should try to improve your physical activities and try to bring weight and lipids in a normal range. Exercise will help in improving the libido too. For weak erection and reduced libido drugs like PDE-5 (Phosphodiesterase) inhibitors like Tadalafil can be used. Low dose Tadalafil in 5 mg per day after dinner daily will help to make a strong erection. To improve erection at the time of sexual intercourse, you can take an extra 10 mg tablet on SOS basis about half to one hour before sex. Kindly consult your doctor for suggestions and take the treatment with consent. This will improve libido and will make erection hard. Avoid smoking, and alcohol use to stay healthy. Supplements containing L-arginine and Yohimbine have great roles in improving libido. Take Nano-Leo which consists of L-arginine that helps to reduce the fatigue."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can you please help me understand my test results?

The increased platelet count in your wife case seems to be due to reactive thrombocytosis. The iron deficiency anemia can lead to reactive thrombocytosis and so platelet count can be high. You need to treat her anemia with Ferrous Ascorbate tablet like medication for a month.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

I am taking Clopidogrel, Nitrates, Amlodipine, etc., with tiny sublingual Nitro, averaged 25 Nitro pills over three months. Occasional episodes of twinges occur, but then they remit. I feel there is a need for cardiac MRI to gain a current picture or status of my disease. I feel occasional chest tightness and dull pain but I also have acid reflux disease. What could it be?","Doctor":"Hello. You have stable ischemic heart disease for the last three years. You are taking medicines and want to know about the heart in detail for which you want cardiac MRI. You have 50 % blockage in the major coronary artery. As far as your heart condition is concerned, it only needs detailed echocardiography to know the function of left and right side of heart, structures of valves and other structures. MRI is only done in case when comprehensive echocardiography is unable to provide information which cardiologist wants to know. Stable ischemic heart disease is treated with lifestyle modifications and medicines. If signs or symptoms remain stable, these are continued without intervention such as angioplasty or bypass. When symptoms are out of control despite maximum medicines and lifestyle modifications, then revascularization is done. I hope your cardiologist got complete information about your heart from angiography and echocardiography. So there is no need of cardiac MRI. MRI is required when there is congenital heart disease, any infiltrative disease whose complete details are not evident on echocardiography. I am sorry I could not promote your views about having cardiac MRI, yet you may ask your cardiologist to tell you the benefits of cardiac MRI over echocardiography, and then you may ask about undergoing MRI in your case. Remember, in most patients, MRI does not provide any additional information that may aid in planning medicines and treatment plan beyond echocardiography and angiography. I would advise you to adhere to a healthy lifestyle, medications, and follow the advice of your cardiologist. Moreover, you may send your reports to me, so that I may guide you more accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a silent missed abortion last year in the third month of my pregnancy.

I am very frightened by them and I am terrified that I have COPD, as it seems to appear from the numbers. The doctor was very non-committal about it, gave me a Breo inhaler and said to come back in a month. FEV1 is only 71%. And can you explain a percentage predicted the result for the FEV1/FVC value? It seems to me that the report is stating that my percentage is only 58 %. Is this low value dangerous? I am terrified right now. Please see the enclosed report and give your impression.","Doctor":"Hello. Percentage predicted means how much is your observed value to the expected value. The computer predicts based on your height, age and gender and on equations how much your FEV1 (forced expiratory volume) and FVC (forced vital capacity) values should be if you are normal. Then in the test we calculate how much are your actual values. To say as normal in FEV1 and FVC we want your calculated value to be not less than 80 percent of your expected. That is 80 % predicted. Here your FEV1 is 71 % percentage predicted. As per values it suggests COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). But few observations, 1. This test is not very reliable as your graph picture shown on right hand side is not an acceptable one. So I personally would like to repeat it. 2. I do not see a bronchodilator reversibility test here, which is a must to see if it is asthma. 3. If you were a smoker and have symptoms I would suggest a repeat test with bronchodilator reversibility to get a definitive diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife was previously diagnosed with bipolar II and was taking 100 mg Lamotrigine daily for depression maintenance. She was on that dosage for nine years. She recently suffered a more chronic depressive episode and went out of town for ketamine infusion therapy. The infusions were very successful, and the psychiatrist who was assessing her for the infusions suggested that she did not need the Lamotrigine, that it was ineffective for treating depression in bipolar II. She tapered off the Lamotrigine, which was very difficult. It has been three to four weeks since her last dose of Lamotrigine, and nine weeks since her infusions. She is feeling very moody and depressed, irritability, fatigue, loss of focus. The question is, do you think she needs to go back on the Lamotrigine? Or does she need to get a booster shot of Ketamine? Both are difficult solutions. Getting off the Lamotrigine was awful, and getting Ketamine requires out of town travel, etc. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your problem. Ketamine infusion therapy has great roles in depression but regular maintenance treatment is needed and which results in a significant burden on patients. Lamotrigine is the right drug for resistant depression. Even in maintenance treatment, the drug has good roles. So, in my opinion, the drug should be started again from a low dose, and gradually the doses are build-up.

I am currently under Tamsukem Plus for 15 days and Alkaston B6 200 ml syrup. Can you help me?","Doctor":"Hello. As it has been prescribed in the USG, the kidney stone that has moved within the urinary pathways have caused the pain you experienced. Alkaston B6 (Magnesium Citrate, Potassium Citrate, Pyridoxine) will help dissolve the stones. Increase water intake. Take uva-ursi, cranberry, and fern tea or supplement to help dissolve the stones. Take Mefenamic acid or Ibuprofen for the pain. Keep following up with a urologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 20-year-old female. I have many hard skin patches majorly in exposed areas like hands and feet. They started around when I was 10 years old. I have consulted many doctors in the past, and all of them have different opinions like some would say it is an allergic reaction or it is a mosquito bite allergy and also deficiency of vitamin E. After any mosquito bites, it really urges to scratch, and I tend to scratch a lot and due to some reason I do also pluck my skin. Also, I have sensitive skin. I can also send you a photo of these patches. I am looking forward to your reply. Currently, I apply Mometasone furoate cream on the affected area.","Doctor":"Hello. It indeed looks like an insect bite hypersensitivity reaction, also known as papular urticaria (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The best way to manage this is protection from insect and mosquito bite. Use repellents, or liquid mosquito vaporizers, or full sleeve clothes and mosquito nets, etc. As this is not always possible, you need to take medications also. Continue using Mometasone furoate cream and take these tablets. Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestion and take the treatment with consent. 1. Tablet Dapsone 100 mg once a day. 2. Tablet Teczine M 10 mg (Levocetirizine, Montelukast) once at night. Get G6PD test (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) done before starting Dapsone once."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Three months ago I had chest pain with nausea and shortness of breath. Since the BP got controlled, the sob decresed. Though they increased the Nitropatch to 0.6 and started the beta blockers, I am having a fewer episodes. I had an angiogram last week. It showed no major arteries blocked. The cardiologist mentioned thickened heart muscles are due to high blood pressure. I would like to know how to get tested for the micro angina and is there a need to go to emergency when I have severe chest pain? Why am I getting chest pain with no major blockages? I have diabetes, copd, severe arthritis in my spine, and diabetic neuropathy in my feet that could also partially be nerve pain from my spine. I have had two knee replacements and at present have carpal tunnel in both hands but have not delt with that yet. Also with the thickened heart muscle, will that be the cause for acute chest pain?","Doctor":"Hello. Microvascular angina can be diagnosed on nuclear stress test with perfusion defects if any and also on angiography which shows slow flow in the absence of blockages in major arteries. So, if these tests are showing any abnormalities, then we have to consider the possibility of microvascular angina. Another modality is a treadmill test which can also show changes, but another test is not necessary as two tests are normal and you were not able to complete it. And microvascular angina usually causes pain on exertion rather than severe chest pain at rest. So we have to find other causes for it. If you had been evaluated or examined and had ECG etc., at the time of chest pain, then it also rules out other causes like vasospastic angina or accelerated hypertension as a cause of chest pain, which are relatively rarer causes. So, overall appears to be noncardiac pain. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

After that, it disappeared for two months, and started again, except this time it appears for a day, the next day it is gone, shows up every couple of days, and there was a very little of blood. None of this ever happened before, although my cycle was never exactly every 30 days, everything was fine.

You have severe physical or mental stress in any form, which would interfere with regular normal ovulation and periods will be haphazard. Try to reduce stress with meditation, breaks, etc. 2. If you have suddenly put on weight. This excess cholesterol will get converted into hormones and interfere with ovulation. So have a healthy lifestyle and diet. You can have cyclical birth control pills for five to six cycles. You have to take pills from day one of the periods for three weeks, then no pills for one week. After eight days start a new pack. Do not wait for next period. 3. You have not mentioned about your sexual activity. If sexually active, then infection could be a cause. If so, you and your partner need to meet a doctor and have a course of antibiotics. 4. If none of these a reason, have a pelvic scan to look for any local problem like polyp or fibroids inside the uterus. 5.

The doctor prescribed Clopitab 75 in the morning and Metoprolol 25 mg in night. I am having a fast heartbeat of 84 to 100. Can I take Hawthorn or Motherwort or Valerian? What should be the dosage and where will this be available in?","Doctor":"Hello. You have ischemic heart disease so your heart rate should be kept low as much as possible to prevent from further deterioration. For this purpose, you are taking Metoprolol 25 mg one time daily still your heart rate is high. Moreover, you are asking about some herbs or herbal products for heart disease. Regarding these herbs, there are no consistent results in clinical trials for heart conditions. Moreover, these products have not been studied widely as for as there beneficial effects on ischemic heart disease are concerned. Also, their side effects have not been assessed in the long term. So, in such case, these herbs cannot be recommended provided there are many evidence-based medicines available for reducing morbidity and mortality one of which is Metoprolol you are taking. There many trials of Metoprolol in ischemic heart disease and heart failure which shows beneficial effects. Regarding your heart rate, I recommend to increase the dose of Metoprolol. There are two forms of Metoprolol available in the market, short-acting Metoprolol Tartrate and long-acting Metoprolol Succinate. Hope you are taking long-acting Metoprolol Succinate because short-acting Tartrate form is to be taken two to three times per 24 hours to reduce heart rate and reap benefits. I advise you to take long-acting Succinate form 50 mg per 24 hours to reduce heart rate. Apart from these, adopt a healthy lifestyle, take a heart-healthy diet low in salt, low in trans fats, low in saturated fats, high in fiber, fruits, vegetables, poultry, low-fat dairy products, dry fruits, legumes, lentils, etc. Please send me your angioplasty and echo report and all medicines you are taking so that I may advise you proper medicine dosages and guide you further regarding your heart."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother’s blood test report shows low hemoglobin 10.9 and high platelet count 623000.

So while sex, my condom broke and I took an I-pill immediately and also in the next day morning. I want to know if the I-pill will work irrespective of having PCOS and what are the chances of getting pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. Since you have a longer than usual cycle as expected of PCOS, less likely that you are fertile on the day you had sex. It would be an even added protection that you took the I-pill. The I-pill will work whether you have PCOS or not. Comparing to a non-PCOS patient, you have lower chance of getting pregnant after taking the I-pill.

It is not always necessary to have withdrawl bleeding after taking Unwanted pill. Some women do not experience that. You should wait for your regular cycle date which might also get a little bit delayed due to intake of pill and if you missed your periods only then you have to do a pregnancy test.

You should maintain your oral health. As I have seen in pictures, there is stain deposition in your back teeth (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There are several reasons for stains, most common is smoking, fail to brush at night, not changing the brush for every two months, ignoring the brushing of back side teeth. Brush twice daily (especially night brushing), flossing, avoid smoking and gutkha paan. Make your teeth free from any deposition. Change brush every two months. If you follow these instructions, you do not need any scaling for several years. The most important thing is proper brushing technique. All surface of teeth should be involved, and prolonged brushing is not required."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, In my penis, veins are visible and it is painful.

There are always large veins on the upper aspect of the penis, and they transport blood back towards the heart. Since the penis is an erectile organ, the veins have to be large and zigzag (tortuous), so they can elongate when the penis becomes erect. Sometimes the pain may occur due to rough masturbation.

The next day, I started getting cramps on my lower right side stomach. Four days later, I got two transvaginal ultrasounds and nothing was found in the uterus, or anywhere else. So I was sent to the hospital again concerning an ectopic pregnancy or possible miscarriage. I got blood tests done, and they told me that my hCG levels went down. So, they ruled it out as a miscarriage or I was in the process of losing it. So on the next day, I went to my doctor, and she told me that she does not understand why they said to me that my levels went down as they went up from 23 to 100’s, so she said it could be an ectopic pregnancy. I got more blood test done, and I came to know that my hCG levels are going up but very slowly. I do not know what is going on. First, they said it was a miscarriage and now something else. I need answer. This is my first pregnancy.","Doctor":"Hello. Let me give you a few basic facts about beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). This hormone is produced from fetal tissue. Once it reaches a level of 25 mIU/mL, it is detectable in the urine test. A normal rate of rising of beta hCG is double in 48 hours. This doubling would mean a healthy pregnancy inside uterus. Rise less than double would mean either an abnormal or ectopic pregnancy. But your level has risen satisfactorily. Many times even a rise just below double also is normal. Only when the level reaches 1500 mIU/mL, then the fetus will be seen on the scan. So do not decide about the health of the baby until the scan sees the sac or fetal heartbeat. The blood test is not always right. Just wait for 10 to 14 days and have a scan. Hope for the best and pray well.

On TVS, I was told to have a thick endometrium of 20 mm. My doctor asked me to wait till next ultrasound. Also, I have been a PCOS patient and treated and delivered a healthy baby. I cannot feel any symptoms of pregnancy as I felt last time. What do you feel about my condition and advise, please? I am taking only Folic acid and asked to wait if period comes or not. Stopped Duphaston two days ago.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read a detailed description of your query. Beta hCG should increase around 66 % after every 48 hours in a normal healthy pregnancy. Have a strict check on your symptoms. Beta hCG if shows increase but less then 60 %, then ectopic should be excluded by having transvaginal scan and symptoms. In case of a suboptimal increase in beta hCG, actually happens in pregnancy outside the uterus. In your case, beta hCG is very less, not even above 500 and should be followed strictly. Symptoms could be abdominal pain, bleeding, etc. It is better to repeat beta hCG after 48 hours and have a detailed scan with expertise hands. Follow beta hCG scan, check in detail and report symptoms that you have to an emergency gynecologist. Ectopic. Beta hCG, a detailed transvaginal scan. Ectopic, early pregnancy. Have beta hCG and detailed expertise scan with a local examination.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

When I was on Femilon, I had discharge after the intercourse and I assume that the semen flows. Now, while I am not on Femilon anymore, I am still getting discharge after intercourse. Does this discharge mean that the semen is not getting inside and comes out entirely? If no, what could cause this discharge? If yes, would I be able to still conceive if the semen flows out of my body after the intercourse? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. The discharge after the intercourse is more likely to be cervical physiological discharge which is following sexual excitation and can come out as mucoid homogeneous non-smelly vaginal discharge. If the semen is coming out after ejaculation then it is advised that you should practice sex in missionary position and keep two pillows under your back during the act and after ejaculation cross your legs and lie down for 10 minutes. This shall avoid extrusion of sperm and shall increase your chances of conception."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother underwent gallbladder surgery 10 months ago. From past 3 months she started having chronic cough. She tried many home remedies. She did not recover completely. I took my mother recently for a health checkup. As I suspected the chest report was not absolutely fine. But, the doctor was not at all concerned about her cough and said everything is normal. Why is it so? I want to know what is the meaning of this x- ray report and what should be our next step? Presently she is under medication for thyroid as well as diabetes. I have attached her reports. Kindly have a look at them and suggest how to go about the treatment. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for choosing this platform. As you said your mother is having chronic cough 4 months after surgery. It can be just coincidental finding as her x-ray (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is showing prominent basal vascular markings and cough can be aggravated by surgery. The x-ray findings are suggestive of interstitial lung disease called lung fibrosis which can be confirmed only after HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography) scan of chest. So at the earliest, I advise you to do HRCT scan of chest to rule out IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). Once the diagnosis is made, treatment can be started accordingly. IPF or lung fibrosis is a chronic and progressive condition. So, diagnosis should be made as early as possible.Talk to your pulmonologist regarding further investigations and treatment. He will guide you better as frequent follow-up visits are required for monitoring the disease. Autoimmunity. HRCT chest to rule out IPF. Interstitial pneumonia.

Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. May I know your age, and since how many months are you experiencing thinning of hair? Please send the pictures of the scalp."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Kindly take a look at my results from various scans of my chest and advice.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen all your FDG-PET reports, which is very sensitive to detect any tumor activity in unidentified mass as the scan shows solitary pulmonary nodules in the left lateral lower lobe. This scan is beneficial to identify and detect tumor by detecting the oxygen utilization level as tumors have growing tissue, which takes more oxygen, so it shows increased activity of that area. Now I will tell you what is happening in your case. Generally, a solitary nodule is very common in the population as it has asymptomatic, multiple etiologies like infection, tuberculosis, simple benign tumor-like hemangiomas, inflammatory disease like sarcoidosis, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism, this all causes pulmonary nodules, out of which 90 % are asymptomatic or benign type. But in your case in the scan 1. Some metabolic activity is seen but not that significant as normal-malignant tissue shows,  2. The nodule has a well-defined shape, but with pleural extension. 3. There is no hilar lymphadenopathy, which is very common in lung malignancy. So it can be a healing granulation tissue, secondary to infection or immune reaction, but it is more unlikely to be a tumor. The last thing I wanted to ask you is, do you have any symptoms of breathlessness, weight loss, anorexia (eating disorder), or heavy smoking history, or hemoptysis (coughing up blood)? Kindly tell the history for better detection."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My result was 49.20, but the reference range was 0.91 for negative and anything over 1.09 as positive. Does my 49.20 mean the infection is a very recent one because it is so high? I am confused about why it is so very high. Should it go down over time? I have also heard that a high IgG could be related to HIV, as I was tested negative for it at day 105 after potential exposure (the last sexual encounter I had was three and a half months ago). Does an HSV IgG antibody test measure for antibodies that are only relevant to HSV, or should I be worried about HIV?","Doctor":"Hello. HSV (herpes simplex virus) IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies indicate previous exposure and HSV IgM (immunoglobulin M) indicates current disease. The positive IgG can become significant only if you have active lesions. The type one usually causes oral lesions which look like small blisters. The HIV testing recommended post exposure is the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or the fourth generation. Which testing did you get?

Scientific evidence about preventing it from causing further damage due to age also is not very sound. However, what is the cause of neural loss? Is it present in both ears or only one? Can you upload your audiometry to check? Was an MRI scan done to rule out neuroma of the eighth nerve? Ayurvedic medicines rely on improving the nerves so that their functioning stays sound. It will not help in overcoming the loss. It may, however, prevent further deterioration of hearing in that ear due to aging with time."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 42-year-old male.

I suppose you are worrying for absent yolk sac. I would suggest to repeat a scan after a week or so and also repeat beta hCG after 48 hours of the previous test date and check if it is almost doubling or not. If it is nearly doubling that would mean that your pregnancy is viable. And soon yolk sac will appear, but if the level is falling, then it would mean that abortion might be there.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I got periods on the next month for four days, and after five days of my periods I got a Nexplanon birth control, and the doctor gave me a negative pregnancy test. I then had a period of 14 days in the next month and I am still spotting. I am just wondering if there is any way for me to be pregnant? I have not had sex since then. But I am paranoid that I am pregnant I cannot afford an abortion. Also, I cannot even afford to go to the doctor or have a way to buy a pregnancy test. For the past couple of days, I have felt movement, but it could be gas. I have also been having sharp pains in my lower abdomen for a while especially when sneezing or coughing hard. I always had very painful and heavy periods associated with sharp pains while pooping on period. The birth control has helped by stopping my period, but I still get the sharp pains randomly. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello.  No, you are not pregnant as your pregnancy test was negative at the time you got Nexplanon implant, and you did not have had sex afterward. So calm down now and give relief to yourself. Your periods have reduced due to the effect of Nexplanon as it is a contraceptive as well as it also reduces blood loss during periods and some women get reduced bleeding or absent bleeding in the very start of the implantation. Your periods will slowly return to normal. So do not have to worry about pregnancy now. And secondly all of the symptoms you told are pointing towards anxiety, and you need some stress reliever. The problem with passing stools may be due to the lack of fiber in your diet. You must drink plenty of water and increase the intake of fiber by eating more vegetables, and less junk food will help improve your bowels, and hopefully, this issue will be resolved soon.

I visited a general physician who suspected GERD and put me on Motilium for GIT and later Pan 40 then Ranitidine for three months. I vomited only once but had been having a burning sensation in my chest. The burning chest has long stopped. I even had an OGD done which was normal. The pain, however, moved to my throat, and I had a feeling of something in my throat ever since though I have no swallowing problems. I have this persistent pricking pain in my throat that does not go away, and also the back of my tongue on the right side feels kind of inflamed (not sure about this. But the tongue feels sore-ish). Throat pain and tongue discomfort are always present. My general physician later recommended to do a neck MRI which I did and was told looked fine. So I am stuck on what exactly could be wrong with me. I do exercise (treadmill and gym) regularly, I am an active person though I must admit I worry too much about my health and it stresses me.","Doctor":"Hello.

Are these interrelated? I am suffering from PCOS, as the latest lower abdomen test shows a cyst in the lower ovary. Also, my menstrual cycles are getting reduced to one to two days with severe pain and indigestion during periods. For the past one month, I have started taking Shatavari gulam. Sometimes I also observe the cracking of bones in my legs. Please suggest me the treatment plan.","Doctor":"Hello. I came to know from your complaints that you have PCOS with hair fall, indigestion, and reduced menstrual flow. Yes, your doubt is right, it is all related. As per Ayurveda PCOS is caused by eating excessive sweet, fatty foods which increase kapha (mucus) in the body. When kapha increases, it reduces the digestive power and patient complaints of indigestion. That is your main problem that I understand. Due to improper diet and physical activities, vata (pacifying foods) also get aggravated in PCOS. Hence the digestion is not proper, and the rasa dhatu is not formed properly affects the menstrual blood (rakta dhatu) and that cause more kapha and medas, and this is why some PCOS patients will gain more weight. The undigested food is called ama. This ama will produce hormonal imbalance that causes changes in menstrual flow. Some patients will complaint heavy flow once in three months, or some complaints less flow that lasts for one or two days. The energy responsible for transformation is called as pitta. In PCOS, pitta is also getting vitiated and patient complaints of hair loss, pimples, painful menstruation sometimes with clots. The movement of follicles from ovum to fallopian tubules is controlled by vata. When vata is impaired producing scanty menstruation with pain, the cracking of bones in legs happens due to aggravated vata. Hence treatment will include all steps to reduce vitiated vata, pitta, and kapha. Treatment plan. Kindly consult your doctor, discuss the suggestion and take the treatment with consent. 1. The first step is to improve digestion through Ashta choornam or Vaishwanara choornam or Hinguvacadi choornam or Amruthotharam kashayam. 2. Next step is to pacify the increased vata through intake of Narayana thailam one teaspoon in kashayam which I am going to explain in the third step or simply oil in hot water. 3. Pacify pitta and kapha through Varanadi kashayam, Kulathadi kashayam, and Kumaryasavam. 4. Raja pravartini vati is also effective. 5. Regular intake of sesame seeds (black) with jaggery is also a natural remedy for menstrual problems. 6. Garlic roasted in ghee is very effective for painful menstruation. Garlic should be taken three weeks before to menstruation. 7. Avoid junk, spicy, oily and fast food. Try to reduce the intake of pickles which produce water retention and cause pain during menstruation. 8. Proper sleep and stress reduction are also important. I saw in your report that you have a cyst in the left ovary (26*26 mm) which is not dangerous and it is a simple cyst that can be managed with medication (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I think my reply will help you. If you have any doubts or complaints, please contact me. For better results, please follow the medications for one month and contact me later."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 11 months and 25 days old. He has some gas problem for last one week.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I have chronic fatigue being on healthy diet. I am not on any medication. There is also low libido. In the blood test report, the levels of UIBC, DHEA, estradiol, vitamin D, progesterone, phosphorus, and platelets were low from the normal level and high B12 level. In the past, my blood test has shown low RBC. Can you tell me what is going on?","Doctor":"Hello. Your chronic fatigue can be explained by low levels of vitamin D, low phosphorus, and low DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone). I will explain why do you have these low levels. There are many causes of vitamin D deficiency, but most common is inadequate exposure to sunlight which I think is the cause in you. Other causes of vitamin D deficiency are malabsorption of vitamin D, kidney disease (not in your case). Vitamin D is essential in the absorption of phosphorus in the intestines. So, a low vitamin D will eventually lead to low phosphorus. And both low vitamin D and low phosphorus can cause chronic fatigue. Remedies are, increase your exposure to sunlight. There is no need for vitamin supplementation at present. Your LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol is on the higher side. I advise you to take tablet Rosuvastatin 5 mg at night after dinner for one year and repeat lipid profile after one year. Also, go on a low-fat diet. Now coming to your low DHEA and low estradiol levels, DHEA levels usually decreases with increasing age so that it could be an age-related issue in your case. It can also be reduced in conditions like adrenal insufficiency, diabetes, kidney disease, but there is nothing in your reports to suggest these diseases. Low DHEA can explain for low libido and chronic fatigue, but low libido can also be due to depression and even abnormalities in prolactin levels (which has been not tested in you). Also, get one serum prolactin level tested. My advice is to increase your physical activity and decrease your calorie intake, this will help in increasing DHEA levels. There is no need for taking DHEA supplements. Low estradiol is also due to low DHEA, but that is not significant. Increased vitamin B12 levels are usually seen in liver diseases or myeloproliferative disease (diseases of the bone marrow ), but one more common cause is if you were on multivitamin tablets it might have caused increased levels. But if you were not on multivitamins, then I advise you get one bone marrow biopsy done for the evaluation or detection of myeloproliferative diseases because even low platelets are seen in these diseases. Kindly revert for any further queries or clarification."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 31-year-old woman. My menstrual cycle usually lasts between 27 to 30 days. I usually ovulate on day 12 of my cycle. I usually track ovulation so I know I do ovulate. I recently took a blood test that shows my MCV is 77 and my MCH is 25 both below normal range. My HbA1c was 5.90 and my ALP levels were mildly elevated as well, at 134 (report said it had to be between 42 to 128). My TSH was fine and well within range. My problem is that my follicular phase seems fine but my luteal phase keeps changing. It lasts anywhere between 14 to 18 days. I wonder, is that normal? Do I need to test myself for PCOS? I never had acne problems. I have gained weight, but that is been over five years. I have never missed a period yet.","Doctor":"Hello. It is really good to know that you are very knowledgeable about your cycle routine. Let me add a few things further into it. The first thing is that the luteal phase is always fixed (14 days) while the follicular phase varies in women's cycle due to hormonal changes in the first half of the cycle. If you want to calculate your ovulation day, then we usually deduct 14 days from the total cycle length. So in your case, your ovulation day is around 14 to 16 depending on if your length is varying between 28 to 30 days in my view. Ovulation on the 12th day is possible in those women who have a cycle length of 26 days. I hope it might have cleared how to calculate ovulation day. Secondly, all your tests are normal, and you have nothing to worry for PCOS as you do not have that because the cycle length of 26 to 35 days is being considered normal for any woman and you are falling in this criteria. I hope this information has helped you. If you require any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 17 years old.

Have you have had any fever, rashes or joint pains in the last two weeks? Based on your symptoms, it is most likely that you either have a urine infection or some infection of the genitalia. The urine test reports also suggest the same. It would be necessary to have a complete physical examination to find out what is the exact infection and treat it with medication which should be able to get you back to normal. You may require a urine culture test or urethral swab test to pinpoint what the infection is. I would suggest you to visit your local urologist at the earliest to get the tests. I hope this helps, feel free to revert with any other questions or concerns."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am on a holiday. I wish to delay my period. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Please mention your last menstrual period date. Ideally, menses can be delayed safely and effectively by starting progesterone only pills from day 21 of your cycle daily till as long as you wish to delay your menses but advisably not more than 15 days. Once the pills are stopped, one usually get her withdrawal bleed in the next three to five days. If started later, on just a few days before the expected date of menses, then there are high chances that complete cessation of bleeding may not occur and you may experience irregular spotting in between the course of medications. Hence it is important to learn about your last menstrual date. You can use tablet Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg one tablet twice a day from day 21 daily for the next 10 to 15 days to delay your menses. The most common side effect faced are progesterone side effects like headache, constipation and often bloating sensation, but it can be controlled by increasing daily water intake up to three to four liters a day."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had an unprotected sex and noticed two issues on the shaft of my penis. The first thing I noticed was a dry, flaky area about the size of a dime. I have applied mosturizer to it thinking it was just dry skin, but it has not gone away over the past two weeks and that spot is still noticably lighter than the rest of the skin. I have also noticed a single, small white bump near the head of my penis. It is raised but only slightly. The white bump does not itch and is painless. Both I have noticed after unprotected sex about a month ago and did not change much. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. If it is not sexually transmitted disease then it can be acne, Fordyce spots which develop when skin's pores are clogged with natural oil, called sebum, sweat, and dead skin, it can also cause infection. Pearly penile papules (PPP) is small, fleshy bumps that usually develop in gland penis in rows around the head of the penis. A skin tag is normal, and it happens as age advances. If it is lichen planus, it can lead to infection and needs medical management. If you have PPP, then it is normal, and there is no need for treatment. Regarding the white growth, if it is not painful, it can be syphilis. Swelling in the shaft, if not painful then think of syphilis.

After two months I started to develop red burning rashes on my breast. The rash first appeared as a single ringworm like red rashes on my breast and no improvement for two days now and rashes have increased at the sides of my two breasts. What could cause this? And are these two occurrences related? I applied a triple effect cream (Bmn plus cream) on it, that is when it started to produce blisters. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. Milk secretion in nonpregnant women is galactorrhea that can occur due to causes like increased prolactin levels in the body, prolactinomas, continuous usage of antacid like drugs, etc. Rubbing of clothes to the nipple can also lead to discharge. Tight innerwear, allergy to fabric material lead to skin rashes, etc. can aso be the cause for the discharge. So, you, please consult your gynecologist once, get examined and go for serum prolactin levels and if needed sonomammography. With this work up the possible cause of your problem can be identified and treated. I hope I have answered your query. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I believe I have dissociative amnesia. I am unable to recall memories until the age of 13. Every now and then I remember a spotty memory but it is never concrete and when I do remember something, in my mind it seems like a dream instead of a clear memory. What could I do with this?","Doctor":"Hello. Memory is the most surprising thing. You remember some events so vividly while others wash out as if they never happened. The retention of things depends on our concentration and attention at that particular time, and the wish to remember it. We all forget most of our childhood memories only a few remain fresh in our conscious. Again individual variations present, but one thing I can tell you this forgetfulness is unlikely to be dissociative amnesia. Dissociative amnesia is usually followed by a stressful, traumatic event in which our mind subconsciously want to avoid. In the absence of stressor, it often does not occur. So if you have some really bad childhood memories, you may have dissociative amnesia. A detailed assessment of yours would be required for dealing with it and appropriate treatment requires some therapy sessions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a question about hearing. Firstly, I am aware that hearing loss takes place when the tiny hair cells within the inner ear are damaged. My question is, once a particular hair has been damaged, will the same sound level that previously damaged it, hurt it again? For example, if you listened to a sound at 90 dB for nine hours and your hearing was damaged, would doing the same thing another day further damage your hearing? Or would it not change anything, as your ears would not be registering the same level of sound as the previous time?","Doctor":"Hello. There is something called a temporary threshold shift and permanent hearing loss. Temporary loss is the loss which if a sudden burst of sound and you get hearing loss as hair cells are fatigued however hearing regains soon in some time. If it is a permanent loss that too at a severe level for all frequencies chances are the person will not notice the same loudness of the sound afterward however there are some pathologies where the sound amplifies itself, and it is called recruitment. So in that condition, the person may not even respond to a loud sound of 80 dB however they might complain abnormal loudness at 90 and feel the same discomfort as a person with normal hearing has. It all depends on the pathology and condition of the hearing loss."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am having a tough time with my skin infection.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out.

I have lost sharp clarity, and I had an OCT which showed thinning of ganglion cells in my maculas. Other clinical results looked normal.

Kindly give me your opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing these symptoms, but hopefully, we can get them resolved or attended to. Unfortunately, I cannot assess the OCT because you only attached the doctor's conclusion (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and not the scan itself, please upload it as soon as possible. What you are experiencing might be the common side effects of Zoloft (Sertraline) it can cause widened pupils and blurriness of vision. I would advise you to approach the doctor that prescribed it for an alternative. I would also recommend you start using lubricating eye drops to compensate for the acquired dryness of the eyes. Use any over the counter (OTC) artificial tears four times daily in both eyes during the day and not before going to sleep. Hopefully, that will reduce the blurriness. As for macular degeneration and the changes in the ganglion layers, you need not worry at the meantime because of many reasons like you are young, no significant changes on the OCT (optical coherence tomography) were detected. There are other reasons for the blurriness that need to be excluded. However, and to eliminate your suspicion, a yearly OCT is recommended to compare the changes and see if the process is stable."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, For controlling my hypertension, I was prescribed Benicar 40/12.5 mg once in the morning, Amlodipine 5 mg twice a day and Clonidine once in the evening. These were prescribed after ECG and blood work. Even, after taking the medication, my BP is usually 160/85 mmHg.

Three months before, I consulted an ENT doctor because of an unilateral (right) tonsil enlargement. I am attaching a photo of what it looked like at that moment. Upon clinical examination, my doctor was not worried and suggested to monitor the volume of the tonsil in the upcoming year. I had underwent adenoidectomy during childhood. In the last few months, I have noticed that the same tonsil has gained in volume and now appears round, red and more swollen than before. It is not painful when I swallow, but I have the sensation that something is stuck in my throat (most probably a collateral effect of edema). I am attaching another photo of what it looks like today. I do not feel any lumps in my neck. I have an appointment to see my ENT again, but it is only in one month from now. Being a big fan of catching things early I am a bit worried about waiting another month. Could you please give me your opinion?","Doctor":"Hello. The two tonsils are unevenly enlarged. Whereas it is usually not any abnormal growth, we can say conclusively only after biopsy. I suggest you discuss with the doctor about the option of tonsillectomy and histopathological examination of the sample. Meanwhile you should get some Benzydamine gargles and check if the symptoms resolve."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had sex with my partner before two days and that was my ovulation day.

I can confirm that the power given cannot be reversed by eating carrots and vitamins. This type of power is called a cylindrical power, and if he does not wear the glasses, he can develop weakness of his optic nerve in the long run, along with short term effects like blurred vision and headache. A drug called Low-dose Atropine in a way can be used to control eye power in children and halt progression but it is only tested in minus powers and not in plus powers.

Anafranil (Clomipramine) is a type of older antidepressants, and it has some undesirable side effects like constipation dryness of mouth, at times effect on the heart. Because of the side effect for file usually, doctors refrain from going for higher doses. But if you are not facing any adverse impact, then we can increase the dose of drug top to 150 to 200 mg.

My left eye is 225, and the right eye is 675. I am planning to get a pair of contact lenses, but the special lenses are a bit pricey. Will it damage my eyesight if I am going to choose regular contact lenses?","Doctor":"Hello. In general, contact lenses are only meant for occasional use and cannot be used every day. In case you meant the special lenses have higher oxygen permeability and help your cornea stay healthy, please go ahead with those. The best option to remain permanently free from glasses is refractive surgery. If your power has been stable for around a year, I will recommend that you see your ophthalmologist for SMILE (small incision lenticule extraction) or PRK (photorefractive keratectomy) than using contact lenses for a long term.

On daily basis, it is suggested that one should try tooth brushing with paste recommended by the American dental association (ADA) and Indian dental association (IDA). While buying a paste, you should look for whether it is ADA or IDA approved. Second is choose the paste containing ingredients like fluoride, sorbitol, glycerol, sodium lauryl sulfate, calcium carbonate, and saccharin. You can use them daily particularly before sleeping. However, if you have sensitivity in teeth and issue with cold things like ice cream, then you can try pastes containing high fluoride which strengthens teeth and prevents sensitivity and also prevents further progress of cavities. You should try usual toothpaste but after three months try this fluoride-rich paste for one month so that you will not develop future caries. Mouthwashes contains mostly Chlorohexidine, but it is not recommended for daily use. It is used in the case when there are gum inflammation and bad breath. Moreover, it is not recommended for more than 15 days as these cause staining of teeth sometimes. If you have gum infection or bad breathe, you can try it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 20 years old and I have myopia (-3,50 ).

What else can I do to stop this progress?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concerns. I want to assure you that such myopic progression is quite common at a young age such as in your case. This is mainly because of the exponential growth and development of all the parts of your body at this stage of life. I can confirm that this has nothing to do with the diet you eat. Over a period of time, this growth will cease, and your eye power will stabilize. One suggestion to reduce progression is to avoid excessive near work like reading books, using smartphones, fine near work like jewelry or watchmaking, etc. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a bump on my arm. I thought it was a burn so I broke it and it became more prominent. It was there for almost two months. So I went to a skin doctor, and they said it is a wart from a germ. They gave me three options. Either apply a cream, liquid nitrogen, and laser (C02fl). I chose the third option because they said it is more effective. After I did it, there was a scab remained which looked like a burn. It has been four days now. I have been asked to apply Bactrocin twice a day for two weeks and Derma V10 rescue oil after that. From the third day, I am seeing like something spreading from the corners of the scab which looks like blood inside and it is red. Is this normal? Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Last week, when I turned my head to the right, I started to blackout. I have been doing neck stretches, pinched nerve exercises, etc. Ever since with no improvement to the condition, this may be due to golf, or light weight lifting related, but I am not sure as I did not do anything abnormal and there was no pop or any pain afterward. One key piece of information may be that if someone else turns my neck to the right for me, there are no symptoms. It only occurs when I do it. I was hoping this piece of information narrows it down. It has been one week and a half with this issue. I try to avoid turning my head to the right. I can go 45 degrees without symptoms, but when I approach 90 degrees, the symptoms start. There is no pain and numbness.","Doctor":"Hello. Do you mean blackout as the sudden loss of consciousness? May I know what is the extent of the episode? If you feel blackout when looking up or turning your head, this may be due to pinching of the arteries that are present alongside the spine, called vertebral arteries. This can sometimes happen as a result of changes in the vertebrae. Pinching of these vertebral arteries can occasionally cause blackouts as the blood flow is temporarily reduced. One condition called cervical rib, here extra rib in the neck area may compress the artery. Some time any lesion in brain clot or ischemia may cause transient ischemic attack (TIA). Better go through investigations such as CT brain, x-ray cervical spine AP or lateral view, FBS (fasting blood sugar), PPBS (postprandial blood sugar test), lipid profile and CBC (complete blood count)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have some rashes on and behind my ear.

A lot of allergens was detected (wheat, melons, peach, cucumber, potato, parsley, carrot, etc). I did avoid those foods. After seven years, I wanted to test it again, and unfortunately, the test showed the same results, more allergies (coconut, plum, chestnut, buckwheat - things I eat regularly.)

Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It is more focused behind and around the knee, in my upper calf, and in the arch of my foot. It is not discolored or swollen or warm or colder than the other side. It is just uncomfortable. I have been pretty stationery due to an infection, but I do get up quite often to use the bathroom, and I often stretch. This pain started before four days. It has not gotten worse but at the same time has not reached better. Does it sound like a pinched nerve maybe or DVT? Should I go to the ER or make an appointment to see my primary care doctor?

Leg pain behind the knees which is localized, non radiating in nature with no swelling, no history of prolonged bed rest and no fracture of a limb. Hence, this is not deep vein thromboembolism. DVT occurs when there is a prolonged history of immobilization with sudden onset of swelling. This also does not look like cellulitis where is a superficial subcutaneous infection, which is most common cause of swelling and pain.

For years, I have experimented with different pressures, methods, stuffs and followed the advice of hundreds of articles, but nothing worked. I always make sure that I have enough time and relaxation. I have tried so many methods involving fingers, my partner and more, but still, nothing worked unless I use a vibrator. I even went months without using it to see if I would desensitize, but nothing changed. Just wondering if anyone else has the same problem. What I can do about it?","Doctor":"Hello. Female masturbation is a complicated one. Yes, I have few patients who were not satisfied with many methods. Male masturbation works only more physical, and few mental work but female masturbation works with more psychological and few physical tasks. Method, if anything needs to be changed. 1. Fingers are used gently and rhythmically over the clitoris, apply study pressure with one finger and can increase two to three finger according to demands. Do not double the pressure of your finger unless you need. Rhythm in moments of the finger should be maintained. Do not be eager to give climax early, female will take them as they like or enjoy. 50 % of the female will reach orgasm or peak within three minutes and, few may take four to five minutes, it also depends on how the vagina and other parts of the female body are manipulated. 2. Vaginal massage as massaging the clitoris with one finger, other finger or fingers moved between the labia. Sometimes labia strokes alone will give results as it is attached to the clitoris. Speed of the stroking depends on personal likes. Initially, it starts with mild strokes and increase the speed according to the needs. 3. Females do not reach climax by inserting fingers or vibrators inside the vagina, since walls of the vagina are practically without nerves, although few sensory nerves close to the entrance of the vagina. Inserting big objects inside the vagina will have no use, since no erotic nerve supply inside the vagina. Deep vaginal penetration in men is fantasy, and it is not a sexual need for women. Only occasional vaginal insertion that to just for a few females will cause an erotic feeling. Keep exploring as much as you can. I hope I have answered your query.

If you had sex with a known person, maybe you would have caught simple infection and that can be treated. If it is due to condom allergy, balanitis inflammation due to painful sex, simple antibiotics and anti-inflammatory will help you. Another condition is pearly penile papules where there is no need to worry about infection.

The next day I masturbated to see if I still have it and this time blood was mixed in the semen. Although, it does not hurt and when I urinate it does not burn.

This happened to me before two years ago but it subsided.","Doctor":"Hello. Blood in semen with no other symptoms is very likely idiopathic or no pathology. After a period of abstinence sometimes aggressive frequent sexual activity leads to hematospermia. Majority of times it is self-limiting. Unprotected sexual intercourse will not give rise to this (rather it causes urethritis). Seminal vesicle can occasionally be infected from the blood.

On consulting another doctor, she suggested to go with PRP injection to rejuvenate the ovary, so that egg count and quality will increase. I am afraid if PRP will cause any harm to the ovary? Are there any issues to try PRP?","Doctor":"Hello. You have been wrongly guided by your doctor because there is no apparent need for PRP (platelet rich plasma) therapy and injection into ovaries to rejuvenate the ovaries to produce better quality eggs. The therapy modality is relatively new and not sufficient studies have been done yet on them. It is being done for women with really low antral follicular count and AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) less than one and failed two natural timed intercourse and six IUI (intrauterine insemination) and one IVF (in vitro fertilization) cycles. You were directly subjected to IVF cycle, which was wrong without treating the pathology. AMH can be increased with DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone) therapy which is oral supplementation along with low dose OC pill (oral contraceptive) therapy for two months. That improves the quality and also the chances of natural conception. Also, another concern is a bicornuate uterus, which has their own demerits for natural conception so that IUI can be offered for conception at least for six cycles, post-therapy. If succeeded, then the bicornuate uterus is unable to sustain the pregnancy for the complete term, and often preterm labor occurs giving birth to a preterm baby. So weigh this complication as well in your mind. You can either opt for Strassman's operation first to increase the size of the uterus by joining them together and then try after a year or take the risk of IUI or IVF and accept complications associated with bicornuate uterus itself. You have to think and make a decision. PRP is the last line of therapy, not primary, in my opinion."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to ask is it possible for me to transmit HIV through hand cut, (I have attached a picture) because I had anxiety when shaking hands.

He did a urine analysis, and some blood work and everything came back fine. There were no problems until three days ago. I peed then a few minutes later it felt like it still had to go so I went back to the toilet but I just got only blood. There was a lot this time, and it was fresh blood and small clots. It is hurting while passing the blood but that is all that came out though I had just emptied my bladder a few minutes before that. The only other symptom I seem to be having is all of a sudden there will be an immediate need to pee out of the blue but then when I go it is not a full bladder of pee just like half but it the onset was very sudden, or I am going to pee my pants. These are my only symptoms. I do have a long history of stones, but I am confident this is not due to that, because I have had blood from stones but not this amount of blood. And every time I have ever had a stone, it hurts worse than childbearing, and I am not in that kind of pain. I feel whatever is going on is the same thing I went to the doctor last year, but he found nothing. What is likely to be wrong with me? I am currently on Coumadin, Lanoxin, Coreg, and Propylthiouracil. Laboratory tests performed are urinalysis, hemoglobin a1c, CBC (complete blood count), fasting lipid panel, and fasting glucose.","Doctor":"Hello. A bladder infection (cystitis), stones and overdose of Coumadin (Warfarin), all three can be the likely reason for your bleeding. In case of any such bleeding, an ultrasound is a must. I prefer to start with a short course of antibiotics (mostly Nitrofurantoin and Cipro or Levofloxacin are given) for five days depending on sensitivity patterns. Blood clotting parameters need to be checked to see if you are on the overdose of Coumadin. Ultrasound is a must to rule out any other serious causes of bleeding like a tumor. Since antibiotics are not available over-the-counter in your place, you need to get back to your general physician. Moreover, even for getting an ultrasound and clotting parameters to check the overdose of Coumadin, you need the help of your general physician. Please do at the earliest."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been taking Zoloft 25 mg and Ativan 5 mg one or two tablets to one tablet prn which I rarely take for anxiety. I take Tapazol 2.5 mg for hyperthyroid, TUMS two or three a day, Pepcid AC, vitamin D, B12, and Ventolin inhaler. I have been taking Zoloft and Ativan for 24 years. Four Psychiatrists and three medical doctors approved Ativan when I was diagnosed with anxiety. I worked for a psychiatrist for years, and he said I was merely cyclothymic if anything and stress. What is bipolar affective?","Doctor":"Hello. Tell me one thing, since how long you have these thyroid nodules? Because some times symptoms of anxiety and restlessness might be due to hyperthyroid state. Is there any family history of any such kind of illness? Is there any change in functioning, sleep or appetite habit? In cyclothymia, there is an alternative period of depression and mania, but none of them is in full symptomatology, which means your functioning is not affected, but you can have distinctive period of euphoria and depression. Take a healthy diet, avoid junk foods, have proper sleep, do moderate exercise, follow relaxation technique, yoga and meditation may help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I think I got balanitis. Which cream should I buy? I had sex five weeks ago without protection. Painful peeing lasts for two years but not as strong as this time. Sores came out after having unprotected sex.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, you need to get blood tests for sexually transmitted diseases like VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory), HIV and HSV (herpes simplex virus), as the act may cause herpes simplex or syphilis. I would start with a combination of antibiotics like Doxycycline and antiviral pills like Valacyclovir. However, in your place, you need to get in touch with your general physician to undergo the necessary tests. Ointments alone will not be sufficient for treatment. A combination of Acyclovir ointment and Fucidin H cream (Hydrocortisone and Fusidic acid) as a thin layer may be applied for three days. Meanwhile, get in touch with your general physician. Avoid sexual activity until the ulcer is treated. Syphilis and HIV test to be repeated after three months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How can I take care of toothbrush health? How often to change toothbrush heads or disposable toothbrushes and the negative effects of not changing them often?","Doctor":"Hi. Dentists recommend a change of toothbrush every six months. But this toothbrush health depends on patient's brushing habits too. Like if a person does not follow proper brushing techniques and brush his teeth vigorously, or maybe he is suffering from any gum disease and he is brushing more often then he must change his toothbrush more often like at every 2 or 3 months. Usually, by six months the bristles of toothbrush start weakening, are not performing their function well, some bacterial flora may start growing at bottom of bristles or at back side of toothbrush head where tongue cleaner is given. If such yellow or brown stains start appearing at some surfaces of toothbrush then toothbrush needs to be changed immediately. At toothbrush replacement, Miswak is the best recommendation. It is like a small bamboo stick and you can easily cut off its bristles after brushing every 2 or 3 days later and it leaches out antibacterial ingredients and has many good affects for your health too. Like it is a cure for all gum diseases."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. Fimbrial blockage of fallopian tube mostly occurs due to ovarian cysts because of multiple large-sized ovarian cyst plugs in the fimbrial opening of the fallopian tube.

I had my pants and my panty on and he had his penis out. He ejaculated on my pant, and I saw that some portion of my panty was wet as well. And I felt wet in the skin of the lower portion of abdomen, where the vagina does not actually start, where it is only the human skin. I was very scared of it and I took a pill within one hour. And, two weeks later, I had the dark brown fluid, which ended in three days but it is not a very heavy flow and sometimes the thin tissue-like red stuff came out while peeing (like what happens during periods). So I guess I am alright? And there is no chance of pregnancy right?","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? I do not see any reason for you to worry. Let me start by giving few basic facts about the period. Usually, ovulation occurs on the 12th to the 16th day of periods and life of the egg is 24 hours. The life of the sperm is 72 hours. So there is no chance of the egg being available on day-5 of periods. The sperm will not survive until next ovulation. Just then, your period would have stopped, so even the inner lining of the uterus would have been so thin and unfavorable for a possible pregnancy. So, the pill was not needed, but what you did was absolutely right as had it been a week later you had a chance of pregnancy. The pill was taken at the right time. This pill is progesterone hormone in high dose. This suddenly increases the inner lining of the uterus and makes it unfavorable for a possible pregnancy. But being a single dose of the pill, the thickness will not stand, so it will break down and you will get periods within seven to 10 days. As there was already no inner lining, the bleeding you noticed was very less. Usually, the bleeding will be thick, dark with fleshy streaks, and slightly painful. There is absolutely no chance of pregnancy. The next period will be one month after this bleeding. So just relax, everything is fine.

If you have further doubts, I would be happy to help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My vagina has cysts and a cut on the inside. I have PCOS and the cysts never hurt until now. I also never have a regular period. And I want to know how I can increase my chance of getting pregnant.","Doctor":"Hello. If you are planning to get pregnant at this time, you would need assistance from Ob-Gyn. She can give you pills like Progesterone to regulate your menses and have you bleed regularly. By doing this, timing interval when to appropriately have an intercourse would lead to better chance of conception. Once she has established your bleeding pattern, for a month or two, she can give you fertility pills. This are Clomiphene pils which will stimulate your ovaries to actually produce an egg or help you ovulate. Because you have to understand that PCOS patients have difficulty getting pregnant because they do not have regular periods and they do not ovulate."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would like to know, can cortisone help if taken before transferring an embryo? And if it can help so, in which way?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, cortisone can increase the chance of getting pregnant. It decreases ACTH production (adrenocorticotropic hormone) and increases pituitary gonadotropin release, thereby increasing the chance of pregnancy. If you have a doubt then get back to me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having hot and cold sensations in lower extremities for about a month. Chronic back pain for many years but more recently tingling in legs. I had MRI done today and saw this spot within one of the vertebral bodies that looks to be a calcific and circular lesion.","Doctor":"Hello. There are two to three hyperintense (white) areas in the L1, L3, and L4 vertebrae. There are likely hemangiomas and are benign findings and not causing your problem. This is not a calcified area and is a common finding in many individuals. This is not of concern. The real issues are due to the degenerative disc changes at L1-L2 to L5-S1 disc levels. The discs are hypointense (black), and there are disc desiccation and mild posterior disc bulge. You can observe that there is neural foramina compromise in L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 disc levels. There is pressure on the nerves, and that is the reason for your abnormal hot and cold sensations and the chronic low backache. There are mild osteophytes in the lumbar vertebrae and mild endplate degenerative changes in the opposing end plates at the level of L5-L1 disc level. There are changes in the bone due to lumbar spondylosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had inflammation inside the nose and ear clogged. I had water in the ear, and it went away, but I still feel some balance issue. I am currently under nasal steroid spray.","Doctor":"Hello. I need some details to understand the problem.

Start Tobrex (Tobramycin) eye drops, one drop four times a day after cleaning her eyes. Please wash your hands after touching and cleaning her eyes, use a separate towel for her to minimize the risk of infection spread to other members of the family. It is contagious (spreads from one person to others). So treat her with antibiotic drops and protect the rest of the family. It will start improving in a couple of days.

I had mango juice, and I did not break out at all, but last year I had an allergic reaction that was from mangoes or peal, that were hives and swelling. Before I turned 18, I was eating mangoes, but after I turned 18, I broke into an allergic reaction that consist of hives and swelling and my chest was tight.","Doctor":"Hello. You need to identify which part of the mango are you allergic to and avoid it. Is it the juice or for the peal? Also, any particular variety of mango needs to be identified like banganapalli, alphonso, etc. If recurring with all the variety of mangoes then try to avoid all mango varieties. Keep antihistamines tablet ready if you get an attack of the hive while having mangoes again. Also, the age-dependent development of allergy is difficult to explain. It might be you have become symptomatic after the period."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had severe itching on the part of my scalp with some blackish color on the area during last month. I applied Eberclin M cream to get relief of the itching, although the cream was not supposed to be applied on the scalp. But after applying just for two days, all the hairs surrounding the area where I used the cream have gone. Surprisingly, the hairs of the main itching area where I applied the cream was not that affected. I consulted a local physician, and he told me that it might be due to the strong tendency of the cream which burnt the area or it might also be due to alopecia areata. He prescribed me a daily shampoo, R89 drops, B and T Zauberol Premium hair oil. For the past week, I am going with these medicines. However yesterday I noticed that one or two hairs here and there are regrowing in the area, but not all the hairs. I am also losing my hair on both sides of the front (forehead), in the last couple of years. Please suggest on both the matters and will it be possible to get back my hairs.","Doctor":"Hello. The side effects of the Eberclin M cream (Eberconazole+Mometasone) are skin thinning and dermatitis. Please do as I say. 1. Externally apply hibiscus flower oil to the scalp (or) rub the flower directly on the affected area daily, if possible. 2. Internally take homeopathic medicine, Graphites 30, two doses at bedtime, One today and second on the fourth day. One dose means ten pills. Just chew the medicine, no need to take water along with medication. Stop all other medication. Please inform me about your life next time. Are you under any stress or personal loss, etc? Alopecia areata. No combing on wet hair. Please inform me after seven days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Local lesions like cervical erosion. 3. Rarely vaginal infection, etc. To find out the exact cause of the problem, please consult your gynecologist once and get examined. By clinical examination the possible cause of your problem can be identified and treatment can be taken accordingly. In case of side effect of implant, antifibrinolytics can help.

Sometimes, she gets cold and fever but that is normal I guess. Is there anything to worry?","Doctor":"Hello. Your child's liver, spleen and lymph nodes should be palpated to check for any enlargement, if present. The thrombocytosis is usually considered reactive when decreasing with the time. Your child's platelet reduces in three days so mostly it will be reactive secondary high platelet for which no specific treatment needed. But you need to repeat your child's CBC again after one week. If after one week it remains high, then you should consult hematologist or pediatrician for detailed evaluation as per my opinion."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife and I had some argument about my past.

I will get an erection, but when its time to enter, it falls. I want to know, how to get my mind to a place of not over thinking so that I am not distracted. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. I am happy that you did understand that the problem behind your erection is, the problem is related to stress and anxiety which is stemmed out of the differences between you and your partner. That itself is the first step of the problem solver. Now the remedial measures are, 1. Do not attempt to have sex when you have the thought and related stress in your mind. 2. Start relaxation breathing for 10 minutes at least once per day. 3. Start physical exercise for one hour daily 4.

I had flow on the exact date of my period for three days, but it was lighter. I used three sanitary pads. But next month I missed my period. I do not have any pregnancy symptoms. My TSH is 10.5. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. Usually, it would take seven to ten days before implantation happens. The fertilized egg (conception day) will have to develop first into blastocyst stage and travel down to implantation site. The actual duration cannot be exact, but it may extend to two to four days more. So the answer is yes, it is possible that the implantation may happen 14 days after conception. In your case, it may not automatically mean implantation since you also have elevated TSH which can mess up with your hormones. I suggest you take a pregnancy test and if it is negative, then the period delay is just secondary to thyroid hormones."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had chest pain very lightly in different areas of the chest. The pain was not continuous but occurs only sometimes during day or night but not in the sleep. I have taken an ECG and lipid profile test, but both are normal. My doctor advised me to take Ecosprin on daily basis life long. Kindly advise on this. I have a habit of smoking 7 to 8 cigarettes per day. Due to gastric problems, I felt this pain, but after taking gastric medicine, it will disappear. The gastric drug that I used was Atorva for cholesterol, but not now. My cholesterol level is in the normal range. Total cholestrol is 191 and triglycerides are 177.","Doctor":"Hello. For chest pain, I advise you to have treadmill test and exercise tolerance test (ETT), in which you have to walk and run on a treadmill and simultaneously your ECG and blood pressure recorded. If chest pain is due to heart, it will be confirmed. Keep taking Statin (atorvastatin) but no need of Ecosprin (aspirin) according to new guidelines. For on and off chest pain, take pain killers such as Paracetamol. Have an ETT done and send me the report so that further planning can be done."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30-year-old married woman. I have got my last period before two months.

Irregular periods can occur due to many causes like stress and strain, dietary changes, etc., leading to hormonal imbalance. General conditions like anemia, thyroid abnormalities, etc., can also cause irregular periods. To find out the exact cause of the problem, please go for a blood test to check pregnancy which is more accurate than a urine test. If that gives negative result, pregnancy is almost ruled out. The other option is ultrasound, which helps in ruling out the pregnancy and also to find out other possible causes of irregular periods like PCOD, etc. Hope I have answered your query."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would like to know why my veins are so visible.

Does it have to do anything with my health? Is there a treatment? Which doctor am I suppose to see?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your case (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Since you have not taken any treatment for any diseases and almost all veins are visible then you need not worry. This phenomenon is exaggerated in some individuals. Surely this will not do any harm to your health, as these are visible for a very long time and they will persist for your life. One more thing veins of feet are becoming more prominent because feet are dependent areas. When we stand we exert all pressure on feet. As a result blood flow to vessels here increases, and it becomes more prominent.

Can you please help me to understand the reason behind this? My mother is suffering from a cervical problem also. Please share your valuable advice and opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. The most common cause is old age. In old age, small vessels become fragile and rupture, leading to blackish bruises, common in lower limbs but can occur anywhere in skin. Another cause is medicines. If a person is using drugs called steroids or anticoagulants or antiplatelets, then such bruises can occur. Another cause is trauma. In old age, an only minor injury can cause bruises as vessels are fragile. No relation to what you called thick blood or so.

OCD responds well to medication (SSRIs - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and psychological therapy (CBT - cognitive behavioral therapy). I presume you are on Fluvoxamine which is useful in OCD. You need to be monitored by your doctor to optimize the dose and monitor for any side effects. If there is no adequate response, alternative SSRI like Sertraline can be tried. Once your symptoms are under control, you can continue to work and function normally.

Anterior tibial tendinitis limits my activities by making it hard for me to walk or stand during long periods of time. I did not have any medical tests done. A physical examination of my right foot and ankle was done last week. I received a prescription for an anti-inflammatory pill called Naproxen. I was advised to take this 500 mg pill up to two times a day to help with pain but the pill must be taken before the pain begins. I was also advised to continue wearing supportive shoes, insoles, ankle supports and ice my foot for approximately 20 minutes whenever I feel the pain. I can do other activities that I do not put so much stress and strain on the foot. I was out a total of 3 days because of this condition. I did call my employer and let them know what was going. I also bought to their notice that I would be out for the next 2 days due to this medical condition. I did my research on this medical condition looked up information on the computer about tendinitis. When I looked up this information I was advised to cease the activity which caused tendinitis. I also looked up the short-term and long-term effects of this medical condition. I have documentation to prove that I do have this medical condition. Shall I apply for leave? Or should I quit my job?","Doctor":"Hi. No, you need not have to quit your job. What you can do is that you can get an ultrasonography (USG) of the tendon done which will show you the inflammation and it will provide you with the documentation of anterior tibial tendinitis. With this documentation, you can apply for about 3 weeks of leave. The leave you got was only for the emergency department. You can visit the OPD (outpatient department) and do a USG scan, document it and apply for further leave. Meanwhile, you can use Naproxen as prescribed to you. Do hot fomentation now over the affected area thrice a day and limit your activity to give rest to the affected part. Also a removable walking cast is going to help you a great deal to recover from this condition sooner and present worsening of this condition which will lead to chronic anterior tibial tendinitis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My father is 76 years old. He has been in ICU for two days as he was diagnosed with LRTI (CAP - community acquired pneumonia). Four years back he had TB. His vitals such as BP, temperature, renal and heart tests are fine. He is not responding to antibiotics and his condition is deteriorating. His saturation has dropped to 82% and put on oxygen. On the third day, he was given Amoxicillin 1000 IV and 5x nebulization and then switched to Piperacillin-tazobactam IV which I have read is for Pseudomonas. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a commonly acquired hospital bacterium. Doctors admit they have not identified the bacteria yet from the sputum culture and told it will take more than 5 days to identify the bacteria. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Your father is suffering from acute exacerbation of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) with CAP (community acquired pneumonia) and sepsis. Currently he is on appropriate antibiotics. But, he needs systemic steroids to cope up the exacerbation along with inhaled steroids. Though his x-ray (attachment removed to protect patient identity) appears normal, CT thorax is suggestive of bilateral consolidation. Sputum culture should ideally tell us the exact bacteria and sensitive antibiotics for it. Supportive treatment like nutrition, supplemental oxygen or noninvasive ventilation must be given. There is no worry as other vital organs are functioning normally. But, definitely he will take time to recover from this exacerbation. He also had tubercular effusion 5 years back, but now it does not seem to be a relapse of TB (tuberculosis). So, no anti-TB medicines are required at present. Definitely it is CAP with COPD exacerbation. Even after he gets well, he should take consultation from pulmonologist for inhaler treatment. Sputum culture report should be sought for at earliest or if not available, fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be performed for taking endobronchial sampling for cultures. Steroids should be tapered in appropriate doses. Bacterial Infection. Sputum culture or bronchoscopic sampling for culture. CAP with sepsis.

So, could not penetrate my penis. Is there any issue in my health? Or is this due to first time fear? How to approach this? Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. Since you got proper erection during foreplay and there is no history of difficulty in erection it was the result of performance anxiety. This generally occurs in first timers and especially in young age. I do not think you need to be concerned at this level as occasional failure is rule rather than exception. Almost all men report such problem in erection psychologically on certain occasions without suffering from any disorder."},{"Patient":"Hi,Could you please review the attached photos and x-ray taken before treatment, post root canal and post temporary filing.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Firstly, yes this is a mild form of chickenpox which occurs in those individuals who have very good immunity. But important thing in your history is that you already had chicken pox in your childhood. Once after getting chickenpox, it is extremely extremely rare to have it again in life.

I have gone through the photos you have provided and noted the sores and white spots inside your cheeks. There are a few explanations for those: 1. Eating or drinking hot foods, drinks, drinking carbonated drinks.  2. If you have experienced flu-like symptoms, it is due to acute viral infection. That might take a few more days to get completely healed. Avoid drinking too hot foods or drinks or carbonated drinks. Keep good oral hygiene. Apply oral antiseptic four times daily.

This is the hormone for fight and flight and to relieve from this condition, Clonazepam acts as a relaxing agent. This is normal for any person and this medicine cannot affect the brain. Due to chronic stress, our serotonin level goes down so that some medicine maintain that level. No anatomical changes occur during stress in the brain. There is no damage in the nervous system.

For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It is an immediate kind of skin allergy, and once it starts, it usually tends to last 4 to 6 weeks if appropriately treated. You could even try to identify any possible exacerbating factor. The usual ones are pain killers, flowering plants, pet animals, artificial colored food items, nuts, seafood, cement dust, etc. You can start taking tablet Allegra 180 mg (Fexofenadine) once daily in the morning, and tablet Teczine 5 mg (Cetirizine) once daily in the evening for three weeks regularly. You can apply Calosoft lotion at sites of itch."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have shortness of breath on exertion and episodic mild muscle weakness for about one year. It worsens with fatigue and particularly ptosis. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello I saw the chest x-ray posteroanterior and lateral views (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The findings are, 1. There are mildly prominent lung markings in the bilateral mid and lower zones. The upper zones are clear bilaterally. 2. There is no pleural effusion. 3. The cardiac size is normal. 4. The retrosternal space is normal. 5. The posterior costophrenic recess is free. The above findings can be due to mildly hyperactive airways. HRCT chest scan may be done if there are abnormalities in lung function tests. Please avoid any pollution area or dust exposure.

It started with a few random anxiety attacks, and soon it spread. I find it hard to leave the house on my own due to this. I feel ashamed, and my self-esteem is very low. I am usually a proud person, very independent, determined and self-sufficient, but this issue has impacted my life negatively. I find it hard to socialize now due to shame about the anxiety symptoms showing up and this led to shyness. I feel depressed and have low energy. I do not enjoy the things I used to enjoy anymore. I had some significant losses and failures in my life in the past few years, and I think this might also be the cause for all this. The anxiety symptoms are pretty much like panic. I get heart palpitations, cold hands and lots of muscle tension, especially in the neck, face, and eyes. If I feel very nervous, my neck gets so tense that it twitches. I also experience lots of self-criticism and guilt because of this. I have high expectations of myself and consider this problem to be unacceptable. I tried many of the common homeopathic remedies for this (such as Ignatia, Staphysagria, Arsenicum, Sulphur, Graphites, Pulsatilla, Calc Carb) and nothing seems to help except for Aconite 200. The problem is that Aconite only helps temporarily. I need something that works more long-term. Is this something you can help me?","Doctor":"Hello. After Going through the details, I could narrow down to three medicines namely, Ambra Grisea. Hyoscyamus. Baryta Carb. I suggest you start with Ambra Grisea 1 M one dose and wait for 7 to 8 days. If you feel a change, then you can wait and repeat the medicine only when required. Also if it helped and then stopped working, then you can go for higher potency like 10 M. If it does not help then go to the Hyoscyamus and then Baryta Carb the same way as the first one. If in case it helps. I would surely like to know the follow-up. With regular follow-ups and it can be managed more efficiently. Some losses in the past few years. None advised. Ambra Grisea, Hyoscyamus, Baryta Carb. Regular follow-ups about the action of the medicine are appreciated for at least at 10-15 days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 33 year old male.

Reviewing your history and pictures showed (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there might be skin irritation which can be from repeated frictions like masturbation or reaction to the substance used it also can be due to vitamin deficiency or a skin condition like psoriasis, etc. Fungal infection is rare and it does not present as a spot usually it is whitish material and happens in people who are immune compromised like diabetics or people who have HIV infections. Since it is not itchy or painful you should not worry about it and you should not use Cortisone cream as it makes things worse. Keep good hygiene area should be dry and clean. Use nonchemical lubricant like olive oil if you masturbate. If you have changed your soap or shower gel it might be the cause. Take vitamin E and vitamin A to replace your vitamin deficiency. If you are known to have psoriasis then treatment can be by Methoteraxate cream (but only for people who are known to have psoriasis).

As far as her kidneys are concerned, her creatinine and urea are within normal range. Her urine microalbumin is raised which points towards heart and kidney function.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

In my first year in school, I feel helpless and depressed because I cannot make friends, more specifically they do not like spending time with me because I am serious most of the time. And my way of thinking is different also I cannot focus on studies. I do give my best to succeed in the exams but still, I m feeling like it is not me, or it is not what I want to do. But I am not sure those are just thoughts that makes me all the time unfocused on what is necessary at the moment , I also suffer from a lack of confidence in myself and cannot say that my situation is the worse but all these 19 years I only learned to hate and hurt myself more than anyone can else do to me. I am scared of taking any wrong decision because I cannot afford it either mentally or financially. Please, can you help me? Going to a psychiatrist in my place is expensive and suspicious. I was a great person until nine years, everything has changed. I struggled alone till 16 which made me talk to some friends and my brother and my secret fiance. Still, I think it is too late because I became a person who is afraid of being happy for more than half a day.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, you should stop hating yourself and stop blaming yourself for anything. The symptoms like helplessness, worthlessness (hating self), difficulty in making friends, weak confidence, lack of focus, indecisiveness, etc., are occurring most likely due to some mood disorder. This could be depression. Depression results in impairment in functioning. To come out of these thoughts, there are two treatment options. Medicines especially antidepressants are the first choice for these symptoms. But since you cannot afford to visit a psychiatrist so this option at this point is not possible. Another option is cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). This is a session based therapy. A therapist is needed, and this helps a lot in coming out of depression. Over the years since childhood, a person learns wrong things, but these thoughts become cognitive distortions like for example if you did not perform well in a group of friends, then you will imply this to your whole life that you are worthless because you fail to perform well in friends. Maximizing negative things, minimizing the positive things, disqualifying positives, generalizing things, etc. are examples of cognitive distortions. In CBT the cognitive distortions are identified, and an individual is made aware of these distortions. Then therapist and individual work together to eliminate these distortions and to work how an individual can live happily.

These cysts are since birth and are usually asymptomatic. In my opinion her symptoms could be related to the bulging disc in L5S1 level, which may need surgery.

Any tablets for balance control or leg devices to help lift little upwards or muscle tightnening substances like enzyme powder Coq10 if any please suggest, any.","Doctor":"Hi. To be very honest myopathy inflammatory in origin needs lifetime treatment. We just have steriods and other immunosuppressive therapy to control the disease progression. Definitely, Prednisolone works magically but since it has lots of side effects, we taper and reduce it to bare minimum. I would recommend to discuss with your doctor to put you on lowest possible dose of Methylprednisolone based on your symptoms and total CPK levels. Co enzyme Q10 has controversial role.

I am taking Yelate antidepressants, Stresam, Ivedol sleeping tablets six in number.","Doctor":"Hello. If he has a fear of something (based on experience) like failed in proper sexual intercourse, he will try to avoid that, because he thinks that it is going to be abandoned, and going to face humiliation in front of you. So he thinks it is better to have no sex, no desire. So in management part first relax him, conquer his trust that you love him even without sex. Now start working on a treatment. 1. SSRI (antidepressants) and Clomipramine. 2. Anesthetic sprays on glance before sex (only study support it). 3. Weak pelvic floor muscles sometimes contribute to it. Kegel exercises may help strengthen them. Find the right muscles to tighten by stopping your urine in midstream. Hold them tight for three seconds and then release them for three seconds. Do this 10 times, at least three times a day. Wear a condom, and It may desensitize him. Some men find that masturbating a few hours before sex helps them stay in control during intercourse.

I am having problem in each and every activity involving legs. I have reduced mobility and flexibility of legs. My report shows AVN stage 3 of hip joint, for which I have been suggested hip replacement surgery. My question is that, if problem is in hip joint then why I have so many problems with knees? When I stand up, my knee gets blocked and I cannot stand instantly. There is cracking sound in knees when I sit or stand up. I am worried whether I have some other problem in knees also.","Doctor":"Hi. Hip avascular necrosis (AVN) and hip arthritis causes pain in the affected hip and also sometimes in the knees as the same nerve which supplies the hip also supplies the knee joint. It is called as obturator nerve. This nerve supplies both the joints. So if there is hip joint pain, many patients also get pain in the knee joint. But, also to be sure if nothing is wrong with the knee joint, you should take x-rays and document it. Get x-ray of the knee joint both in anteroposterior view (AP) and lateral view and then get a follow up done to confirm your problem."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 30 year old male. I had a BMG urethroplasty a week ago. Currently urinating with catheter due to pan-anterior urethral stricture. Are there any complications and risks associated with it?","Doctor":"Hello. I welcome you and want to assure you need not worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. The panurethral stricture is rather a less common but serious challenging surgical issue the urologists have to face.  2. This surgery is usually challenging as there is scanty tissue to cover the whole length of the urethra. Also as we know the reason for panurethral strictures is usually inflammatory disease, so the results of surgical repair may be less than expected on the scale of satisfaction. It is due to the spongiofibrosis of the repaired tissue.  3. During the post-operative period, infections and breakdown of the repaired tissue is commonly seen as a complication. But with all these risks, still this surgery is going on very successfully throughout the globe. If there is urinary tract infection your physician may prescribe you with Nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin). Take cranberry juice to avoid infection."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I got a complete medical checkup done today.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The commonly seen changes are opacification of airspaces within the lung parenchyma. Any cavity in the lung lesion. Calcification can exist around a cavity and nodule with poorly defined margins. Pleural effusion - presence of a significant amount of fluid within the lung space. Hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy (bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy) - enlargement of lymph nodes in the lungs.

Should I see a nephrologist prior to the ESWL? Or do you think that it is fine to proceed with the treatment as planned?","Doctor":"Hello. Your high readings in kidney function tests are probably attributed to the kidney stone that you are having. Any stone present in kidney that is causing hematuria is very likely to cause transient rise in creatinine levels and alter the kidney function test too. This is the reason for the stone need to be removed else it would cause permanent kidney damage. I suppose there is no need to see a nephrologist at this point. Once your stone is removed, your kidney function would dramatically improve within a matter of few weeks. However, I would still need to know the location of the stone? What is the size of the stone and any hydroureteronephrosis associated? If possible just attach your ultrasound or CT report.

The rule of thumb in psychiatry is to prescribe medicine for an adequate duration and adequate dose, before considering it ineffective or plan to change. If your doctor has previously tried one medication for proper dose and duration now, he can add another drug, so it depends on how you are responding to medicine? So it might be possible that if you did not respond to one medicine your doctor keeps adding medicine to your prescription. If you are not in a depression or not a rapid cycler, Sertraline can be tapered down. If you are in remission, Lamotrigine can be slowly stopped. I found no counteracting drug.

I understand your concern and would like to explain that as all your cardiac tests have resulted in normal, a cardiac issue is almost excluded. A 24 hours ECG monitoring test (Holter) would be necessary to eliminate any abnormal arrhythmic event. Probably the most important aspect to explain your symptoms seems to be anxiety. It may exacerbate tachycardia and also unpleasant chest discomfort. But, before getting to that conclusion, I would recommend a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging test.

The presence of thick curdy white discharge with itching and often foul smell is indicative of a fungal and bacterial infection together called mixed vaginosis. This is usually caused by women who are sexually active and contract it while intercourse and also seen in women who use chemical based soaps to wash their genitals during bathing or while using toilets.

I passed carefully through your concern and would like to explain that krill oil is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have proven beneficial to the brain and nerve endings activity.

Talk to your obstetrician about it. Blood loss in C- section and normal delivery are almost the same. So any mode of delivery is equally risky for anemia. You should do a deworming.

Sometimes we see someone close to us suffering from any disease and try to find or check yourself for these symptoms, remain anxious with their thought, later that thought can lead to depression. One more easy way to decide is to ask yourself whether normal functioning is hampered. If the answer is yes you should go to a psychiatrist as early as possible. Again saying that taking help from the parent is the best option in front of you. Do not be afraid of the treatment. It is very simple and easy to treat depression nowadays."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old female. I have checked my pregnancy test on the 8th of this month and my last LMP was on the 5th of last month. I have consulted the doctor, he confirmed my pregnancy and prescribed me capsule Gestafine 200 (Progesterone soft gelatin 200) one capsule per day for 15 days and Folvite 5 mg one tablet per day for 15 days. After a week, I found some brown discharge. Then, My doctor did a scan and said that the baby growth is not well for the one month of pregnancy. She said that there is a 50% chance of miscarriage. So, she prescribed Aspirin gastro-resistant tablet IP 50 mg one tablet per day for 15 days and Tranlok-E two tablets per day for three days. As my brown discharge did not stop, again, I went to the doctor. She has done an ultrasonic scan and told me that the baby has started to grow. Now, she prescribed IM HUCOG 5000 one injection, IM Susten 200 one injection, Tranlok-E three tablets per day for 5 days, Duphastone 10 mg three tablets per day for 10 days, Susten 200 one tablet per day for 10 days, Folvite 5 mg one tablet per day for 10 days and Aspirin gastro-resistant IP 50 mg one tablet per day for 10 days. As of now my brown discharge has stopped. I tried to approach you this time, because on the internet I found that Tranlok-E is prescribed to stop uncontrolled bleeding in menstrual periods and it is not mentioned for pregnant women. Since, I am pregnant, I just want to confirm whether there is any side effect in the above mentioned tablets. Shall I continue those medicines?. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your query completely here.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Earlier I had valve replacement open heart surgery in a reputed hospital. Please provide me all information regarding this. Is there any risk in another open heart surgery or in TAVR?","Doctor":"Hello. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. Transthoracic aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is usually considered as a good choice for patients who are not a good candidate for open heart surgery. It is a good alternative for patients based on clinical evaluation and severity of the disease. Every procedure has its own risk factors and the same to TAVR and open heart surgery. It includes heart musculature rupture, valvular damages, some damage to the vessels coming out and going into the heart. Damage to the brain and other major organs due to clot or thrombus formation may also occur due to manipulation and surgery.

If you have been trying for last one year and not conceived yet then a semen analysis is necessary, which should evaluate the sperm count and morphology.

Based on test results, my opinion is, it could be chronic Lyme disease. Low CD57 with additional symptoms provided except follicular carcinoma, could be due to chronic Lyme disease. Chronic Lyme disease is associated with a decrease in the CD57 lymphocyte subset that may persist over 10 years. The decrease in CD57 cells appears to reflect a selective immunologic abnormality in patients with chronic Borrelia infection.

Start Zinc syrup 10 milligrams once a day and a good brand of prebiotic probiotic available locally. Look around her bums area, if there is a redness rash, then apply Zinc-oxide cream locally 3 to 4 times a day.

I show no active signs and lupus and never truly did. I was always just monitored. I have a copper IUD and occasionally take my Aspirin. When I take it often, I bruise super easily.

All other labs are normal in the metabolic panel and CBC with auto diff.","Doctor":"Hello. The elevated high total protein does not indicate malignancy only. It could be due to some temporary infective etiology as well. Your all other parameters do not indicate any blood cancer. If you have a history of positive beta 2 glycoproteins as mentioned in the above description then you have to repeat your beta 2 glycoprotein estimation again after 12 weeks. If two repeated tests for beta 2 glycoprotein are positive and any history of thrombosis, then anti-phospholipid lipid syndrome can be possible or else not. The positive Smith antigen points towards lupus. If asymptomatic, then no need for treatment and only monitoring can be done. However, you can repeat your Smith antibody estimation again to exclude the possibility of lupus. You can investigate with anti-ds DNA estimation as well to exclude SLE. If beta 2 glycoprotein result comes negative in the repeat test, then no need to take Aspirin. The occasional Aspirin ingestion has no value and not indicated.

However, they have been continually elevated to the point that I was recently sent to a hematologist who initially thought I had CLL, but the flow cytometry test came back negative, then he did a T-cell gamma rearrangement test, also negative. At that point, he decided it must be autoimmune and sent me back to my PCP. Several years earlier when all this started, I woke up with joint pain, swelling and was sent to a Rheumatologist who decided I had RA despite every RA test being negative, and the joint swelling is not following what is clinically seen in RA (my joints were not bilaterally swollen, red, or hot. They were randomly swelling in my hands, feet and were really painful). So, I refused to take Methotrexate because I had no positive RA tests and after about a year, the swelling went down, the pain faded away and I have had no other flares since that time. So, my question is, should I try to get to the bottom of my chronically elevated absolute lymphocyte and if so, are there any other tests I should have my PCP pursue?

If you have any type of leukemia especially CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) or MBL (monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis) then it could have been reflected in the peripheral smear examination report or in flow cytometry investigation. Your flow cytometry report is negative and hence it suggestive of non-leukemia condition. Autoimmune disease chances can be there.

His ejaculate went on the floor, maybe a small amount on my hands. I quickly wiped my hands dry with a towel and then washed them with hot soap and water. I had no visible scratches or cuts on my hand. Additionally, he had no visible sores, blisters or warts on his penis. What is the scale of risk associated with this behavior? This was my first encounter such as this.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. With your history, it seems like the risk of getting STD's like herpes, syphilis, chancroid, and the wart is very negligible as you have mentioned that the person had no sores, ulcers, blisters or wart. If the person has latent herpes, then there are remote chances of getting herpes on hands that again depends on your immunity. Mucosal contact has a significant risk of transmission of STDs. Oral sex has the risk of 1 in 1000 chances of acquiring HIV, and anal sex has 1 in 100. In your case, I would say the risk is negligible."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 9 years old. He got his first prescription glasses two years ago, and it was 1.00 and 1.25. Since he started to wear glasses, he had red eyes, tearing, and after some times pupil goes side to side out of control. Then we were referred to an ophthalmologist. He said my son's shape is a little different than an average person. Then I stopped him from wearing glasses until the last year. He got his prescription glasses before three months. It was for long distance of 1.25 and 1.50. Now it dropped to 2.25 and 2.50 in four months. And he started to face the same problems. What can be the problem? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Did he undergo cycloplegic refraction? Cycloplegic refraction means, children cannot be tested for glasses like adults. For children, we have to first put drops like Homatropine to dilate their eyes and then optometrist has to do a retinoscopy to determine the number. If this method is not used, one cannot determine the error correctly. Only after cycloplegic refraction, one can tell exact refractive mistake of a child."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Last week I woke up with what appeared to be three to four tiny blisters on my upper left lip, outside of the mouth, not inside. I recently had a baby and have not left the house except to go to a dental appointment one week before developing these small blisters. I went to the doctor a few hours after finding the blisters, and she ran an Ig blood test which came back negative. I also had an HSV 1 and HSV 2 test done before seven months before giving birth that came back negative. So I know I was not a carrier of the virus. After seeing what could be the beginning of primary infection, my doctor prophylactically put me on a dose of Valtrex. Three days before we did a culture swab test which came back today as negative. My question is, are there any possible ailments that would closely mirror a cold sore? I understand that if my primary infection was only two weeks ago, it is possible that it would be undetectable in the bloodstream but I was surprised that the culture swab came back negative as well. Could this be because of the use of Abreva earlier in the day? The blisters never leaked much fluid, so it was quite hard to get a great sample on the swab. After a few days, the blisters never turned into an open sore, just slowly dried and tingled a little. At this point, they appear to be gone entirely. There was never any pain associated with the sore.","Doctor":"Hello. 1. There can be other skin diseases which mimic HSV 1 infection on lips, but still, it is quite characteristic clinically, things which can sometimes look like are paederus dermatitis, hand foot, and mouth disease, but it is seen usually in children and blisters elsewhere are also present. Candida can be there, but it rarely presents as blisters in adults. 2. To conclude the appearance is quite characteristic and your description of vesicles and their evolution looks like HSV. 3. The serology can take up to a month (average 2 to 4 weeks) to become positive after primary infection, HSV IgM will be detectable at that time in serum. So it might be one of the reasons for that. 4. For culture the sensitivity overall is 50 percent, that is 50 out 100 patients culture will grow the virus. Although in primary syphilis sensitivity is up to 80 percent. 5. When lesions start to heal it is difficult for a culture to get a positive result. Also, fluid will be required for it to be positive. Either fluid from blisters or erosions whatever is present. It will not come positive if the sample is taken from the surface of the vesicle. 6. My advice is to repeat serology after 3 to 4 weeks once again, and even if it is positive, you do not need to get frightened so much as HSV 1 serology is usually seen in 50 to 75 percent cases. It does not mean it will come back again, though being a carrier chance of spread is there somewhat."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby is 10 months old, and he is two months premature. If I feed him with solid food, he does vomiting. Is it not safe for him to feed with solid food?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. I advise you to try giving some soft and semi-solid foods to your baby right now. Once he starts digesting these then move on slowly towards other food items. Moreover, some babies do not take solid food properly until they develop teeth. But if your baby does not digest semi-solid foods too, then you need to visit a nearby child specialist. Because it can be due to some other underlying cause which needs to be ruled out. I hope you understand my point."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

There was blood in sputum few times and sputum test showed negative but based on CT scan doctor suspected pulmonary TB. I was recommended medicine for six months. I gained 3 kg weight and there was no blood in sputum during this period. The medicine was completed last week and I visited the doctor. This time again CT scan was done and the report is attached. The doctor says there are a significant improvement but still some suspicious nodules that may be active in a rare case of 1 to 2 percent. He suggests extending medicine for another three months. I consulted another doctor based on same CT scan and he says there is no need to extend medicine. There will always be 1 to 2 percent chance of TB recurring even after taking medicine for another three months. He says that since TB is detected early and sputum was negative, hence there is no need to extend medicine. I have attached the first and last CT scan report for your reference. These are some queries in this regard. 1) What does the current CT scan report say about TB? 2) Whether should I take TB medicine for another three months? 3) Is there always 1 to 2 percent chance of TB recurring even after completion of medicine? 4) Is there any chance of TB getting drug resistance if it happens again? 5) Can I be sure that I do not have drug resistance TB right now?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through both the CT scans and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is good that you have completed six months of TB treatment in spite of the sputum test being negative. Even though the sputum test for AFB was negative, the symptoms and CT scan were suggestive of active TB before six months. Now, the CT scan is showing signs of healed fibronodular shadows but we cannot decide whether this is active TB at present or not just on the basis of CT scan report. For that, we have to consider, if there are any symptoms at present or not, second now what is the status of sputum AFB test whether positive or negative and if sputum test is negative then we should do induced sputum test after nebulization with saline or perform bronchoscopy test, a kind of endoscopy of lungs and collect sputum sample through the scope. Regarding extension of treatment, it is always the decision of treating doctor to extend the medicines for extra three months, based on sputum report or if any active symptoms as there is always a chance of some residual infection or reinfection with TB bacteria. Also, we can do Bactec test of sputum to find out whether it is drug-resistant TB or not and decide the appropriate medicines based on the Bactec test report. So it is advisable to discuss all these things with the treating doctor and based on the fresh reports, to decide whether to extend the same medicines for three months more or to start new medicines. I hope all your queries are clear now. Simultaneously you should concentrate on the high protein diet and avoid junk food. All the best and take care. Sputum AFB test, bronchoscopy to collect sputum directly from the lungs. It should be based upon the results of fresh sputum test."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Medical history: I am a diabetic patient under insulin treatment.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Three days ago it started to pain under left breast then under left armpit. The pain continued in a part of my arm, then a spot on my neck and then a spot on my shoulder. And I read about heart attack. And I have been under a lot of stress recently. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Unlikely to be a heart attack. This is atypical chest pain. I guess you do not have any shortness of breath. Considering your age group the possibility of heart attack is extremely low. Next, the pattern of pain is not consistent with the heart attack. Heart attack pain is sudden onset, retrosternal or left-sided rather than just below the breast, going to left arm associated with uneasiness sweating, etc. It usually does not persist for three days even without treatment. The possibilities in you are musculoskeletal pain, cervical causes, pain from breast itself due to hormonal changes and stretching of tissues due to breast enlargement, etc. Try to press over the site and see if pain reappears, if yes then it suggests that it is a local pain rather than due to the heart attack. So, unlikely to be related to heart attack, but should get examined by a local doctor and ECG done if necessary after examination. Examination of doctor will also help to assess the possibility of peripartum cardiomyopathy, which usually presents with shortness of breath rather than chest pain.

I have read that a small scar area is probably non-progressive but I have also read about IPF, and that fills me with fear. Spirometry test was normal as it was a physical exam. I am so scared that it might be a progressive disease, but I hope that it is just an old scar as it is really small. Otherwise mostly healthy with no cough or difficulty breathing at all. Are all lung scars progressive?","Doctor":"Hello. Does not look worrisome (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Small streaks or fibrosis is usually due to old infection or collapses etc., The usual cause for such fibrosis is typically an infection and commonly found at such age groups. The probability of IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) is extremely low as the fibrosis is not diffuse or bilateral, no symptoms and spirometry are normal. So, I think it is not worrisome at present and should follow up as advised to be sure. Should consult your doctor earlier if developed any symptoms. Majority of the scar is non-progressive and extremely common to find such scars on routine X-ray and the majority are benign.

If there is no active bleeding you can safely go to work provided the roads and all are smooth and if it is not a very long drive. Please avoid intercourse and vaginal douching. Repeat USG after six weeks for a level 2 scan and look for placental migration. Continue Susten (Progesterone tablet)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing? I do not get excited during sex and unable to ejaculate. Only, rubbing the tip of the penis gives me excitement. Also, two weeks ago, I have undergone circumcision as my foreskin did not retract. Before circumcision too, I have the same problem. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. For further doubts consult a sexologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to know your opinion. I have had two positive hepatitis C antigen tests and the doctor had a polymerase chain reaction test that was negative for hepatitis C. He said I was one of the lucky ones. He said he could repeat and I did and again negative. All blood was concerning liver normal for 20 years. I had my gallbladder out and the doctor said the liver is perfect. I had a ruptured ectopic pregnancy on Easter day 25 years back. Subsequently, nine IVF procedures and one exploratory surgery, one open surgery to tie the fallopian tube to prevent fluid washing out embryos. Necrotic ovary half removed 14 years back. A CT scan of organs all normal lately. All blood tests are normal except TSH thyroid and low vitamin D.","Doctor":"Hi. You had a history of laparotomy operation as a consequence of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. But none of the surgical management has been related to your low TSH level. TSH level can be altered in infective condition or sometimes temporary due to non-thyroid illness. I suggest you repeat your serum TSH estimation and serum free T4 estimation after few days and revert back with that report. For low vitamin D level, you need to take Cholecalciferol sachet once a week for eight weeks or tablet can be prescribed. You can rely on PCR testing for HCV as it can be considered superior testing."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just had my period and last night, I masturbated and this morning there was blood and it had a strong odor. What does that mean?","Doctor":"Hello. Strong odor means you might be having a vaginal infection which may commonly occur in women due to lack of hygiene sometimes (during masturbation hand or sex toy if not sterilized properly) may lead to traveling of germs up inside the vagina and may result in infection and smelly vaginal discharge. I would suggest once wash your affected area as much as possible with plain water and avoid using any cosmetic products there and avoid tampon as well. Preferably use sanitary towels for periods and as soon you finish your periods get yourself assessed by a doctor to get the exact diagnosis of discharge and appropriate treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Among Nicotine gum, Bupron and Varenicline, which is better for quit smoking? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. All three have different indications. Still Varenicline is best to control smoking. They are known to reduce craving. Bupropion is preferred, if associated depressive symptoms present. Nicotine gum or patch preferred, if person is not able to control desire by above these. It is a replacement therapy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My father is a kidney transplant patient. He had his transplant a year ago. Right now he is having wet cough and cold. It started yesterday. He is taking Pangraf 1.5 mg, Cellcept 500 mg, Septran and Wysolone daily. Which medicines should we give him for cough and cold?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, most of the cough and common cold are upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) issues, which are self-limiting and respond without antibiotics. But since he is on immunosupressants, he would be considered for antibiotics if he develops any high grade fever or severe coughing. For URTI, I advise to take an antibiotic like Azithromycin only in case he has persisting fever. Otherwise in most cases of URTI, it is due to viral infection and it gets better within 5 days. He can take an antiallergic like Levocetirizine which is available as OTC (over-the-counter) drug. He should do warm saline gargles at least 3-4 times a day and do steam inhalation. He should also take Paracetamol on as or when required basis for fever and body pains.Please share my opinion with your doctor, before acting upon it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 35-year-old female. I am suffering from a vaginal infection. I want to get pregnant. Is it safe and possible for me after treatment?","Doctor":"Hello. There are different kinds of vaginal infections. The most common are yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis. They are easy to treat most of the time and should not alter your ability to get pregnant. These types of infections can also occur during pregnancy and can safely be treated at that time as well. It is difficult to give more detailed information without knowing the type of infections and the treatment provided."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My amazing 67-year-old dad who runs 10 miles a day just had his first TIA. The hospital did an array of tests and did not see any sign of it afterward but they are sure that is what it was. He and my mom are changing their diet and I am researching supplements. They are changing his blood thinning medication so I am not exactly sure what he will be on. But I read that one should be careful in taking turmeric and blood thinning medications.However, it would be great for him to be on turmeric because of the other benefits. What precautions would you recommend when it comes to this supplement and preventing a stroke? Any other supplements he should get on right away or talk to his doctor about?","Doctor":"Hi. I would like to bring into your notice that he should avoid turmeric as well as Fenugreek seeds in diet, as they have blood thinning potential. However, the potential is low, but can get aggravated by blood thinner medicines. As far as diet is concerned, he should completely avoid fast food, oil, alcohol, and smoking. A regular walk should be done, but make sure it is not done during cold seasons. I do not recommend any supplements. You may ask your doctor to add Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D to his prescription. Make sure he takes his medications regularly and get his check-ups done regularly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My mother aged 64 is suffering from ILD for the past three years. Now the doctor suggested recently that she has developed nodules which are mostly sarcoids in nature. Recent CT scan report shows it. Is there any way to revive her lungs condition? Is stem cell therapy effective for her? She is now on 24 hours of oxygen support with three liters capacity. Please help us.","Doctor":"Hello. ILD (interstitial lung disease) has many different types. What was her type of ILD when diagnosed and what treatment was given? Development of new nodules which are suspicious of sarcoidosis is quite rare, nevertheless if her condition permits which need to be evaluated by biopsy of the lungs, which might help in tailoring the treatment regimen. Repeat sputum for AFB smears, gram stain, C/S and GeneXPERT MTB/Rif. 1. Apart from home care oxygen, only another thing which might change the course of your mother is exercise, which is called pulmonary rehabilitation. 2. Weekly three times intense pulmonary rehabilitation has to be given. 3. Nutrition is very important which needs to be tailored by getting dietician consultation. 4. Stem cell therapy in ILD is still in the research phases so I cannot advise that. 5. As a last resort, you can try for lung transplantation. Vaccinations if not done earlier."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What ppm and percentage of fluoride are good for adults? I am trying to figure out what kind of toothpaste is good, but I hate mint, so I am trying to check the percentages of fluoride that is good for an adult.","Doctor":"Hello. Fluoride content can be around 1000 to 1200 ppm which is more than enough for the prevention of cavities. No need to go higher than that. More important is the proper brushing technique. Go for up-down or circular brushing technique without too much pressure onto the teeth to prevent wearing away of enamel in the long term due to abrasion."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 21 years old, and I have been struggling all my life with how to manage my hair and maintain a healthy hair texture. My hair used to be curly when I was younger but then became wavy over time and for the most part, it is wavy (I feel like it would be slightly more curled if it was healthy). I used to have a lot of insecurities with my hair growing up. To the point where I cry about it sometimes even now. It is always very dry and tangly and I used to straighten my hair a lot to be able to manage it. But I stopped straightening my hair over two years ago due to damage. I feel like hair products I use (like leave-in conditioners and sprays) only help my hair for a few weeks to a month, it almost seems like my hair gets used to it and adapts to fight me back. I have used hair masks like olive oil and coconut oil but not consistently. Lately, I only wash my hair once a week (it takes a lot for my hair to get oily, and I only wash it more than that if I am outside where there is a lot of dust or dirt). My diet is a lot of protein and carbohydrates (I workout 5 to 6 days a week) but very little greens (I am trying to work on eating that more). When I wash my hair once a week, I also lose a lot of hair, like 2 to 3 clumps, I do not have bald spots or anything, but I do get worried about my hair. I feel overall my hair is very fine, dry, and flat. It sits flat on top of my head with no body and it bothers me very much. I hate when other girls complain about their hair saying it is dead and they need a haircut, when their hair is way better than mine. I am going to have my hair for the rest of my life, I just want to know how to take good care of it and keep it healthy and put the right products so that I can feel happy, healthy, and confident.","Doctor":"Hi. I think your problem is very common and you should not feel so let down. Please get your blood tests for thyroid and iron profile. I hope your cycles are normal. If not then please get yourself checked from a gynecologist and follow a healthy diet like drinking lots of water. Eat lots of vegetables like broccoli and fruits like avocado. Please apply fresh aloe vera gel on the damaged root tips once or twice a week. Make a paste consisting of yogurt, almond oil, and vitamin E capsule and apply once or twice a week. Do not use any sulfate-based shampoo and use good serum oils on your root tips. Keep doing this and you will get results soon. Apart from that, wash your hair twice a week a least."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am currently on the Yaz contraceptive pill. I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?","Doctor":"Hello. The brown discharge should be temporary. I would recommend you have a period for the next couple of months and not skip the placebo pills temporarily to get back on track. If you have not missed any pills, pregnancy is very unlikely, but I would recommend a pregnancy test for added reassurance. If you have not had a recent test for STDs, like gonorrhea or chlamydia, I would also get tested for those, as these infections may have no symptoms and can cause spotting or bleeding after intercourse. If the problem continues, and no other cause can be found, you can consider changing to a different pill."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Am I pregnant now?","Doctor":"Hello. It can take up to 21 days to have bleeding after taking emergency contraception and although it is good that you took it very soon after unprotected intercourse, you should not use this as your primary method of birth control. It will cause cycle delays and unpredictability. Emergency contraception is not 100 % effective, even when taken as directed. There is always a chance of pregnancy when you have unprotected sex.

She is fine and on birth control and tells me she feels good but her upper back has been hurting for the past four days and she is starting to get cramps on and off again. We had sex two days before her last period and I have a strong feeling that it is just the birth control doing this. I used a condom and made sure there were no holes. Before I finished I pulled out but the condom slipped off and it got stuck inside of her and she said nothing was coming out of her after this happened. Is birth control the cause of all of this?","Doctor":"Hello. Any type of hormonal contraception may cause irregular bleeding that can be unpredictable in nature. If a birth control method is changed or if pills are missed, unscheduled bleeding can also occur. All birth control methods can fail, even with perfect use and unusual bleeding can also be a sign of pregnancy. A home pregnancy test is a good idea to make sure this is not the case. Upper back pain an unusual side effect of birth control, but cramping may be normal if it is during a period. Cramping or pelvic pain in the setting of abnormal or irregular bleeding could be caused by many things including ovarian cysts, early or abnormal pregnancy, urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted infections or PID (pelvic inflammatory disease).

Two years ago I was suspected to have fibroadenoma on the right breast by a doctor who's only done the ultrasound, because I haven't accept to do the biopsy. On the report it is written by the doctor Ultrasonographic bilaterally dense glandular parenchyma, on the left side there are no signs of apathological echogenicity, on the right side is seen lobule hypohehogenic focus of 16mm suspected of fibroadenoma. Since then I haven't done any ultrasound at all, and haven't used any kind of medication because the doctor haventw prescribed me anhthing and recently I feel pain before the period and then after having the period I dont feel pain. But now that I am on the fertile days, I feel pain a lot when touching it, and I can feel that there is a thick lump near the nipple. Moreover, now I can feel I have lumps also on the left side when I touch it, and it's painful, but the right side is more painful, and this didn't happen to me before. Just to add that I am still breastfeeding. I want to do another ultrasound but until then I need your answer about these questions: 1. I don't have family history with breast cancer, except the aunt of my mother who had breast cancer. Is it possible this is cancer and not fibroadenoma? 2. What kind of a diet should I have to cure this disease? 3. I am afraid of biopsy, I've heard that it is dangerous because when you get a part of the lump removed,(and if that is cancer) the rest of it will be shared all over the body. Is it true? 4. Should I stop breastfeeding and can I plan for another baby after some months or I should better do a surgery before then? 5. Is it possible that I feel this pain these days because of the fertile days I am going through? Thank you a lot","Doctor":"Hi, I have gone through your narration of symptoms. With the history of pain occuring around the periods time, it is more likely to be Fibroadenosis rather than Fibriadenoma.. I would like to assure you not worry about either of this conditions as both of them are only benign conditions and not cancerous.. It wont cause any dangerous harm.. There is nothing much specific help we could get drastically from diet modification for this condition.. Just maintain your ideal body weight.. But still you need to confirm it by a Biopsy.. Need not fear about biopsy.. As you described it is not removal of part of the lump.. It is just a pinch of the lump, a small bit from it with a small injection.. Sometimes your surgeon might decide to excise it as a whole and send for biopsy in which case, it is called Excision biopsy.. But that will serve you dually for diagnosis and also completion of treatment by total removal.. And it is only a minor surgery, not a major one.. So, just throw away your fears on that.. You can continue breastfeeding and plan for pregnancy. But I think, the lump may increase in size during pregnancy which I am not sure about.. You need to consult with a Gynaecologist rwgarding this..

I have reviewed the attached photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The closely grouped fluid filled blisters and yellow crusted lesions seem to be most likely herpes infection. You do not have to apply Acyclovir cream as it will not be much effective in genital herpes. You should start with oral antiviral like tablet Acyclovir 400 mg thrice daily for a week and apply topical antibiotic like Mupirocin cream on the lesions twice daily. Do not use soap over the affected areas and wash only with plain water. Caused by herpes virus; either HSV1 or HSV2 (herpes simplex virus 1 or 2). Herpes genitalis.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

To keep blood pooling down keep your feet and high during sleep, put one pillow beneath feet. 4. Try to give rest to your legs when have to stand for long, in between.

I have used it seven days not knowing that will cause me rebound effect. My ENT doctor says to continue my spray due to my dry nasal congestion I think. Now I went back to him saying that, I had rebound congestion and my turbinates are swelling, he advised me to stop the spray, and he replaced it with Mometsone Furoate two sprays once a day. He also gave me Methylprednisolone two times a day for seven days and an antihistamine. I am now on my sixth day of withdrawal, the steroid spray works and also the oral he gave me relief. But I do not think that it reduces my turbinates.","Doctor":"Hello. Why do you feel the turbinates are not getting reduced? Is it because you see those big in the mirror? Is there any symptomatic improvement in nose block after the use of Mometasone? Turbinates usually increase and decrease in their size a few times a day. Additionally, the nasal cavities also have congestion decongestion cycles normally. The rebound congestion that occurs due to decongestant nasal sprays is a temporary phenomenon. What might have happened in your case is rhinitis medicamentosa. But that occurs after months of usage of the decongestant spray and not by a week. We do frequently give decongestant drops for a week or ten days as indicated. I suggest you to continue with the steroid sprays. You may use a plain saline nasal douching couple of times a day. Make sure that you do it before using Mometasone and not after using as then it would wash away the Mometasone. Nasal douching helps keep the mucosa clear and supple. It helps to improve the ciliary action of cells lining the mucosa and clear the mucus better. That way you appreciate the better movement of air inside the nasal cavities. Do revert back to me with more details. If possible click a picture of the turbinates and get back to me. For now, if you were to come to me for a second opinion, I would continue with the medications you are on."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Looking to get an evaluation of brain MRI. Sensory overstimulation, suspecting temporal lobe epilepsy. Why is gray matter volume so high and white matter volume so low (atrophy reports)? Why are nucleus accumbens and caudate volume so low? Are there any signs of Huntington's disease? Are there any signs of hippocampal sclerosis? Are there any other issues that stand out or seem abnormal? I am currently taking Depakote ER, 2,000 mg per day. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. For evaluation of juvenile Huntington's disease, the ratio of frontal horn width or inter caudate distance is 2.52 (normal 2.2 to 2.6). The ratio of inter caudate distance or inner table width is 0.11 (normal 0.09 to 0.12). Therefore you do not have features of Huntington's disease. The asymmetry in nucleus accumbens and the left nucleus accumbens being smaller in size can be due to changes in the dopamine system. And it is related to neurobiochemistry factors. The grey matter percentile is on the higher side for you, and this area is still under research to assess the changes in brain grey-white matter and neurodegenerative changes. There are no apparent features of mesial temporal sclerosis and hippocampus atrophy changes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 41 years old. My office colleague is giving me mental trauma by gossiping about my childhood physical abuse. Sometimes suicidal thoughts come to my mind. How should I tackle it?","Doctor":"Hello. The first thing that you have to fix in your mind is you have done nothing wrong in that abuse episode, it is a matter of shame for that person who had done it and to those who are making fun of this. Be confident and set in your mind that you will never get disheartened, say to your own mind that you have fought very well with the circumstances and done your best to overcome that. Suicide can never be a solution to anything. Do people stop gossiping after you? They will keep talking, no matter or anyone else .one more thing, rule out other features of depression. If present consultant a psychiatrist. For the current situation try to talk with them and ask them if the same event had happened with someone to their relative or close one, will they keep talking like this?

Some need a particular ambiance to get proper sleep. It might well be our body's way of telling us that something is wrong somewhere. It may also be due to stress and tiredness. Erratic (irregular) dietary and sleep habits can contribute to the problem.

He is also a patient of hypertension with an abnormal lipid profile. His RBS is now 360 mg/dl. He is suffering from extreme fatigue although BP is controlled by anti-hypertensive drugs. In this condition, how can we manage fatigue although he is taking Metformin regularly?","Doctor":"Hello. Looking at RBG given (360 mg/100 ml), he has totally uncontrolled diabetes. When this happens there is a lot of glucose lost through urine, leading to excess urination, excess thirst and excess hunger. Plus there is unexplained weight loss and severe tiredness. The remedy for that is to achieve strict glucose control. Ideally, in a well-controlled patient, fasting glucose should be less than 100 mg, PP 150 to 170 mg and HbA1c % less than 6.8. For his age, it can be around 7 %. It is clear that his current treatment is totally inadequate. There is a need to upgrade the same. Some additional drug or drugs are required. Plus we will have to give a closer look at his present diet, weight, the extent of daily exercise. It is also necessary to check lipid profile, serum creatinine, and urea as well as microalbuminuria. Therefore, it is necessary to consult your local physician and get the necessary treatment initiated. If you are looking for online help, then please come back with all the above details for a consultation. Then I will be able to give specific guidance and even prescribe necessary medication. But please do not neglect. Such high glucose is an invitation for long term complications associated with diabetes.

Neurobion tablet Vitamin B group (B1, B6, B12) one tablet in the morning. Her sugar level always in fasting reaches 127 to 130 and after food level is fine which is less than 180. Recently we consulted a doctor and replaced the tablet as below mentioned. Isryl- M2 one tablet in the morning and night one before food. Neurobion B complex tablet one in the morning, Calcium DailyCal one tablet in the morning. After taking the new medicines the blood sugar level has increased from 150 to 160 in fasting.

Please advise if the dosage has to be increased with a new medicine or a new replacement required. Kindly advice if required new medicine.","Doctor":"Hello. I think the dosage is less for complete control of the sugar levels. Let her take one tablet at morning and 1.5 tablets at night and let me know her sugar levels. This new medicine has less dosage in comparison to the one she was taking earlier. Hence it must have lead to changes in her blood sugars. Also, I would like to ask if she is following a diabetic diet and does she exercise regularly? It is equally important as her medicines and would also make the medicines more effective.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Depending on where you live, emergency contraception can be purchased over-the-counter and taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, some women have this on hand just in case. Another effective way to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex is to have an intrauterine device (IUD) inserted within five days.

My uncle had pterygium excision with conjunctival autograft surgery on his right eye. He was given Ofloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.3% drops for eyes. After using the drop 4 times a day for 4 days, things did not seem right. After peeling the label of the bottle he saw, he was given Ofloxacin otic solution 0.3% for ears only. I am wondering if this could have caused the issues. He is currently having a feeling as though his eyelid is thick, heavy as well as very dry. And also he is feeling as though there is a film over his eye. Do you think this could have caused permanent damage? Presently he is taking medicines for high blood pressure and cholesterol. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. The cause for his present complaint is due to the surgical trauma induced by the surgery. In pterygium surgery, the mass of tissue is cut and scraped off and then a graft is placed to cover the defect. Our eyes are so sensitive, that even when an eyelash accidentally falls in the eye, it becomes so uncomfortable. Now a whole area has been actually cut and the graft sutured, so definitely, until the healing is completed the symptoms of heaviness, dryness will continue. This usually takes about a month to heal. Regarding the eye drop, I do not think it should matter much. If you can change it easily for any ophthalmic drop, then it will be better."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I suggest you please ask your dentist for dental X-ray, to find out the number of injected teeth and I think you need root canal treatment followed by gum treatment. Please do not worry it is common in early childhood and known as rampant caries. Generally occurs due to bottle feeding, more sugar-containing food, poor oral hygiene. Root canal (pulpectomy in child patient) is an effective way of draining out root infection. Prolonged use of antibiotic is not good for child health, a dental procedure done in dental office and medication is the best way to treat this type of problem. Pedodontist is a specialist for child dental problem so I suggest you please see an experienced pedodontist for your baby.

Real sex will not be like a porn movie, in reality, it smells, tired, sweat, no background music, do not expect light effects, do not expect two hours duration usually it will be few minutes, no continuous erotic sounds from partners. 8.

When someone tries to snap me out of it, I lash out. I think about suicide a lot, and I have a history of self-harm, and I have started to drink alcohol to feel normal. What is wrong with me?","Doctor":"Hello. You are reporting mood problems, history of self-harm and suicidal ideation. When you say you are spacing out, you are possibly describing dissociation which can be a result of high-stress levels. You will benefit by talking to your doctor or a counsellor to clarify the nature and extent of your symptoms and factors which could have contributed to your problems. The symptoms you report can happen in different conditions in adolescents. The common theme is high-stress levels and difficulty coping with the situation. With appropriate support, you will gradually get better. Have you discussed these issues with your parents or a trusted family member? I will strongly advise to talk to a trusted elder so that you can access further help. You can also talk to your school teacher or pastoral support. Be open and honest about your feelings. If talking is difficult, you can write down your feelings in a paper and share it with them. You can access support by seeing a counsellor at school or be referred by your doctor. Avoid alcohol. It will make your symptoms worse and more difficult to manage. Try positive coping strategies like exercise, learning martial arts, etc. I will recommend sharing this query to your parents so that they can support you. It is important to remember that you are not alone. Talk to others. At any time if you feel like you are not able to cope and keep yourself safe, you should talk to a family member or trusted elders.

You are anemic which can cause headache and blackouts in your vision. The consumption of those food products could be a sign of pica which is common in people with iron deficiency. It can take many weeks to build your iron levels back up with oral iron. If you are not pregnant, the delay in your menses is likely due to not ovulating with your previous cycle.

Some common foods or ingredients I have heard of are alcohol, aged cheese, chocolate, nitrates, MSG, and artificial sweeteners. Is there any truth to these? Are there any substances in common household products (like cleaning products) that might trigger migraines?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it is true that all these types of food may trigger migraine headaches. It depends on individual properties because not all individuals are sensitive to these substances. The underlying mechanism is thought to be vessel constriction and dilation, which is part of the physiopathology of migraine headaches. Other substances contained in cleaning products or cooking can trigger migraine too, depending on individual sensitivity. Other triggering factors are bright lights, sunlight, cold weather, etc."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Does economic stress affect a person's health?

Because financial stress and poverty lead to deficient nutritional status hence affect physical health, worry about it lead to impaired mental health. Poverty is seen in researches that poverty leads to poor mental health and poverty again is a significant risk factor for mental illnesses.

The onset of this headache starts with like a pressure getting built up in my head, like stress for no reason and all of a sudden and then the headache starts at the back of the head and within minutes it gets severe. If I have to describe the location, it is above the base of the skull and below the top of the skull. The pain is so severe that I have to take a pain killer else it will not subside. There are no other symptoms like vomiting, dizziness, nausea, speech imbalance nothing. The pain is pulsating or throbbing and it increases with any movement or applying pressure. This headache also comes on while having alcohol and on a very rare occasion at the time of ejaculation while having sex with my partner (once in a blue moon scenario). I got my cervical spine CT scan done and the reports were normal. The onset of headache has to do something with the time as well, for example, if today it has started in the evening then for the next few days it will happen around the same time. If I think a lot or involved in any discussion (intense or involves me getting anxious or excited) it triggers. It also gets triggered sometimes, if I am washing dishes or cooking food which requires a bit of focus. I do not know what the pattern is but all I know is it is ruining my quality of life. The frequency of these headaches are very frequent and consuming pain killers has started to affect my digestive system. I want to get rid of this problem. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Your headache most likely is migraine since it has been going on for the last 12 years. Another less likely possibility is occipital neuralgia. One thing that is not clear from your description is whether the pain is localized to one side or occurs on either side. Nevertheless, I would recommend the following: 1. MRI of the brain to rule out structural abnormalities that could be causing the headache. 2. Start on tablet Topiramate 25 mg twice a day and build up to 50 mg twice a day. 3. Maintain a headache diary- note the time, duration and character of pain in a diary each time you have pain. 4. Consider tablet Pregabalin 75 mg twice a day if Topiramate is not effective.

It has all the necessary ingredients that are easily digestible by just developing a newborn digestive system.

Breast milk does not need to prepare and to have arrangements for sterile bottles, boiled water as powder mill requires.

Moringa leaf extract does not contain any hormonal active ingredients that I can see from my research, just very high in vitamins and nutrients. This particular compound is not well studied as far as its effect on the menstrual cycle, so it is difficult to relate the changes in your cycle and bleeding pattern to that alone. The most likely cause of the spotting is that you did not ovulate this cycle and the lining of the uterus did not stabilize like it does after ovulation, which is why you are having light spotting. The partial three week fast likely put some stress on your body and may have contributed to the change in your cycle.

PEP is really efficacious, To the best of my clinical practice, I have not seen any case of a patient who has completed PEP with complete adherence and then turned positive. There are recommendations to test at four weeks, three months and then at six months of last exposure. You need not be tested in between and if negative, no further test is required."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Please tell me what are the things that can happen when you eat expired food.","Doctor":"Hello. If we eat food that is expired, the efficiency of the preservative is lost. So some organisms if present can multiply and can send some endotoxins. Also, the taste and odor can be altered. The food has a shelf life. If this is crossed some people can have diarrhea or acidity in the stomach. This can be due to the chemical nature of the food."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Based on your dates, if your gestational age is 10+6weeks, and if you had heavy bleeding, most likely it indicates an abortion wherein the product of conception have been expelled already. The heterogeneous endometrium just indicated the thickened uterine lining which develops in pregnancy to support the embryo, which will take some time to become normal. I am assuming your bleeding would have stopped by now and your gynecologist would have advised you some antibiotics to prevent any infections. If not then please consider taking them. I hope this helps. Repeat the scan after two weeks. Avoid pregnancy for the next two to three months, evaluate and then plan a pregnancy. Evaluate yourself prior to planning a pregnancy in the view of recurrent miscarriages."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have got my wisdom teeth out yesterday and they have been bleeding for over 24 hours.

But before two months, I was detected with a 2 cm x 1.8 cm x 2 cm submucosal fibroid in the uterus due to which I am feeling very dejected now. Please guide me.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. A lot of females are diagnosed with incidental fibroids and in most cases these can be resected easily. These does not pose serious risk to fertility and do not worry about it. The feeling of dejection can occur due to mild depression or rather I would call this as adjustment disorder. Try to remain relaxed. Discuss the prognosis with your gynaecologist and do not remain dejected. In some case, medicines like low dose SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) as Fluoxetine or Sertraline can be used. These medicines will help to improve the mood and will help to give you positive mood. Do not remain worried. If there are no symptoms and fibroid is incidental then this would not cause any serious effects on your health.

My test report shows small hypoechoic lesion of 7 mm in the fundus myometrium. It is indicative of a fibroid, and my endometrial thickness is 7 mm. What is the meaning of this 7 mm lesion? How will it impact my health?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? If I may suggest, just forget the report, let me explain why. Fibroids or myomas are harmless masses in the uterus, which are hormone dependent. It keeps growing as long as you have estrogen, so once your hormones stop after menopause, it will cease to grow and may regress. They never turn malignant. If you scan 100 ladies randomly, 50 to 70 % ladies will have fibroids of varying size. But they should never be treated unless they are causing some symptoms like excessive or intermittent bleeding during periods, excessive vaginal discharge, severe pain in the lower abdomen during periods, pressure symptoms on the bladder or bowel or back or kidney, or if the fibroid is interfering with the baby. We advise any fibroid of more than 5 cm should be removed, it grows at 1 to 2 mm per year, so you should have no problem. So just forget it, maybe have a scan again after 2 to 3 years or when trying for pregnancy. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Take Van kumari legium one spoon (five gram) in the morning and one spoon in the evening before food. Take tablet M2 tone (Ashoka and Ashwagandha) two tablets in the morning and two tablets in the evening after meal. You can take a banana flower after cooking, and jamun fruits can be consumed more if the bleeding is more. If you can collect the bark of jamun tree, then its kashayam is the best one to stop the bleeding. Make it as small pieces of the bark. Take 20 grams of the cut barks, add 250 ml of water, and boil it in a mild flame. Once the water is reduced to 100 ml, then stop firing it. Filter it, and this is called as jamun bark kashayam.

If you do not get the above tablet, buy Ashoka pattai (bark) choorna. Take 1 g thrice a day.

Aloes compounds two tablets in the morning and two tablets in the evening after food. Banana flower, it can be prepared as a fry, or vada or kashaya. It is a good food to stop excess bleeding.

As such for Lamotrigine following drug interactions need to be considered as important.

If you left it as it may lead to your infection, then you have to get it root canaled or extracted. You can use desensitizing toothpaste but this is temporary. You can also avoid it by not taking hot or cold or sweet food but all these are temporary provision. My opinion is to visit a dentist and get it filled as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My 2 year 9 months old daughter was tested and she has an egg white allergy. She ate scrambled eggs accidentally. Should I worry? Is it a problem if the egg is scrambled? Please, can you advise?","Doctor":"Hi. Do not worry. However, please watch for symptoms of allergy like hives and severe itching and in worst case scenario breathlessness. If breathlessness occurs, it is best to rush the child to the nearest hospital. The other symptoms are mostly controlled by syrup Allegra (3.5 ml) for two such doses spaced 12 hours apart. Steroids and Adrenaline may be required in the worst case scenarios."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been experiencing pain in my urethra while urinating for weeks now. Also, have mild pain in my left testicle. Today morning when I woke up at 6 AM, I observed a milk-like liquid drop at the tip of my penis. Is it a sign of any kind of STD?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern for your symptoms. Yes, infection should be ruled out. If you had unprotected sex with someone, then we can think of STD. If yes, give more details for investigation. If not, it can be other bacterial infection. Retrograde ejaculation can also cause this kind of discharge. Do a urine complete investigation for better understanding and treatment regime."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am an IV drug user, street-level Fentanyl and Carfentanyl specifically and I am getting big deep scabby like sores all over my arms where I am using IV. Now I am noticing electrical currents shocking my arms both at exactly the same time, especially when I take deeper breaths I have noticed.","Doctor":"Hello. I am really sorry to know that you are an IV drug user. I hope you will start quitting the drug, life is a beautiful gift, so do not throw it away like this. Get helped by family or friends or even by a specialist to be drug-free. You deserve a better life, but not like this. The problems with deep breathing electrical currents when injecting drug is due to drugs injected. Perhaps the dose was higher than normal or not injected inside the vein. Or injection speed was fast, in other words, is due to the drug injected. Plus, sores all over your arms are infected, need to keep well clean, wash with warm water and soap, rinse well, dry well. Then, apply alcoholic swab, plus Betadine on the sores followed by triple antibiotic ointment. If no improvement, you should consult further with your physician."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Mucus felt like super glue. I chalked it up to season change but it did not go away. So I went to my primary care doctor, they chalked it up to seasonal and could not see anything with the limited view of the tools they had other than irritation on the left side. I scheduled another appointment about a week later when the symptoms still had not gone away. I realized when I used a Q-Tip to clean my nose in that nostril that I would get blood (not a nosebleed). It was on the inside of the Q-Tip only so it was a specific area in the back of my nose. I was getting an aching pain on that side of my face. The doctor gave me Amox and Flonase, I took the Amoxicillin for five days and am still using the Flonase. The congestion has definitely improved, but I am still getting inconsistent blood when I touch that area, light aching that is inconsistent or when I cough that I can feel in the left sinus. Left nostril still feels sticky. I am 35 years old, I smoked off an on for about 6 to 7 years (have not touched a cigarette in about four years). I used oral tobacco for about 3 to 4 years (have not used in two years now) and I vaped for about two years (stopped about 14 days ago). There is no history of sinus or head cancer in my family other than my grandmother who had skin cancer on the flap of her right nostril. She was a lifetime smoker, it was removed. I am not experiencing any weight loss (the opposite actually), I am not fatigued, I am not getting headaches, my sense of smell and appetite is intact. I just want to know why I am having these symptoms. It does not really get cold here. Even when it has I have never had reactions to season change.","Doctor":"Hi. Do not worry at all. It does not look like cancer at all. All the symptoms you have seem to be for chronic sinusitis. The antibiotic you had is not bad but according to my opinion it is not enough to treat sinus infections in adults, so I recommend Medofloxine 750 mg once daily for 10 days. Medofloxine is a Fluoroquinolone. In case you cannot find it in your country you can use Moxifloxacin 400 mg for ten days which is a Fluoroquinolone too. Also, you need to add a mucolytic to liquify the mucus inside your sinus. Continue the Flonase. After 10 days of treatment if no improvement, you have to perform a CT scan for your nose and sinuses to see what is the shape of the pathology inside your sinus. As the infection can be fungal, not bacterial but fungal infection is rare although it is a far possibility."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to know a few things about the clitoris. 1.

Why people tend to misunderstand the most about it?","Doctor":"Hello. The clitoris is a substitute for the male organ in the female. It has some tissues similar to that of male organ but not that much active. It has receptors that can be stimulated by touch on having sex, especially at foreplay. During foreplay, these receptors when get stimulated can initiate local lubrication and prepare the vagina for better sex by having secretions locally. In a few women, the clitoris is too sensitive while in some it is less. But it is sensitive to touch, increase lubrication in the process of orgasm to have penetrative sex. Some women feel this process like masturbation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My 2 years old little girl is beating us the moment she wakes up.

Sometimes your child's needs remain unmet due to lack of understanding by the caregivers or due to lack of speech so they end up engaging in self-harm behaviors. 1. Do not pay attention to her actions by punishing her as this would reinforce the behavior. 2. Focus on the child's feeling. 3. Help your child in calming down. 4. In the daytime try to spend quality time with her engaging in games and other play that your daughter likes. 5. Consult a psychologist to help her learn self-soothing strategies and also the psychologist would facilitate you in dealing with this complex behavior."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, 1. What are some health issues that can crop up during the period? Please explain why this might occur, and if there is anything to prevent it? 2. What specific health issues might be more common during the period? How to keep healthier during this time of the month?","Doctor":"Hello. Usually, periods are associated with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, body pains, headaches, irritability, lack of concentration, mood swings, susceptibility to allergies, cold. All these symptoms are because of the hormonal changes. Yoga, lifestyle modifications, deep breathing exercises, plenty of oral fluids, fiber-rich diet, Multivitamin supplements will help you get relief from the symptoms. Avoid smoking, alcohol, caffeine intake, junk, and spicy foods."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Are nightshades vegetables harmful? Please comment on nightshade vegetables. Do they cause inflammation?

The side-effect documented is a personal account and no research has concluded any harmful effects of these vegetables."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can I drink coffee during pregnancy and why? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. It is safe to drink coffee when you are pregnant. Yes, but hold the refills. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends limiting your caffeine consumption to fewer than 200 milligrams (mg) per day. You can still enjoy a mug of coffee every now and then during your pregnancy. That is about two mugs of instant coffee or one mug of filter coffee. If caffeine intake is more than 200 mg per day, there are chances of low birth weight. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Why more mothers are choosing to exclusively pump their breast milk? How does it work for them? Kindly explain.","Doctor":"Hi. Mostly breast pumps are used by mothers who need to prepare for the child in advance due to their business. Most of the working ladies are using breast pumps to empty the breast in advance and to have milk as per need. Breast pump helps to maintain breast production by emptying breast if used properly. Emptying of breast even if the baby does not need at present but after some time helps to maintain milk production and also can be managed in hectic routine of working ladies. Some time sick babies are unable to suck, so in those timings, breast pump helps fully for mother to empty breast as engorged breast can give her symptoms as well. Babies taken care by maids can be well fed by breast milk even in a tough working schedule of the mother with the help of a breast pump."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I do not know what happened to my scalp. A transparent fluid releases from my scalp and because of this, my scalp becomes hard. I am unable to comb my hair. After scratching it feels like burning. Can this problem arise due to lice in the head? Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, this is happening due to excessive scratching of the scalp that is rupturing the membrane of the scalp, and thus a white discharge is coming out. Please do not scratch so much. Please wash your hair daily with some anti-lice shampoo or neem water. You may also use some anti-dandruff shampoo also that should be mild because scratching can happen due to dandruff also. Apply Aloe Vera gel on the scalp to give you a soothing effect and heal the injury naturally. You have to keep your scalp clean by washing your hair daily for a few days, and lice will diminish."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Both are on lower side. I am also taking Thyronorm 75 mg since last 7-8 years. I have attached my medical file of past health issues. After 7 PM, I feel very low and confused. My sex drive has also been affected. I am doing exercise for about 1 to 1.5 hours daily, and still I am gaining weight. I have also persisting heel pain. I am partially bald. 14 years ago TRT was done. The report and medication are attached. My doctor has prescribed Arachitol 6 lakhs units once a month for three months. Please suggest some medicine for my condition. I would also like to know whether the TRT is required again. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi. Well, for your low testosterone and low vitamin D you need to take supplements. For vitamin D, I recommend Cholecalciferol sachets or tablets 60000 units weekly once for three months. Also take Calcium supplements every night. For testosterone, you need to get Testosterone injections once in 15 days. But neither low vitamin D nor low testosterone can explain your forgetfulness or confusion. It needs further evaluation to know the cause of forgetfulness or confusion. In that regard, I recommend the following tests to you. Serum vitamin B12, serum sodium, and serum cortisol (8 AM and 4 PM). Regarding your inability to lose weight, you need to increase the intensity of your exercise and go on a low-calorie diet."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am planning to go for liposuction to lose weight. My weight is 78 kg and height is 5'3\\". Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Your calculated body mass index (BMI) is 30.4 kg/m2. Generally we perform bariatric surgery to achieve permanent weight loss for any patient whose BMI is 30 kg/m2 or above. Liposuction is not a treatment option for weight loss. It is a cosmetic procedure for body shaping. There is a set point for fat storage for everyone. This is not altered by liposuction. Weight loss by liposuction, diet control, exercise, naturopathy, amway, herbalife, etc., is temporary, as all these methods do not have any effect on set point for fat storage. So, any fat that is removed in liposuction will reaccumulate over a period of 6 months to two years. Those who can reduce weight by diet control and exercise does not need liposuction and those who cannot reduce weight by above methods will not reduce even after liposuction. Bariatric surgery provides permanent weight loss as it lowers set point for fat storage. If you are looking for permanent weight loss then bariatric surgery is the only scientifically proven method for that."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Over the past 3 months, my periods have become irregular. It was regular throughout my life. I faced spotting between periods and had been detected with a submucosal fibroid of 2 cm. For the past 3 months, I feel in the morning after passing bowels, that my bowel has not cleared. This feeling of incomplete evacuation of bowel remains till noon. I drink nearly 2 liters of water in the morning to noon. With more water, I feel bowel pressure, but do not need to pass it always. My usual bowel movement is one time a day and on some days it is twice.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand that your periods are irregular and you have a feeling of incomplete evacuation of bowel. This type of combination is seen in hypothyroidism. So you need to check your thyroid function after consulting a physician. These two problems can also be totally unrelated in that case you need to consult a gynecologist for periods problem. For bowel, you can take high-fiber diets, specifically diet rich in fruits and green leafy vegetables. Regular timing of food and a good healthy breakfast are also very important. If the problem persistents, you may need medication. Initially, medicated fibers like Isabgol also known as Ispaghula and others after consulting physician or gastroenterologist."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am just done with HIV-1 and HIV-2 test. Can you help me understand the report? Result is 0.03. Notes given regarding this test are this is a chemiluminescent enzyme (CLIA) for simultaneous qualitative detection of antibodies to HIV 1 and 2. A negative result does not exclude the possibility of exposure to or infection with HIV 1 and 2. A positive result is not a diagnosis of AIDS. Supplemental testing such as immunoblot should be done for confirmation. Specimens containing mouse monoclonal antibodies or heterophile antibodies can give falsely elevated or depressed values.","Doctor":"Hi. In CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Assessment) test result, a value greater than 1 is considered reactive (positive). Your result is 0.03, which is less than 1. Hence, it is non-reactive (negative). In HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus) testing, it is very important to know how long it has been since your suspected exposure to infection.It can take up to 3 months from the time of exposure, for the virus to be detected in blood. If it has been more than 3 months since your suspected exposure, your result confirms that you do not have HIV infection. In case it is less than 3 months since suspected exposure, I advise you to repeat the test after 3 months of exposure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had thrush a few weeks ago due to antibiotics. It subsided on taking cream and a pessary after which I stopped the cream in three to four days. After a few days, the thrush again appeared on my vagina (labia). Nurse in a walk said still there is thrush and advised to take Fluconazole and cream. So took one pill of Fluconazole and took cream for a week. However, the painful cuts are still there and itchy. I have got some pictures attached. Wiping hurts a lot because it is sensitive to the touch. I also have some similar cut near my butt hole.","Doctor":"Hello. These are definitely (attachment removed to protect patient identity) old thrush lesions which have become inflamed and red, due to possible frequent scratching following itching over the region. The scratching has possibly led to abrasions or knife-like cuts. They are likely to be painful and oozing increases if scratching continues. Instead of using Plan Canesten cream, use cream Canesten-s (which contains Clotrimazole 1 % with Beclomethasone 0.025 % w/v) and apply it overall knife cut lesions thrice a day for the next three days. Beclomethasone is a steroid which blocks the production of certain chemical messengers (prostaglandins) that make the skin red, swollen and itchy (often following scratching- vicious cycle). Clotrimazole is an antifungal which stops the growth of fungi on the surface by preventing them from forming their protective covering. Keep the local area as dry as possible throughout the day, especially post micturition, use soft cotton towels to dry (clean sheets regularly and use a fresh one each time as tissues can cause further abrasions. So do not wipe, just pat and dry). After that, you may apply an antifungal dusting powder (Canesten dusting powder) after application of the cream, over both vulval and peri-anal region which shall help local moisture in check and allow lesions to heal. Please wear loose cotton undergarments to avoid any further frictional injury."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My cousin, a newborn baby, was born four days before, male, 51 cm and 3.1 kg. He is crying, and we think that he cannot poop. He drinks breast milk. And every time he farts he cries and, we thought he has a hard time getting it out. I would also like to ask if he is allowed to drink water and if we can do mixed feeding (alternate drinking of breast milk and formula milk).","Doctor":"Hello. Please note that a child may cry either because he is hungry, has passed urine or stool, or wants to seek attention. Take note of the same. Other than that whatever you have described is normal and it persists till the age of six months. Hence do not worry. Giving water is not required as milk already contains water. However, giving boiled and cooled clean water is harmless. You can mix feeds and give. It is not an issue."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Due to masturbation, my penis has no sense in it. It is not erecting also even if sexual thought comes in my mind. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. Masturbation is usual. It does not cause physical or sexual problems. Also, do not give any importance to the advertisement that mentions masturbation cause health problems or destroys life, and it does not require any treatment. Masturbation is a maintenance procedure. It keeps the penis well and regular turnover of fresh semen or sperm. If you want to reduce it, you should involve yourself in studies, games, and hobbies. Also, try not to remain alone most of the time and avoid porn. Erection problem can be due to stress or anxiety or due to a physical cause. For the physical reason, you need to do blood tests Hb (hemoglobin), TC (total cell count), DC (differential cell count), fasting sugar, prolactin, TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone), testosterone. Please upload the reports. Depending on the results treatment can be decided."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Kindly tell me: 1. What are some foods that are great to eat when you are sick? 2. How can these foods boost your immune system or promote healing, etc.? 3. Is it important to eat a variety of foods when you are sick, or more important to stick to a few highly nutritious staples? 4. Is there anything else someone should know about choosing foods when they are sick?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. Yes, food is always important especially when you are sick. Because if you take proper food you will not require medicine. When you are sick you need to take food which should be easy to digest, healthy, maintain fluid and electrolytes balance and have various nutrients. Food items include soups, khichadi (porridge made up of rice and skinned splitmung gram), daliya (cracked wheat), oatmeal, fruits (may vary from condition to condition), coconut water, herbal tea, yogurt, and dairy products (may vary in some condition). As these foods are a source of nutrients and provide fluids and electrolytes so they help in healing from sickness and also improves immunity and provide us energy. You can shuffle food items but it is important to take nutritious food daily. Selection of food items varies from one problem to another like if a diabetic patient will get sick his food regimen will be different from a hypertensive patient or from an otherwise healthy person."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 34-year-old male. My right hip pains when moving the leg in specific positions (best explained in a few photos). Need help in identifying what muscle or tendons are affected so I can move forward with a correct stretching. I suspect a few problems but need an expert opinion. I do not feel any pain in my daily life, and I can play tennis or squash without feeling any pain, but the problem can worsen after exercise and yoga. I have a history of not stretching, and my body is relatively tight, especially hip flexors and leg muscles. I have no history of severe hip, leg or spine injuries. To my recollection, the problem first started a few years back while running down a staircase the pain disappeared after a few weeks. Symptoms began again a few months ago while doing yoga and other exercises. I had a bad habit of putting my right foot under my left thigh while sitting on my office chair (basically sitting on my foot). I do not feel any pain while doing this but could be a factor to my current problems.","Doctor":"Hello. Based on my clinical experience and the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), you are more than likely dealing with hypertonic muscles. Based on my views the top three muscles would be the TFL (tensor fasciae latae), glute medius, and piriformis. I commonly see these muscle tight in practice. To treat them, or to at least know if they might be an issue, I would recommend getting a lacrosse ball and stretching them out. You will find a sore spot and hold it for three to five seconds. Roll off and find a new place. Do this three to four times a day. I advise against using it based on the picture and clinical description of your problem. I would also recommend seeing a licensed provider for an actual physical examination for proper treatment and care.

Mother's cut off free beta hCG is greater than or equal to 1.98 PAPP-A.","Doctor":"Hello. 1 in 250 means that if we take 250 women of the same results as your wife had then only one will have a baby with Down syndrome. So this is the explanation of the calculated risk of down syndrome. Secondly, NT (nuchal translucency) and blood tests which she underwent are screening tests. Screening tests are not diagnostic. They only detect who is at risk. If they become positive, that does not mean that particular is at risk. It just says that specific condition may or may not be there which is then confirmed by diagnostic tests. In your case, CVS (chorionic villus sampling, taking a sample from the baby) will diagnose if the Down syndrome is there or not which you will be offered at 12 to 13 weeks most probably.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

She already had scaling done two times by a dentist. This has made her teeth loose and fall out. Please suggest some solution as another cleaning might harm her teeth even further.","Doctor":"Hello. This time get your mother's teeth cleaned by the dentist and then ask her to brush twice daily. Cleaning by the dentist does not make the teeth fall off, this is a pure myth. The teeth which are weakened by tartar gets damaged from inside so they feel like loose after cleaning and scaling. They fall out due to removing tartar that is supporting them. We must clean them after the dentist has done his work. Also, ask her to follow all instructions properly and place artificial teeth in the place of missing teeth as soon as possible else she might lose other teeth too. I wish you good health and happiness. Keep me updated with the improvements."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My nephew is 3 and a half years old.

He has got his nasal septal cartilage fractured and due to that there is misalignment of the septum.  You need to consult an otorhinolaryngologist for evaluation or you may also go for plastic and reconstructive cosmetic surgeon for better results. It is not like going under the knife. It is very sophisticated procedure and is done with an endoscope and is very successfully done in a matter of minutes with minimum cut and patient can come home after 40 minutes of surgery."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been suffering from acne since one month, mainly it is cystic acne. I have always had this issue on and off, but this time it is painful and new acne keeps coming. The scar too takes long time to go. I have been using the over-the-counter Benzoyl peroxide face wash, Benzoyl peroxide 10%, and Tretinoin 0.025%, for the past 3 weeks. Doctor suggested me to take Aldactone oral medicine. Can the acne get treated with topical medicine or oral medicine or both? Also, please let me know the medicines.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your history and seen the attached photographs (attachments removed to protect patient identity). According to me, you need both oral as well as topical medication to treat acne. Continue with the face wash but Benzoyl peroxide 10 percent is too strong for the face. Instead use Benzoyl peroxide 2.5 percent gel on the pimples in the morning and Adapalene gel on the pimples at night. Along with this take a course of Azithromycin 500 mg daily on 3 consecutive days in a week for at least 4-6 weeks. This is the mildest oral drug used in acne treatment and hope it works in your case. I do not know whether these drugs will be available over-the-counter in your country. Besides this keep your face dry, avoid applying cream or moisturizer, avoid oiling of the scalp and reduce the intake of sugary foods. You can continue this treatment for six weeks and then revert back to me. Wish you speedy recovery. 1. Seborrhea. 2. Hormonal imbalance. Acne vulgaris."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, What are the causes of pain in the first metatarsal that radiate to the entire forefoot?","Doctor":"Hi.

I could not see the fibroid in the cervix in this report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It says fibroid in anterior uterine wall and size is very small. I do not see any of the above-mentioned reasons to go for a C-section as none of them is an indication to opt straight for operation without giving a trial of labor. Age is not at all a factor to consider for a C-section straightaway neither low HB. As the operation will result in even higher bleeding as compared to normal delivery. I feel vaginal delivery would be a safer option too if everything remains fine."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Having severe pain in rightside back lower body with rashes.

With difficulty, I manage in 10 minutes. Do this fornightly to clean the penis. I wish to avoid circumcision and understand the application of Lignocaine gel will help. Should I apply it on penis gland or head or on top of the foreskin?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern about your symptoms. The application is a local anesthetic. Wherever you have pain when you retract foreskin (mostly skin will have pain). You can apply Lignocaine. You cannot apply Lignocaine inside of your foreskin since you have phimosis. So the external application is only possible. Considering your age, kindly rule our other causes of phimosis.

I have attached photo for your reference. What is the best treatment?","Doctor":"Hi. It is a first degree burn as you can see the eroded skin (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Systemic antibiotic is needed along with topical and daily dressing. Stop Bacitracin, as it can cause sensitization in many individuals. Continue Silver sulfadiazine thrice daily. Daily dressing and cleaning with Betadine lotion is a must. Following injections should be taken: Drink at least 5 liters of water daily, otherwise you may need injectable fluid also. Take healthy proteinaceous diet and drink lot of coconut water as it contains minerals."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Throat or esophagus is making a funny noise off and on for years sporadically. Diagnosed with Gerd and Larapharyngeal reflex. Clean endoscopy in 2 years back but esophagus is slightly twisted. Had dilation during procedure. Other endoscopies were fine. Is this classic signs of GERD? Saw ENT recently for other issues, throat looked good. Just never had the gurgling as much. Taking Gas x and Protonix and tums here and there. Also deal with allergies and post nasal drip. No vomiting or fever. Just uncomfortable.","Doctor":"Hello. Most of the symptoms such as burping, gurgling within esophagus and funny noise all can be encompassed in to one diagnosis, that is, GERD. But thing which make concerned, are-you have 3 endoscopies and all showling normal without signs of ulceration which is not usually a case in GERD patient unless they are on maximal acid suppressant medications and symptom free at the time of undergoing endoscopy. So endoscopy result has to be correlated with the timings and weather use of acid suppressant medication before making a diagnosis. Given some more interesting findings like dilated esophagus, and no ulceration at the time of endoscopy, with presence of persistent symptoms, suggest some other additional problem bystanding with GERD- such as motility disorder. Some time GERD is just a menifestation of motility disorders, because two disorders almost cause similar symptoms. Secondly for GERD, one must have PH-imepdence monitoring to confirm the diagnosis. And in case you have already gone through this, then you come in category of refractory GERD not responding to usual acid suppressant medications. For refractory GERD, the only single test that can confirm symptoms correlation index,-acid reflux causing the symptoms or non acid reflux causing symptoms, or no acid reflux at all; is PH-impedence test while person on acid suppressant medications. I can understand it must be very exhaustive and confusing for you to understand above things, but it can be very easy while investigation all these possibilities. I urge you to upload your previous reports and keep in touch with me, as I can suggest you how it is further be approached.

If you are having heavy bleeding then probably your abortion was not complete. You should immediately get an ultrasound scan to see if the uterus is empty or not.

Please tell us what all would be the consequences.","Doctor":"Hi. Welcome to icliniq.com. It was emergency surgery done to relieve the blockage, complete surgery will be done after chemotherapy because chemotherapy will further shrink the tumor and will make the surgery more feasible.

It is usually associated with other symptoms like severe headache, dizziness, etc. So, I definitely do not think that you have this syndrome. As you do not have any other symptoms, there is no reason to worry about. In my opinion, it could be a normal face asymmetry. If you have double vision, especially at the end of the day, or if the ptosis is more visible at the end of the day compared to the morning, I would recommend performing nerve conduction studies in order to investigate for myasthenia gravis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My wife is 38 weeks pregnant and in the 19th week, the doctor recommended for cervical cerclage and that was done at that time.

Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I received some routine blood work (annual physical) and my results came in today. I noticed something that made my heart sank. HSV 1/ 2(IGG) type-spec AB tested positive with a reading of 33.10 H. What does this mean? Am I extremely contagious? I have never had a cold sore, nor do I now, and I have no symptoms.","Doctor":"Hello. 1. In general population, around 50 to 75 % have HSV antibodies in the blood which they might have acquired at some time in the past life due to clinical or subclinical herpes infection. 2. If you do not have any active lesions you do not require any active treatment and neither are you extremely contagious, just as much as those 75 % others. Nothing to worry if only tests are raised and no ulcer or vesicles."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been experiencing what my mother says is a panic attack, but I am not sure because I only get racing thoughts, my heart races or beats really hard, and I feel shaky like I might cry (no other symptoms). I read that panic attacks peak at 10 minutes, but I feel this way for hours and it keeps me up at night. I have no previous problems with mental health, and I think it is only a fear of the dark keeping me up. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Your mother is probably right. You are describing anxiety and panic symptoms. Staying at a noisy Air BNB has probably accentuated your fears. How long have you been having these symptoms? If you are not having any problems during the day and no problems during other situations, then it possibly is just a fearful psychological reaction to an unfamiliar situation. If it is persistent and pervasive, it will be helpful to see your doctor for an assessment. Try these simple measures to manage your fear: 1. Breathing techniques. 2. Progressive muscle relaxation exercises. 3. Keep a light switched on in your room during sleep. Perhaps having some music at low volume can help. 4. Speak to your mother, friend regularly, if possible, you can share your room with a friend to make it less fearful. Remember that these fearful thoughts get better gradually with support. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 20-year-old female and I weigh 122. I understand that I have anxiety and that I have GERD acid reflux, so I am used to the throat feeling.

I am afraid to choke on my food and I have not taken food all day.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome back to icliniq.com. The condition of food getting stuck in the throat with a heaviness of chest are also symptoms of GERD. Hence, along with medication, I need you to change food pattern. 1. Reduce oil and cheese products. 2. Drink 4 liters of water per day. 3. Do not skip meals in a day. 4. Omeprazole is not a powerful antacid. Hence, I suggest you take a higher one."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My skin on my legs feels dry after washing. I need to apply lotion immediately after I wash. However, after about an hour the skin feels tight and dry again. Is this dry or dehydrated skin? I am using Aveeno, could this be causing it? In the forearm, back of neck and underarms I have the same problem. They hurt at times. I am afraid that my skin or skin barrier is damaged. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read about your query. Dryness of the skin depends on the type of the skin individually. Since you are on moisturizer Aveeno, you can continue it with the following tips. Apply a moisturizer within three minutes of your bath because some amount of hydration should be present on the skin for the moisturizer to act fully.If you want to apply over noon and evenings, take some amount of lotion and add a few drops of water, mix and apply it. Please check that the moisturizer has humectants or not. If humectants are present, change the moisturizer with only an emollient content. Because, humectants will act only in humid climates and not in dry climates as it will draw water from the body itself in dry climates and make the skin more dry. 1. Thyroid profile. 2. Fasting blood Sugar. 1. Moisturizer. 2. If cracks and pain are present a mild steroid like Desonide can be mixed with the moisturizer and applied twice daily for two weeks."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 33 years old male.

I have attached my lipid profile report please refer. Should I start medication or lifestyle change will help? Also please let me know the side effects of medicine. Is my report bad?","Doctor":"Hi. You have deranged lipid profile (attachment removed to protect patient identity). With such high level of LDL (Low density lipoprotein) treatment with drugs is necessary. I would suggest you to get fasting blood sugar, thyroid profile and ECG done. You should start on statins like Atorvastatin or Rosuvastatin. Lifestyle changes are necessary along with this, as medicine can be later discontinued and lifestyle changes can be adapted for natural control of cholesterol. I would advise you to: Get your lipid profile repeated after a month and get back with reports. This is my best opinion for you. You should discuss with your doctor before acting upon any advise.

Recently I have been doing yoga and doing intermittent fasting for the past 2 months. Now I got my period twice in April and for may month it is spotting for the last 2 days. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Treatment of women with PCOS should begin with lifestyle measures. For those who are obese, a combination of weight loss and exercise may stimulate ovulation. Intermittent fasting is wonderful lifestyle. What is your mode of intermittent fasting. Are you doing 16/8 or fast and feast? Have you tried 36 hours fasting? Please let me know. Also, low carbohydrates diet with no sugary juices and no added sugar is very beneficial. If the woman is not overweight or weight loss is ineffective then: taking into account potential adverse effects, ease and mode of use, the woman's BMI, and monitoring needed, Clomifene citrate or Metformin or a combination of the above. For women who are taking Clomifene citrate, I offer ultrasound monitoring during at least the first cycle of treatment to ensure that they are taking a dose that minimises the risk of multiple pregnancy. Women prescribed Metformin may know side effects such as nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal disturbances. If woman known to be resistant to Clomifene citrate, we can go for laparoscopic ovarian drilling or combined treatment with Clomifene citrate and Metformin if not already offered as first-line treatment or Gonadotrophins. So, there are plenty of options available and you are not alone we can together make a plan for management. Please give me more details if you have done investigations ultrasound and Harmone tests."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, 27 days ago I had protected sex with a girl, whom I knew only for 5 days and it was the first time. Also, we had oral sex also. During oral sex, I had no protection. Next day I started having pain on my testicles and my stomach. I was feeling weak the whole time, and after a week I gave urine and semen for culture. The urine culture was clean, and the semen culture with bacterium E. coli has been detected. It is worth mentioning that I am suffering from prostatitis and I have been diagnosed and treated for more than 3 years with almost the same bacterium, which I thought has been eliminated. Also on that day, we had sex 3 times within 5 hours and I am thinking whether the intensity of that might have brought back the E. coli or it was still there and it appears now. I do not know therefore this is my first question. Since the oral sex was not protected, can it be that she passed me the E. coli? Or is it due to my prostatitis? After my semen results, the doctor asked me to take Tavanic 500 mg once per day for one month. I am now on the first week, the pain is still there but comparatively less. I still feel pressure on the lower part of my stomach and also since the last 3 weeks I feel my stomach always full and not so comfortable. Can this be a side effect of the E. coli or something else? I had no fever since then, and I did not lose my appetite, but I am feeling full. Apart from the E. coli that I need to finish my treatment, now I do have a fear whether I have been infected with any other STDs. If yes, the semen and urine culture should have normally shown something abnormal. Also, I have a fear if because of the oral sex, I might have been infected with HIV, could this be possible? Should I do an HIV test? If yes which kind of HIV test can give me a fast indication. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. Frequency of sex has nothing to do with E. coli bacteria (Escherichia coli). Prostatitis is very resistant to treat, so it is not necessary that if you have taken treatment, it will not recur. Sometimes, you have to take 4 to 6 months of treatment for prostatitis. This is the main reason why you are still having the pain. Semen and culture usually do not cover all STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) and lower abdominal pain is a non-specific symptom and can be attributed to prostatitis. Yes, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) can be transmitted through oral sex. So if you know the person, it is better to get her tested because if she is not HIV positive, then you need no testing. Nevertheless, you can go for HIV 1 and 2 antibody test by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) method and HIV RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). I hope the above information is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My head feels heavy for the past three months, and I am having neck stiffness as well. I have consulted an orthopedist who gave me Stemetil MD, but was of no use. I consulted a neurologist and had Sibelium, Myoril, etc., but still the problem is not cured. In certain positions, I feel my head is spinning. Can it be due to loss of inner ear balance?","Doctor":"Hi. Sensation of spinningor dizziness is usually due to improper functioning of balance system. It includes your inner ear, cerebellum (part of brain), peripheral sensory system and eyes. All must work together and synchronize with each other to maintain balance. Problem in any one of the system, will make you feel dizzy. In your case, for neck pain stress may be the cause. However, you need to provide with detail history to make diagnosis. When did this problem start? How was first episode begun? And how long it lasted?"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am 51 years being treated for coronary ectasia and hypertension. I am taking the following medicines now.

It seems that some pollen is annoying and she rubs her eyes to remove it. She washes with water and uses rose water and Ciprofloxacin eye drops in her eyes. But she is not getting relief. Now her eyes have sticking tendency. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. Pollen has a notorious tendency to cause allergic conjunctivitis. The predominant symptom in allergic conjunctivitis is eye rubbing. When the patients rub their eyes, whatever dust or germs are there on their fingers go into their eyes. Thus setting up an infection. Such infection needs to be treated by a qualified ophthalmologist. In the meantime, please follow these instructions: 1. Continue Ciprofloxacin eye drops six times a day. 2. Wash the sticky discharge with clean running water. 3. Use tissues to wipe the spill rather than your handkerchief as you tend to rub the same infection again onto your eye with a scarf. 4. Avoid eye rubbing. I hope you get well soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My sister had her aortic valve (tissue) replaced last week. The operations were uneventful, though she has been suffering from nausea and weakness. Each time she is given Beta-blockers to prevent atrial fibrillation. Before the operation, her heart rate was 100 beats per minute, which attributed to the stenosis. After the surgery, her heart rate has remained around 100 without Beta-blockers. The hospital staff has now reduced the Beta-blocker dosage from 10 to 2.5 mg, yet she still feels very weak. With Beta- blockers, her heart rate has descended to 86, but she feels terrible. My question is, If she feels fine without the Beta-blockers, could it be safe for her to discontinue using Beta-blockers to avoid the weakness or nausea? Or would this be a bad decision?","Doctor":"Hello. I passed carefully through your concern and would like to explain that several components may maintain the patient heart rate at those levels (like pain due to surgery, local inflammation, potential fever, transient respiratory decreased capacity, relative anemia, relative hypovolemia, body immobility, psychological conditions, etc.). The causes mentioned above may at least partially contribute to her weakness and nausea, Beta-blockers may further deteriorate this clinical condition, especially in the case of relative hypotension and decreased overall cardiac performance. I would recommend monitoring her blood pressure values before taking her medications, and if the symptoms persist in withdrawing her Beta-blocker from therapy gradually. It is necessary to taper her daily Beta-blocker dose progressively to avoid the rebound effect of stopping Beta-blocker cold turkey. In such a case, the high heart rate would reappear again. So, discuss with her attending cardiologist to gradually stop the Beta-blocker by reducing the daily dose step by step. I hope to have been helpful to you. In case of any further questions, feel free to ask me again."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

There is nothing to worry as having sex for the first time (even fingering) may lead to mild bleeding due to breakage of the hymen and vaginal tissue. It may lead to burning sensation and slight discomfort which usually resolve in a few hours or may take a day or so.

If she does not use spectacles will there be any problem in future?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concerns. This power of 1.5 cylinders although relatively small, needs to be adequately corrected. You see, each part of our body is dependent on our users for its development. The part we use the most tends to develop more, and the area we do not use tends to under develop. The same situation is with our eyes, suppose during our developmental stages between 0 to 12 years, if there is a disease which causes us not to see far away objects, our brain, and optic nerves adapt to this and never develop the ability to see far away objects as clearly as ordinary people do. In spite of our best efforts at a later stage, she may never be able to improve. So please make sure that she always keeps her glasses on, apart from of course while sleeping. Also regularly follow up with your ophthalmologist (at least once a year). As she grows up, there are numerous ways she can avoid wearing glasses starting from contact lenses to refractive surgery. But for now, Please instruct her to keep her glasses on continuously. I hope this clarifies your doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Everytime I have sex I get a vaginal tear. I did not have sex or wear a tampon for 10 weeks to let it heal. I had sex again last night and it tore again. I do not have an issue with lubrication, so I am not sure what to do.","Doctor":"Hello. Vaginal tears after sex are mainly dependent on several causes like vaginal dryness, chronic skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis or lichen planus, etc., and sometimes it may also be caused by the use of recreational medicine like Viagara by the partner. Vaginal tears could be superficial and deep. Superficial tears usually result after having sex and they usually heal by themselves in few hours to 1 to 2 days and then usually do not bleed heavily. Deeper cuts usually occur during childbirth.  As you mentioned that it took 10 days to heal your previous tear then it sounds alarming. Was there any heavy bleeding or pus coming through it? And how long have you been facing this problem? Can I have a look at any picture of tear? I would suggest you that if you do not have any issues with lubrication (which is the most common cause of vaginal tear during sex) then you must get yourself assessed by the local doctor and get tear examined to determine the actual cause and appropriate treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 48 years old. A few months ago my ear was full of fluid, ringing, and infected. I took antibiotics which cleared up the infection. The fluid is gone, however, my ears still ring. Three weeks ago, I saw an ENT. He said that cells which had collected around the eardrum were impeding my hearing and causing the ringing. He said this collection would fall off and we did not need to do anything. If I wanted to speed up the process to use some mineral oil. 1. How long should I leave the mineral oil in my ear? 2. Could you explain a little more about what this collection of cells is called and the healing process from this?","Doctor":"Hello. Whatever mineral oil or any oil you instill, will only act outside the eardrum. The cells that are outside the eardrum form cerumen or wax and these oils will be helpful. I can give you the dose and duration for that. But however, if there was fluid inside the ear, now resolved, the ringing should be due to that. The fluid we are talking about is the one inside the drum. In a scenario where the drum is intact, these oils are of no use to remove the cells which have got clumped inside the drum. Did the ENT do any test to confirm the presence of fluid inside the ear? Did he do an audiogram or a tympanogram?

Once the pain level drops between 5 to 6 in the VAS pain scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is maximum pain, then you can begin neck strengthening exercises which will help stabilize the cervical spine.

It is only noticeable when I close my left eye, and so I am not sure how long it has taken for this to develop.

My main question is that when I look out of the corner of my right eye the blurriness seems to subside and I can see usually. I am wondering if this is a good sign. I have been dealing with severe anxiety the past couple months, and I am worried that might have raised my blood pressure enough to hurt my eyesight. Eyesight when looking with both eyes seems to be normal. I have also noticed floaters in my eyes. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. This kind of a picture of eyesight becoming better on looking at specific directions are related to astigmatism. It is a very prevalent and correctable condition. There is no need to be anxious about it. Different reasons cause floaters. A dilated retinal examination will be able to help us get to the cause. Most of the conditions causing floaters are benign (not severe), but a few are dangerous, but all are treatable. So, I recommend that you visit your optometrist and in case you need any further information or help with refractive surgery, please schedule a consultation. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I suffered from loose motions due to navel displacement. My period date is the 10th of this month. My last menstrual period was the 14th of last month. My husband and I are planning for a baby. I am suffering from abdominal bloating, fatigue, constipation, and acidity. Can I conceive even after knowing about my naval displacement?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all please make it clear that there is nothing like navel dislocation, or displacement exist in this world neither it is a medical problem or terminology. You might be suffering from loose motions because of any intestinal (small or large bowel) infections. So your first problem has been ruled out as you do not have any navel displacement. Secondly, as you said you are due date is 10th of this month, so this is the last week of your cycle. So there is no use of trying for pregnancy at this time as you are about to start periods soon. My advice would be to start working for pregnancy right after your period ends until the next ten days (8 to 18 days of cycle) on every alternate day to improve chances of pregnancy.

For a minor infection, both of these options seem rather extreme for me, and I am wondering if there is a way to eliminate the disease naturally. I can find different online suggestions for probiotics and boric acid suppositories. I am expecting if there is a plan you can recommend. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a general issue in women. It does not cause any serious problem, but it is irritating with abnormal vaginal discharges, itching, and odor. If you do not get treated in an early stage, then infections may spread to the uterus, fallopian tube, and ovaries which leads to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disorders or other complications. It may be associated with yeast or fungal infections. It can be managed naturally through Ayurvedic medicines and Yoga practices. Infection, unprotected and unhygienic intercourse, unhygienic undergarments and irregular cleaning of the vaginal area. Vaginal swab test and CBC (complete blood count). Internal hygiene is very important along with medications in such kind of issues. Wash your vaginal area regularly with Triphala Kwatha twice a day. Allow it to dry apply Himalaya Vgel and take the following oral medicines with the consent of your doctor. 1. Tablet Purim 1 tablet + Tablet Lukal 1 tablet + Tablet Gandhaka Rasayana 1 tablet thrice a day with warm water after meals. 2. M2 tone syrup 10 ml twice a day before food. Avoid spicy and fried junk foods. Maintain your internal hygiene. Use properly cleaned undergarments. Do these things and provide your valuable feedback after 15 days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 24 years old. I do not know what is wrong with me. I feel depressed all the time. I left home two years back because of my parent's behavior. They always use to make me feel I am worthless and not important for them, they also beat me several times and I was facing emotional trauma on a daily basis. Now I stay away from family alone but seems like things will never change. I am all alone here and people I trusted have backfired on me. My office situation is very pathetic my manager harasses me emotionally or I do not know if I overreact. I just do not know what is wrong? I do not have any friends to talk. I gave a lot of importance to one person in my life and that person did not understand me at all. I cry all day in my room and do not even step outside. I get super angry or emotional on little things. I always stay alone in the office or at home. I feel like there is nothing left for me in this life and I am worthless no one really needs me in there life. For whom am I alive. I do not know if I am depressed or not? I am just done with this life. (Just to add I am a PCOS patient for the past one year).","Doctor":"Hi. The symptoms you have mentioned are symptoms of depression. You left home because of the behavior of your parents and then you are continuously feeling low because of ongoing things at office and at personal space. All these things are aggravating the depression in you. The feeling of worthlessness, emotional trauma, crying spells, emotional lability, anger outbursts, lack of interest in anything, etc are part of depression. But if these symptoms are persistent and are hampering your personal life and you have negative thoughts then yes, we can think that you have a depressive disorder. If the symptoms are not persistent then no need to get worried. You just have to change your lifestyle, try to not to expect anything from others. Just focus on your life and your things. If anyone hurts you then try to ignore the thoughts. This is difficult but in some days you will learn to suppress the thoughts and with the time you will be able to ignore any emotional trauma. No need to get worried. If you are not able to function properly then you can visit a psychiatrist in person and antidepressants can be started. Escitalopram is a good option in your case. The drug is safe and has great efficacy. This will help to make your mood better. Do you have any thoughts like killing or harming yourself? Any ongoing stress that is bothering you? Any relationship issue? PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) too is an independent factor that aggravated depression because of hormonal changes. Control of PCOS also helps in improving mood symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I normally clean my ears with peroxide. After I added drops of peroxide back last month, I noticed that when people spoke to me loudly I would hear wind sound in my ears. Also, my ears felt plugged and I heard thumping (heartbeat sound) in my ear. Two days ago, I attempted to clean my ear with a home irrigation system. I was able to dislodge a large piece of dried, white wax. My ear felt the best in a long time. I was hearing clearly and the sounds in my ear went away. Yesterday, my ear felt plugged again. So I irrigated my ear and nothing came out. But the plugged feeling and sound went away. This morning my ear felt plugged again, and I irrigated my ear and nothing came out. But my ear felt clear and the plugged feeling and sound went away. What is causing this issue? Why does it keep coming back?","Doctor":"Hi. It looks like your having a eustachian tube catarrh. This tube essentially ventilates both the ear and nose and in an event where this tube has got blocked, you might develop fullness and ringing sensation in the same ear. Self-cleaning your ear is the most dangerous thing you can ever do. Never introduce peroxide or any thing under doctor's advice as it can be disastrous considering the ear and it is related structures to be one the most sensitive regions in the body. Another possibility is that there could be some remnant wax in your ear which can be the reason for you developing this ringing sensation on a regular basis. You can consider using Soliwax ear drops three times a day for one week and then get the blob suctioned out by an ent specialist. Other than this, take tablet Sinarest (Acetaminophen, Chlorpheniramine, and pseudoephedrine) or its equivalent one tablet two times a day after food for the next 1 week. Otrivin nasal drops thrice daily for five days should help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am seeking insight from a psychological professional on how awards affect us. Why we give them? Why we deny them to others? And what impact it causes to the one who is receiving them or not has on one's career? Please explain both from the recipient or non-recipient perspective and from an employer mindset.","Doctor":"Hello. The topic of effects of awards is complex. The awards act as positive reinforcement to any individual and thus the probability of repetition of behavior increases. If we consider it from a psychological point, then if an individual is given award then it acts as an operant conditioner and the individual tends to seek another award. All this increase the probability of repetition of desired behavior. If an individual is showing desired behavior but is not given reward then with time the occurrence of desired behavior decreases. So, reward acts as a method to get positive results, if we consider it in a company or in an organization. If we consider it on the basis of a physiological point of view, then reward stimulates corticolimbic pathways. This cause release of Dopamine which helps in the feeling of pleasure. This pleasure results in repetition of behavior and increased work efficiency."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had vaginal sexual intercourse two weeks ago.

Do you have a history of recurrent oral or genital painful vesicles or ulcers? C. If yes, how many episodes and how frequently do you have those episodes?

Is it fine for after cardio and will this diet cause my liver to swell?","Doctor":"Hi. You finished typhoid fever medicine course, but you see typhoid fever otherwise called enteric fever, so the main infection pathology is in our intestine wall gland.

I understand your concern and have seen your photo attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I feel that you may be suffering from a chalazion than a stye, given that the swelling has been there for a year. Chalazia (plural of chalazion), are painless and stony hard in consistency. They usually do not disappear with warm compresses and need surgery to treat. Most GPs have the equipment to drain such swelling, but it is always best to inquire before setting up an appointment. I suggest that you continue giving warm compresses and see your GP or an ophthalmologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I went to the doctors with four bouts of chest pain. Lasted under a minute each time. The pain went into the left arm. The doctor ordered ECG. No breathlessness, unless exercising. Can you please review and provide feedback on a recent ECG?","Doctor":"Hi. Significant findings in ECG are: 1. Early repolarization in V5 and V6. This is a normal finding at your age. 2. Deep S wave in lead V3. This can suggest left ventricular hypertrophy (by Cornell voltage criteria). However, there are no other changes in ECG to suggest LVH and deep S wave can sometimes be seen normally in young people.

I would like to know her age, other medical conditions, and present medicines. Fainting needs to be evaluated as it can recur and cause serious problems. If she is still feeling unwell, or having giddiness (a tendency to fall), or lost consciousness, you should get her to the emergency room. In the emergency room, they will be able to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and basic blood tests. If you are back to normal, then you can meet your primary care physician in the clinic at the earliest.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Treating the underlying cause helps in mitigating (making less severe) these symptoms. Allergic rhinitis or rhinosinusitis can be difficult to treat.

Despite everything, I have a degree, full-time job and home of my own. I have done really well last few years too after CBT. I have stayed well and even been promoted at work. This year I have gone off track gradually more and more though. What started as stress over work demands, turned into extreme anxiety with disabling effects. Then we found that my mother is suffering from cancer after five years of my dad's death. I had a breakdown but did not tell my family how I had been all this while. I recovered and returned to work, but I have sunk into a deep depression now. I am unable to eat. I do not want to go out or even dress. I stay in bed when I can. The last couple of weeks, I have had strong urges to harm and even kill myself. I am also so agitated at times. My thoughts go on to overdrive. I have been home this week but have to go back to work tomorrow and stress are high there. I am somehow dealing with it. I have been given some tranquilizers on top of my antidepressants, and these have helped quite a bit, but they make me sedated so not good when I am working. I feel so alone too as I cannot tell anyone this stuff. I have also been bloodletting with needles directly into a vein. It relieves pain and suicidal ideas. What can I do? My past psychiatrist has been alerted and wanted me to go to the hospital. I refused, and fortunately, he said he could not force me at present, but that could change.

He always used to get a cough and sometimes fever in an interval of every two to three months, especially since last one year. However, there is no other visible physical or mental problem because of his preterm birth. Recently doctor has diagnosed, based on his stethoscope examination and repeated illness, mild intermittent asthma. However, we do not have any family history of asthma. His last 6 months illness history and medication are attached here. Kindly go through it and reply to my queries. Based on the symptoms and background, can it be confirmed that my son is suffering from asthma? If it is asthma, is it the right course of medication in the initial stage? Do we need any other test for reconfirmation and start with essential medicines? Is it permanently curable? What are the dietary do and do not for asthmatic patients? Is there any other better means of treatment in ayurveda or homeopathy for complete treatment? Earlier he was advised 1 mL of Kidrich D3 (multivitamin) for 3 months. Can we continue this along with present medicines? What about routine vaccinations like polio drop, etc? Thanks and regards for your valuable advice.","Doctor":"Hi. Though your son is premature, it does not matter with the present illness. Let me first clear you that he is suffering from bronchial asthma. And anyone can have asthma without any family history. So, it is not necessary to be always run in families. To confirm the diagnosis we do spirometry test in children over 6 years of age. But as your son is too young, he will not be able to perform the spirometry. So, we have to make diagnosis on clinical basis. There is no other way to confirm. Now, we have made a firm diagnosis of asthma.Regarding the treatment, nebulization medications are only to be used in emergency. Also, it is not advisable to use steroids syrup on long-term basis. The best treatment for asthma to your son is using inhaler medicines with spacer. You start him on Budecort inhaler (Budesonide) 100 two puffs twice daily with Zerostat VT spacer. Both medicines are from Cipla company. Ask him to gargle after each use of inhaler. Multivitamin and cough syrup can be used as required. But stop Syrup Omnacortil (Prednisolone) by tapering the dose. Use Asthalin nebulizer (Salbutamol) when required in emergency only and not daily. You can give him his vaccines even polio drops while on inhaler treatment. There is no problem in it. Last thing to clear you is that asthma is a life-long disease. We can only control the symptoms of asthma by taking inhaler medicines. It is an incurable disease. In many children, asthma disappears as they grow, in many it remains the same and in some cases it gets worse with increasing age.At this step, no one can predict what will happen to his asthma ahead. So for time being, we must continue with the inhaler medicines.I have tried to give you overall idea about asthma as much possible after carefully reading the history. Please get back if you have any doubts. Allergy to anything. 1. Inhaler medicines like Budecort 100 MDI (metered dose inhaler) 2 puffs twice daily with Zerostat-VT Spacer. 2. Asthalin MDI to be used as required. Avoid dusts, cold liquids or ice creams."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I heard that in nephrotic syndrome the filtering unit of kidney becomes larger and so protein comes in urine.

I also heard that kidney biopsy is done for nephrotic syndrome. But no doctor advised me for biopsy. Do I have minimal change disease?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, you have heard the things right. Due to increased pore there is protein in urine. The best treatment remains the Cortisone. In cases where there is no response to Cortisone as evidenced by persistence of albumin in urine, we need to shift those patients on Cyclophosphamide and Azathioprine.

I am obsessed with checking for signs that I will go into labor early. I am currently 24 weeks pregnant.

These are not working and now I have blood flecks in mucus when I blow nose first thing on waking. This morning, blood streaks are also in the scum from throat which feels raw.","Doctor":"Hi.

I also had sex without a condom after the incident and I wanted to know if I am still protected and will I continue to be protected?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your concern. If you have been on a pill for more than a month and this is your second pack, you have nothing to worry if you just missed out one pill. Since most probably you have vomited out the pill, you can take another pill for today and then continue as once a day every day. You do not have to take a double pill. You will continue to be protected and just continue with the pack. The problem will only arise if you have not been consistently taking it, if you just missed it today because of the vomiting, it will not be too significant.

So, I have taken HIV tridot test two months back and fourth generation test last month and again tridot test this month. All are negative. So should I need to test again or these are enough? What is the window period for HIV fourth generation test? What is the window period for HIV tridot test?","Doctor":"Hello. I will try to solve your query so that all your doubts are cleared. First, to get infected with HIV first your partner needs to be HIV positive. The chances of your partner being HIV positive depends on the type of partner. If your partner is a commercial sex worker the chances are increased as compared to others. Secondly, the use of any protection. If you are using condom definitely chances are lower. Thirdly, if there is a contact of your blood or fluid with the partners fluid. This means if you have any injuries prior or during sex and your blood get mixed with partners blood, there are higher chances. Lastly, even when all the previous points get fulfilled there my be a chance that you might not get infected. So by your explanation, you are at a lesser risk. Coming to your last queries. Tridot test has a window period of three months, that is, it gives HIV status of three months from present and not recent three months and fourth generation test has a window period of four weeks. So going by the chronology of events you are quite safe. I hope it solves your queries and I hope you become a little relaxed now. If you still have doubt I am always there to help you.

But, rest assured that such things are quite common and corneal abrasions usually heal in about five to seven days without any further harm. I suggest that you continue with the Erythromycin ointment and make sure that your son does not go out in sunny, windy or dusty environments. If necessary dark goggles can be worn temporarily for extra protection. I recommend that you see an Ophthalmologist in case of the following: 1.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

Birth control pills with estrogen are an established cause of such a condition. In pseudotumor, all investigations are normal, just like in your case. Hence it is called as \\"pseudo\\" tumor. The next important step is to meet with your obstetrician and change the type of birth control pills you are on. Your ophthalmologist or physician may start you on oral medications to reduce the swelling of your optic nerves.

I am a 35-year-old female who has severe health anxiety and panic disorder with agoraphobia. I have been doing good until this past month. Then, I got sick and had a fever.

For example, when I am up around the house cleaning, it can hit 130. When I am walking into someplace I have anxiety it can get up to 140. And I feel it. Then I get more scared. I want to start walking with my mom. But I feel scared because it may increase my heart rate. I need some reassurance as I have stuck in this heart fear. Blood pressure generally runs 107/75 and resting heart rate is around 70. I weight 134 lbs (60 kg), and my height is 5'3. Seven years ago I had an echocardiogram when my anxiety first started, and I wore a 30 days Holter monitor. All was good except some PVCs. I also had a stress test without contrast during that time that was also fine. I have always been scared to exercise because of the fear of my heart rate and thinking it will make me have a heart attack or go into cardiac arrest. Please, can you give me some reassurance? I came to know that I can duplicate any chest pain by pressing on the spot then snap out of thinking I have a heart attack.","Doctor":"Hello. I passed carefully through your medical history. Considering your clinical symptoms and performed medical test I would explain as follows: Your heart rate increase recently is defined by your condition of high body temperature and systemic inflammation response. Usually, there is some degree of dehydration that may also further contribute to the matter. But the primary cause of the racing heart rate is your excessive anxiety. You need to fix and avoid it.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I used a sex toy (dildo) this morning which is slightly bigger than my partner. After, which I noticed a bit of blood on the toy and a small amount came out afterward. I did not feel any pain during or after, I noticed it felt deeper than usual and a stretching sensation. Four hours later I noticed more blood coming out, I have continued to bleed what looks like my period. I have no other symptoms but more blood has come out, no mucous or clots either. I feel well. Could it be coincidental that my period has come back or could I have injured myself? What are the signs of injury and at what point should I get checked out? By the way of background, I have been waiting for my period since last year. I stopped taking the pill thinking my period would come but it never did. I had irregular periods prior to taking the pill (hence why I got on the pill). My periods were always relatively heavy. I also have had a number of ovarian cysts over the last two to three years which have caused me pain previously. I am not polycystic and have not undergone any treatment but for the removal of ovarian cysts three years back due to torsion.","Doctor":"Hello. As your history suggests that you experienced bleeding post insertion and usage of sex toy (dildo). There are two ways it can cause injury in women - one by frictional lesions experienced as stretching and vaginal wall tears leading to bleeding (reddish spotting to heavy) or presence of cervicitis or cervical erosions which can bleed after the act of insertion or intercourse (often darkish brown discharge to reddish spotting). This calls for a per speculum examination to rule out either -vaginal mucosal injury or cervicitis. Now that you have been amenorrhoeic (absence of mensuration) since last four months, there is all likelihood that post sexual act, due to orgasm and increased endorphins, your menses may have been initiated and have increased inflow in next few days without any discomfort. The chances of bleeding being menses and heavy is high considering there is no pain or fever and that you did not have your menses for the last four months. You should get an ultrasound pelvis done to check for endometrial blood collection which shall confirm menses and also a per speculum exam which shall rule out any cervicitis or vaginal mucous lesions. I hope I have answered your query in detail, Avoid use of sex toy till cause is ascertained and bleeding stops. Please consult your gynecologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having a bunch of bumps on my dick. I think it is because I jerk off a lot but I am not exactly sure what it is.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My height is 6 feet, and I weigh 165 lbs. Overall I have maintained good health with stable CAD, chronic sinusitis and very fit. My recent stress echo shows excellent exercise tolerance and no blood flow blockage in coronary arteries. I have been taking these medications Crestor, Amlodipine, Benazepril, Bystolic, and Zetia for many years. I have symptoms such as frequent hunger, and still, there is weight loss. Perhaps have lost 2 kg over past 3 months. I have constant body aches, constant low-grade headache, overall fatigue, feeling some sensation in both groin and armpits. Bowels work fine. This has been going on for several weeks. Consulted my physician who said the lymph nodes that he could palpate were fine. Did ultrasound of neck and axilla and chest x-ray both were unremarkable. I fear that I may have liquid cancer. Can you look at these two laboratory results and tell me if these results could indicate the presence of lymphoma or leukemia. If it is not cardiac arrest, then I am sure it will be figured out in time. There is no history of CA in my family. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query and attached reports (attachments removed to protect patient identity) my opinion is as follows:  Based on your reports, there is no abnormality. No signs of any lymphoma or leukemia. Weight loss of 2 kg over 3 months is normal. Dehydration can cause up to 1-2 kg weight loss within a week and 2 kg should not be worrisome. Thyroid profile is good and there is no anemia. Regular moderate activity, protein-rich diet, good hydration (5-6 liters of water per day) should be helpful. Night sweats are usually a sign of cancer. However, the weight loss will be in the range of more than 10% within 2-3 months and additionally, for lymphoma, multiple groups of lymph nodes would be enlarged or in case of leukemia WBC (white blood cell), the differential would show a high number of blasts or immature cells. None of which are found. Additionally, there are no frequent new infections, indicating good bone marrow and immune function. There is no presence of any cancer of blood-forming cells. 1. Regular moderate activity. 2. Have good protein rich diet. 3. Keep yourself hydrated.

Day one I took 1 tablet of 200 mcg, the second day I took 2 tablets each 200 mcg. I did not take rest two pills, due to heavy bleeding. Also, I had got a lot of clotting, though it must be cleared now. On the fourth day, I did ultrasonography and found still a few clots were present. What is the best solution now? Will it clear automatically after a few weeks or should I take rest two pills now? Please help. Also day 4, the doctor suggested that I need to go for dilatation and curettage. I need your suggestion. Should I do it immediately? I am not in a position to do it now. Can I do dilatation and curettage after some time of around two months? Please suggest. I have attached my laboratory tests for your reference. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. Considering the USG (ultrasonography) scan report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there are still retained products of conception inside the uterus with clots. Ideally, you can take the remaining two doses of tablet Misoprostol and allow the bleeding to continue further as with medical abortion the bleeding may last for at least 7-10 days. Repeat USG scan ideally after 2 weeks to check for retained products again. If the products are still retained then dilatation and curettage would have to be done without delaying it further as you said till 2 months.

He is on both breastfeeding and formula preparation. What type of multivitamin can be recommended for him? Kindly suggest a few and enlighten what all are necessary for growth.","Doctor":"Hello. Neonates need exclusive breastfeeding and can supplement formula feed as needed. Usually, there is no need for multivitamin supplement at this age and would not recommend unless there is a need for one. For infant growth, all you need is timely feeds and breastfeeding. You start weaning at six months of age. Vaccines are important and make sure he gets all his vaccination on time through his pediatrician."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a patient of PCOD. I had my last periods before nine days. I took tablet Letrozole 2.5 mg from the second day of my periods and continued for five days. My USG findings of today as after ten days is right ovary follicle is 23.4 mm, and ET is 6.7. I will be able to meet my husband only after three days. My query is when shall I take injection hCG, as I can afford to have intercourse only after three days. My second query is with such a background, is there a possibility of cyst formation?","Doctor":"Hello. As the follicular size has already crossed 22 mm, there are high chances that you would ovulate in the next 24 hours naturally. However, by rule hCG dose is offered when the largest follicular size has crossed 20 mm, so you should be taking it today. After the injection, the ovulation is expected in the next 36 hours after the LH (luteinizing hormone) surge. So we advise intercourse from the very next day of hCG injection daily for the next three days to increase chances of conception. After ovulation, the egg is available for the next 24 hours when fertilization can occur as the egg starts to degenerate post 24 hours of ovulation. It has to be followed daily transvaginal ultrasound to watch for ovulation. If you ovulate by today night and see a ruptured follicle tomorrow then next 24 hours would be crucial for conception. In your case where sex is planned on three days from now if the follicle does not rupture naturally then you can take an hCG injection in the morning before the day of meeting your husband. And you expect egg after ovulation to be viable till that day and the next day when you can opt for frequent sex to increase chances of conception. All this provided follicle does not rupture until tomorrow evening."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, Before five years I consulted an ayurvedic doctor. I was suffering from hyperthyroid back pain. Then had a concentration problem in all the aspects of life. So I asked the doctor to suggest me some ayurvedic medicine for that. The doctor asked me to take manasmitra vatakam from kotakkal arya vaidyasala, the dosage of one tablet twice a day. Till date, I am taking it. The doctor told me that it does not have any side effects. Till now, I have had no side effect because of this. I feel focused and less anxious. Just wanted to ask will it be done or I have to continue with these two tablets? Will it have any side effect on the long run? I am still taking the medicines from the same brand.","Doctor":"Hello. Manasmitra vatkam is a good product and has no side effects in general. But it is always advised to take it under supervision only, so if tapering off the medication is required or dose adjustment is required only your physician can do that. Also only for anxiety bouts, it is not advisable for long periods. I advise you to visit your ayurvedic physician who prescribed you to take it and ask for the complete clinical psychological examination and then take it accordingly.

Early stages of emphysema are difficult to see on x-ray and are visualized only on HRCT (high-resolution computerized tomography) chest scan. If X-rays are normal then more likely that you do not have lung emphysema."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Two weeks ago I had 10 positive home urine pregnancy tests. I consulted with my obstetrician and they sent me for two blood tests 48 hours apart. The blood test showed my hCG level more than doubled within 48 hours which the obstetrician said was great. Well because I have irregular periods I did not know the date of my last period, so my obstetrician scheduled me for a vaginal ultrasound today and the ultrasound showed a gestational sac but no fetus in it. My obstetrician asked me to get another blood drawn in which results came out good and normal. she has asked me to come and do another ultrasound in two weeks to see if they can see the baby. Is it normal to not see the fetus and just the gestational sac in early pregnancy? I have been so nervous and going nuts since my obstetrician did an ultrasound this morning. It is driving me insane. Please send me any information if you can. Thanks so much.","Doctor":"Hello. In early pregnancy, by six weeks of gestation, the gestational sac is often not seen and only decidual reaction can be appreciated in the uterus, but as the hCG levels are doubling, there is definitely a viable ongoing pregnancy either inside or outside uterus, so a repeat ultrasound after two weeks shall establish the location and presence of a sac, considering that it would grow to a recognizable size in next two weeks. My concern with you is that you have been on the Adderall tablet, which is a pregnancy category C drug and not to be used before or during pregnancy as it has been known to cause congenital defects in fetuses."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from sweaty palms.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Will there be a condition, where I do not have to use lenses like ever?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. There are a number of different treatments for keratoconus based on the corneal topographical measures and your visual needs. The best to halt progression is corneal collagen cross-linking (C3R). This procedure causes the development of a lot of chemical bonds inside your cornea stabilizing it, thus preventing it from bulging out further. This procedure can only bring stabilization and will not improve your vision. For vision, we have a number of surgeries and implants, which can improve vision after corneal collagen cross-linking.

We are a vegetarian family but eat eggs and dairy. He is a very social person, likes building and creating things, enjoys music and dancing.","Doctor":"Hello. This needs medication which I will be prescribing."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30-year-old male. I work with computer eight hours per day, I was wearing contact lenses for 15 years, glasses for eight years prior to that. I go to yearly checkups with my optician and physician. I eat healthy foods and exercise daily. I have healthy BMI, no known diseases, no known allergies, and no medications. Eye diseases in my family: Retinal detachment, glaucoma. And my brother had frequent episodes of ocular migraines in his youth with migraine plus visual pattern. Before five months, I had an episode with my eyes. I was watching TV in the evening, suddenly I could not read the subtitles on the screen. They were blurred. I checked my phone and I could not focus my eyes to read my screen. I felt partially blinded. I also noticed I lacked some part of my viewing field. I looked at my arms while waving them up and down, and I could not see my right hand in my right eye in a certain position at about 3 feet distance. I would summarize it saying I had partial loss of vision in parts of my right eye and I was blinded like by a camera flash in both eyes. This lasted for 20 minutes. I was worried it might be something serious, so after talking to my doctor I ended up at the hospital. They took an MRI scan, had an eye doctor check my eyes and they used ultrasound on my neck. They could not find anything. I told them early that my younger brother had experienced ocular migraines when he was younger, so the doctors gave me the same diagnoses after the tests could not give any other answers. I will also add that prior to this episode I had for a while dry eyes and polyps on my right eyelid. I have never had this before. I have always been health conscious, so after this incident, I read a lot about this and implemented several things. I always sleep a minimum of 8 hours. I do not skip meals, eat foods. I have read that these are beneficial for eyes: Meditation and exercise to reduce stress. For the past two weeks, I have been experiencing almost every evening that my eyes are irritated by all screens. It has not been too bad, so it has just been in the back of my mind. But this weekend it got so bad I was blinded like by the flash of a camera for 24 hours straight. During this time, it was extremely sensitive to any lights, from screens to candles. I went to the general practitioner early today to have his opinion. I woke up with this same blinding flash disturbance and had it while I was at the doctor. He seemed clueless because these symptoms during this past week do not go that well with the diagnosis of ocular migraines that typically last 20 minutes to an hour. Also, I never have migraines. I just have the vision disturbance. My doctor has referred me back to the hospital and the eye doctors there. I wait for them to schedule it. My question is if you know what this could be and what I can do to limit these episodes. I am at a point now that this disturbs my work and I struggle to find the advice. I need to go forward. The eye doctor at the hospital, my general practitioner and my optician all say screen use has nothing to do with this. But none of them can give me advice on what to do.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. There are not many conditions which can give rise to the feeling of being blinded by a camera flash for 24 hours. A few of the conditions which can give rise to periodic flashes of light are retinal detachment, posterior vitreous detachment, ocular migraine and aura of migraine. None of these conditions can cause a flash of blinding light for 24 hours. But in case you are referring to episodic blindness, there are several causes like prodromal stages of retinal blood vessel disorder, migraine, Raynaud's disease, intermittent glaucoma and carotid artery stenosis (for which the ultrasound neck is done). I feel that the cause may be neurological and related to the blood supply. In case you need further information, please send me a scanned copy of your doctors records or tests reports.

Went to the ER, had a CT scan, diagnosed with a 6.5 mm kidney stone in my right ureter with mild hydronephrosis. I was given Percocet and sent home with instructions to see a urologist. I was not able to get an appointment until yesterday. Two days after my ER visit, I began having severe chills and running fever as high as 101.5. The urologist did a UA yesterday and said I did not have an infection. And also he did a KUB, which showed my stone had not moved at all. He scheduled me for lithotripsy next Tuesday. I continue to have severe chills and fever. I called his office today and he says I probably have flu. Is it possible that I have an infection in my right kidney? Because the stone is blocking the ureter. But, urine I am passing is clear and uninfected. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. High fever and chill are indicative of infection indeed and as we have a cause rightly evident there are chances that you may be developing hydronephrosis (accumulation of urine in swollen kidney) in the right kidney and a secondary infection following stasis of urine (stoppage or reduced flow of urine) in the kidney leading to nephritis. Though urine culture generally picks up an infection in the bladder, nephritis is more of clinical diagnosis with pain and tenderness in the renal angle and high-grade fever accompanying it. Ideally, you should be started on prophylactic antibiotics to control the infection sooner before septic features or septicemia may occur.I think you should take a second opinion from another urologist too."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a question about my skin condition.

Though you may not have had this on your previous exposure, now onwards you may have a severe reaction to the dye. You can use topical 1 % Hydrocortisone cream local application twice daily and take tablet Levocetirizine once daily for one week after consulting your dermatologist.

I believe this was due to excessive masturbation and having sex when it was sore and hurting, to begin with. It seems like it is healing up, but I want to make sure. There has not been pus, discharge or pain from peeing. Just the irritated spot has been sore. The skin has turned dark there as it is healing I presume? I have been having sex with the same person for over two years so I do not think it is anything she gave to me as she is clean. I am just hoping this is not some sort of STI.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to icliniq.com. Usually, whenever soreness is present over the penis we have to rule out herpes or syphilis. But I have seen attached image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It does not look like any sexually transmitted illness. For a few days, it is advisable to stop masturbation and you can apply topical antibiotic cream over that. If no improvement, then you have to consult a dermatologist for detailed evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Recently, I noticed a visible gum recession. Ignore black triangles. Got it after orthodontist told me that is due to my nature of teeth shape. I had braces two years ago. I realized the recession when flossing and brushing my teeth. I am wondering if I have overflossed and hurt my gums because it bleeds sometimes too and worried if it is gingivitis. Does mouth wash help? I am considering getting it.","Doctor":"Hello. Gum recession is caused due to multiple reasons and one of them is gingivitis or periodontitis. The amount of recession as I see in your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is very less and you need not to worry about it at all unless you experience sensitivity issues. There is no sign of any inflammation or infection in your gums and that is not the cause for recession. The probable cause for this in your case is a faulty tooth brushing which causes constant trauma to the teeth and gums. Applying excessive pressure on your toothbrush while brushing is the most common reason as people usually think this will make the teeth whiter but in fact, it only causes more harm. Following proper tooth brushing techniques will prevent further recession. Black triangles are caused usually due to deposits in the interdental areas. You can visit a periodontist to get this treated. We have a few options such as laser therapy for papilla regeneration and a few other minor surgical procedures to regrow the lost gums in between the tooth. To correct gum recession also you may ask the periodontist for the treatment options. They are commonly gum grafts, coronally advanced flap therapy, etc., which will bring you back your esthetics. These procedures are not majorly invasive and need not hesitate to get it done. However, if it does not cause you any trouble you need not get any procedures done other than regular scaling and maintaining hygiene. Also, remember to use only a soft toothbrush as hard bristles can cause more trauma and result in a further recession."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have white discharge problem since 3 to 4 years. I tested vaginal swab and my reports showed staphylococcus aureus isolated. I have weight loss and pimples problems also.","Doctor":"Hi. White discharge is a common problem among sexually active females and there are a few things to be kept in mind. 1. Do not take extra care for your private parts by using intimate washes, perfumes, and douches. They wash away your normal protective vaginal flora. Just wash the area with water during bath time. 2. Have yogurt every day to incorporate probiotics in the diet. 3. Use cotton undergarments. 4. Avoid oral sex if the partner has dental issues. 5. Rule out latex allergy and change to pads if using tampons. 6. Have proper sleep, maintain a regime. 7. Avoid stress. 8. Eat healthy and drink water in adequate amounts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

To prevent relapse of acne one needs to complete a total dose of 120 mg/kg of Isotretinoin. As your weight is 55 kg you should be taking a total of 6600 mg of Isotretinoin to prevent relapse. That comes out to be 330 days of 20 mg per day of Isotretinoin. That is almost 11 months of 20 mg Isotretinoin. This dose is recommended to prevent relapse of acne."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 36 years old female, who is 6 weeks and 4 days pregnant. I take Gestofit 300 once daily and Fertigyn 5000 twice a week. I am on complete bed rest. I get a slight amount of brown discharge occasionally. Should I panic about miscarriage? I am afraid because I had two miscarriages, one at 7 weeks and the other at 11 weeks last year. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. At 6 weeks 4 days, you can have a scan, if it is still not done, to confirm the fetal heartbeat, as the baby's heartbeat only can confirm the health of the baby and to see the decidual reaction. Brown discharge only means that it is old blood and implantation bleeding. When the embryo bores into the decidual lining of the uterus, it causes few drops of blood to come out. This blood comes out of uterus a few days later as brown discharge. It is normal and nothing to worry. Do not worry about the history of miscarriages, the chances of repeated miscarriages are only 3 %, which means 97 % chances of healthy pregnancy. For your information, bed rest is not needed. No matter what history you had, the baby does not get attached to uterus mechanically, rather by chemical attachment. So, whatever you do, the baby will stay attached to the uterus. Pregnancy is not an illness, so enjoy every moment of pregnancy with good health and lots of prayers. Baby will do fine. Medicines are fine, Gestofit (Progesterone) makes the uterus relaxed and reduces the likelihood of bleeding from the decidual layer. The best method would be to insert the capsule Gestofit 200 mg or 300 mg vaginally twice a day, as the dose reaching the uterus will be the highest with no side effects of the hormone. Injection Fertigyn (Human chorionic gonadotropin) improves the decidual implantation of the embryo. If you already had a scan and health of pregnancy has been confirmed, I suggest you try Proluton depot (Hydroxyprogesterone caproate) 500 mg injection, intramuscularly once in every two weeks until 12 weeks of gestation. It will not allow any further bleeding from the uterus. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take medicine with their consent. Hope I have clarified your doubt, do write back if you have any more queries. All the best.

The brown discharge could be due to the frequent use of Ipill. The excess Ipill intake is not advisable for health. You can use precaution next time.

I use Ibuprofen for pain and also use a tube of Scheriproct. There has been no improvement in four days. Should I get worried or does it take time to clear?","Doctor":"Hi. If you are using Sheriproct (Prednisolone), there should be at least some improvement because it contains a steroid and it helps clear up the piles within seven days. I hope you are using it correctly. I hate to tell you this but if there is no improvement with topical treatment, you may need to go to the doctor for sclerotherapy. They will use a sclerosing agent as an injection which can effectively cause shrinkage of the hemorrhoids. My advice would be to not delay in seeking proper treatment, which in your case would be sclerotherapy. If the topical is not working at all, delaying it further might make it worse and then you might require surgery. I do not mean to scare you, I hope you understand. If there has been at least slight improvement with Sheriproct, then continue it for three more days and see what happens. If no significant improvement, go for sclerotherapy.

The stye is on the center of the eyelid just above the pupil area when the eye is closed. I was wondering how to get rid of it as it is disturbing my vision every often. The eye is dry all the time and aches once in a while but the stye is not painful at all. If there is any help or advise you could give to attend this matter, that would be highly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your photo attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and understand your concerns. Since the swelling is not at the eyelid margin, it could be an internal type of the stye called hordeolum internum. A stye is expected to have symptoms such as pain, redness and watering and frequently goes away with treatment in a few days. Suppose the swelling has been present since a few weeks and has no pain, it might have progressed from a stye to a chalazion, this stage needs surgical treatment. There also is the possibility that the swelling may not be a stye. It could a cystic or fibrous swelling. A simple eye examination will be able to diagnose these lesions. So, I advise you to continue with the eye ointment and give hot fomentation with a clean cloth or some cotton. This will help for both stye and chalazion. If the swelling shows no signs of reduction, I suggest that you meet with an ophthalmologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had a swollen eyelid for over five years, in one eye only, and it is more bulged than the other eye.

The commonest non-painful swelling being a chalazion, it starts off as a painful swelling accompanied with eye rubbing and irritation. In case, these do not heal adequately they become painless and hardened chalazion. The other causes including swelling due to hormonal fluctuations, swellings due to tumors and due to conjunctivitis.

I am a hypothyroid patient and I had to stop taking medicine for it due to low TSH level. I have also been suffering from thrombocytopenia for long. I am post-menopausal for the past seven years. Please advise me what I should do.","Doctor":"Hello. First, from what I see from the results (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is the presence of low T3 and T4 levels with elevated TSH at the same time. It means that your thyroid function is deprived again and you need to re-start hormone replacement therapy. The fact that your lipid levels are elevated speaks in favor of slowed metabolism and can be attributed to the current hypothyroid state. Second, your platelets are borderline. At this time they are sufficient enough in quantity to exert anti-bleeding properties, so if you had bleeding at this moment, most probably it was not due to their count. But if your hypothyroidism is autoimmune in nature, the reason for which you did not mention, then there is a high chance that you have immune thrombocytopenia as well. Usually, one autoimmune disorder goes together with another. But even if you have immune thrombocytopenia, at the current platelet count it would not require any treatment. The hypothyroidism requires though. You have a slight increase in eosinophils. Again, they are borderline, but nevertheless, this prompts investigation for parasites such as echinococcosis, leishmaniasis, toxocariasis are the ones that are more frequent in your region. Next, do you take any medications that could potentially inhibit platelet function? Such as Aspirin, Clopidogrel or do you eat a lot of garlic? Then, if there is no drug substance causing dysfunction of platelets, you will need to check your coagulation with conventional tests such as APTT, PT, and INR. Last, but not the least, this could be a case of inherited plate dysfunction, but that you should have had since early childhood. And finally, I assume you had your differential manually checked by a laboratory specialist and they did not found any abnormal cells on the smear. You also have not mentioned whether the dentist reported on gum hypertrophy, but I assume there is none. You can take some Vitamin C, you might be lacking it, and Rutascorbin to prevent capillary fragility. Hashimoto thyroiditis. Parasitologic tests, coagulation tests: APTT, INR, PT.

The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

When I am trying to give him cough syrup he is vomiting and not taking it. Also the amount of antibiotic prescribed is too high I hope. What shall I do now? Please guide me.","Doctor":"Hi. For infants with cough and cold, antibiotics are fine to give. As per AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) guidelines, Sinarest (combination of Chlorpheniramine maleate, Phenylephrine hydrochloride, Sodium citrate, and Menthol) and cough syrup are not indicated in this age, as they may cause more harm than benefit. I am not able to comment without the name of antibiotic. I would appreciate if you could provide me with the generic name of the medicine you are giving her. This would help to provide proper guidance and dosage.

That the eyelids of your other eye have swollen up or one is pushed out or one eye has a squint, giving an apparent prominence of the other. Both causes are dangerous in that, they both can hamper your vision in several forms. Rare instances of life-threatening tumors are also reported, I have run into patients with such problems.

Some of these can be corrected by glasses, these are called refractive errors. While others cannot be improved with glasses and will need eye surgery or special medication. A simple test to see if your eyesight can improve with glasses is to use the pin-hole test. For this, take any piece of paper. Poke a hole in it with the tip of a ballpoint pen and try to see far away objects with it. If in case you see better through the hole, then your condition can improve with glasses.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

This can be confirmed by getting a serum beta hCG test (human chorionic gonadotrophin test) done which can conclusively rule out pregnancy as well, earliest by 10 days post intercourse.

A pilonidal sinus is more common among men who: 1. Have more hard body hair. 2. Have long working hours (sitting down). 3. Obese. Unfortunately, surgery is the best option for you in going forward. However, as the recovery period can be a lengthy one, you may hold off on surgery for a few months provided the discharge from the sinus is not bothering you too much and is not painful. Whilst you decide on when to get it operated, you should continue to maintain local hygiene, keep the area as dry as possible, and remove any hair in the area. That being said, the longer you leave it, the more problematic it might become due to infection, and worsening of the sinus.

My partner and I had unprotected sex on 4th but he did not ejaculate inside. Since yesterday I feel tenderness in my breasts, a little fatigue and mild cramps in between. Is there anything to worry about?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from tenderness in your breast and little bit fatigue. Your last menstrual period was on 15th April which lasted for 15 hours and you had unprotected sexual intercourse on 4th. Usually, woman's menstrual cycle is 28 days (+/-7days) normally. So if period occurs seven days before the estimated date as well as seven days after the estimated date is quite normal. It may happen in every woman in her lifetime. It is nothing to be worried. Again menstrual bleeding can last for 2-7 days normally. So your last menstrual bleeding lasted for 15 hours which may be quite normal. You should not worry about that. You should know about the safe period during a normal menstrual cycle. It is also known as calendar method. In this period no woman becomes pregnant from unprotected sex. If your menstrual cycle is 28 days, then from the 9th day of your last menstrual cycle to the 16 th day of your last day of menstruation will be counted as danger period (from 9th day to 16th day, total 7 days are known as danger period). In this period a woman can bear pregnancy from unprotected sexual intercourse. The rest 21 days are counted as safe period. In this period no woman can become pregnant from unprotected sex. So, luckily 4th April was your safe day. So there is no chance for you to become pregnant. Hormonal fluctuations can cause breast tenderness. Breasts may become painful before three to five days of starting of a menstrual period and stop hurting after your period begins. Menstrual cycle causes hormone fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone which make your breasts swell and can lead to sore and discharge. Those hormonal imbalance may make you fatigue too. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant?

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Though my nose was never stuffy, I could feel the congestion somewhere between my lower nasal passage and sinus. When I would go to clear this, it would take a few minutes of hard blowing to get it loose enough to exit. When it finally would clear, the mucous was the strongest, thickest, non-separating gelatin-like, clear or white material I have ever come across. I chalked it up as allergies as I have begin to develop them mildly at the age of 40. This symptom over the last six months became more frequent, and now, for the last week, it is there daily and bright, dark yellow. The mucous is still very difficult to bring out, and sometimes I am able to bring it through the oral cavity, after incredulous amounts of effort. The mucous is so sticky it wants to stay right where it is. Or could this be a polyp issue, possibly? It is symptomatic of sinusitis as it is an obvious infection, but I am not stuffy at all. I can breathe finely. No fever or other symptoms, aside from very slight sinus pressure, but I sound nasal when I speak like I have a cold.","Doctor":"Hello. Do you have a decreased sense of smell or running nose or itchy eyes or watering of eyes or itchy nose? Do you have blocked sensation or choking feeling of the throat? Any soreness of throat or difficulty in swallowing? Your symptoms do sound like you have sinusitis and possibly polyposis like you rightly guessed. But the only way to confirm the same is to get a professional consult and ask the ENT to do a nasal endoscopy which is an office procedure and simple. Thereafter, if needed, you can subject yourself to a sinus CT scan. Empirically, you may start a steroid nasal spray and an antiallergic for now. You can start on a mucolytic medicine also for five days. For more details do revert back to me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 27 years old, female. I am taking Nilavarai powder continuously for constipation. I am 47 days pregnant. Can I continue this powder?","Doctor":"Hi. Nilavarai is commonly known as Senna or Sonamukhi in Ayurveda. It has laxative property. After taking for a long time, it makes habitual and mildly irritating. If you are pregnant then you should avoid taking it for a long time.

It is completely safe to you in pregnancy too."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am using Minoxidil and noticing dark eyes and wrinkles. Is there a way to keep using Minoxidil but counter the side effects?","Doctor":"Hello. 1. Minoxidil has nothing to do with dark eye circles or wrinkles. 2.

Is she supposed to avoid both saturated fats and unsaturated fats? Can she eat nuts like cashew and groundnut?","Doctor":"Hello. Dear, she may take unsaturated fats like omega-3 fatty acids or fish oils or cod liver oil, etc. Avoid spicy food and saturated fats. Vitamin E and Vitamin C are useful to reduce fat in the liver. Use tablet Pantoprazole before breakfast for one week in case of acidity or indigestion which is more common in fatty liver disease. Regular exercise, weight reduction may be useful. Please consult your physician for a follow-up scan and blood tests.

I have been using steroid creams and anti-itch cream but it kept coming back on and off. Three weeks ago I started getting hives and before two weeks, they covered most of my body from my neck to my ankles. As per my doctor, I went on Prednisone and Cetirizine but it did not stop. Now I am on Methylprednisolone and Cetirizine and it seems to be getting a little better. I cannot figure out any triggers though, the itching and the hives are pretty much unbearable. It does not seem to be a sugar allergy, but I am uncertain about a gluten allergy. I have had a previous allergy test but revealed nothing except for allergy to a few animals, which I have none. I never had a gluten test. My current medications are Amlodipine, Paroxetine, Wellbutrin, Famotidine, and Cetirizine. Methylprednisolone for the past four days. I am 52 years old.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the attachments. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  It must be difficult for you with the itch and the rashes. Can you upload the report of your allergy testing? Why do not you go ahead and get the flute testing? It is a blood test and not as costly as the routine allergy panel. Secondly, when did you start Paroxetine and Wellbutrin? Were those started recently? Is there any correlation between their start and the development of the rashes? When you take the steroid tablets and antihistaminics are you better off? Do the rashes stay at bay then? Are there any triggers inside the house? Any insects or dust particles? Any history of change of place of stay?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a gingival polyp that has been removed three times but keeps growing back.

I understand your concern, this is quite a common issue most children at his age develop. The eye uses several mechanisms which help to keep it steady and focused in on a target. Such mechanisms are inoperative when the person is just looking in a particular direction and not trying to see anything specific or while daydreaming. When you redirect his attention to you, he looks at your face (the target), hence the nystagmus stops. How is he in class, is he able to see his books or what the teacher writes on the board, does he have problems with seeing these? I recommend seeing a pediatric ophthalmologist just to be sure that he is not developing any refractive errors. But like I said, this is quite common at his age and is not a serious problem. In case you need any further information, please send me a scanned copy of his doctors records, I will do my best to help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had an exotropia surgery before. It was a strabismus kind of thing. But my eye, the one with the condition, is small and the pupil is like looking down. When I take pictures is very noticeable. I need to flip them to make them look normal. Is it normal that my eye is smaller and is looking down? Is my right eye fine? The left one is fine. This is really bringing me down. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concerns. From the image you sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can see that your right eye is a bit red. Has your right eye always been a little red? How long back did you get the squint surgery? If you have had surgery long ago, then I can tell you that your images show a hypotropia in the right. This is once again treatable with surgery. I do not feel that flipping the images has made the defect any less apparent. Nonetheless, such a condition is not an emergency unless you feel that the vision in your eyes has dropped. If it helps you, some people can get their eyes straighter for photos by first closing the normal eye, then looking at an object with the squinting eye then opening to see with the normal eye. In case you need any further information, kindly send me a scanned copy of your surgery report. I will do my best to help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had discomfort recently in my right upper rear torso. I recently had an ultrasound and a CAT scan. The results covered a variety of body parts. But I am interested in speaking to a liver specialist regarding what the results said about my liver.

CAT scan showed: Liver: Diffuse hepatic steatosis. Indeterminant subcapsular posterior right hepatic lobe 13 x 9 mm hypoattenuation segment 7.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your US reports and I can say that: 1. You have fatty liver disease (steatosis). 2. With regards to second ultrasound indeterminant subcapsular posterior right hepatic lobe, 13x9 mm hypoattenuation means that ultrasound cannot identify the reason. Often it is related with no fatty tissues at this part of the liver. Otherwise, if I were your treating doctor I would suggest doing MRI of liver to better evaluate the parenchyma of the liver."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby is having a fever.

Yes, for fever, if less than 100 F, do just tap water sponging all over the body. If 100 F to 102 F, give Paracetamol as and when the fever comes with a gap of six hours between two doses. If fever is more than 102 F then give Meftal with a gap of eight hours between two doses of Meftal. Avoid Meftal as much as possible. Give more food and more liquid. If he is dull, not taking orally, then go to the doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off.

I had been in the sun a lot recently and I am feeling symptoms of heat exhaustion, but I am worried that the staph infection is causing septic shock? Is this a possibility?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from a feeling of heat exhaustion as you were more exposed to the sunlight and worried about Staph infection that may cause septic shock. You had a staph infection one month back and you took antibiotics for that. So I think your previous staph infection was well eradicated by taking antibiotics. Even without treatment, it can be eradicated within 10-20 days. Staph infection may cause life-threatening condition like sepsis. Clinical features of sepsis are high fever with chills and rigors, rapid pulse rate, rapid breathing, hypotension, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. When staph bacteria enters a person's bloodstream and develop an infection that may affect the entire body and cause death is known as sepsis. You are not mentioned here that you are affected by sepsis-like clinical features and no history of having sepsis in the past.

Also, I want to know what my options are for fixing scar tissue? Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Sorry to hear the pain and discomfort you are having and wish you a quick recovery. Please find my observations below. Your MRI scan reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) show that there are changes seen in the neck region of the spinal cord at the level of fusion surgery for which the term myelomalacia (softening of the spinal cord) and myelopathy (compression of the spinal cord) has been used. The cervical spondylosis has probably increased from before. These changes make the neck changes a little worse than the lower back. There is significant pinching of nerve roots at C6 - C7 level on the right side and this becomes important because it affects your daily activities. There are changes in the spinal cord at this level which is a concern. If you are right-handed and have to use the computer at work then this can be one of the reasons for the tingling and numbness. The lower back problem is mild and is of less concern when compared to the neck. In conclusion, the visit to the neurosurgeon should be focused on reducing the nerve pinching in the neck C6 - C7 level and preventing any progressive changes in the spinal cord at that level. I would be glad if you can share the CD so that I can have a look at your images. However, my observations will most likely be the same as mentioned above."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I need to get rid of the post acne hyperpigmentation that is a year old.

Usually, post any sprint or run which is done all of a sudden without reconsidering it as a regular activity there might be doms (delayed onset muscle soreness) and this stays for around 4 to 5 days of time. Post that, the pain reduces in its own without any kind of medication.

As you are 53 years now and your primary concern was menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) which causes anemia and other issues. If it has been controlled with birth control since the last six months, then this indicates hormonal imbalances. Now at 53, you should be expecting your menopause soon, which cannot be found out if you remain on birth control, hence you can opt to stop them for two cycles and watch for bleeding.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

So first what should I remove? Infection in the root canal or wisdom tooth? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. From the X-ray, I understand that all your wisdom teeth are indicated for removal as they are erupting in the wrong path. However, I would suggest you get the one which is troubling you extracted first followed by re-root canal treatment for the adjacent tooth. It is better to get the extraction done first followed by the root canal. This sequence may vary from dentist to dentist and also based on patients preferences."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My complaints started 22 years back, light feeling in the head, cramped neck and chest, hypochondriacal thoughts about heart disease (which I do not have). This caused several panic attacks and anxiety and finally chronic fatigue. My doctor prescribed Paroxetine 20 mg and after some extra anxiety, I was practically free of problems for 20 years and lived a wonderful life. Six months ago after a long period of bad sleep and insomnia, I became anxious again with panic attacks and this time along with negative obsessive thoughts about breathing (not able to stop thinking about breathing), so severe that I cannot function in a normal state anymore. My doctor, the general practitioner, upped the dose of Paroxetine from 20 to 30 mg, but it caused a strong adverse reaction. I became very emotional and unstable, not able to sleep and very restless and racing thoughts. I have had the 30 mg dose over a period of 8 to 9 weeks to see if the symptoms went away and my situation improved, but it did not. So I am back at 20 mg again. The extreme adverse effects have eased it but I still have obsessive thoughts about my breathing. This is going on dozens or many times a day and is causing so much anxiety. The bottom line is that I am aware of my breathing and is afraid to get rid of this thought, but I think it is fed by general anxiety, because when I take a Benzo or sleeping aid later in the day, the obsessive thoughts are gone. This now controls my life and I am unable to cope. It is also mentioned under the name sensorimotor obsession. In my opinion, this is a kind of OCD, but the basis lies in general anxiety. This breath OCD also manifested itself 21 years back when I first took the Paroxetine, but after a while went away and never brought so much anxiety. Now my question is whether this is caused by Paxil poop out or tachyphylaxis although the upped dose did not work. And what to do, augment the Paroxetine with Buspar to try to fight the possible Serotonin depletion? Or switch to another SSRI or SRNI? Or TCA? I am 51 years old, male and only taking some Benzos as other medications. I also have no other medical issues as far as I know.","Doctor":"Hello. You have provided a helpful insightful summary of your problems. As you rightly identified, your difficulties appear to be related to excessive anxiety. Panic attacks, obsessive preoccupation about breathing, fatigue and sleep disturbance appear to be related to high anxiety levels. I note that you responded very well to Paroxetine 20 mg for more than two decades but did not tolerate the increased dose recently and 20 mg is no longer effective. This is noticed commonly clinically due to various reasons. Just wanted to clarify whether in addition to medication, have you received any psychological therapy like CBT for management of your anxiety. CBT is highly effective in anxiety and will be very useful for the symptoms you describe. Kindly discuss with your doctor about CBT input. Even if you had CBT before, it will be worthwhile having it again to gain an additional perspective. Regarding medication change, switching to another SSRI like Sertraline should be considered first before SNRIs or TCAs or augmentation strategies. Benzo can be continued for short periods. Kindly discuss with your doctor as you will need to be monitored during the switching period. Also, I just wanted to highlight other additional strategies that help to decrease anxiety levels. Try progressive muscle relaxation exercises at least twice daily. Avoid alcohol, caffeinated drinks, it will worsen anxiety. Regular walking or exercise helps. To sum up, medication helps but also consider CBT and non-pharmacological measures in addition to medication as there is good evidence that they help with anxiety."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, About a month ago, I got a filling on one of my front teeth, they called it a surface cavity but filled it like a normal cavity. For the first two weeks, I could barely drink room temperature drinks without being in agony. I made an appointment after two weeks to have my dentist look at it to make sure it was not cracked or anything. He never even looked at it, he gave me an antibiotic and said if it did not get any better, I would need a root canal. A few days later the sensitivity went away and I thought it healed. Last week, I noticed the gums above it have changed color. They are a slight red, purple and the gum itself is very sensitive. Under my nose and some of my cheek, I can feel where it is swollen (the gum). It also throbs sometimes. Should I take the antibiotic that my orginal dentist prescribed or should I just wait it out until I see the new dentist to see what they say? I am just scared. Is it an abscess and I do not want it to become more infected.","Doctor":"Hi. Unfortunately, your doubt is true about it. The swollen gum and change in its color right above the tooth in question indicate that your tooth is infected and you need a root canal treatment now. Immediately, start taking the antibiotics from now, before starting take a picture of the color of gums and tooth so that you may show it to the new dentist that at this condition you started with antibiotics to avoid severity of infection and he might not give you this antibiotic coverage again and start treatment from the next step. Feel free to ask if you have any further question in mind. Stay happy and blessed. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have ringworms on my face, nose, eyebrows, scalp, jock itch, white spots around the anus that hurt and itch.

For how long do you have this problem? This is not ringworm or fungal infection. There are multiple atrophic plaques over the face and arms from your picture. Have you applied anything over them?
