I m 23 years old... have three children already... for the past month or so I have been having every pregnancy symptom you could think of... but I didn t think nothing of it until I missed my period & today I m two weeks late. I ve taken 3 hpt in the past couple of weeks but they all have been negative. I have also been experiencing a lot of pain and pressure in my pelvic area. Today my husband and I tried to have intercourse but I was afraid that it would hurt due to the pain that I ve been in. Sure enough we had to stop because I had the worst pain in my life; I never had pain like that in all three of my previous labor! I had extreme sharp pain and pressure in my pelvic area, I could barely move. My husband helped me to the shower were I could only sit because it hurt too bad to stand and I let the hot water fall on me to try and ease the pain. The pain wa so bad that I threw up in the shower. When I got done, I set on the toilet because of all the pressure and it sorta felt like something was going to fall out of me. I ended up having to get my husband to help me to the bed so that I could lay down because the pain was so unbearable that I turned pale and cold and I was sure that I was going to past out, but never did, thank God. That was this morning and for the rest of the day I have been resting in bed and taking Motrin. I only feel a little pain while I m laying down but when I get up, I get the pressure in my pelvis area and I get so dizzy and lightheaded. What could this possibly be? I plan on seeing my doctor but I have to wait until after the holidays. I also have the Mirena IUD . Thank you for your help!","Doctor":"Hello,MIRENA IUD is very much effective in preventing unwanted pregnancy with failure rate less than 1%.Pain around pelvic region may be due to pelvic infection, endometriosis, PID associated with insertion of MIRENA. Do a pelvic USG with some hormone test & blood for TC/DC/ ESR and a urine test for R/E, M/E to rule out underlying pathology. Also, you have to undergo some clinical and pelvic examination.Check tail end of thread to make sure that MIRENA is properly placed and not displaced.Use some anti spasmodic medicine like Tab DROTIN DS to get some relief. Avoid stress, take healthy diet, control body wt and need proper sleep. Drink lots of fluid.Be well and take care."},{"Patient":"im 3 month pregnant and i feel cramping and what it seems to be pressure on my upper stomach right below my chest.

Red blood cells can also appear if the inside of your bladder is inflamed from the infection.However, the presence of red blood in your urine can also be caused by other conditions of the kidneys or bladder that cause bleeding without infection. The most common of these is a kidney stone, and if you have had very severe pain in your back or lower pelvis, especially on one side, that diagnosis is also possible.Pregnancy or STDs do not generally cause blood to be seen in the urine.  If you are concerned about pregnancy or STD exposure, these can be tested separately, but you do not have to be concerned about these conditions because of the presence of blood cells in your urine.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am now pregnant with 4 months.

Sunday: meat/mince meat/chicken","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Prima facae the diet you are taking seems to be  fairly balanced diet for pregnancy. However, I see that you are not consuming sufficient quantity of pulses and legumes. Please try to include them in your diet. Though dosa provides some dal like urad, it is very small quantity that you are eating. Please increase the quantity of sambar in your diet; and let it be thick sambar with plenty of dal. For good quality proteins, include Thalipeeth of combined pulses. You should have variety of pulses and legumes in the diet to provide all the essential amino acids required by the body. Inclusion of varied bean sprouts will provide you good, predigested high quality proteins. Also please include more fruits in your diet. Apple is not that nutritious fruit; it contains more minerals and water. Banana is a very good fruit.  Chikoo and guava also are good nutritious fruits. Citrous fruits will provide you minerals and vitamin C. Please have variety of fruits in the diet. I am not clear which vegetables you are eating. Along with fruit vegetables, you should have plenty of fresh green leafy vegetables for vitamins and minerals. Moreover, fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables will prevent constipation which is so very common during pregnancy. During whole day, have at least 500 ml of milk in divided servings. One large glassful of milk in the morning and one at bedtime should serve this purpose. In general, follow the principle:High proteinsModerate Carbohydrates Low fatLots of fresh fruits and green leafy vegetableOther vegetablesAbout 2200 to 2500 calories (depending on your weight) dailyWith little bit of modification in your diet, you can consume the ideal balance diet for pregnancy.

When boy babies are born, the testicles drop from the groin through a canal into the scrotum.  This canal can stay open in some people and the testicle can slip into the canal.A man's testicles need to be outside the body to remain cooler than regular body temperature for sperm to develop properly.  Just to be safe, if you are trying to get pregnant, your fiance should see his primary doctor or a urologist for an examination to make sure there is nothing to be concerned about.  If the testicle goes up into the groin and gets stuck and he cannot push it back down, your fiance should go to an emergency room as the blood supply to the testicle can be compromised.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that this information was helpful.Best wishes, and good luck with getting pregnant,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I did MRI last year spt. 28, 2016 for prostate cancer, here are the results: Could explain theme to me. 1. there is thickening of the bladder wall- what doesit mean? 2. there re no enlarged regional lymph nodes. - what does it mean? 3. the visualized bony pelvis is unremarkable. - what does it mean?

Please type your query here...I just found out i am pregnant but about three weeks ago I ate a stem of magic mushrooms while at a friends birthday.Would this have caused any problems. My last period puts me at about 6 weeks","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. There is little medical evidence about the effects of hallucinogenic mushrooms on pregnancy, as there are many different types and species used for this purpose. However, many people consume alcohol or other substances generally regarded as harmful for pregnancy before they realize they are pregnant. The period of the development of the major organs on the fetus does not begin until at least the eighth week, so any exposure before that time in pregnancy really does not have a chance to expose the fetus at a time critical to its development. So it is unlikely that this one exposure will have any significant effect on the fetus as long as you do not continue to use the mushrooms later in pregnancy. To help ensure the best pregnancy outcome, I recommend you begin taking a prenatal vitamin daily and discontinue any further use of alcohol or any other drugs not prescribed to you by a doctor. I hope I was able to answer your question adequately and that my advice was helpful.

Sperm can live in the reproductive tract for at least 3-5 days, and an egg can also live for 72 hours inside your body.  This means that the most accurate estimates of conception can only be within 5 days.  So because your two encounters were only 5 days apart, and there is no way to know exactly when you ovulated, both of these men are possible candidates to be the father of your baby.Paternity tests on the baby can only be performed after the child is born.I hope I was able to give you the necessary information and I wish you the best for the rest of the pregnancy.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"i am 22 weeks pregnant and pulled a groin muscle at the very top of my thigh, the pain has been there going on 4 weeks and is making it hard to stand and walk with out limping and siting up is painful especially in the morning. also the pain feels like its spreading across my vaginal area and to the other leg and this morning I almost could not stand.

I am sorry that you are suffering from this injury. The ligaments of pregnant women in their hips get looser from pregnancy, and that can make you more vulnerable to a hip or groin injury. So I recommend seeing an orhipedic specialist to diagnose exactly how you hurt yourself, and possibly give you a cane to help you walk until this gets better. In the meantime, there is no reason that you cannot take adult strength Tylenol, even extra strength. Tylenol has been tested for safety in pregnancy in the full adult dose. So if you take adult Tylenol, you may be able to get some relief. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.

My query remains, should we continue with the pregnancy or not. Will there be any problem-defect for the baby in the hearing or limp growth or eye or anything. Kindly advise, you are our last consultant. Shaiju: hello doctorThis is regarding my wife. She is 28 yrs old and 5.3 my wife is 8 weeks pregnant now. she was using AKT4 at the time of conception and then was moved on to AKT3 till a day back (08.04.2011). We would like to know, if it is advisable to go ahead with the pregnancy. is it going to cause any disability of any kind (hearing, eye, etc.) for the babies (she is conceived with twins) to be born. kindly advise in detail as we are getting different words from many of our offline doctors. We are really concerned and the verge of thinking to terminate. Doctor: Hi Doctor: Dr.Vidya here Shaiju: hello doctor Doctor: Please give me a couple of mins to read your questions Shaiju: sure Doctor: I will help you now , thanks for your patience Shaiju: thank you doctor Doctor: may i know when was she diagnosed with TB ? Shaiju: she was not diagnosed of TB, it was inconclusive Shaiju: she was diagnosed with granulumatous lymphadenitis Doctor: ok Doctor: when was this ? Shaiju: for which the doctors could not find any dead or live bacteria Shaiju: this was in october 2010 Doctor: ok Doctor: when did she start the medicines Shaiju: november 2010 Doctor: ok Doctor: was she on AKT4 regularly ? Shaiju: then she had stopped for sometime Doctor: ok Doctor: when was the conception exactly diagnosed ? Shaiju: yes continuously for three months starting december Shaiju: yes we have done a scan and also a blood test too. Doctor: ok , when was the pregnancy confirmed? Doctor: can you give me the dates Shaiju: 07/04/2011 Shaiju: we didn t know that she was pregnant before that Doctor: ok Shaiju: when it was diagnosed it was already 7.5 weeks Doctor: have you taken an opinion about this from a consultant gynecologist ? Shaiju: one fetus and another 7.6 weeks Shaiju: yes Doctor: what did the doctor opine ? Shaiju: she is not able to ascertain if there would be any effect on the fetus or not Shaiju: so she is suggesting termination Shaiju: we also consulted a pediatrician, he is in the opinion that the child might have problem with the hearing Doctor: ok Doctor: let me explain it to you Doctor: the drugs for TB include isoniazid , pyrizinamide , ethambutol and rifamipicin Doctor: all of them are grouped under CATEGORY C Doctor: under the pregnancy and lactation drugs list Shaiju: what does the category c mean doctor Doctor: We have something called FDA categories in pregnancy which we follow Doctor: i will tell uoi Doctor: you* Doctor: for example : we have 5 categories called A,B,C,D,X Shaiju: ok Doctor: Controlled studies show no risk. Adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate risk to the fetus this is for category A Doctor: No evidence of risk in humans. Either animal findings show risk, but human findings do not; or if no adequate human studies have been done, animal findings are negative this is for CAT B Doctor: Risk cannot be ruled out. Human studies are lacking, and animal studies are either positive for fetal risk or lacking. However, potential benefits may justify the potential risks THIS IS FOR CAT C which the drugs taken fall under Doctor: since this says risks cannot be ruled out Doctor: but human studies have not shown risks so far Doctor: i would give 60 /40 chances Doctor: many doctors do not ask to terminate the pregnancy Doctor: but some doctors do suggest for termination if it is stillin early weeks Doctor: this is a situation of weighing risk over benifits Shaiju: is this going to be the case even in the case of twins Doctor: yes , it includes same for twins as well Doctor: may i know if it is the first child ? Shaiju: yes this is our first Shaiju: we are unable to make a strong decision Doctor: i know this is a situation which needs a lot of thinking Doctor: it may or may not harm the child Doctor: there is no significant evidence so far that there will be problems in the child Doctor: with the medicines she is on Doctor: if she had taken STREPTOMYCIN Doctor: there were possibilities of having a hearing defect Doctor: as I told you the classification also Doctor: it does not rule out chances of risk , but also says it can be given in pregnancy Doctor: it is upto you to make the decision Doctor: I suggest you take a second opinion Shaiju: what are the possible defects that we can expect, if there would be any Doctor: from a good obstretician Doctor: with these drugs , there are not much which has been reported , but very rarely one can see vision problems in the child like color defects Doctor: and also bleeding problems at birth Shaiju: ok doctor Doctor: so i recommend a second opinion Shaiju: could those defects if treated if needed Doctor: you can compare and contrast Doctor: it depends on the level of damage to the eye and other organs Shaiju: will the bleeding affect the mother badly during pregnancy Doctor: it would be difficult for me to say upto what level it causes a damage Doctor: the bleeding can be pevented with supplement vitamins called pyridoxine in pregnancy Doctor: it will not be so severe also Shaiju: whats the percentage of complication in pregnancy Doctor: very rarely limb malformation , kidney malformation , hip dislocation have been reported in some cases , very very few cases so far Doctor: it will not affect the mother Doctor: as such taking AKT4 in pregnancy will notcomplicate the pregnancy if taken under guidance of a good speciailist Shaiju: ok doctor Doctor: so I SUGGEST YOU DISCUSS THIS WITH THE GYNECOLOGIST Shaiju: do we get to talk to a obstretician on this website Doctor: probabaly a second opinion Doctor: yes , you have a phone service as well as mail service for seeking a specialist opinion Doctor: do you want to avail it Doctor: Dr. Chetna JainM.D, M.R.C.O.G., UK Board certification in Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

I appreciate your deepest concern for your unborn children and painstaking effort to get as many opinions as you get. I hope you haven't jumped into hasty decisions by the time you receive this answer. First of all, AKT4 contains 4 drugs that are rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide.All these are first line drugs for tuberculosis.Let's consider one by one,1. Isoniazid belongs to category A drug and is considered safe in pregnancy.2. Pyrazinamide is a category B2 drug which means no studies has been done or data is available regarding its safety but fetal malformations aren't reported. WHO and International Union against TB and Lung diseases support its use in pregnancy although Centre for Disease Control(CDC) says it can probably be used safely in pregnancy.3. Rifampicin is category C drug and is considered safe to use in pregnancy by WHO.Bleeding side effect in newborn and the mother is related to its use in last few weeks of pregnancy and can be prevented by using vitamin k injections.4.Ethambutol is category A drug and safe to use in pregnancy.  P.S-There are very rare risks associated with these drugs. But it doesn't strictly warrant termination of pregnancy. Hope this helps. Enjoy your parenthood with utmost joy. All the best."},{"Patient":"this is my first pregnancy, i went to the doctor last week on friday and was 3cm dilated. the plug passed saturday around 0215, i have had no contractions; is it normal to not feel any pain and when is it a have to go to the hospital time- i don t want to go there and spend 20 hours doing nothing and not being able to eat when i could of spent my time at home resting and eating. i am a bit worried -then again im a worry rat- cuz my baby (he) isnt moving that much, he moves at least once every half hour to an hour compared to before when he wouldn t move for about nine hours in a 24 hour period","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query. Its not uncommon to find cervix dilated even up to 5 or 6 cm without pain although its not the norm. If your pregnancy has remained uncomplicated throughout and if you can reach the hospital within no time if your water breaks or pain starts then you can take that chance of staying at home for sometime.  But its risky when your cervix dilates without pain and your labour progresses very fast and baby is not monitored. So I suggest you to carefully watch for pains or contractions and and get admitted for labour at least when your cervix is 5 to 6 cm dilated.2. Your baby movements are generally restricted during labour and late stages of pregnancy. Your obgyn will assess baby status by taking its heart beat graph( cardiotocograph) which will tell you how baby is doing. Hope this helps.Have a safe delivery. Good luck."},{"Patient":"my 8 year old son has red blotches on his penis and scrotum.some have popped up in the last couple hours,he is currently taking augmenton for another infection.he has 2 spots on his stomach also.could this be chicken pox or an allergic reaction to the augmenton?","Doctor":"Hello, It could be an allergic eruption.

Firstly, if you are trying to conceive, the cause of your previous abortion should be known so that essential steps may be taken to prevent similar things happening again. 2. Secondly, tests to know thyroid profile are ideally done once in 2-3 months to know the effect of the medication. Frequent change in dosage is nor advisable. Your latest TSH report is not available. Based on the earlier findings, it would be ideal if you take the advise of an endocrinologist instead of self-medication. Apart from this, other factors like tubal patency and motility, ovulation status and male factor are also needed to be considered to help conception.

I was wondering how to have positive pregnancy in my day 14 of cycle, my Dr. prescribe for me duphastone 10 mg twice daily. after a week I repeat Beta HCG result was 8900 on 12 july 2010. I was feeling nausea and regular signs of pregnancy. on 19 July I went to do ultrasound to check for the fetus. nothing appear and suspected ectopic after that my Dr. asked me to repeat Beta HCG 28000 so I was admitted for laparoscopic operation for ectopic pregnancy in my left side fallopian tube was removed. I was have no pain but with continuous brownish spotting. Im wondering how the first ultrasound shows folicle in the right side is there any explanation??? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. I will be able to comment further if you can furnish me details of the sonogram reports and also the operative notes. It is quite rare that when the follicle was visualized in the right tube, ectopic was detected in the left tube. This means the fertilized egg instead of travelling into the uterus, traveled via the pelvic cavity into the other fallopian tube, which is a very rare phenomenon. It is possible another follicle in the left tube was missed at the time of the initial scan. Release of multiple follicles simultaneously from both the ovaries also is a rare phenomenon. Hope your query has been answered.

Pregnancy increases strain on a women's heart, and pregnancy also makes blood clot more easily, which can put women at risk for stroke if they have abnormal heart motion.  The fact that she needs a pacemaker is another sign that her heart cannot beat properly on it's own.Therefore, I hope your sister-in-law is getting care at a major medical center and can consult with a high-risk obstetrician, because pregnancy may be an extremely risky state for her.  There is no danger from maternal heart disease to the baby, but the mother may have an increased risk of stroke, heart attack and even death if the pregnancy continues.So without complete review of all you sister-in-law's medical records, I cannot exactly determine what her percent risks are, but all women with severe cardiac disease while pregnant have an increased risk of death.I sincerely hope her doctors will determine the best course of action for her health, which may be to not continue the pregnancy if that is an option.I hope I was able to help answer your question and sincerely wish your sister in law the best of luck for her health and her pregnancy.Sincerely,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, My wife is pregnent with 3 month and in sonography report folloing has came out neck region shows cystic lesion of size 25*23 mm with internal septation.

Will you pls tell me what is the risk and what is the possibilities of having that risk.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope i can help you today.Cystic Hygroma and Meningomyelocele are two different types of abnormailities that can be seen as a lesion in the neck region of the fetus on an ultrasound.Cystic Hygroma is a fluid-filled sac that protrudes from the area of the baby's neck towards the front.  The sac can resolve on it's own, however fetuses with cystic hygroma have an increased risk of being genetically abnormal.  The most common genetic abnormaility associated with cystic hygroma is Down's syndrome.Meningomyelocele is cause by the fetus' spinal cord at the neck not closing properly and some of the spinal cord tissue can bulge out in a sac-like structure.  This disease sometimes requires surgery for treatment of the baby when it is born.Neither of these possibilities has a very good prognosis for the baby.  The doctor wants to check another ultrasound test when the baby is a little larger to confirm the diagnosis, and then further testing of the mother's blood and/or amniocentesis will be necessary to determine the best plan of action.I hope i was able to provide you with valuable information and that i could answer your question with the information available at this time.

Since you have just removed your copper T last month, and if there is no other contraindication, I would suggest you wait for some more time for your cycles to normalise and for you to ovulate naturally. It may take another 4-6 months but it will be worth the wait. Trying to conceive using hormones for ovulation should be reserved for in extreme cases where normal conception is not possible.

Also last wk i went to the dr for a groin lymph node that seemed swollen and she told me that it was bc i shave there and not to worry... but again I am!","Doctor":"Hello!I can totally understand how it feels to find something not normal when you're pregnant, especially knowing that now your baby is dependent on you too. Please donot worry and take care of your health and diet. Both the mole and the lymph node in the groin can very well be explained simply. The mole may have shown some minor change in size or colour (which may rarely happen during pregnancy); hence your dermatologist wants to get it removed and examined, but if he is not insisting on it to get it done immediately, I'm sure it is not something very serious and urgent.As regards the groin lymph node, any minor trauma to to lower limb including a small bump or a scratch or a small boil may make it large enough to be felt. If your doctor has found no other specific focus of infection on examination, we can safely wait and watch; most likely it will regress on its own in a couple of weeks.

The test should be repeated again in 2-3 weeks and if the titres show a rise, the infection is considered to be recent and further management planned actively.

It was a really light flow and didn t have the normal clots in it. I didn t cramp and it last for 5 days off and on I wore a pantiliner the whole time. I took a test three days after it stopped and it was still negative. but this week I have had sore tender tender breast and my periods not due until February 24 my husband said the inside of my lady part has a bluish look to it and that my breast are enlarged and darker. I had this belt I wore three months ago and I can not wear it any longer because my hips have spread for some reason. I have been to a health department and they think since me and my husband want a baby and a pregnancy that we are both thinking every symptom is pregnancy. but how do you explain the bluish vulva? I really need answers on what I should do.","Doctor":"Dear Madam,I do empathise your concern. However, the first cardinal symptom of pregnancy is missing a period (though occasionally some women may get menses in first couple of months of pregnancy). You had periods, however, somewhat lighter. This should be taken into consideration. The other symptoms follow about one or two weeks later. They are:* Nausea and vomiting with pica: You do not seem to have them.* Frequency of urination which you do not seem to have.* Breast changes: - Engorgement and tenderness which you are having- Dark discolouration of the nipples and areola: This also you have noticed. Along with this, the size of areola also increases. Are there any tubercles under the areola? They will go more in favour of pregnancy. - Secretions from the nipples: They will be strongly supporting the pregnancy. We do not diagnose the pregnancy only on the symptoms; they have to be supported by confirmatory evidences like pregnancy test and/or clinical findings. However, your pregnancy test is negative. Madam, I feel you have carried out this test rather too early. These tests may report false negative in the first week after missed period. Hence, repeat the test after about 4 days; however, going for Beta hCG test would be more reliable. This is highly specific and sensitive test. The levels of hCG > 25 will confirm the pregnancy. If this test also reveals that you are not pregnant, you have to accept the diagnosis and attribute the symptoms to some other cause like increase in weight or so. Let the bluish discolouration of vagina be confirmed by Gynaecologist instead of a lay person like your husband. I hope this has given you a valid clue to resolve your dilemma."},{"Patient":"Dear Dr Jain, I just check my urine this morning and find that I may be pregnant. The test result in the test region shown a lightly pink colored line which worried me so much.... Am I really pregnant? For me, my story is quite complicated. I had separated with my husband for a year. Yet, we are still keep in close contact and he still cares about me so much. In the middle of last month, it was our 3rd anniversary. We had dinner on that night and ....... we finally had unprotected sex. Actually that was not the first time we had sex again despite we are separated. Over the year of separation, we both feel guilty to have the consequence to be separated. On 4 Feb 2010, we had unsafe sex. On that day, I guess it s likely to be pregnant as my date of my period in January was 24 Jan 2010. So on the date of sex, that was Day 11 .... I worried to be pregnant so I went to see the doctor. The doctor give me two pieces of postinor2. Then, my period was come on 21 Feb 2010. As I said, we had sex again after the 3rd anniversary dinner on 21 March 2010. Since my period was not yet come, and that was already a month ago for my last period on 21 Feb 2010, so we had unsafe sex again. My period was supposed to be on 22 March 2010 as my period was so regular that usually for every 28 days/ cycle. However, it was late for more than 2 weeks and I have the pregnancy test. The result today was ??? positive. My worry is: 1. If I was pregnant, will the effect of postinor2 which I taken about 7 weeks ago before our intersexual course affect the development of my baby? 2. I had sore throat in the recent 2 weeks, I had taken lysosome chloride for sore throat, will it affect my baby? 3. If we don t want that baby and decide for abortion (now I was 35 years old and my hubby was 39 years old), will it affect the future chance of having a baby?? Kindly request for your reply. Frustrated Lady X.","Doctor":"Dear x,Let me address your concerns one by one.1. Postinor is an emergency contraceptive which has worked well in your case by preventing pregnancy and you did get your periods that cycle. So drop your concern about that.2.lysozyme is a natural enzyme of the body and is unlikely to cause any effect on the baby. Relax.3.Regarding your last question about your future pregnancy, chances are that it might get a bit difficult keeping in mind your age which is regarded as advanced maternal age and also likihood of pregnancy associated medical problems like gestational diabetes etc at that age. So it will be wise to consider pregnancy early from reproductive stand point. You can plan your pregnancy by buying some time if you have a good ovarian reserve( known by some blood tests like amh) or by considering ovum freezing.4. Another thing I would like suggest is according to your menstrual dates its 6 weeks by which time you should have seen a strong positive line on your card test. So kindly fix an appointment with your physician for early pregnancy evaluation .good luck."},{"Patient":"hi, my baby BPD is 37 mm, and FL is 23 mm, and AC is 94 mm, and HC is 137 mm, and i am 16 weeks pregnant...does these measures match with the normal growth of my baby, and do they say anything about the health of my baby?....and can these measures detect weather it is a baby boy or girl","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for the query. Let me explain you,1. What is more important than the measurement is the centile marking on the fetal growth chart provided by your sonologist report. ( it looks like a graph for each category with upper limit and lower limit) .you can say values are normal if it falls between 5th and 95th percentile. Anything above or below it is a concern.2. These measurements when in normal range suggests baby s physical growth is appropriate.3.For structural growth you need to rely on anomaly scan done between 18 to 20 weeks.4.Lastly, it is not possible to detect gender of the baby based on these measurements.Hope your query is satisfactorily answered. Good luck."},{"Patient":"I am about 27 weeks pregnant with twins and have been having tightening and pain in my stomache for about an hour now. Some have been pretty bad but they are not really regular. If I get up and walk they get worse though. I am wondering if I should just go in or if its just braxton hicks.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You are carrying twin pregnancy. Twin pregnancy is prone for premature delivery due to overstretching of the uterus. However, 27 weeks gestation is too early for management of the premature child. The uterus is continuously contracting and relaxing throughout the pregnancy. You have very rightly mentioned them as Braxton Hick's contractions. However, Braxton Hick's contractions are never painful contractions. If you are getting pain also, they could be early labour contractions. Please report to the Obstetrician ASAP. You need to be on the bed and put on uterine relaxants like Salbutamol and Progetational preparation like Susten for maintenance. Once the uterine contractions have subsided, then also you should continue to take bed rest. You have yet not completed 28 weeks. So the possibility of week mouth of the uterus (incompetent cervical internal os) should be ruled out; though it usually does not cause painful uterine contractions for prolonged period. Incompetent internal os needs cervical stitch for reinforcement which is removed just before delivery. I hope you will take quick action to report to the Obstetrician."},{"Patient":"Hello Docter i m a wife who been married for almost 10 month.All this time we tried all kind way to have the little one come in our life but it s look like very hard to get it.The thing i want to ask how n what way should we take to get the little one come fast.For you know sir that my husband very fast went to ejaculation more ever when he in very tired situation.As for me i really hard in focus when do that if my husband forced m.Also when we checking to the docter he said i m very healty condition.Or this coz i m to fat but i have friend ever fatter than me she got it just in couple a month after her married.What should do n eat or else?","Doctor":"Hi,   Thanks for the query.I understand your concern.

Please type your query here...i am in third trimester and went to hospital because I felt something come out of my vagina while peeing and didn t see it , for a few seconds I smelt differently, not bad just differently. the NP there took a swab and analyzed it saying that it isn t BV and that according to her experience that it looked like yeast. However, it appeared that due to that she decided not to analyze further I think. Now it is about 6 days later and after scratching one side of my vagina where it crevices with my leg, I see an oval sore about one inch long that is swollen and sensitive to moisture. When she showed me the test tube of what the specimen looked like I saw a thin milky liquid with a touch of gray in it . A few days prior I had a day of discharge that was so bright yellow it was that of egg yolk. I also noticed sometimes a trickly down my thigh on the same side of the boil of the same looking liquid she got from the swab of my cervix.

Here abortion is very expensive. So we used Cytolog tablets bough from india. Please advise will it help. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Cytolog or misoprostol pills are for the expulsion of products of conception. It just acts by causing contraction of the uterus. Your wife had taken 2 pills without any effect. It is naturally so as for expulsion, the products need to be separated from maternal body.If you are intending to go for medical termination of pregnancy with pills she has to purchase an MTP kit which has 5 pills.• Take 200 mg pills of mifepristone.• After 48 hours she has to take 2 pills of misoprostol/cytolog (vaginally or orally).• In case there is no bleeding she can add 2 more pills of misoprostol after 12 hours.Mostly bleeding starts and abortion may complete by 2 days to 10 days. Check up by a gynecologist after 15 days to confirm complete abortion.*BUT there may be incomplete abortion/profuse bleeding/infection.

She is taking full rest. I just want to know can this medicine lead us to 9 months to deliver baby? Or there is a risk of delivering a baby before it get mature. pls help.","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for your query. Duvadilan retard (isoxsuprine) relaxes the uterine smooth muscle, thus preventing Labour. If your wife takes adequate rest and medications there is a very good chance that she will complete the term and deliver a full term baby. Is her cervical length normal?(more than 3 cms). If less than 2.5cms, chances of preterm Labour is higher. This can be treated by cervical encirclage followed by bed rest. Monitor the baby movements. Have your wife practice some relaxing techniques like meditation, breathing exercises to calm her mind. False contractions (Braxton - hicks) will be present now and can happen at any time. This is usually felt as a tightening of the uterus and may be associated with some discomfort but not pain. It is irregular and can be triggered by emotions, hunger, full stomach or baby movements. If the contractions are regular and become more frequent with period like pain, contact her obstetrician right away. In this time, try not to panic and practice calming breathing exercises along with your wife. If it occurs after 37weeks, baby will be mature enough to survive on its own, provided there are no other complications. If this occurs before 37 weeks, steroid injections to speed up the lung maturation process may be necessary. If before 35 weeks, attempts to delay Labour will be made. If that doesn't work out, your baby may need close monitoring in an intensive care till he is stable.This is just so that you may be prepared. In most cases, we are looking at the first outcome. There is a risk of preterm Labour. However, if monitored closely, with rest and medications, this can be minimized. Being prepared for any event is necessary. Keep the doctor's, hospital's Labour room numbers handy along with a few people who will be able to assist you during that time. Pack a weeks worth of clothes for yourself, wife and baby. Plan for someone to travel back and forth between hospital and home or someone to stay with your wife while you do so. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with. Wish you all good health and I pray for a safe confinement."},{"Patient":"I was put on Clomid this month for luteal phase defect days 3-7.

Is that normal? before clomid I would have a drop and then a spike that stayed up for about 9 days and then would drop the day I started. I have 28-30 day cycles. I took a hpt this morning and received a negative. Not sure which day I ovulated.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Pregnancy test on urine (HPT) would not be useful to ascertain or even detect ovulation. These tests are specifically meant to diagnose pregnancy.Your BBT chart changes suggest that you have ovulated on the day when you had an ascending spike. Just before the ovulation, there is a drop by about half a degree followed by rise of one degree when ovulation takes place. Then again there is a fall by half a degree and the temperature remains that high. You are on Clomid; i.e. Clomiphene citrate. This medicine can cause release of more than one eggs. Hence you had two spikes of temperature rise . However, to ascertain the evidence of ovulation, ultrasonography is the best tool at our hands. Ovulation monitoring by USG can spot the day of ovulation. It can inform us about the number of egg released also. Apart from the visual evidence of ovulation, it provides following important relevant information:1. Follicular size at the time of ovulation: Follicles between 18 mm and 21 mm release healthiest eggs which can result into successful pregnancies. It may facilitate the decision of hCG injection if planned for. 2. Endometrial thickness: Uterine lining (endometrium) between 9 mm to 14 mm thickness is most conducive for the implantation of the fertilized ovum. I hope you will take help of USG in future rather than just relying on BBT chart."},{"Patient":"hi, sorry to bother you, im just a bit worried, i havt had a period since the end of jan, beginning of feb, over the last few weeks iv noticed that im a lot more tired than usual, although i have been working a lot, my stomach is quite bloated, and i have gone off smoking, from an average of ten a day, to two, and sometimes none, i just dont feel like it, when (im sorry to say) only a few weeks ago i used to enjoy it.

So, yes madam, missing a period should be looked upon as first cardinal symptom to suspect pregnancy. The other cardinal symptoms of pregnancy, which usually appear about a week to 10 days after missed period are:1. Nausea and vomiting with pica: Your repulsion towards smoking may be attributed to pica. Even you may experience aversion to certain types of, in particular fried and spicy food. 2. Frequent urination.3. Breast changes: Engorgement of the breasts with tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples and areola with areolar widening, Montgomery's tubercles under areola and secretions though nipples. You have not mentioned any other symptoms. So I presume they may be absent. However, all the symptoms may not be present in each individual. Hence I feel the best option for you would be to perform pregnancy test on the overnight first early morning urine sample.

My hubby Manjunath, 36 yrs is a lecturer. Planned to start with the family & underwent some Ayurvedic & Hallopathy treatments. Doctors informed us that I had PCOD & my husbby semen count is low. After waiting for 1 yr, we are now consulting Dr. Kamini Rao. They started with routine check ups, laproscopy & put us on medicines. My PCOD problem does not exist & both my fallopian tubes are patent. They say that the problem persists with the semen count of my husband. The details are mailed to YYYY@YYYY . We underwent 2 cycles of IUI & later senior Dr in Kamini Rao hospital suggested us to go for IVF. We underwent IVF last Aug, 09 and it was a failure. IVF details are mailed. Now, the Doctor suggests us to go for another cycle of IVF. Kindly request you to guide us in this & let us know how to proceed with the treatment. We are really open for your thoughts.

Along with antibiotic like Althrocin ( if the nasal discharge is thick & yellow along with fever   self care-    - Take vapor inhalation twice a day ( early morning & night)/ drink warm water/ hot  saline gargles with a pinch of salt   - Take nasal saline spray,   - keep away from allergen,   - keep moving.. it decreases allergy symptoms    Consult your doctor before starting the medication.. for suitable dosage in your case.

This doesn t add up ? How far along could I actually be ? Thanks","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If you understand some basic facts of conception, your dilemma about the day of conception would be clear. The conception takes place on or within 24 hours of the egg release (ovulation) as the egg can live only up to 24 hours. The day of ovulation is 14 days prior to the next expected menses. You had your last menstrual period on 21 January and the next expected period was 25 February (21 Feb +  4 days). So your day of ovulation is about 11 February. Therefore the day of conception would be around that day. Though clinically the period of gestation is calculated from the date of last menstrual period (LMP), actual conception takes place around 2 weeks later. This has probably created the confusion for you. Pregnancy of 3-4 weeks from the date of LMP is actually 2 weeks lesser in age. To further clarify this dilemma, you may get ultrasonography done. By ultrasonography, the age of the embryo is calculated by its size. Hence it would be the real age of the embryo; i.e. calculated from the day of conception. However, please be aware that in such early stages of pregnancy, there could be variation by few days to a week in calculating the age of embryo. I hope this resolves your dilemma."},{"Patient":"This past summer I had a white patch of skin under the top part of my penis tip.  It was milky in color and looked like dry skin.  It did not hurt at all. A week later I had the urge to urinate and a slight tingling after I urinated.   I went to the clinic and the doctor told me that I had a large amount of protein in my system which had most likely caused an infection.  She told me the white patch looked like a friction rub.  I had been masturbating a lot.  I met a girl in September and we are still together now.  We had unprotected sex in October in November the symptom came back there was a tiny bump on the shaft of my penis with no pain and it again bothered me when I urinated.  I went to the Dr. to get a full blood work.  Everything came back negative except for Herpes 1.  Its now Feb and I see another pimple like bump on my circumcision line.  It does not hurt but looks very pale.  It is close to where the first abrasion was located (this are is now darker).  I have been paranoid and been putting ointments and rubbing alcohol on my penis to get rid of any germs.  Again the bumps never hurt, never flake or fill up with puss like a typical cold sore that I've had years ago on my lip.  Could this been a skin issue due to my girlfriends vaginal fluid (she just went on the pill), hygiene ( i work out 5 days a week), or an STD that hasnt shown up.  I have also never seen any discharge from my penis.  It takes several weeks for it to go away and normally there is just one.","Doctor":"Hello, As a first line management, you can apply low potency steroid creams like Betamethasone for symptomatic relief. If the lesion persists, it is better to consult a dermatologist and get evaluated. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

My obgyn examined me about 2 months ago and said that she didn t feel anything abnormal and that this was normal during pregnancy. Should I still be worried or get a second opinion?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,During pregnancy, there is generalized engorgement of the breasts as a whole. This is due to the hormonal changes in the body. Though the breast is seen on the front side of the chest wall, it has got a tail which extends up to the armpit. This is known as The Axillary Tail of the Breast.  As the breasts get engorged, depending up on the degree of engorgement, this Axillary tail also gets engorged. So what you are feeling the soreness and swelling under the armpit is nothing but the part of breast engorgement involving the Axillary tail of the breasts. I do not feel you need any second opinion. In fact I have given you the second opinion with physiological and anatomical explanation. :)I hope this takes away all your worries."},{"Patient":"I am a pregnant 39 year woman, 5 wks 5 days (LMP 05/05/10).

Clearly, an abnormal rise, at least at the start. I understand there may be some concern that it s an ectopic pregnancy, but I am wondering if there is a chance that this is still a viable pregnancy? I will have an ultrasound next week, unless I develop concerning symptoms (I have had no bleeding, but have had some mild cramping). I am using Progesterone 200mg intra-vaginally at bedtime. This is my 5th pregnancy: 3 miscarriages, and 1 live birth. Thank you in advance for your kind insight into this matter.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcare magic.Rule of thumb is that in viable intrauterine pregnancy pregnancy the beta hcg level increases by 66% (RCOG guideline).In case of an ectopic pregnancy the beta hcg level DOESNOT RISE as per the above mentioned level. So a falling beta hcg level is an indicator of ectopic pregnancy or missed abortion.In your case there has been a rise and not fall.

Since you are a feeding mother, you need to be extra careful not to contaminate the baby. Please see a physician and get the rash examined. If needed, go for oral antibiotic therapy. Mupirocin (Bactroban) has very good proved efficacy. The infection as well as the need to feed the baby apart from taking care of a toddler, put together must be causing the weakness. In the current scenario, I would suggest some delay in trying to conceive again. This is needed to recoup and become healthier once again to cope with yet another pregnancy.

She was having hypothyroidism and PCOS in right ovary and her periods are also irregular (period cycle is after 2 - 3 months and will last for at least 6 days with heavy bleeding. As consulted by a gyne, she has taken 4 cycles of Herface (contraceptive pills) and she is taking Thyroxin (50mg) for hypothyroidism which has now settled down to normal. Now after 8 months of treatment she is still unable to conceive. Now her doc (gyne) has advised to have an ultrasound of lower abdomen (TVS), below is the report: ULTRA-SOUND LOWER ABDOMEN – TRANSVAGINAL U/S ALSO DONE. Uterus is anteverted normal in size, shape and outline. Uterus measures 53*68*31mm Myometrial and Endometrial abdomen are normal. Cervix is bulky with multiple nabothian cyst of 4mm. Endometrial thickness is 6.1mm Both ovaries are enlarged in size, shape and echopattern. Evdience of irregularly arranged multiple 6 to 10 mm size follicles. Right Ovary volume : 16 ml, left ovary volume :14ml No adnexal mass is seen. There is no fulid in the cul-de-Sac Impression – *Bilateral Multicystic Ovarian Changes. *Chorinic Cervicites. Doc also told for an for ovulation test (i am not sure if i have written the correct test name, she(gyne) asked to visit my wife within 24 hours of periods for the test and told that the report will come after 25 days) but she was unable to perform the test (or she was unable to take the sample from her vagina, she told that my wife has a bifurcated septum inside vagina/ovary). I just wanted to be sure that she (gyne) is going tin the right direction. Now after the US report she is suggesting for another 3 cycles (months) of Herface/Meprate (contraceptive pills) which means for 3 months she wont be able to conceive and i am not sure if after 3 moths will it fix the problem or not. Also she has asked to visit after 3 days of the periods for another test (that i don t know) and also asking to go for the 1st test i mentioned(withing 24 hours of periods).

Though it has been stated that there can be low IQ in the babies born after maternal ketone bodies are high, it is suggested that the actual reason behind this finding is the inability to maintain the insulin levels that could be causative.

Orange vaginal discharge during pregnancy is not normal and it indicates some amount of spotting mixed with the normal white discharge; alternatively, vaginal infections also can cause such type of discharge. A local examination is necessary to detect the cause. If there is no infection and there is no active bleeding, you can manage by observation.

Shooting backache during pregnancy can mean a cervical origin. Either the cervix is getting slowly shortened and dilated or the fetal parts are descending on to the cervix exerting pressure. Infection of the urinary tract is another factor that should be paid attention. In the current scenario, you should report the matter immediately to your consultant and go for a check up. Curling up is not advisable as it puts undue pressure on the abdomen and thereby the enlarging uterus. Hope your query has been answered.

I guess the only way that i can really explain how i feel is to start at the very beginning so i hope you all have time. I have no one else to ask and no one else is taking me seriously. So i decided that i would try one more time to talk to someone. Since around the age of 13 i was on paxil, it helped A LOT with anxiety, i never found a need to get off of it until i accidentally found myself pregnant at age 18. When i was at the OBGYN the nurse told me that i could not be on paxil while i was pregnant and that i needed to try Zoloft. I never saw the Dr, i never talked to them or anything, i just discontinued my paxil and i began zoloft. The first few days i didn’t feel too bad, i didn’t feel quite right, but i didn’t feel terrible. Than for the next month almost (give or take) after that i had every bad side effect that i could have imagined. I read the side effects for the zoloft and i had 90% of what was listed. I told the Drs several times that i didn’t feel good and that i didn’t want to try any other pill i just wanted to stop taking all of them. After i stopped taking everything all together i felt like i was having withdrawal. I have not felt good since. I am no longer pregnant... i did have an abortion.. but that is a touchy subject.. but i figured that’s also involved with health so i needed to not leave out any details. It has been about 8 months since i have stopped all together and i still to this day do not feel good, every single day i have this odd headache. It feels like pressure in my head. I still have some of the issues that i developed while taking zoloft, which i was told would go away once i stopped and 8 months later i am still dealing with, such as my ears ringing, constantly. I never had that problem before this. I have had countless problems since zoloft and i have been trying to feel better without resulting back to paxil, i like being able to know that i can live without it, i no longer have panic attacks, and if i do on a rare occasion i can control it. I feel i have no need to go back on to paxil, but my dr pretty much insists that i go back on it because he is convinced the way that i feel now is all because of that. The way that i feel right now is a pressure in my head, mainly in my forehead and in the back of my head. If i press on certain parts of my head its sore as if its a soft spot. I have a chronic sinus infection that i have had to treat on and off the allergy seasons with antibiotics, which make that clear up, and strangely enough make my head feel completely better. Many of the Dr s thought that it was the sinus infections that was making my head feel weird. But i asked them why than would i feel pressure in the back of my head when i have no sinus s there? So that blew that theory out. I have also had bacterial and yeast infections every once in a while that also had to be treated with antibiotics, and again, (no sinus infection issues at the time) my head would feel better. Another example of this was when i had another bacterial or yeast infection of some kind and while i was taking my antibiotic it began to make my head feel better, but before i was done taking them it started to feel weird again... So talking with my nose dr he decided that it would be a bad idea to take anymore antibiotics because he thought that they were treating SOMETHING in my head, but no one knew for sure what that SOMETHING was. But he said that if we kept miss treating it with antibiotics than it would soon become immune to them. So since then i have refused to take another antibiotic because i do not want to make anything any worse, but the problem is we have made ZERO progress on what is actually wrong, i have spent over 500 dollars trying to find out what exactly is wrong and we have gotten no where. I began to get worried and i asked for an MRI, and a CT scan, apparently they both came back normal, but i had no one read them to me or go over what exactly there was... but they did assure me that i had no tumor or anything. So that helped reassure me for the time being. I have had multiple blood tests for many different things and they assure me that i have no infections or anything, (which confuses me, because if i have a chronic sinus infection.. shouldn’t that show up?..) but either way they assure me that there is no infection. So i am feeling like i am on my own. I have done research trying to find something, anything that could give the same kind of symptoms of what i am feeling, and i stumbled across meningitis. Now i understand that meningitis is usually severe and can do damage in as little as one day... but i have also found and i will quote it exactly as i found it Occasionally, if someone has been on antibiotics for another infection, the symptoms can take longer to develop or may be less intense my source is from WEBMD. Meningitis can also be caused by the spread of an infection occurring near the brain, such as from the ears or the sinuses. It is also an occasional complication of brain, head, or neck surgery. which i was thinking could have something to do with my sinus infection ( which i now have AGAIN, but cant treat because i cant take antibiotics until we find out what is wrong with my head and why it feels better with antibiotics). I have tried talking to 3 different doctors. My primary, My ear nose and throat doctor, and they both ended up sending me to another doctor... which i cant quite remember who or what he is suppose to do.. but all i remember is him being extremely rude and ignored anything and everything that i had to say.. so i got absolutely no where with him. I left his office in tears and had to pay 80 or more dollars just to be in the same exact spot I’ve been in for months. I have had blood work done and many other things done, i asked my primary doctor out of desperation and last measures to see if i could get a spinal tap to make absolutely sure that it was not meningitis. I am exhausting every option, i am running out of money and i am desperately searching for an answer. I am 19 years old and i have no idea what is wrong with me, it is effecting my everyday life and i have spent so much time, energy and money into figuring out the possible cause of what is going on. I feel like no one is taking me seriously now because my primary doctor has just suggested that i try taking my paxil again. Its very frustrating because i feel like no one takes me seriously once they learn that i have anxiety and they assume that it is all in my head or just taking a simple pill with help make everything better. It just seems like whatever it is, is getting worse, and i would really appreciate help from anyone that is willing to help. I have not taken antibiotics in many months and i feel like my head just keeps getting worse. I don’t know how to explain it... i have been told that it could be cluster headaches... but i have had headaches, i have had migraines.. they are nothing like this. It is a constant, all day everyday, from the second that i wake up to the minute before i fall asleep the same feeling. Lately i have felt extremely tired, my eyes have started to hurt.. i had to go to the eye dr because my vision has been doing weird things, but they said that i have perfect vision and the only problem i have is i have hard corneas.. or whatever that is that causes you to have higher pressure in your eyes without having glaucoma. I have been noticing trails, i see halos around objects mostly people, i see something that i would consider visual static.. and this has all started just recently.. about maybe a month its been happening and getting worse. At first i could see visual static and maybe every once in a while i would see trails, than i started to see halos. I try to ignore it, because i don’t have enough money to go in for a check up any more, i don’t know whets wrong so i don’t know how to have anyone fix it. The reason that i decided to write to you today and not try to ignore it like i do every other day is because i was in the shower today and out of no where i felt like i was going to pass out, i felt this weird sensation that the room was just getting dark and i was just going to pass out, so i jumped out of the shower and sat on the floor for a minute. I had this stabbing pain in my back and my stomach and i felt like i was going to puke, when i felt as if i could stand i did so, and i left the room to get some fresh air, immediately i felt as if i was going to puke again and i ran into the bathroom and i had one dry heave... and felt completely normal again. That is the first time anything like that has ever happened to me before. So please, i am completely lost on what to do. All i want to know is how do i find out what could be wrong with how my head feels. What could be causing it, why does it feel better with antibiotics and what can i do. Please if you have any words of advice please let me know. I am sorry for such a long note but i am running out of people to talk to. Please and thank you. Amber Mamerow","Doctor":"Hello Amber. I completely understand how it feels not to be taken seriously. While I was going through your answer, diagnoses like chronic sinusitis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and also vascular headaches did occur to me, but they are difficult to prove with a normal MRI or CT (not vascular headaches though, they appear normal on imaging). The paxil you were taking earlier is not only an anti-anxiety drug but also is used in certain intractable pains, hence I feel your doctor had asked you to restart it hoping for some positive results. However, since you are firm that you donot want to restart it, and I appreciate the decision of trying to manage without the anxiety pills, I feel we have to move on to other possibilities - Benign Intracranial Hypertension is one of them. I would suggest you to get Vitamin A levels too. A spinal tap would certainly help in this case to reach a diagnosis. Hope this helps.Regards,Dr Geeta"},{"Patient":"hello there well im 19 years old and me and my boyfriend have regular unprotected sex but i dont get pregnant my period would b regular then irregular it will leave then come back i lost a baby at 16 i went 5months without my period they told me that it was an abnormal pregnancy do you think u can tell me what is going on","Doctor":"HI,    Thanks for your query. I do understand your concern.     I am sorry for the loss of pregnancy you had 3 years back. Most of the times cause of pregnancy loss is pregnancy abnormality/  viral fevers in mother/ fall  with trauma  to abdomen .So once abnormal need not be same again Please don't worry.    Now after so many days, we can think of repeat possibility after blood tests ( Thyroid function tests, VDRL ) with expert opinion.    * THe 5 months lack of menses you hsd can be hormonal imbalance immediately after delivery/of due to certain conditions like PCOD afterwords.     *  I think irregularity of period you have is the cause of non conception in your case . So You need a gynecologist's advise/ investigations (   Hb% to assess your general condition/ USG abdomen/thyroid function tests/ hormonal estimation & after knowing the exact cause, you would be given specific treatment.. so as you start having normal menses with ovulation.    - At the same time some weakness in semen acn also be the cause.. which needs to be excluded/ treated with doctor's advise.    - Psychological trauma due to lost pregnancy, fear & anxiety can lead to hormonal imbalance/ irregular periods & lack of .So you should discuss the thing & your doubts with your doctor, get a clear concept & be free from any tension... this will help conception.    Thanks."},{"Patient":"I m about 10wks pregnant and have been to my midwife for a urine test, she found traces of thrush however she said there was nothing to worry about.

I hope you re doing fine & I d like to say in advance how much I appreciate your feedback regarding this urgent situation. My sister who currently resides in Jakarta, Indonesia is 3 months pregnant and is not doing well now. She had severe bleeding a few weeks ago, but was told that her baby survived the crisis & is still ok. She has been advised by a doctor there to go for surgery to sew up her womb, but a 2nd opinion from another doctor advised her against it. She also suffers from pain as well now & is unsure what to do. She s been told that her womb is weak, that is why she had the bleeding & may face complications later on in her pregnancy. Please help give us advice on what possible options are available to her, & whether surgery may be the best option, & what the risks are. She is very worried & scared & we are all uncertain what to do, but I d like to help her. Sincerely appreciate your kind assistance in this matter. Regards, Natasha.","Doctor":"Dear Natasha,It seems your doctor has suspected weakness in the mouth of the uterus. It is called as incompetent cervix. This deficiency leads to repeated abortions in the middle three months of pregnancy. If the diagnosis is right, you will require a stitch around the mouth of the uterus (cervix) to reinforce it. However, such condition threatens the pregnancy between 14 weeks to 28 weeks of pregnancy. Moreover, severe bleeding does not fit into the clinical picture of incompetent cervical os.  Therefore you have first to find out the cause of the bleeding. Placental separation from a normally situated placenta (abruptio placentae) or from low lying placenta (placenta praevia) - both are rather threatening conditions. The formal leads to bleeding with pain while the later is a painless, causeless and recurrent bleeding. However, these accidents take place in the later half of the pregnancy. If the cause for the bleeding is completely cured, there is no possibility for recurrent bleeding and you have incompetent cervical os, you will have to undergo encirclage of the cervix. Ultrasonography at this stage will help you to reach the diagnosis. It will locate the site of bleeding and whether it has completely stopped, it will locate the site of placenta and also it will find out the status of cervical os. However, tightening the cervix before 14 weeks of pregnancy are completed cannot be accepted scientifically. Madam, from your history, I do not feel you are having incompetent cervical os. Please get the cause of your bleeding diagnosed from a Gynaecologist first by required investigations and concentrate on the treatment for that. I hope this will guide you appropriately."},{"Patient":"i am not a diabetic but want to know what must my sugar level be fasting and non fasting during pregnancy, i am 39 weeks pregnant and my sugar was 6.1 fryday fasting and 2 - 3 hours after lunch it was 9.

There are several causes for failure of conception. For the male part, the sperm count, progressive motility and liquefaction are important. For the female part, regular ovulation, proper tubal and uterine function, absence of anti-sperm antibodies are important. Intercourse should be done at least on alternate days around ovulation, i.e., two weeks prior to the onset of the next menstrual cycle. If your wife has a retroverted uterus, lying on the stomach for sometime after the intercourse will help to retain the sperm longer. Alternatively, placing a pillow beneath the hip region may also be tried if there is a spillage of semen. You can get further help from a specialist.

From my last menstrual cycle start it is now 46 days ( though I know the conception could only be a maximum of 40 days ago) and in the scan done yesterday the doctor says the foetus seen is only showing 35 day growth. This could be due to the thyroid causing delayed growth or the foetus having stopped growth due to the same or some reason. Also I had mild discharge yesterdy of brown period like strands, though very little. The doctor has adviced me to take some Thyroid medication and the following : Dufaston and Trenaxa 100 mg; and to wait till the next 10 days after which we can scan and see the growth and test TSH. If all is not well we may need to medically cleanse the uterus, as it is known that Thyroid abnormality may cause improper intellectual and other growth in the baby, or the baby may have stopped growing by then.

Presense of pelviectasis solely doesn't mean your girl has any problem that has to be taken care of immediately. It requires serial ultrasonography to monitor the size of renal pelvis, kidneys and ureters to assess any damage if there is any.Babies with down's syndrome usually have higher rate of urinary tract abnormalities in comparison with normal babies.

I understand your concern.    The oral contraceptives need to be taken regularly, every day and at a fixed time every day too.  You have taken it delayed for 2 days.. & also missed 3 pills at a stretch in same month.     This runs all the risk of rebound ovulation & may be conception also.     In case you are pregnant( conformed by HCG blood testing around expected menses/ by urine pregnancy test 8 days delay in periods.

Then i started bleeding about March 7th and it only lasted about 2 or 3 days. and it was nothing like my normal periods at all. my periods are normally about 6 or 7 days. it was really dark at first and light. then lasted 20 minutes, then the next morning it started back up again and it was dark still but with some pinkish red in it, and then it had a little more blood but not a lot to fill a pad. but i wasn t suppose to start my period until around March 19th which i didn t never start that.On march 11th something bad happened and i was under a lot of stress. But i had already ovulated around the time i was suppose to which was march2nd-march7th. then i thought since i was bleeding beginning of march that i would start around the beginning of April but i haven t started yet. i took a pregnancy test like 2 weeks ago but it said negative. =(. but i still just feel like i could be pregnant. and plus no period still. so ill wait until next week and if no period still then I m going to the hospital to find out why I m not starting my period if I m not pregnant. but i hope they will tell me that I m pregnant. we re really hoping I m pregnant. but if not then we re TTC ASAP and going to keep trying. But i know that stress can cause your period to be late, but people have told me its only caused to be late from stress if also the women ovulated late. because i read that when a women ovulates late then period will be late because there s no menstrual cycle to pass through. but that it the women had already ovulated and then got stress then only stress its self can t make woman s period late if they have already ovulated. So does anyone think I could be pregnant? please give me advise. and me and my boyfriend are hoping I m pregnant.","Doctor":"HI,    Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.     You have very sleek chance of conception.. because of the sex on 4th of March.. & sperms can be active up to 3 days after ejaculation.       The bleeding you had on 7th was probably ovulation bleeding.      In that case pregnancy test should be positive by end of March ( with  home pregnancy test. ) / by 3rd week of march by blood pregnancy  HCG test .    You should go for the test at proper time for exact results.

I am a single mother to my two children aged 8 and 3 and i am 25. I gave up smoking cold turkey a few days ago for the babys sake but quitting has made my nausea worse and moods very low. The constant feeling of sickness is dehabilitating and i cant take my kids to school or nursery i have to lay curled up for hours at a time and its making me very depressed. I have made an effort to eat healthy foods and have bought travel/morning sickness bands that have had little effect.. i feel like my life is slipping away from me as i cant go anywhere and dont have much support from anybody, even my own mother is fed up of me being ill.. What can i do to feel better????","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. If the infection has cleared up, you need to concentrate on getting a healthy diet, adequate rest and proper follow up. It is also likely that you could be suffering withdrawal, for which, you need to take proper counselling. The stress of being a single mother is adding up to your woes, but, please remember, no time is going to stay forever. You can ask your consultant for medication to deal with the nausea, try to change your diet, have small frequent meals and develop a positive attitude. You are so young and have a lot of life ahead of you. You must support yourself first before any body can support you. Only then will others begin to recognize your efforts and start helping you.

I will be able to comment better if you can furnish me the details of your sonography report. It appears from your description that you have a subchorionic bleed. You did not mention the age of your pregnancy. Your doctor has prescribed methylfolate, cephalosporin, chorionic gonadotropin and herbal remedy to treat bowel irritability. Please let me know if you have any other symptoms like diarrhea. Also, I am unable to understand why you have been asked to take the antibiotic. It is true that infections can lead to such a clinical picture, but, use of any medication should be limited during the first trimester. Please take absolute bed rest, avoid stress and sexual intercourse. Most of the bleeds subside with this management. Follow up sonograms are mandatory. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, I recently taken 14 tablets (1 tab, twice daily for 7 days) of Primolut-N 5mg. I didnt get my period (which i have previously i as i took a course to get a period so I could take clomid for fertility), so decided to take a pregnancy test. It has come back positive! What are the side effects of taking primolut when pregnant. I know that its says very strongly not too. And what are the chances of something being wrong with my baby. PLEASE HELP.. Worried","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Please get rid of all your worries even before you start reading the following explanation. Primolut-N is a progesterone preparation. Progesterone is a hormone which is required throughout the pregnancy for its maintenance. Hence, throughout the pregnancy the levels of Progesterone are raised all the time. In fact, when in early stages (and many ties even later also), the pregnancy becomes unstable or is at risk, we do give progesterone to the pregnant woman to stabilize the pregnancy. Progesterone has no serious teratogenic effects on the baby. The only unwanted effect is if the baby is girl and if the progesterone is taken for very long time, her genitals may develop somewhat like a boy's genitals. Therefore, external Progesterone should be given with caution. However, 14 tablets of Primolut-N, that too before you missed your period is not going to affect the baby's development adversely. I hope this gives you a sound sleep."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, i have been a depression patient for many years. I m 31 & now 5.5 months pregnant.

Thanks for giving time..","Doctor":"HI,    Thanks for the query. I understand your problem. Tryptomer 25 is a drug recommended to treat anxiety, depression,neurotic pains.  It is clearly contraindicated in breast feeding/ children under 7 years. but it is  found to be comparitively safer in pregnancy..that's why your doctor has advised it.   Beleave your doctor & continue with it. But at the same time try to control your symptoms by improving your mind power/ control of mind/ mind concentration & relaxation exercises/ having sound sleep without a pill.     Yoga, Pranayam, Yoganidra audio cassette.& mind concentration exercises , meditation would help.

I will presume your LMP to be 21 November for the current calculations. Also I am presuming your menses to be regular coming after every 30 days. If there are any changes in this, you may then make the modification in the calculations. Egg is released (ovulation) from the ovaries 14 days prior to the next menses. Your expected menstruation would be on 21 December; hence the expected date of ovulation would be 7 December. The egg has life of 24 hours. Hence any sexual intercourse around 6-7 December would be responsible for the pregnancy. Since, it is not clear on which date the baby was 19weeks, it would not be possible to make any calculations based on that. With the available history, it seems you are carrying the child of your husband. If you still have any doubt, the final confirmation can be done by DNA test after the delivery of the baby. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"While having sex it becomes so embarrassing to come out just in a blink of an eye I am 24 yrs old good health used to have sex like 4-5 time every day 2 years back but now it s really annoying and erection becomes a challenge sometimes as well I am so afraid what to do","Doctor":"Hello, Erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation may be due to anxiety mostly. Other possibilities like diabetes or neurological problems, spinal cord injuries etc. Hypothyroidism or hypomagnesemia or anemia or alcohol intake or smoking may aggravate the problem. Do regular exercise and yoga, avoid smoking and caffeine drinks. Avoid alcohol intake. Use a multivitamin tablet. Use tablet Nano Leo.

However, the very fact you had your last menstrual period before you had intercourse with your second boyfriend; i.e. after you have separated from the first boyfriend, the chances of first boyfriend being the father of this child are nil. It has to be due to the intercourse which has taken place after you had your last menstrual period. So naturally, your second boyfriend happens to be the responsible person for this pregnancy. However, if you are still in doubt, you may get DNA test done for confirming the paternity. I hope this resolves your confusion."},{"Patient":"hi im 33 weeks pregnant an my head is spinning like every time I stand or move around I did take my iron pill today but is this normal? my baby has been pushing down really hard that sometimes it an be very pain full an almost breathless but im really concerned bout my head spinning should I go to the ER?","Doctor":"Hi,   Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.    The spinning of head at 33 weeks of pregnancy can be due to blood pressure problems -   - When the blood pressure is low, it still drops down in standing position (postural hypo tension ) this can lead to spinning.Iron replsacement before getting up is nor having any effect to stop the spinning .. but taking plenty of fluids with sugar & salt through along with all other medications advised would help.   - High blood pressure can cause spinning with head ache. High blood pressure is concerning in pregnancy... Here bed rest/ restricting salts in diet/ positive tension freee mentality along with medications  suggested by doctor are helpful.  - some times middle ear problems/ sinusitis/ allergic problems can lead to spinning( vertigo ) & treatment is very effective once the cause is found.  - Many a times eye sight problems can cause such spinning.  * In this context to visit your treating doctor & get serial blood pressure readings would diagnose type of BP High, low or normal ( Doctor may suggest to check urine for albumin.. in case BP is high ) ../ & check you for any other  cause for the spinning .    Once the cause is known specific medications would control your problem.  -Please don't worry.

My name is Adriana and im 23 years old. I have had 4 csections ( 3 live 1 deceased) in the past 5 years. I currently found out that i am pregnant but unsure of how far along i am. I did not want to get pregnant and was taking care of myself as much as possible. I am scared due to the fact that i was high risk in my last two pregnancies. As much as i love my kids i cannot have another one and the dr. that attended me on my last csection repeated to me that i could not have another one because it could be extremely dangerous. I do not know what to do, i have not told anybody and i feel like im in a hole that i cant get out of. What do you suggest i should do ? If you could please respond to me at YYYY@YYYY . Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Dear Adriana,I do empathize your situation. Pregnancy after 4 Caesarean sections does carry a very high risks of rupture of the uterus during delivery and even sometimes during pregnancy, retained placenta after delivery if it is implanted over the scar, post delivery bleeding, etc.. If you are under 9 weeks of pregnancy and are sure that you do not want to continue with this pregnancy, you may opt for termination of pregnancy by medicines which carries very low risk even after caesarean section. WHO has recommended two regimes for such terminations:1. Tab. Mifepristone to be followed after 24-48 hours by Tab. Misoprostol 2. Tab. Misoprostol only regime: Tab. Misoprostol every 3-12 hours for up to 3 dosesThese are very effective and safe methods for terminating pregnancy up to 9 weeks of gestation. It is advisable to ensure the completeness of abortion by ultrasonography. These medicines are prescription medicines and need to be procured by Gynaecologists prescription only. They should be taken as per  the instructions of Gynaecologist. These medicines cause developmental abnormalities in the baby; hence the pregnancy should not be continued if the medicines fail to abort; then the pregnancy should be terminated by surgical methods like MVA aspiration. Since you are having 4 previous Caesarean sections, it will carry some extra risk; however under expert supervision, this can be carried out fairly safely. If you decide to continue with this pregnancy (which I would not advise), you will have to be under continuous supervision of Obstetrician. The integrity of the scan may be assessed by repeated frequent ultrasonography. Any discomfort over the lower abdomen should be reported to the Obstetrician immediately. You may have to be in the hospital during last month of your pregnancy. This will have to be a planned caesarean delivery. This delivery has to be a hospital delivery. Please maintain your health. Keep your haemoglobin within normal range by regular consumption of iron and high protein diet. Please visit the Obstetrician for antenatal care more frequently and follow the advise religiously. I hope you got the messages."},{"Patient":"Hi I m 6 week and 2 day pregnant I m getting this thighting feeling at my pelvis area is quite discomfort special when I need to go to toilet I m really worried because I had two miscarrieges already this one quite different pregnancy to my others pregnancy is it normal.","Doctor":"HI,    Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  -  IT's natural for you to be worried following two miscarriages. But in my view, when you already know that your pregnancy is normal.. you should not be psychologically stressed... taking care is needed, but stress & tension can have adverse effect of pregnancy.   * Actually frequency of urination& frequent urge ( may be taken as tightening .. is normal in early pregnancy, due to pressure of growing fetus presses on  the urinary bladder. .. as a result there is no complete empting of bladder & the symptoms.   - Try to pass urine in  forward bendsng position with hands resting on knee. This relieves pressure on bladder.. it empties completely & there is no frequent urge& stretching!   *  If you are not relieved with this -    Please consult your treating doctor, tell about your tightening before urination. he will advise you-     - Get urine checked for any infection/ HSG/ Progesterone  assessment to determine hormonal sufficiency  & will prescribe needful medicines .   * Actually you had 2 abortions in past.. routinely such patients are given Progesterone supplements ( as a preventive measure ) till 12-14 weeks are completed.    You can discuss with your doctor about the supplements ( actually you must be already been prescribed  ).. . As the hormone supports pregnancy , your tension would be relieved.

These pile further start bleeding if hard stools have to be pushed by straining. Therefore during pregnancy, bleeding piles is a known complication. You seem to have bleeding piles. Please get the diagnosis confirmed from a doctor by per rectal examination. To get relief from this:1. Have soft diet with roughage.2. Eat plenty of fruits; in particular Banana, Citrus fruits like oranges, sweet lime, etc. 3. Drink plenty of water. 4. For few days you may take Liquid paraffin for softening the stools. 5. Locally apply Practosedyl cream. Please do not use its applicator for application, apply with fingers deep inside the rectum. With these you should feel somewhat better. If still the bleeding continues, you may have to undergo ligation of the piles. Please report this to your Obstetrician.I hope this should help you for the immediate relief."},{"Patient":"Hi Doc Just need to fine out whether I can use autrin and ferritin capsules 2gether as I was 28weeks pregnant low iron doc only put me on autrin 5weeks after @ my 33week app. So my baby passed on still birth @ 35+ weeks! Plse which 1 is best as I had a C-section on 1 march 2014! Still feeling very tired though! I m anemic now! Plse help.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,During Pregnancy, you need to consume iron preparation. As it is during pregnancy, the blood gets diluted. Moreover, you mention that you have iron deficiency. Iron deficiency makes you anaemic. Anaemia during pregnancy makes the pregnant woman prone to many complications like weakness, infection, intrauterine growth retardation, excessive bleeding after delivery, after delivery infection, etc. Hence even a non-anaemic woman also needs to take iron during pregnancy. Moreover, you are due for Caesarean delivery. So you should build your haemoglobin and make yourself fit for surgery otherwise you may require blood during surgery. Even anesthetic complications are also common in anaemic patients.  The iron taken during pregnancy in part goes to the baby in the uterus giving the baby also iron storages. Autrin and Ferritin - both are good iron preparations. They are not only safe but are essential medicines during pregnancy. You may choose either of them. To achieve best results, please take these tablets about half an hour before the food. Iron absorption is best in acidic medium. Please do not take any antacids. They hamper the iron absorption. Along with the iron, please take good high protein diet as it is required along with iron to form haemoglobin. Please continue taking these tablets even after the delivery till you are breastfeeding your baby. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"I went for my 20 week scan today and found out I was having a little girl. I am English and having my baby in Spain so there is a little language barrier sometimes. As far as I could understand they said my baby had a full bladder and it should not be full. They also mentioned they would be keeping a eye on her kidney s as the tubes running to the kidney s are a little small. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to healthcare magicsingle ultrasonography showing a full bladder should not worry you much. You are having a girl. Commonly boys may have a full bladder because of a birth defect (posterior urethral valve) which causes difficulty in passing urine.Regarding short ureters a repeat scan at 22-24 weeks will give a clearer picture.Please do get back to me if you have any more questions"},{"Patient":"I m 16 wk pregnant and I have depression which is normally under control. However, my boyfriend is always stressing on me or upsetting me he also said something last night that I really cannot forgive. He doesnt seem to understand that this stress is inevitablly going to kick start my depression as its already having a debilitating effect on me. I have been extremely lucky not to have many pregnancy symptoms, however when he stresses me out I have jaw pain, neck pain, back ache, and severe headaches (think they are migraines) and this is all down to him stressing me which makes me freeze up, get no sleep and irritates my TMJ disorder, causing the headaches (I never got them befoore pregnancy-and I dont want them to stay!!!) I have spoke to him time & time again crying begging him to stop. This is not just a matter of oestrogen levels rising he s alsways been this way with me. What can I do? Should I avoid him till my baby is due? He is doing more harm than good. Is there any literature out there specifically for this problem-making him see that he cant keep doing this-he needs to get his stress out elsewhere & be more empathetic towards me. He isnt given me any emotional support Im scared about the effects of cortisol on the baby- it causes all sorts of problems- doubles risk of still birth & other social/mental/emotional& physical problems. He needs to stop or get out!!!!!","Doctor":"Hi,    Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.     Healthy pregnancy demands good nutrition, good exercises, good medication & regular pregnancy check ups, good & optimum exercises under expert guidance & a happy, positive & sound mind. Deviation of any factor directly affects fetus.     You have a psychological stress problem, specially with a particular person. The management of such stress requires efforts from both of you.      You start with your own efforts Start doing meditation/ mind concentration regularly Take help of some Yoga guru in your town & start practicing it. along with exercises./ few sittings of psychological counselar would help./ Try to avoid points of dispute with the person .    Take boyfriend to your doctor/  family counselor . They will explain importance of psychological stability & positivity in pregnancy. They will also advise him few methods to avoid dispute / he may be given counseling .     Thus try wholeheartedly & both of you will bypass the conflict & a happy companionship.      In case, he is not responding , you can think of avoiding him till you get delivered.     Thanks."},{"Patient":"I m pregnant (week 7) and have a chronic gastritis.

If you are experiencing this vomiting only now and not earlier in your pregnancy, you should see a physician to evaluate the cause.

I understand your concern.   * In late pregnancy,the size of uterus in enlarged & it occupies most of abdominal cavity.. creating short of place to bowels. This causes mechanical hurdle in digestion & travel of food through gut which does not coincide with release of digestive enzymes in digestive tract . This causes digestive deficiency.  - Pregnancy hormones make intestinal movements sluggish, thus  partially food stands long in the intestines... leads to more gas formation.. thus increasing more distension of abdomen & sometimes constipation.  - In such condition normal eating habits cause overload on digestion .. this adds to lack of digestion.  * ALL above factors cause stretching abdomen & stretching of abdomen causes pain & discomfort.   * All of your investigations are normal , so way out for the problem can be-     - Eat small & frequent servings  ( every 3 hours )      -  Each serving should contain fibers ( salad/ vegetable/ fruit ). Drink lot of water in  a day. ( 12 glasses in 24 hours )- sufficient fibers with water make improve intestinal movements..This improves digestion.     - Add light exercises in your routine.. simple yoga exercises/ walking... This stimulates functioning of gut.     - Avoid spicy, oily & difficult to digest food.    - You can add digestive enzymes over the counter/ with your doctor's advise to improve digestion still more.   * the stroke you mention you has during last delivery  must not be related to abdominal pain. It must be something related to your blood pressure( which is normal at present.. but psychological stress can  cause high blood pressure / low Blood pressure also can produce  fainting & weakness .

Plz answer my query .... Waiting for reply","Doctor":"Hello, and i hope I can help you today.It is not recommended that Albendazole be taken during the first trimester of pregnancy because the medication has been shown to cause birth defects in laboratory animals if given during pregnancy.However, there are two reasons that you do not need to worry about the one dose of Albendazole you already took.  The first is that there are no studies that Albendazole causes birth defects in humans at all.  Secondly, you took the medicine at the time of conception and even though the drug can stay in your system for four weeks, a fetus does not even develop by this time.  Therefore, you do not need to worry about birth defects from the timing of when you took Albendazole.

It acts by dramatically  stopping the menstrual hormones , stops the menstrual cycle for at least 3 months from injection.    The state of hormonal imbalance due to  endometriosis interferes with fertility.So the drug Lupride depot is also used in treatment of IVF ..  when needful hormones are provided in calculated dose externally to bring about maturity of ovum/ ovulation . The further process of in vitro fertilization is continued out side the body & fertilized ovum is transferred in mother's uterus.

The drug Letroz is a anti malignant drug.. used to treat cancer.  *  It is also empirically used by some people  for de3velopment of follicle ( immature ovum ). But it is having bad effects on embryo ( early stage of fetus ) & fetus .. so it has been legally banned from use in young females.

I understand your concern. Gestational diabetes is a cause of increased amniotic fluid.  The explanation is as follows.   Due to gestational diabetes, fetal blood sugar is raised & this leads to excessive urination in fetus ( osmotic effect ).. which causes increased amniotic fluid in  gestational diabetes.   As an  effect of gestational diabetes, apart from maternal complications, fetus has high birth weight/pregnancy can turn in premature labor, abnormal fetal presentation during child birth.  Please don't worry these can be prevented by controlling gestational diabetes by life style changes & few medications (as per advise by treating doctor  )    Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor My Wife is 29yrs old , Its been one week over her periods date .We did prgency test which was positive. My doc friend advised to have 2 Mtpills followed by Misoprost 2 pills after 48 hours. Its been more then 30 hours now she had Mt pills bleeding is no started .Is it advisable for still to have Misoprost pills ? How long it normally takes to start with bleeding ?Should we go for some other medicine ? Please advice Thanks","Doctor":"HI,    Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.       THE MT pill kit can be used to terminate 37 to 63 days of pregnancy.     You had taken Mifepristone pills on day one    It kills the fetus .It may not start bleeding.     On day 3 ( after 48 hours ) you have to take two pills of MIsoprostol..( orally/ vaginally )., This pill now causes uterine contractions to expel the dead fetus out. Bleeding starts after taking MIsoprostol. If there is no bleeding in 12 hours 2 more pills of Misoprostol are used..Abortion is complete in a couple of days.   Check up by a gynecologist/ USG is essential to confirm complete abortion.   * You may need doctor's help in case there is profuse bleeding or incomplete abortion. SO it is better taken under expert guidance of a gynecologist.

I am sorry to know about  the mishaps in both of your pregnancies. I have read your query carefully, I feel both the times there were different causes forthe out come.( First time may be  fall /hit to abdomen, high blood pressure or un diagnosed placenta previa & second time due to family history / viral infection like Rubella in first three months of pregnancy )     Still  You need to plan your next pregnancy with due precautions as follows.    - Both of you get full physical check up & relevant investigations to rule out any existing health problem./ get safe alterations in regular medication for chronic illness.. if any. Have a healthy lifestyle for 3 months prier to conception, see that you don't get any health problem & do not need any medication in those days.     - Get Rubella vaccination 3-4 months before you plan pregnancy. If a pregnant lady gets rubella infection in first three months of pregnancy .. the fetus gets congenital defects ,one of them being heart problem.    - Get you thyroid profile done before you plan for pregnancy.  Normal thyroid  hormone  is essential for fetal developmental If you have any thyroid problem.. it must be controlled before pregnancy & normal levels maintained through out pregnancy with endocrinologist's advise   Once you get pregnant, be careful to follow doctor's advise after regular pregnancy check ups./ have healthy life style/nutritious diet/ exercises & sleep .   With a planned pregnancy & careful follow ups you would be blessed with a bony baby.. rest assured.

I understand your concern.    Yes, smoking marijunia pot in pregnancy has tremendous side effects in fetus & mother both. It may seize morning sickness vomiting, but the side effects it causes are hazardous.( name physical / mental/ intellectual / cognitive side effects in new born.. making it's life miserable.   To control morning sickness you can-   Chew dry snacks slowly before getting out of bed( water or liquids stimulate vomiting., be in bed for half hour & then get up to start your routine.     Never starve. Take small/ multiple servings( 5-6 in a day ) of   nutritious food you relish. Avoid spicy, oily or left over food.Avoid aerated drinks,   _ get prescription from your doctor for preventing morning sickness.( like Doxinate pills 2 at bed time )   - Consult your doctor regularly for pregnancy check up.    - Low blood pressure increases sickness.. Some times IV fluids can control such excessive vomiting.   - Think that it's pregnancy hormones that cause the symptoms.. so your baby is getting good hormones & is growing well. This will stop when your body gets adjusted to the hormones.( usually by 3 months of pregnancy ) It's helpful to be positive.   Thanks."},{"Patient":"hi, I m 21 week 6 days pregnant.

Would this notching a serious problem in terms of baby growth / delivery? What precautions I should take? 2. Would the above mentioned solutions recommended by my doctor resolve notching? Any side affects of ecosprin tablet? 3. Any other precautions I need to take to ensure a full-term healthy pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the presence of early diastolic notching might be a normal finding before 24 weeks of pregnancy.Persistence of the same even after 24 weeks might cause growth retardation of the baby.Its good to know that your BP is normal.As per your information I feel there is nothing to worry.But follow up with serial ultrasounds to monitor the well being of fetus might be needed.So relax.Nothing to worry.You are on correct medication and the aspirin can be taken in pregnancy and it might prevent any vascular changes occurring .Take healthy nutritional diet and adequate fluids upto 3 litres per day.Practice antenatal exercise or walking daily.Hope this helps.Best regards...."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Monday night I started cramping and bleeding bright red blood....went to ED on Tuesday Sept 14th to be positive that I was miscarring bc I had positive test and negative Hcg serum, my levels at the ED were at a 7 for Hcg. Bleeding stopped Tuesday...was asked to repeat Beta Hcg on Tuesday. I was curious so over the weekend took another test...still showed positive??

What im confused about is why would my Beta Hcg go from 7-101-204 in a 3 week toime span if nothing is there? Im confused...any answers??our query here...","Doctor":"Interesting case. Not a frequent one too. In short, pregnancy test is positive but since levels of BHCG are below the discriminatory levels nothing is seen at the Transvaginal (endocavitary) scan. You need about 2000 mIU/dL BHCG for a pregnancy to be seen in a high resolution scan. You have a condition called PUL (Pregnancy of Unknown Location) and serial measurements of BHCG can lead to the right diagnosis, options are: in this order of frequency1.- Normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), 75%2.- Miscarriage (spontaneous abortion, SA), 25%3.- Ectopic pregnancy (EP), 1%Since BHCG duplicate its levels every 72 hs and considering 7 as the initial level by sept 29th your BHCG levels should have been about 400-500, this means that:1.- no normal duplication pattern is seen, pregnancy might not be right and there might a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnacy2.- discriminatory levels are not met and that explains why a gestacional sac GS is not seen3.- there is still the posiibility of a normal pregnancyWhat would I do? Wait, repeat BHCG in about a week and perform another scan with the new resultsLevels fall, no GS on scan: miscarriageLevels rise, duplicate and GS seen: IUPLevels rise but do not duplicate or reach about 2000, no GS is seen: considering EP and new levels are measured and scan performed about a week laterif more than 2000 units are measured and no sac is seen, I would consider / perform a laparoscopy"},{"Patient":"i have been getting cramps and pain in the bottom of my back and stomach. i have also been getting weird sensations in my stomach. this has been happening for just over a week. i was due for my period within the first 5 days of the month, and i never had it. yet this mornin i noticed a few spots of blood but it is very light and does not feel like a normal period that i usally have. could i be pregnant.","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion any abnormal period in case of regularly menstruating woman should be evaluated.Usually the pregnancy symptoms are nausea,vomitings,increased urination, sore breasts start 2 weeks after missed period.And the abdominal cramps could be due to normal premenstrual phase.Anyways I suggest you to get a urine pregnancy test done to rule out the pregnancy.The urine pregnancy test gives  accurate results a week after missed period .Relax.

Please try to understand the  indications and risks for Suboxone. Suboxone contains a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone. Buprenorphine is an opioid medication. An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic. Naloxone blocks the effects of opioid medication, including pain relief or feelings of well-being that can lead to opioid abuse.Suboxone is used to treat narcotic (opiate) addiction. It is not for use as a pain medication.It is not known whether Suboxone will harm an unborn baby. If you use buprenorphine and naloxone while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on the drug. This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks.Buprenorphine and naloxone can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed while using this medicine.Suboxone falls in FDA pregnancy category C meaning thereby that Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus however there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.However, nowhere in the literature,  Suboxone  is mentioned to lead to the Down's Syndrome to the baby in the womb. Still, my advice to you is refrain from the use of Suboxone, not only during pregnancy (even otherwise also unless you are using it for de-addiction from opioid misuse). Please report to your Gynaecologist and Physician to find some alternative non addictive medicine for your condition other than de-addiction. For the Down's Syndrome (21 Trisomy) of your baby in the womb, please report to your Obstetrician. You may require amniocentesis for the study of the foetal cells to confirm the diagnosis. Just do not go on what a technician has expressed to you. Anyway, you are now 6 weeks pregnant, so you have crossed the limits of legal abortion (if you are in India) and you will have to plan for upbringing this baby with the help of some experts. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hello, my wife is 15 weeks pregnant. Today she saw some blood. Actually not blood. Its like black color. It was for some 2-3min. then it was vanished.

The low amount of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios) is a serious turn that your pregnancy has taken. I would have appreciated had you mentioned the amniotic fluid index (AFI) values. If they are under 5, it is a serious level and you may need to effect the birth of the baby since it seems it is not safe in the uterus. However, if AFI is between 5 and 10, some efforts should be made to increase the weight of the baby. High protein diet with lots of fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables, moderate carbohydrates and low fat diet might help you achieve this. Drink plenty of water with the hope of increasing amniotic fluid volume. Intravenous fluids though tried have not shown any promising results in oligohydramnios. Please get Manning's score done which includes 4 parameters by ultrasonography and one by electronic foetal heart monitoring. Each index carries score of 2. The score => 8 is safe while one =Please try to find out the cause of oligohydramnios. Are you having high blood pressure, diabetes, any abnormality in the baby, etc.. Depending upon Manning's score, the AFI and underlying cause, further management will have to be planned by your Obstetrician. If at all immediate delivery is indicated, such babies do not sustain the stress of vaginal delivery and need to be delivered by Caesarean section. The delivery should be planned only in well equipped health facility with availability of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and Expert Neonatologist.

Then on 9th March you had just a spotting. This is your ovulation bleeding which is called as Mittelschmerz. Now whether  you are pregnant or not depends up on whether you have missed your period which was due on or around 23rd March. The first cardinal symptom of pregnancy is missing a period. All other symptoms like nausea, vomiting & pica, frequent urination, breast symptoms like engorgement & tenderness, dark discolouration of the nipples and areola with areolar widening, Montgomery's tubercles and secretions through the nipples appear about 8-10 days after missing a period. If you have not missed period, wait for the period. If it misses, you may perform the pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample a week after missed period. Earlier theses tests may report false negative. Alternatively you may opt for Beta hCG test which is very sensitive and gives reliable reports even few days before missing the period. If you get the period and/or the tests are negative, you are not pregnant. These symptoms then could be due to gastro-intestinal problems like indigestion. Even Jaundice may cause such symptoms.

The ultrasound showed a Sack of diameter 24mm, but no embryo. The ObGyn said it looked like a typical pregnancy of only 6 weeks. At 8 weeks there is usually an embryo visible with a visible heartbeat as well. What could this mean? Is it highly likely that the baby will be born handicapped, deformed or permanently ill? What does it mean that my gf s pregnancy is slow?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If she is 8 weeks pregnant her ultrasonography should show the embryo with heart activity too. Her gestational sac is of 6 weeks size only and there is no embryo in the sac and there are no heart activities of the baby noted. These are the typical findings of Blighted ovum. Blighted ovum is a condition wherein there is pregnancy without the baby (embryo) in the gestational sac. Usually such sacs are having irregular margins. Please repeat the scan after a week. If still the embryo is missing from the gestational sac and there are no heart activities noted, the diagnosis of blighted ovum is confirmed. Blighted ovum pregnancies do not continue and grow. If the pregnancy does not get aborted spontaneously, get it terminated from an Obstetrician ASAP. Delay may invite complications like infection or excessive bleeding. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"hi doctor i 32 years ago i pregent and last period is 20-12-2010 but taken tetracid drug 1 capasule untile 30-1-2011.but stop drug after this day.i did 4d sonar in 23 weeke and appear no any abnormaility but weight is 580 grams and dignosis is symetrical growth restriction what opinion? no medical history for any disese iweight is now 70 k.gram","Doctor":"HI,   Thanks for asking. I understand your concern.  Tetracid contains tetracyclin.. the antibiotic . Tetracyclin is not reported to cause fetal abnormality except for teeth staining in fetus.   Symmetrical growth restriction of baby can be due to -    Restricted bone growth during taking tetracyclin.. this effect disappears after the tetracyclins are withdrawn.    Other possible cause include thyroid deficiency/ malnutrition of mother.

Clindamycin forte is an antibacterial medicine; it is not anti-fungal medicine. Clindamycin vaginal  suppositories are used for bacterial vaginosis. In fact any antibiotic increases the possibility of or flares up the fungal infection. So please get it confirmed about your lesion - whether you have got fungal infection or Bacterial vaginosis. For fungal infection, you would be prescribed some anti-fungal medicine like Clotrimazole. Clindamycin has not shown any ill effects on the baby if taken in second and last three months of pregnancy. However, its use during breastfeeding is not recommended. I hope this will make you confirm the diagnosis and the treatment.

Please i am now more scared, i hope my pregnancy is not under any risk. Please what is the adverse effect of phenorbarbitone? please i need a quick response","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Your doubt is valid. Phenobarbital has been assigned to pregnancy category D by the FDA. An increased risk of congenital malformations has been associated with use of phenobarbital during pregnancy. I would not advise you to take this medicine during pregnancy. Phenobarbital should only be given during pregnancy when there are no alternatives and benefit outweighs risk.In fact, Phenobarbitone might have been prescribed to you so that you take good bed rest. I feel you should drop these tablets and take bed rest without any sedatives. This is not a must medicine for the treatment of threatened abortion. Instead, you may start taking Tab.

It will help to control urine infection. Kindly, procure complete prescription from your doctor.PREVENTION: You must drink plenty of water (2.5 to 3 lit/ day) to flush out the body toxin, take cranberry juice (one glass) regularly, maintain genital hygiene properly, empty bladder in time and wear clean-cotton underwear only.Hope, it helps for you.

She bought the abortions pills by someone, did it @ home and never went to hospital or clinic or seen any doctor after that. She never had a womb scrub or whatever. About a month ago she found out she s pregnant. The day after that she started bleeding but didn t think anythong of it as they say that it is normal to bleed in your first trimester. However, when she eventually decided to go see a doctor they did a pregnancy test and it showed negative. Is this a result of a miscarraige or what?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I feel you should get certain medical knowledge which will clarify many of your doubts and also get some important messages.Firstly, she should not have instituted termination of pregnancy by abortion pills without Gynaecologist's advice. These medicines are prescription medicines and should be taken with appropriate prescription and advice; lest the risk of many complications. Now regarding her ?fresh pregnancy:Yes, after the medical termination of pregnancy, fresh pregnancy is possible after the next cycle. If her pregnancy test was positive, she could be pregnant again. However the dilemma is due to next day negative pregnancy test. Dear friend, even if she has aborted on the day she got her pregnancy test report positive, the very next day pregnancy test would not become negative due to abortion. It takes about a week to 10 days for the pregnancy test to report negative after the baby has become non-viable. So the possibility is that one of the tests is reporting incorrect. The fact that she has done first test after bleeding started suggests that this could be false positive result; however false positive results are not commonly known. To find out the true fact, please opt for Beta hCG test. This test is highly sensitive and gives reliable reports even few days before missing a period. I hope this will resolve your dilemma. To avoid such stressful confusing situations in the life, I would suggest you to advice your friend to use some reliable contraceptive method like condom, intrauterine device like copper T or birth control pills if she does not plan pregnancy in near future.I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Yesterday I had pains that felt like Labor Pains.

Your vagina and/or vulva is sore.3. You are/were on antibiotics. 4. The white spots could not be removed easily. To me this appears to be fungal (yeast) infection in a very early stage. It need not smell. Please report to the Gynaecologist to confirm the diagnosis and get appropriate treatment. Either systemic or preferably local antifungal medicines will cure you of this infection. Left untreated will infect the baby's eyes and mouth during delivery. Along with, please use Lactobacilli containing vaginal ovules or Lactacyd perineal wash. This will regain the normal vaginal flora destroyed by the antibiotics. This infection can be transmitted sexually also. Hence, the treatment should be taken simultaneously by both the partners irrespective of the symptoms to the other partner. Both of you, also please follow these instructions: 1. Observe sexual abstinence till both of you are declared completely cured of the infection.2. Shave the private parts clean.3. Do not apply soap to the private parts. Soap increases the fungal infection.4. Boil underwear daily.5. Use panty liners (for you only).6.

We underwent chromosomal test which was normal and normal count. we are planning for our next child and we are in great tension thinking if the next child will have some problem due to this. Please tell us what to be done.","Doctor":"HI,   Thanks for the query. I have read your query carefully & understood your concern.   Congenital heart problems arise due to various causes like genetic ( as you have already don both of your chromosomal anlysis.. the risk is lesser ).. if there is family history of such problem in both of your families.. the possibility has to be checked in fetus / viral infection, rubella infection of mother in first 3 months of pregnancy/ Type one or two diabetes in mother/ mother taking alcohol/ Taking certain drugs for seizures,  pain killers like Ibuprofen,treatment of acne.. during pregnancy can affect heart development in fetus.  * While planning for child you should keep in mind the risk factors & prevent them as per possibility.Taking anti Rubella vaccine 6 months before pregnancy is advised.  *  Be in regular touch with treating gynecologist when she is pregnant.Pregnancy fetal abnormality scan ( in 5th month )/ triple guard test/ chromosomal analysis  are few investigations which can indicate fetal abnormality ... if diagnosed in time necessary action can be taken in time.     Hope, this helps you in planning. BE careful & observant.. instead of being scared & stressed.. this will definitely give you positive results.     Thanks,"},{"Patient":"my spouse and I are trying to get pregnant. She is an aircraft mechanic. SHe works around lots of different types of greases, fluids and paints. Should she be avoiding the use of those while we are trying to get pregnant? Once we get pregnant, should she avoid them? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Yes, some chemicals do affect the baby while some affect even the fertility also. However it all depends to which chemicals she is exposed to. In particular, she should avoid exposure to paints since the paints contain heavy metals and lead. This may affect the cognitive function of the baby. She should avoid volatile and/or irritant fluids as they will diminish the oxygen she is breathing and will lead to improper growth of the foetus. Amines are not good. Moreover, if the fumes are harmful to the baby, they should be totally avoided. It depends upon to which fluids she is exposed to. The best strategy is better to err on safer side. I hope this provides you some guidelines."},{"Patient":"HAD A TRANSVAGINAL SCAN TODAY A 1ST SCAN WHICH REVEALS AM 6-WEEKS PREGNANT( I THOUGHT WOULD BE 8 WEEKS LAST MENSTRUATED AROUND 16TH DECEMBER) BUT THERE WAS NO HEART BEAT OR FETAL POLE AND HAVE STARTED TO BLEED LIGHTLY RED BLOOD INTERMITTENT SINCE YESTERDAY THAT WAS WHY I WEANT TO THE A/E LAST NIGHT THEY TOOK A SCAN AND SAID I WAS AROUND 5-WEEKS AND THIS MORNING THEY SAID 6-WEEKS ANOTHER SCAN SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The calendar method calculates the period of gestation from the date of last menstrual period (LMP). Actually, the conception takes place about 2 weeks after LMP. Ultrasonography scanning measures the length of the embryo to assess the age of gestation. Hence, in early stages of pregnancy, a lag of 2 weeks between calendar calculations and scan assessment  may be observed. Probably, 5 weeks is too early to appreciate the foetal heart activity. Please wait for a week to 10 days more and then get another scan done. If even then the foetal heart activity is not noted and the baby is not growing, it may suggest non-viable baby. In such event, you may have to terminate the pregnancy. Since you are having some amount of spotting, till the status of baby is ascertained, please take some Progestational preparation with the advice of your Obstetrician to stabilize the pregnancy. If the baby is viable and if the baby's heart activity is noted, you may continue the Progestational preparation with the advice of your Obstetrician. I hope this will help you."},{"Patient":"I masturbate weekly twice or more i try a lot not to mastutbate but I can t control myself so sometimes i get head ache also so please suggest me how to quit masturbate and I asked few people how to stop they say to marry but iam very thin So I just want to stop masturbation","Doctor":"I have had a patient this past week with this same problem. It is addictive and very difficult to treat. I told this patient what I will tell you. It is important to remove triggers from your environment, things that make you want to masturbate, that remind you of masturbating. Television, videos, internet, magazines... these can all be sources for temptation that make it hard for you to resist. I would start by changing your environment. It also helps to keep a journal, writing down your thoughts, feelings, and reasons for wanting to masturbate, to better understand your motivations and gain insight into your addiction. Having a therapist if one is available, one who can maintain confidentiality, is a plus. I would disagree to rush into a marriage just to get out of your masturbation issues. If intimacy with a partner is your issue, it might be helpful to consider trying to desensitize yourself by addressing your fears and getting more experience with the opposite sex. Do you watch pornography? Do you have any history of sexual abuse? You really need to evaluate why you have this problem and try to understand it. It is also, in many ways, a normal thing to try to experiment, masturbate, especially in your teenage years. There is nothing wrong with this. However, if it becomes to a point where you cannot maintain relationships, difficulty obtaining a job, or affecting your life in other ways, then it is no longer considered normal but rather an addiction.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi i am 14 weeks pregnant and have HPV I just discovered two growths? on the inside of my vagina...its like in the folds of my inner labia i think there is one on each side ... and they are white. They look nothing like the warts i am being treated for they are much bigger and look more like cysts or glands","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for submitting your query here.In pregnancy, it is not uncommon to have some growths which are actually retained secretion of vaginal glands.During pregnancy,the glands secrete excessive secretion which often remain retained and form the growth. Another possibility is having yeast, which remain heaped up and form a swelling.Just clean those areas with cotton soaked in saltwater. If the growth increases in size or painful,think consulting your GP for an opinion.Sincerely"},{"Patient":"Hi, well I ve been on microgynon for 3 months now...but just these past 2 weeks I´ve been feeling so diferent.

I have read & understood your query.   -  IF you have taken the pills regularly & had regular break through bleeding in past . you won't have risk of pregnancy & the symptoms you have are side effect of hormones in the pills. IT would slowly disappear as you get adjusted to the pill.    -  In case of absent break through bleeding/ irregular consumption of pills.. you have to go for home pregnancy test & exclude/ confirm pregnancy. Pregnancy in such a case needs to be terminated for risk of fetal malformations.

Thyroid deficiency definitely affects the development of the baby. Hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome which includes:• Increased incidence of miscarriages, recurrent pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, anaemia, Diabetes, placental separation, heavy bleeding after delivery• Foetal growth restriction, foetal distress during labour, foetal death, preterm birth• Cognitive, neurological and developmental impairment in the baby.Guidelines recommend screening of all pregnant women at risk for hypothyroidism.  Please get your complete Thyroid Function; i.e. T3, T4 and TSH estimated.The normal ranges for First trimester: 0.1 to 2.5 mIU/L; Second trimester 0.2 to 3 mIU/L; Third trimester: 0.3 to 3 mIU/LLevothyroxine is the drug of choice for treating hypothyroidism. Starting dose can be 25 mcg /day while for TSH level > 10 mIU/l it should be 50 mcg/day. Thyroxine should be taken early morning on empty stomach. L-Thyroxin ingestion and the ingestion of iron supplements, calcium supplements and soy-based food should be separated by at least 4 hours.TSH should be repeated after 4-6 weeks of starting the treatment to see the response. Target TSH levels should be kept below 2.5 in first trimester and below 3 during second and third trimesters. If target TSH level is not achieved, the dose should be increased by 25 mcg/day. Dose should be adjusted according to TSH levels. At any time TSH below 0.1 should be avoided by decreasing the thyroxine dose by 25 mcg from the current dose.After delivery, most patients need to decrease thyroxine dosage received during pregnancy. It is very important to continue monitoring thyroid function tests for at least 6 months after delivery.With this treatment of Thyroid you can prevent the further damage of the foetal brain. I hope this helps you. If you feel so, you may vote for 'Helpful' answer."},{"Patient":"I just did my Pelvic sonography and its says i have both overies mildly enlarge with multiple folicles arrange peripherally....i am on ttc from last 7 months and dint try any medication...my weight is 50kg height 5.3, no pimples or any hair growth but very irregular period.....Pls help, can i any how become pregnant....","Doctor":"Hi there,Peripherally arranged follicles with enlarged ovaries indicate that you have polycystic ovarian syndrome as you also have irregular cycles.Women with polycystic do have difficult conceiving and require help through ovulation induction.

A repeat scan at 32 weeks most of these placenta move to the upper segment and do not cause any problems to the mother or the baby.In a few women they may still remain low and then the mode of delivery may have to be decided by the obstetrician and the women. She is more likley to bleed during delivery, and blood needs to be arranged and kept ready if required for transfusion.Also some women require caesarean for delivery if it covers the os.But all this would depend on location of the placenta at 32 weeks.

Any help would be great. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. When oral contraception is initiated, the first two cycles need additional protection. This is because there is a chance that ovulation may not be inhibited. Since you took a break, this cycle is not protected. If the incident happened during your usual fertile period, you would need additional protection. If this happened during your usual safe period, you need not take any emergency contraception.

IgG antibody presence indicates past exposure to the infection or vaccination, while IgM antibody presence signifies recent or current infection. In this scenario, the test may be repeated after 2-3 weeks and if there is a rise in the IgG antibody titres, recent infection must be suspected and further management planned accordingly. If there is no rise in tires, regular follow up is to be done with periodic sonograms to detect any anomalies early on. Vaccination should not be done during pregnancy. The baby is also tested at birth for evidence of infection and appropriate management done. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi.. im now at 28th week of pregnancy.. still i have vomtings .if i dont take medicine i will get vomit..

Dimenhydrinate, the content of Dramamine has been given the pregnancy category B by the FDA. This means the drug can be used if absolutely needed and no known teratogeneic effects reported. Pantoprazole, again, has been assigned pregnancy category B by the FDA. Thus, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh the risks in pregnancy. Since you are 28 weeks pregnant, with organogenesis stage over, the risk of congenital anomalies is low. Please get regular follow up.

The medications like rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide have not been shown to be associated with any fetal congenital malformations when used during pregnancy and hence are considered safe. Streptomycin should not be used. Vaccination should not be given. Hepatic function should be carefully monitored and nutritional supplements amply prescribed to avoid peripheral neuritis. In this scenario, please discuss with your consultant as to the safety of continuing with the pregnancy as the treatment of the disease is also essential and if she needs teratogeneic medication, she cannot continue with the pregnancy. Hope your query has been clarified. Take care."},{"Patient":"I m 10 weeks pregnant. My boyfriend and I were decided on abortion, so I drank one night last week, when I was 9 weeks.

What are the chances drinking one night and continuing to take Riddilin has harmed my baby?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. Methylphenidate has been assigned to the category C by the FDA. This means there are no adequate controlled animal studies to detect fetal effects while this drug is used during pregnancy and human statistics are not available. Thus if you have taken the medication once, you can think of continuing the pregnancy. If however, you have also taken the medication to induce a medical abortion, abortion is the only alternative left since fetal anomalies are a possibility with the use of Misoprostol and Mifepristone.

Please see a physician for a proper clinical assessment and treatment as any form of self-medication is to be avoided in pregnancy. You can have saline water gargles, steam inhalations, apply cold rubs like vicks to the throat, back and chest to relieve congestion. Antihistamines and paracetamol are usually prescribed. Antibiotics can be used if there is a suspected bacterial infection. Please take lukewarm water to drink, maintain good fluid and electrolyte balance and take good rest.

But since I started taking this medicine, I have seen some pinkish reddish spotting. there is bo abdominal pain or discomfort and the discharge is visible only as drops on the pad or when I wipe myself. Should I continue the course or should I stop immediately? . Please advise. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Candid is prescribed for the yeast or Candida or Monalial or fungal infestation of vagina. If such infestation is during pregnancy, it should be treated promptly to safeguard the baby from infection. The lower abdominal pain or discomfort you are experiencing is due to the infection and inflammation of the top of vagina. This is due to the yeast. Once your infection is cured, this will go away. Slight pinkish discharge you are getting is due to the local disturbance. Usually 10 days treatment cures the infection. Along with these medicines, please have Lactacyd perineal wash which contains Lactobacilli or Lactobacilli vaginal ovules . Lactobacilli help killing the yeast. However, reinfection has to be avoided. For that please follow the instructions:1. Since this infection can be transmitted sexually, both the partners should get the treatment simultaneously (irrespective of symptoms or no symptoms) and follow these instructions.2. Observe sexual abstinence till both of you are declared completely cured of the infection. 3. Shave private parts clean.4. Clip the nails short.5. Boil the underwear daily.6. Use panty liners (for you).7. This infection is caused due to commode use also. So keep the commode hygienically clean and avoid splash. 8. Use Lactacyd Please do not discontinue the treatment for the fungal infection till you are cured. Complete it following the above instructions. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"My waif is pregnant in 8the month and she is complaining of lift back pain since 5 years there was no treatment given unlace analgesic knew physician advised to do nerve condect test my question is their any said affect in pregnant for this test","Doctor":"Well, she is pregnant with a heavy load that shifts her balance to a forward position. Back pain is common during pregnancy and studies are seldom performed since pregnancy alters the normal body physiology. Physical therapy is frequently indicated during pregnancy.

Your symptoms can occur during a very early pregnancy or during the premenstrual phase of the period due to progesterone effect. The vaginal discharge however, is abnormal and most likely due to hormone imbalance. Since you had both blood and urine pregnancy tests negative, pregnancy can be ruled out. A trans-vaginal sonogram will help to know the status of the pelvic organs. Weight disturbances, infections, stress, polycystic ovaries and certain medications also can create this clinical picture.

Even though you have tested positive for Group B streptococcus (GBS), you need not worry about the fetal outcome. 1 in 200 of untreated babies and 1 in 4000 of treated babies get infected. It is true that you are in the high risk group having lost a baby due to the infection previously. Yet, regular monitoring, prophylaxis with intravenous antibiotics during labor and proper handling of the new born help to overcome the problem. If you have been tested once during this pregnancy and reported positive, there is no need to get tested again. Otherwise, you need to be tested between 35-37 weeks. A course of antibiotics may also be given during pregnancy since you had the infection antenatally in the past, to arrest the infection temporarily.

Meanwhile please continue with the medication prescribed by your doctor. Avoid drinking and smoking, hot water baths, tight undergarments and prolonged sitting. If ovulation can be regularly established, IUI can be tried if natural methods fail due to thickness of semen. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello. Well my husband and I have been trying to conceive for almost 3 months now. IÃ¢ ?m usually regular with my menstrual cycle and it usually is light the first day the heave second and third day then light 4 day then gone, well I was supposed to get my period this month on the 5th February 5th which I did, but it was weird . First day was spotting then second day was light and then nothing on the 3rd day. Then it stopped for like 5 days then came back very light pink. I tested for pregnancy on the 18 still with the light pink period and I got 3 positive results, but itÃ¢ ??s February 22 and I still have the light [pink discharge. What could this mean?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. Since you have had three positive pregnancy tests, you are pregnant. You can get the status of the pregnancy through a pelvic/trans-vaginal sonogram. Usually, implantation bleed is seen at the time of the expected period and is usually a fresh, light bleed which subsides in a couple of days. Persistent spotting is usually observed when there is a hormone deficiency. If the pregnancy is progressing normally, you are likely to benefit from progesterone supplements, absolute bed rest and abstinence. Hope your query has been answered. Take care."},{"Patient":"hi my wife is now 28 years old. she is now 7 month pregnant. she has also severe pulmonery vulve stenosis. gradiant is 89 mm /hg. she has no digginess, faint , chest pain. she belongs as a normal life.

She should follow up and deliver at a tertiary care hospital which has both obstetricians and cardiologists available round the clock.Her medical condition should be optimised prior to delivery, if she has anemia it has to be corrected and her ECHO to see for heart function done in the later weeks of pregnancy.The fetus also needs to be monitored as babies of women with heart disease tend to be smaller than others and may have growth restriction.Regular visits to her obstetrician are necessary. And the first few days after delivery as well are very crucial and she should be kept under observation in the hospital.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am due or delivery in 11 days and has been diagnosed with high alkaline phosphate, sgot and sgpt levels. I also had nausea, vomiting and severe heartburn all throughout, though worsened since past 1 month. Please suggest, also what impact does this have on the child?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. In the current scenario, your liver function should be assessed further by a physician or a gastroenterologist and further management planned. Your investigation reports suggest, though not specific, of some hepatic malfunction. Raised alkaline phosphatase can be seen during the third trimester of pregnancy due to elevated isoenzyme levels. Clinical correlation is more important in the diagnosis. There may not be any significant impact on the baby as your pregnancy has reached term; the coagulation profile should be assessed and any abnormal values taken care of prior to delivery. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"My last menstural period was 9/2/10 I had a positive pregnancy test at my OBGYN s office. On Sunday 10/10/10 I was having some spotting. On Monday 10/11/10 I noticed a few small clots so I called my doctor. She referred me to the ER . At the ER I had an ultrasound done which showed a fertilized egg inmplanted in the uterus which was estimated to be approximately 4 weeks old. I was told it was too soon to see a heart beat. My HCG level on 10/8/10 was 192.61 On 10/11/10 it was 322.28 and on 10/13/10 it was 356.75. I m afraid I m having a miscarriage. Is it ever ok for the HCG levels to rise so slowly?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.In a normal pregnancy, the HCG value is supposed to double every 48-72 hours.  Furthermore, in a normal pregnancy, a HCG level for a 4-5 week pregnancy is in the thousands, not hundreds.So I am very sorry to inform you that is really is not likely you have a normal pregnancy that will ever develop a heartbeat.  If you had an ultrasound that confirms this pregnancy is in your uterus (an ectopic or tubal pregnancy can also cause bleeding and inappropriately rising HCG) you already likely already miscarried, meaning that the part of the pregnancy that develops into a fetus has stopped developing or died.  The tissue that supports the pregnancy can continue to secrete HCG so your levels may continue to rise until you pass the pregnancy completely or have treatment by your doctor (medical or surgical) to remove the remainder of the pregnancy.Unfortunately, one in ten pregnancies will end in miscarriage (this increases to one in seven if you are over 35 years old and one in five if you're over 40).  There is nothing that can be done to prevent a miscarriage if the pregnancy is not developing normally, so bedrest and/or medications will not help you and will just likely prolong the period of time it would take for your body to pass the rest of the pregnancy.  99 percent of miscarriages are due to genetic abnormalities, and having it die or not develop at an early gestation is nature's way of not having a very abnormal fetus continue to develop.So I am so sorry to give you sad news, but I asssure you if this is a miscarriage you have a greater than 90% chance of having a successful pregnancy if you are under the age of 35, and even in older women, it is most likely your next pregnancy will develop successfully.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes and take care,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"How to stop masyerbution .

Transient hypotension is a common phenomenon during pregnancy due to the altered vascular state. You seem to be suffering from postural hypotension, but, other organic causes also have to ruled out. I would ask you to see a general physician for a proper assessment. In addition, if you have had a normal sonogram picture in compliance with your stage of pregnancy, check for abnormal blood pressure, electrolyte imbalances and anemia. further management can be planned accordingly. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"i am 6 weeks and 2 days pregnant. Last night i went to the er with bleeding and was told the baby looked good but the heartbeat was only 82 which they said was not good. I have been really sick, coughing A LOT hard and feeling terrible. Can the coughing cause the bleeding and the lower heart rate?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through the query and understood your concern. Cough can cause stress and pressure on the uterus and this exertion can lead to a possible hemochorial separation which may present as external bleeding. If this happens, and if this does not stop, the pregnancy is at risk. The lowered fetal heart rate is suggestive of a possible threat to the fetal blood supply. In the current scenario, you should take absolute bed rest, avoid all stressful activity, get immediate relief from the cough through medication or natural remedies and follow up regularly to assess the pregnancy status. Serial sonograms of the pelvis and serial beta-hCG titres help a lot. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"hi im 22 year old woman with a son who is 2.my hairfall after my delivery was a normal issue , but has made me XTREMELY worried now as it hasnt stopped yet and i can see miniature thin hair falling out as well my monthly cycle has been normal after my delivery.i had 2 miscarriages before my son as i was polycystic at that time.please help me which doctor should i consult and what tests should i take.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,During post delivery period, loss of hair (associated with sagging of the breasts) is a common problem. This is mainly due to insufficient supplementation of the nutrients. The baby is taking whatever is needed for it. If the supplementation is not adequate, women face different deficiencies. Mainly proteins, Vitamin A (and even other vitamins also) are required for healthy hair growth. Please include high quality proteins with fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables in your diet. Bean sprouts is a very good source of pre-digested proteins. Iron deficiency and/or anaemia also lead to unhealthy hair and hence loss of hair. Please start iron tablets regularly. Use of Shatavari (Arrowroot) powder in a glassful of milk has proved to stop hair loss and sagging of the breasts. You may try it. Please do not apply strong shampoo and conditioner to the hair. Do not take head-bath by very hot water. Apply coconut or maka oil to hair. This will hep you have good hair again. Hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hello.

When they are more than 25 mIU, the pregnancy is diagnosed. Your size of the baby is smaller than the expected one at the given period of gestation. Moreover, the Beta hCG levels are dropping. However, the levels you have mentioned are confusing. From 261 to 19885 is no a drop but is rise. Have you missed a decimal point? I have read it as 198.85.  This is suggesting that the baby might be jeopardized. You should have mentioned about the presence or absence of heart beats of the baby. However, no conclusion is arrived by just one finding of hCG. Please repeat the test again after 4 days. If it is still on the downward trend, the chances that the baby is jeopardized are quite high. In fact the ultrasonography may be more informative in your case to know about the viability of the baby. Of the baby is non-viable, then you may have to undergo termination of pregnancy considering this as missed abortion. In missed abortion, the pregnancy should be terminated ASAP as delay may cause complications like heavy uncontrollable bleeding due to clotting defect (DIC), infection, etc. So please follow the instructions of your Obstetrician."},{"Patient":"Hello I am currently 35 and a half weeks pregnant and 4 weeks ago I had a routine urine test done that came back with a trace of protein in the urine.

Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I indeed empathize your situation and sufferings. Urinary colic, particularly kidney pain is excruciating and very difficult to tolerate. Since, now you are under investigations, your doctors do not want to start any treatment till the diagnosis of urinary infection is confirmed. Then, may be your urine will be sent for culture and sensitivity test which will identify the causative organisms and the antibiotics to which they are sensitive. Accordingly, you will be put on antibiotics. Meanwhile, you should not suffer from the pain. Phenazopyridine (Pyridacil or Pyridium) is a specific urinary analgesic which gives relief from the urinary pain. You may take these tablets - even two tablets three times a day is OK. This medicine changes the colour of the urine to red colour. Please do not be concerned about this colour of the urine. It is due to the colour of the medicine. Also drink plenty of water. This may give you some relief from the urinary pain. Urinary infection, particularly during pregnancy should be taken seriously. It may lead to rise in blood pressure also. Please monitor the blood pressure. To keep the baby safe, you should maintain your blood pressure under 135/95 mm of Hg. Also please keep a watch on the foetal movements. Please keep a written record of foetal movement count. Baby should move around 10 times in 12 hours. If you find the movements count lesser, please report to the Obstetrician ASAP. I feel this would give you some symptomatic relief.

The time to get pregnant will depend on the return of your periods .

MY QUESTION IS I WENT TO THE REST ROOM A FEW HOURS AGO AND HAD A BROWNISH DISCHARGE, SHOULD I GO TO THE ER OR WAIT?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear Martha,Brown bleeding during any stage of pregnancy should be taken seriously as it suggests the possibility of the non-viable baby. The decaying discharge from the non-viable baby and/or the old bleeding from the placental tissue causes such brown bleeding. When the baby is non-viable and still the miscarriage has not taken place, it is called as Missed abortion. Brown bleeding is a classic symptom of Missed abortion. For correct diagnosis ultrasonography is the best investigation. If it shows that there are no foetal heart activities, the sac is not healthy or absent, the Missed abortion can be diagnosed. If the baby has been non-viable for more than 10 days, the pregnancy test may become negative.Missed abortion should be terminated immediately lest the risk of alarming heavy bleeding due to clotting disorders (DIC), infection, etc. Please report to the Obstetrician ASAP. Following tests may be carried on your blood to rule out DIC:1. Bleeding time & Clotting time2. Platelet count3. Prothrombin time4. Fibrinogen degradation productsIf ultrasonography reveals that the baby is viable and it was slight bleeding from chorionic tissue, you will be put to bed and some Progesterone preparation may be given to you stabilize the pregnancy. However, let this decision be taken by an Obstetrician. So please do not delay the treatment."},{"Patient":"hi, I am currently 6 wks pregnant and my morning sickness has been really bad today (have thrown up twice) also I have been having loose motions (about 4 times today) is this normal for this stage?

Thanks for your help","Doctor":"Hi.Morning sickness is most common during the first trimester but can occur during any phase of the pregnancy. As for the diarrhoea or bowel irregularity, this can also occur during any phase in pregnancy but as long as it does not lead to dehydration, it is not something that should cause any concern either.Other symptoms of threadworm include insomnia, bedwetting, itching around the anal region, bedwetting, skin infection, etc. Diarrhoea is usually not a symptom associated with threadworm, although it can occur, it is not due to the threadworm. You can choose to visit your doctor and get examined, but in my opinion it seems unlikely. Also make sure you ask your husband to help with taking care of your daughter, and also use separate rest rooms.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi, I jus have a question I ve been off depo since August an I ve been having this brown discharge for about two months me an my partner had sex on nov.5 while I still had the brown discharge but then I started bleeding on the 19th so I thought it was my period but then it started to get light an it only lasted for 2 days an when I m on my period it last for 7 days so then I started looking up implantation bleeding on pregnancy an it said that it only last for 2 days an its a pinkish color when you wipe so when I wipe I get a pinkish color or nothing but I took 3 pregnancy test an they were negative so I was wondering if u can help","Doctor":"HI.The symptoms you are presenting with could also appear due to a hormonal imbalance that can occur after getting off the depo shot.

Blood test for beta-hCG is more reliable in your case.In absence of pregnancy, other reasons of late period are PCOD, ovarian cyst, hypothyroid state, over weight/ extreme loss, extra mental stress or anxiety, emotional upset, eating disorder, high prolactin.Here, I suggest you to undergo complete hormone profile (LH/ FSH, serum prolactin, progesterone, thyroid, DHEAS, testosterone etc) and pelvic ultrasound scan.Review with test results or you can consult with local gynecologist.

A beta hCG level of under 50 is considered what we call \\"chemical pregnancy\\" which means that a very small amount of pregnancy hormone may have been produced by an egg and sperm which did come together, but did not necessarily implant.It is true however, that a developing pregnancy should double the beta hCG level every 48 hours. In your case, since the level has dropped, it is unlikely that this pregnancy is normal. Your beta hCG level should be continue to be followed as even though your hormone level is very low, there is still a possibility of an ectopic pregnancy, however your most likely diagnosis is a chemical pregnancy, which is actually a kind of miscarriage.There is nothing anyone can do to prevent a miscarriage. Bed rest, taking hormones, or any other treatment cannot make pregnancy develop that is not destined to do so.I generally try to advise my patients were trying to become pregnant not to test their pregnancy hormone via urine or blood until they actually miss a menstrual cycle. Chemical pregnancy is a relatively common, one in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage and they estimate that if you include chemical pregnancies, which never even implant in the first place and produce bleeding at the same time of the patient's expected menstrual cycle the rate may be as high as one in five.So psychologically, it can be very distressing to learn you have a positive pregnancy test before you would actually miss a menstrual cycle. If you had not been tested, you most likely would've bled on time for your regular cycle, and never known that this chemical pregnancy ever took place. Furthermore, nothing can be done to prevent miscarriage in a pregnancy that is not destined to develop. So bed rest, taking hormones, or any form of treatment cannot correct the development of an embryo that does not implant.So I'm sorry to report that in your case, this pregnancy is most likely not viable no matter what you do.Once you pregnancy hormone level returns to zero, you should discuss the plan going forward with your fertility doctor. Certain fertility medications, when taken for longer than four months, can make your uterine lining thin which can interfere with implantation.I am sorry that this answer may not be the news that you want to to receive, however with proper medical care I sincerely hope that you can achieve a successful pregnancy.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I m trying to conceive for the last two weeks.

As she is 11 weeks or more now, the gestational sac should be easily visualised, so do not worry, visit your doctor for an ultrasound and get rid of that anxiety both of you are carrying around.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m 36 weeks pregnant and concerned about my health.

This pain is affecting me both physically and mentally as I m constantly feeling low aswell as being in alot of pain. My pelvis can t cope with the weight any longer and I m afraid of it cracking or breaking which is making me very apprehensive about labour. Will my doctor induce me at 37 weeks for this?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to this forum.A  pelvic pain is not uncommon in late trimester when your fetal head enters into your pelvis. It compresses the pelvic structures towards periphery, which could cause such a pain. Along with , are there any possibilities of constipation or urine infection inside you, which could cause this sort of pain?However, just start to taking seitz bath twice a day. This could be done by sitting inside a bucket full of warm water upto your umbilicus.Next, rule out whether you have any constipation or urine infection. As this is mostly physiological, your doctor will unlikely induce you at 37 weeks for this. You can try Advil 650 mg which is an OTC drug, for pain relief as SOS basis.However,please contact your OBG consultant if you feel any form of intense pelvic pain, tightening of abdomen along with discharge per vagina ; which signifies the onset of labour Sincerely,"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I am 24 year of age and starting with my 7th month of pregnancy on 24th July, I was ruled out with RCC in left kidney and undergone Radical nephrectomy at 4th month of pregnancy.

Just count it daily and keep a record of it. A count 10 to 12 per day is consideted adequate and if less than that; need an urgent consultation.Sincerely"},{"Patient":"Respected Doctor,I had intercourse with 'hirjas' one day with condom only. but my penis is pricking sometimes and while erecting also and foreskin attached to the penis becomes little bit red and still paining.

Though pregnancy needs a progestetone often,but a natural one.However, a 4 days course of sysron N has no such effect over pregnancy, if it is at all positive.I suggest you to stop the sysron N now and perform a pregnancy test after a missed cycle.You can proceed then your GP if pregnancy test appears positive .SincerelyDr Sanjoy"},{"Patient":"I ve been having contractions all morning but haven t counted how close.

Posture, overweight especially breasts & abdomen, improper way of walking/or high heels, bad weight lifting techniques can all put a strain on your back.strengthening core muscles, reducing weight, maintaining good posture while sitting/standing, proper techniques while lifting weight can help to alleviate LBA.Being pregnant, the growing uterus, pregnancy hormones can put an added strain on your back by shifting the center of gravity. do not attempt to do any exercise , other than walking now.Use pillows, as many as you need. they are a blessing in disguise. use them to cushion the curve of your lower back (the curve)whenever you sit.use them between your thighs and a wedge/thin pillow under your abdomen when  you lie down on your side. this relieves the added pull on the back.gentle massages with warm oil, warm baths can help soothe inflammation and pain.\\"just muscular pain\\" is still pain. and I understand how this answer doesn't help with putting your mind at ease. try all these safe methods during pregnancy. once you deliver, use a feeding pillow and a pillow behind your back when you feed. rest you back when you feed.if the pain persists after delivery and is severe, it has to be evaluated by a medical professional.any medication or OTC medications, creams you use should be checked with your OBGYN before use.the type of pain that should raise red flags is:- cramping at regular intervals with hardening of your uterus- severe twisting or poking pain of sudden onset. go to the ER or call your doc right away.hope this helps and you have a safe confinement.wish you good health. please get back to us for any further queries."},{"Patient":"I am 33 yrs old and as a child i took 1500mgs of Tegretol a day between the age of 9-14 yrs old now im having problems conceving and am looking into fertility treatments. could this by why im having problems I know there are many men out there having the same problem any many web sites for them to look at but i can not find any about women","Doctor":"Thank you for your query. Anti-epileptics taken in childhood do not affect fertility. If you are currently on medications for seizures, the more the number of medications, the higher the chance infertility. This is an observation based on research and has not been proved to have a direct effect on fertility. causes for infertility  are :Endometriosis, :Polycystic ovaries, :sperm problem, :structural problems of uterus /fallopian tubes/ovaries,: premature ovarian failure,: luteal phase defects. Timing of intercourse matters. Should be timed to the day of ovulation and 3 days before to maximize chances. I would  do a hormone profile, get detailed personal &  family history, ultrasound pelvic, semen analysis, follicular study. Based on this a treatment plan will be initiated. Monitoring basal body temperature and using ovulation prediction kits can help pinpoint day of ovulation and fertile days. Planning intercourse during this period increases chances of pregnancy. Start taking folic acid supplements from now. Ideally started 3 months before conceiving, this helps to prevent neural tube defects. Wish you success and good health.

In most countries where I have practise, a medical abortion is legal if there holds valid reason (like yours) until the 20th week of pregnancy or before (better if earlier).A duration of 20 weeks more than suffices to look for find/rule out any/all birth defects.

I would like to know what your outlook is about this. Do you tthink this is a new pregnancy or just my left over hormones?","Doctor":"Hi.No in my opinion, because the body takes some time to return back to the pre-partum state, and your hCG levels are just gradually dropping after the abortion.I am sorry your first pregnancy had to end the way it did, but what is important is that you are both repenting, and this is a sign from God showing you both are probably ready to be parents, so I really wish you both luck from the bottom of my heart.Say no to abortions, if they were widespread, probably you and I wouldn't be here.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I am pregnant in first trimester and my doctor suggested that I should check TSH level.

Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.Premature ejaculation is uncontrolled ejaculation either before or shortly after sexual penetration. It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. In many cases premature ejaculation gets better on its own over time. Treatment may not be needed. Practicing relaxation techniques or using distraction methods may help you delay ejaculation. For some men, stopping or cutting down on the use of alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs may improve how well they can control ejaculation.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time.Kindly regards. Wish you a good health."},{"Patient":"hi.i had intercourse and on the very next day i had my periods. so i dint take any contraceptive medication. i had period the next month too. but this month my periods have been delayed by a week. i took pregnancy test twice but it was negative. are there chances that i might be pregnant and if i am , i am not ready for baby so how can i get rid of it?","Doctor":"Hi.You had unprotected sexual intercourse almost 2 months ago and had your period twice?

Do I have a chance of having a normal pregnancy? or even having a chance to have a baby. I was 29 and 31 years old when that happened. I am now 36. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi.If no abnormalities were observed, then it could just be pure coincidence. Make sure you are active, but not overactive physically, take your pre-natal supplements at least 3 months before starting conception and accordingly during pregnancy as well. Chances are always present, but yours will be a complicated pregnancy purely because of your age. Get your hormone levels checked, and if all is well then there should be absolutely no assistance required for you to conceive either.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I am 6 weeks and one day with a heartbeat of 86 bpm I have had three miscarriages one a chromosome issue.

The baby was born dead but was re-lived. It has been a week since the baby was born and she hasn t had any progress. The baby does not move at all (looks like she is dead) and is connected to a ventillator to help her breathe. At first the doctors thought it was a neurological problem but that has since been ruled out. The only thing the doctors can think of if that 24 hrs before the birth my cousin had eaten cheese. Therefore, they believe she acquired a bacteria from it and passed it on to the baby. Is there any special test or anything that maybe her doctors are missing to figure this out?","Doctor":"Hi.At present, there is nothing else. I am not sure whether a neurological check was conducted or not, but I am sure it was when the neurological problem has been ruled out. So there is really nothing for now, lets wait and watch the baby.

You can choose to have a blood test to check on hCG levels, but I do not think that will help much either.If your period does not appear by the 6th week from the unprotected sexual contact, then go ahead with an ultrasound scan which can confirm the pregnancy. Do not take any medications in the meantime.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"hi, My wife is 7 weeks pregnant and has severe vomiting sensation and feels feverish/cold.

Is it safe to take Emeset-4 everyday during pregnancy? Why Doxinate is not at all helping her to control vomiting?","Doctor":"Hi.It is fine to take it once daily, but avoid using it more often.

The healthy sperm will swim towards the follicle as soon as the ejaculate enters you, so do not worry about what comes out.But to avoid this and to help the healthy sperm from reaching its target, I recommend placing a pillow below your lower back and also raising your legs and placing them on a wall next to you for at least 15-30 minutes in order to help the sperm.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Im seven week pregnant woman how can i get healthy pregnancy i having morning sickness now days im feeling very weak emotionaly also.. plz suggest me some idea to get rid of this situation sometime i having right side abdominal pain also is it serious","Doctor":"Hi.Using doxinate is safe during pregnancy and it is an anti-nausea medication, unto 3 tablets can be used safely each day.

However in the last 3 or 4 days i have had a significant decrease in discharge almost to the point of no discharge. Is this something that I should worry about?","Doctor":"Hi.No, this is nothing to worry about, do not worry about it at all. Discharge usually does not always occur, but if it does occur it is normal, so if it does not, then there is no issue whatsoever. Either way, report this to your doctor who may choose to check on your hormone levels, just to make sure all is well.Best wishes"},{"Patient":"hi im currently 10 weeks pregnant and i have had some bleeding the 1st was 2 light red streaks then it was a little tiny lump which was dark red and today i had quite a bit of dark red i went and got examined and all was fine down below they checked my hormone levels yesterday and found they was at 22 and they checked today and they hadnt changed is this bad","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Bleeding with recurring episodes at 10 weeks duration of pregnancy is not a good sign and needs investigations. Hormone levels may not be good indicators to help diagnosing baby's jeopardy since it takes about 8-10 days for the hormone levels to drop down  to non-pregnant state. Your hCG levels were 22 mIU. During pregnancy, they have to be more than 25 mIU. Any levels between 5 mIU and 25 mIU suggest that the baby may have been jeopardized or the baby may be present outside the uterine cavity (ectopic pregnancy). I would suggest you to get ultrasonography done which will inform us:1. Whether the baby is viable2. Whether the baby is in the uterine cavity or not. If the viable baby is in the uterine cavity, you may start some Progestational medicine with the advice of your Obstetrician; and restrict yourself to the bed till you have full one week without ant vaginal bleeding. After one week, again repeat the ultrasonography scan and then your doctor can decide about the further line of action. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I m pregnant in week 27 and for the first time Two week ago I had some brownish spotty and went to my gynacologyst and he asked me take primolut injections once in a week till the mid of 9th month, plus he gave me cycogest progesterone for only 15 days Is it safe on my baby? And is it safe to take it till the mid of my 9th month ? Thank u","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Cyclogest and Primolute are progestational medicines which help stabilising pregnancy, particularly in earlier stage.However, you had brown vaginal bleeding which denotes old bleeding or blood mixed with decaying tissue. At 27 weeks of pregnancy if there is brown bleeding, you have to confirm that the baby is viable and there is no risk to the life of baby. Ultrasonography will reveal the condition of the baby; so also it will help to locate the site of bleeding. If baby is safe, you may go for these medicines that have been prescribed to you, If unfortunately the baby is jeopardised, the pregnancy needs to be terminated without delay. Delay may be associated with complications like heavy bleeding (DIC), Kidney failure, infection, etc. Please get the condition of the baby assessed before you start progestational medicines."},{"Patient":"I had an unprotected sex with my boyfriend last wk friday though he didn t cum inside me,suddenly i am scared of maybe conceiving and don t know what drugs to take to be sure I don t get pregnant,please advice me on what to do bearing in mind that I ve an issue of high prolactin for some time now that ve seized to stop even with the medications I took in the past also I have a case of renal problem.Please come to my aid,waiting patiently to hear from you","Doctor":"Hi there,,If you are having a high prolactin levels it is unlikely you are ovulating normally, making you get irregular periods.You need to take mediactions for the same, after meeting an endocrinologist; also for the renal problems you need to get in touch with a nephrologist immediately; as kidneys are very vital organs and you need to make sure they function well.For contraception that will not be affected or will affect the above diseases you should consider Copper-T, an intrauterine device, it is safe, long term and does not have any hormones in it.It is very very effective as well and can be fitted easily on OPD basis. Get it inserted after your next period, 8 or 9th day after the start of the period to be sure that you are not pregannt .Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello dear dr. i have problem whit my sexuality. when i wana have fun time whit my partner. i very fast finishing sometimes 1 minutes . some years ago i used upiom when i wana doing and have fun . but i leave that . i dont know what are must doing whit this big problem please help me thank you","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using healthcaremagic. I understand your concern about the condition. Performance during sexual intercourse is a big thing on men's mind. Some amount of tension is quite normal. But excess thinking can ruin the experience for both the partners. The truth is premature ejaculation is common and mostly related to uncontrolled stimulation. Following are a few suggestions which can help you along the process. First of all, take the entire thing slowly, that is no hurrying. Taking it slowly is a plus point for both you and your partner. It delays ejaculation for you, and heightens pleasure for both. Hurrying simply leads to sudden overstimulation and easily cause premature ejaculation. Secondly, enjoy the act fully without thinking about any other distraction including premature ejaculation itself. This  will require some degree of patience. But it should also help with the problem. Thirdly, using a barrier contraceptive (condom), reduces direct contact, hence reduces sensation slightly, hence delaying ejaculation to some degree. And it has its own other benefits. Fourth,  a few pelvic muscle exercises also are said to help with premature ejaculation. One being kegel's exercise, where you clench the groin muscles which help to stop urination voluntarily, and hold for a sometime. It is easy to perform and can be done at almost any place. Try doing it at least 5 minutes twice daily. With practice and patience, it is quite possible to have intercourse while also enjoying it. If you have any pain or itching or other problems during or after intercourse, you should get it checked. Wishing you a fun filled life, hoping you get a better control over the act. I hope that your query has been answered with sufficient information. Feel free to ask any follow up queries you have. Thanks again."},{"Patient":"My head is always overheating. I sweat fast and have a high metabolism but im not active in any type of sports. I get headaches when i get too hot. Usually i put cold things like frozen peas on my head or sit infront of the Air Conditioner/Fan. It always calms me down. Is there anyway i can fix this? Im now pregnant and i tend to overheat faster now.","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through the query and understood your concern. Your symptoms are suggestive of excess function of certain body hormones that lead to excess sweating and this sort of presentation needs further evaluation to manage properly. This can also be hereditary. Now that you are pregnant, evaluation should wait ideally until you deliver as biological changes inherent to pregnancy can cause confusion in the diagnosis. Moreover, several investigations should be avoided in pregnancy and so are treatments. So, please try to take a healthy diet. Avoid fried food, fast foods, oily food and take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables along with adequate water. This should help tide over the situation. Wish you safe motherhood."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, my name is Maureen. I had Uterine synechiae following my miscarriage on 5/8/12. It has been treated and i took in last yr March.

My left tube is okay.","Doctor":"Hello Ms.Maureen,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. It is so sad that the conception resulted in an ectopic pregnancy. In the current scenario, the tubal motility of the remaining tube, its patency and the status of the endometrium, whether it is capable of holding an embryo safely etc., should be evaluated by an expert in high risk pregnancy. You may need to take a break temporarily to allow proper tissue repair. Once healing is done, given the parameters are good enough, you can try for another pregnancy. As you have no ovulation defects, your chances of conception are good if the tubal function is normal. Hope your query has been clarified.

If you have taken cerazette regularly there is very little chance that you could be pregannt. Do not worry about the same.The home pregnancy test works if done on the day of the expected next period, if done earlier it can give false negative result.If you are too anxious you could do the home pregnancy test on the next date of expected period.Do not worry, its very very unlikely that you are pregannt.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I had my gallbladder removed nearly 3 years ago, I m now 14 weeks pregnant, I noticed yesterday morning tat my wee was red and also this morning, brought a urine sample 2 my doctor and he said I d bile in my urine, I ve 2 bring him another test on Thursday morning, is this dangerous 2 t baby?...wat does it mean for me?","Doctor":"Hi.Having bile in your urine may require some amount of monitoring and intervention, but in my opinion there is nothing to worry about.

When a woman finds out she's pregnant, the gestational age is already 4 weeks (calculated from the first date of the last menstrual period). When a miscarriage occurs, all the products of conception are expelled out along with the endometrial lining. It is like a heavy period. However, sometimes, the placental tissue remains adhered to the uterus and needs to be removed either by medications that enhance uterine contractions and if that too doesn't work, it has to be removed manually by a dilatation & curettage (D&C). An ultrasound is performed to confirm that all the embryonic tissue is expelled. Symptoms of pregnancy - nausea, vomiting, frequent urination to name a few.

I told my doctor about this but recieve no answers. What is happening? Is this normal?","Doctor":"Thank you for your query. The last trimester can be difficult. Your body is changing to accommodate your growing baby. The pelvic & abdominal muscles stretch, hips widen,adding more strain to your back. This puts pressure on your crotch and a constant need to be near the restroom just in case you need to urinate. Pillows are a blessing in disguise. Use them behind your back while you sit. Between your thighs and tummy when you sleep on your side to relieve pull on your back. The growing baby and uterus put pressure on the blood vessels that drain venous blood from your legs. This causes stasis and hence swelling in your ankles.  Keep your feet propped up at hip level when you sit. Facial swelling, eye puffiness, persistent headaches, blurring vision, severe itching  is not normal and need to be reported to your doctor immediately Occasional cramping and tightening of uterus are practice contractions called Braxton-Hicks. These may cause some discomfort. Remember that any tightening/ pain at regular intervals lasting more than an hour, a gush of water/blood could mean you are in Labour. See your doctor immediately. Your baby should stay in for at least another 3-4weeks, ideally 6weeks. Some mucus discharge is normal. A thick blob of mucus, however, with or without blood could also signal onset of Labour. Too much white discharge could indicate fungal infection (possible in pregnancy) which needs to be treated. Go for regular checkup. Monitor your baby's movements (2-5 an hour except when the little one is  sleeping). Stay well rested, nourished &  hydrated. Your symptoms are normally expected in pregnancy (although it varies from person to person). Just monitor for the warning signs. Here's wishing  you and your baby a safe, happy and healthy delivery.

Endogest is a form of progesterone, and it is a pregnancy supporting drug which has been prescribed to you because of the bleeding you had early on. The bleeding means yours could be a threatened pregnancy, and the progesterone in endogest will help prevent that miscarriage from taking place3. No side effect of any ultrasound what so ever on the developing fetus4.

Everything else looks fine. Baby is growing fine with no problems. Why would my fluid be low? I was low/normal 2 weeks earlier. What are the statistics that all will be fine and deliver closer to due date? And what are the benefits of bed rest?","Doctor":"Low AF volume has many causes, from low production to fluid loss due to rupture of the membranes. Since you are fine and did not report fluid loss from your genitalia we can dismiss that as a probable cause. Next we must consider low production due to kidney absence or malformations but that do not seem to be case either. Another cause is placental insuficiency but the baby is doing fine and growing as expected for a normal pregnancy. Being that said I would mention a seldom considered cause, that is, poor maternal hydration. Before considering that you ask for an appointment to perform Doppler studies of the placental-fetal circulatoon I would suggest you drink more water during the day, water, not juices and sodas, water. Within hours AF level could improve.

My throat also gets dry from trying to get whatever it is to come out.","Doctor":"Hello, and i hope I can help you today.The sensation of feeling something stuck in your throat is a symptom of reflux- when the food that you eat or the acid in your stomach can back up and irritate it.  This is common when you have a large belly at full term because your stomach is being pushed up towards your chest and also the hormones from the pregnancy cause the top opening of your stomach that connects to your esophagus to be looser, so food and acid can leak more easily.The best way to try to control this is to eat only small amounts at one time and to make sure you sit up for at least 2 hours after meals.  Taking antacids, which for the most part are all safe during pregnancy, can also help.  Trying to cough up what you feel in your throat will not help because there is not actually something solid coming up.These symptoms may be difficult to treat, but the good news is the symptoms will get better after you have the baby.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am 21 weeks pregnant.

As far as my knowledge goes, Primolut should not be prescribed as a progesterone supplement during pregnancy. This can cause virilization of a female fetus if used at the stage of organogenesis. It can also adversely effect the differentiation of the male sex organs. There are other, safer progesterone supplements like Duphaston, that can be used when needed. Please check with your doctor once again if the drug has been correctly prescribed or not. Since you are spotting, it is essential to take absolute bed rest, avoid all stressful situations and have regular follow up to know the pregnancy status. If the cause of the previous pregnancy loss can be known, it would be more useful. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"This is a disgusting ish question I am sorry. I had sex about a month and a half ago.

I am more worried about the second time, so what are the chances of pregnancy for that?Thanks","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I-pill is very effective post coital contraceptive pill. It has got more than 90% success rate if taken in stipulated dose and time. I-pill has to be taken within 72 hours of the unprotected sex for its reliable results. Your friend has taken it 48 hours and 12 hours respectively after the two events of unprotected sexual relations. This is within the advised period and so she should be protected against the pregnancy. You need not be stressed for the pregnancy due to these two intercourses. These pills contain Progestational medicines. Hence, few days after taking the pills, she may get some amount of the withdrawal bleeding; and her next menses may be delayed by about a week or so. You need not be concerned about it. Such repeated consumption of emergency contraceptive pills is not advised lest the risk of hormonal imbalance leading to menstrual irregularities.

Followings are my comments:At first, I suggest you to undergo one home pregnancy test to confirm possible pregnancy. You can't take abortion pill without confirmation.1) On POSITIVE test, you must undergo medical abortion under the guidance of gynecologist, which will be helpful in emergency situation. Don't take those medicine by yourself without doctor's prescription.2) By procedure, at first, you need to take Tab Mifepristone or Mifegest 200mg (ideally 600mg) on D1, after 48 hrs take 2 Tab Misoprostol 200mg in the morning and other 2 tabs need to insert inside vagina by doctor.3) You may need double dose sometimes if proper bleeding DOESN'T start within 72 hrs. Soon after taking Tab Misoprostol, abdominal cramp and vaginal bleeding start within 7 days and next period may be earlier/delayed.4) Post pill abortion, you must do a USG lower abdomen to check retained bits/ conceptional products if any and may need D &C to complete abortion.5) Practice safe sex by using safe period/OCP/ other methods to prevent unwanted pregnancy.Be well.

You will need to get a blood test done to know the level of antibodies. The usual cut off considered is 20 mIU. If they are more than this it could adversely affect the baby.Anti-C though rarely found should be checked in all pregnant women as the presence of these antibodies can cause problems like ascitis, and fluid colloction in baby and in womb called polyhydramniuos.These anitbodies are more commonly seen in women who have had blood transfusion before.Once detected the levels have to be checked routinely during pregnancy and if increasing, a fetal medicine expert needs to be seen immediately.Get the titres checked and discuss the above with your obstetrician.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello, this is the begining of my 6th week of 4th pregnancy after least menstrual period . married for 9 years i had a missed abortion of 5 weeks after 1.5 years of marriage and then after one year again concieved and a healthy baby girl arrived. then again after a gap of three years I gave birth to a healthy baby girl aged 3.2 now. so this is my 4th. doc prescribed two injections per week ,daily ascard and follic acid tabs. my questions why is it necesacry to take these progesterone n hcg injections this time. regards","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Progesterone is a hormone required for stabilizing the pregnancy. This hormone is prepared in large amounts by placental tissue or the precursors of placental tissue. Before placenta is formed, it is the chorionic tissue which produces hormone hCG in large quantities to support the other progesterone producing tissues to produce progesterone. Hence, if there any signs suggesting that the pregnancy is at risk, particularly early pregnancy, either hCG or Progesterone or both are given to stabilize the pregnancy. The signs demanding for these are mainly bleeding in the first three months without pain in the abdomen. Sometimes, if there is bad obstetrics history with previous abortions in first three months, these medicines are given as a precaution. If you do not have any such history of symptoms, you may not require Injection of hCG and/or Progesterone. However, please continue to take Folic acid which is very vital for the growth of the baby.

Vaginal discharge gets heavier during pregnancy, and it normally has a yellow creamy color. It should not have a strong odor or itch. Greenish discharge may indicate either the presence of mucus (which can be normal) or either a bacterial or yeast infection. Yeast infections tend to produce chunky discharge with solid portions and no odor, while with a bacterial infection, odor when urinating or after sex is usually present. The way one could tell the difference is by an examination by your prenatal care provider, who could take a look at our discharge and let you know if it is normal. Your high amniotic fluid will need to be continued to be followed during your pregnancy by ultrasound but it most frequently goes away by itself. You likely will need monthly ultrasounds until it does. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful.

But when I went to pee after there was a very light amount in my urine just enough to turn it a little darker than normal, after that everything was normal. I am 24, have been tested for STI’s recently, also no new sexual partners and have no other medical issues, no problems with urination no pain or burning. What could this indicate?","Doctor":"Hello, But this could be due to prostatitis, UTI or ureteric stones. I would recommend that you get a pelvic ultrasound to exclude prostatitis and ureteric stones. I would also recommend that you get a urinalysis to exclude UTI. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards, Dr Salah Saad Shoman, Internal Medicine Specialist"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 41 years old and went off the pill 8/15/15. My period has not been regular and now I am on 40 days of not having it. As I wish I were pregnant, my test at home says negative. I have an appointment with my OB on Wednesday. Outside of perimenopause which can be the case, is their anything else she should look into?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. There are a few potential causes of irregular periods when women come off the pill. The first is that your natural cycle may be irregular, and you may still ovulate, and the irregular cycles are just due to discontinuation of the pill. In that case, you will usually resume regular cycles by 6 months off the pill if you previously had regular periods. The second possibility is that certain medical conditions, such as thyroid dysfunction or an excess of a hormone called Prolactin, can cause irregular periods. Your doctor should test for these conditions as part of your evaluation. Lastly, there is also perimenopause, which can be tested via blood hormone levels.So I recommend you see a GYN doctor for an evaluation... because there are multiple possibilities for why you are having long cycles. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am pregnant.

I have drank a few weekend ans took lexapro for a while, what affect can that have?","Doctor":"HelloWelcome here.I understand your concerns.Pot smoking in father will not affect the developing fetus.In your case, regular alcohol can definitely affect the baby's development. There is a risk of lexapro causing effect of baby development but only on regular use.Hope this answers your query.Thanks."},{"Patient":"i am pregnent of 26 weeks, i have one issue..i dnt like milk at all does my baby bone are fine becoz i am not consuming milk i like more salty things instaed of sweet do i have any other option to consume calcium so that my baby will not suffer from calcium deficiency. looking forward for ur rep.","Doctor":"Hi there,,From 28 weeks of pregnancy extra calcium is required as that is the period when maximum development of fetal bones occurs. If you are unable to take dietary calcium in the form of milk, then it would be wise to take Calcium supplements. About 1 gm of calcium in divided doses of 500mg twice a day can be taken.Any brand of calcium will do, you could try a few, see which one suits you the best, as some calcium tablets can be quite large and women find them difficult to swallow.Also do not take iron and calcium at the same time as they can hamper each others absorbtion.Hope this helsp.Regards."},{"Patient":"I had my wisdom teeth extracted with IV sedation and just recently after found out I was pregnant. I ve had irregular periods my whole life so I didn t know but I am about 13-14 weeks pregnant. Very scared my baby is hurt and since it s Friday my doctor isn t in her office. Please help","Doctor":"First of all, congratulations! Second of all, don't worry. By 13 to 14 weeks, the large majority of the organs have formed. The best time to have surgery (like wisdom teeth or appendix or gallbladder) is the second semester, which you are officially in now. At this point, sedation does not pose a large risk to the baby. Potential hazards that could harm your baby more than sedation for wisdom teeth extraction include alcohol, tobacco or drugs. I wouldn't worry about a little bit of sedation. Now, it's going to be important to establish prenatal care and stay healthy for the rest of your pregnancy. Again, congratulations!"},{"Patient":"im 33 weeks pregnant and i just lost my mom i smoked pot during that time i havent used it in about two weeks i got kicked out of my clinic and had to transfer to another . they will still monitor my urire and they said they were going to put a bag on the baby when she is born what does that mean and do you think ill be clean i was really stressed and thats the safest thing to use wile pregnant i know its not and axcuse but im just needing some help i dont want to loose my first baby","Doctor":"Putting a bag on the baby means they are going to do a urine drug screen on the baby. It could potentially affect your custody status if it is positive. The good news is you are only 33 weeks. Hopefully, you won't deliver in the next four weeks. Marijuana takes about 4 weeks to get out of your system. I implore you to stay clean for the remainder of your pregnancy. Good luck and I'm sorry about your mom."},{"Patient":"I m 6 weeks pregnant and having a reactivation of genital herpes. The current infection is very mild like the others, only 1 lesion. I ve had genital herpes for ~10 years and rarely get a reactivation and don t have an antiviral at home. Should I be worried about the fetus right now and should I get treated during pregnancy? (I understand the implications for delivery and will be on an antiviral in my 3rd trimester.)","Doctor":"Yes, you should absolutely get it treated in pregnancy. When we see it at the hospital where I work, we always treat it with a round of antivirals. It doesn't matter how far along you are. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"Hi i am a twenty four year old pregnant women i am twenty weeks and am having a waterey fluid cuming from my vaginal area when i stand up straight i had a big bump at the start of my pregnancy but now am completely flat again when my baby moves i feel it asif its right below my skin asif ther aint no water bag to protect my baby this is my 4 pregnancy and nothing happened like this before any advice would be great thanks","Doctor":"Hi there. Based on what you are telling me, I am a little concerned that your water may have broken. I'm not sure how long this has been going on or what you were doing when it started, but I definitely think it would be a good idea to go in for evaluation. If your water is broken at 20 weeks, you will likely need to be on bed rest for a while. Having your water break at 20 weeks can pose a threat to the baby and to you, namely, infection. If this watery discharge continues, please go get evaluated. It could also be completely normal, but it sounds like you know what normal feels like. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"I am 35 weeks pregnant,i have had HG through out the pregnancy until 3 weeks ago when it subsided and i got my picc line removed and i also developed pregnancy induced asthma at 24 weeks which subsided thankfully after a round of prednisone,i have been well since except now i am starting to feel bad again,fatigued,drowning feeling in my chest,and swelling on my right hand and leg that subsides after a few minutes of massaging and elevating.I cant sleep well i wake up coughing and overwhelmed by the drowning feeling so i have to sleep almost all the way seated up.and at andom times my heart feels like its beating weird like butterflies in my chest or something.is this all normal 3rd trimester pregnancy issues.my blood pressure has been 100/70 through out except when i was taken ill for asthma and random fainting spells.prepregnancy weight was 177 and am now 180,am 5.4","Doctor":"Hi there. This is definitely concerning. The symptoms you are describing could definitely be related to asthma. They could also be caused by your heart. You are definitely a little higher risk than the average pregnant woman and you could need some intense treatment up to an including delivery. The symptoms you describe sound more like a heart problem. However, I'm not sure if this is how you previously felt when you got asthma. I urge you to go get evaluated. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"I m 31 weeks plus 4 days, I ve been having bad pressure in my lower abdominal area for the last few day, I had a midwife appointment yesterday and she said the babies head was low down. Today the pressure has increased and when I walk I feel I need to go to the toilet, I went earlier and when I wiped twice there were pin pricks of blood on the tissue.","Doctor":"Any vaginal bleeding at 31 weeks is a cause for concern. The fact that you are feeling this much pressure plus vaginal spotting tells me you need to be evaluated for preterm labor. Likely, you are not in preterm labor, but I cannot guarantee you that you aren't without doing a cervical exam and monitoring you for a while. Please go to the hospital for evaluation. When you go, they will likely do a pelvic exam with a cervical check and put you on the monitor for a while to make sure you aren't contracting. They may run a couple tests and you may get an ultrasound to make sure baby has enough fluid. If you are in preterm labor and end up delivering, 31 week babies tend to do well, especially with the NICUs available today. Good luck!!"},{"Patient":"Hi! i was 5 weeks and 5 days pregnant and i started spotting in my sixth week of pregnancy. It started off with bright red bleeding that lasted only for a very short time and then turned brown and very light. it stopped the very next day. A day after that i started bleeding heavily, bright red and also passed big blood clots followed by severe cramping, dizziness and nausea. i went hospital that day and had both transvaginal and pelvic ultasound and the doctor said they could not see the baby in there but the blood test for HCG hormone came positive indicating i am still pregnant. Its been two days now and i am still bleeding, cramping and feeling dizzy. What does this mean?","Doctor":"By 6 weeks of pregnancy, we should definitely be able to see a baby and a heartbeat on ultrasound. What you are describing is concerning for a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage). The fact that they couldn't see a baby is also concerning. We have a rule in the OB world- a positive pregnancy test without visualization of a baby is an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise. An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy outside of the uterus, usually in the Fallopian tube- this can be life-threatening and needs to be treated either medically or surgically. I am not fazed by the fact that your blood hormone hCG was positive- it can take a couple weeks for the hormone to disappear from your system after a miscarriage or during an ectopic. Your hormone level needs to be monitored every 48 hours until your doctor can clarify if this is a miscarriage, an ectopic pregnancy, or a normal pregnancy. With the amount of bleeding you are having, it sounds like you are miscarrying. However, I cannot rule out an ectopic pregnancy at this point. Please follow up with your doctor as soon as possible, especially if you are still bleeding heavily or having a lot of pain. Heavy bleeding can make you anemic, which may mean you could need a blood transfusion. Severe abdominal pain is concerning for an ectopic. Either way, please follow up with your doctor. Best of luck!"},{"Patient":"I am a male who has a painless lump in my breast just to the left of my nipple on my right breast it doesn t cause any pain, but when I touch it its sensitive and sore on and no visible signs as it is a flat lump under the skin what do you think it could be ?","Doctor":"Hello, I have gone through your question and I understand your concerns but this is probably due to a lipoma formation or a lymph node reaction.

I had my follicular study on 15th day..report is as follows ..Right ovary F1 1.1×0.8cm, Left ovary F1 0.9×0.8cm.Uterus 6.3×2.7×4.8cm.Right ovary measures 3.2×2.1cm, Left ovary 3.2×1.5cm...im having irregular periods. Last month I had my periods on 35th day..please clear my doubt whether I have ovulated or not? Whether my ovulation is delaying this month &whether there is chance for getting conceived this month?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If your menses are so irregular, the chances of your ovulation are quite poor. However, you may monitor your ovulation by one of the following methods:1. Ovulation monitoring kits can be used at home which will inform you if and when you ovulate. 2. Ultrasonography ovulation monitoring is the best way to monitor ovulation. It gives direct visual evidence of ovulation. Moreover it informs us about the number of eggs released, the size of the follicle ovulated and the thickness of endometrium at the time of ovulation. Follicle between 18mm - 21mm size releases healthy ovum with maximum possibility of successful pregnancy. So also endometrial thickness between 9 mm to 14 mm is highly conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum (blastocyst). By this information, you can plan your intercourse every alternate day when the follicle becomes 17+ mm size. For regular menstrual cycles, clinical way of locating ovulation to plan the intercourse is by calculation of the days. Ovulation happens 14 days prior to the next expected menses. Egg has life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about week to 10 days is fertile period. I hope this helps you.

However, I don't know why your liver enzymes are elevated. We see elevated liver enzymes with several serious conditions during pregnancy including preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, and IHCP to name a few. These conditions can harm your baby and you. With the medicine you are on, it sounds like you make have Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (IHCP). Usually with this condition, you would have itching all over and elevated bilirubin in your blood. IHCP can be threatening to the baby and you may need to be delivered early. Additionally, I don't know what your blood pressure is and if you have any signs of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy that is associated with elevated blood pressure, protein in your urine, elevated liver enzymes (HELLP), and other bio marker abormalities. This condition is dangerous because it could be a precursor to eclampsia, which is characterized by a hypertensive seizure in pregnancy. A seizure can be dangerous to your little one because he or she doesn't get enough blood flow. I'm sure your doctor knows what he or she is doing. I think you are on the medicine you are on to help bring your liver enzymes down. Please make sure you follow up regularly with your doctor and go immediately to your delivery hospital if you have abdominal pain, diffuse itching, headache, vision changes, vaginal bleeding, or decreased fetal movement. These can all be a sign that something is wrong. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"Iâ??m 12 weeks pregnant and just got my test results for: TSH, 3rd Generation at (0.09 L) T4 (Thryroxine) at (12.6 H) Iâ??m a gastric by pass patient and Iâ??m not taking any medications for thyroid and never got a diagnosis of thyroid problems before. Whatâ??s going on with me? Is it going to affect my baby?","Doctor":"Based on your test results, you have HYPERthyroidism. Your thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormone. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include eyes looking like they are popping out of your head, fast hear rate, palpitations, shortness of breath and weight loss. This happens sometimes in pregnancy. It is often transient, meaning it goes away after pregnancy. However, it needs to be treated and monitored throughout your pregnancy. As long as you get it treated in a timely manner, it shouldn't affect the baby. The biggest risk to your baby is if you don't get it treated- baby's system won't make thyroid hormone correctly and could become HYPOthyroid after birth. There are many potential causes of hyperthyroidism, most of them benign. You could have an autoimmune disease, or there could be a mass there causing the elevated hormone levels. Either way, please see an endocrinologist for evaluation. You will likely need a thyroid ultrasound and you will definitely need medication to control your thyroid and frequent monitoring to make sure your hormone levels are appropriate. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"We are the childless couple. Of course, I have passed just two years of married life but we want to parent a baby soon. Since my wife had toxoplasma infection, she got foetus dropped in second month of pregnancy and she had to undergo the curating. There after the doctor gave us some medicin and she was tested again for TORCH and she had negative reports. Now the gap of six months prescribed by doctor to avoid pregnancy is over and we have changed the doctor with the new hopes. The new gynaecologist has prescribed her Siphene-50 mg to be taken from third day of menstruation and Meprate-30 from 21st day of menstruation. But we are not succeeded. Can any medicine harmful to my wife to concieve the child. Pls tell use we are confused as some one said us that maprate can be used to avoid the pregnancy.","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through the query and understood your concern. Meprate is not advised for the treatment of infertility and in those trying to conceive. There are other forms of progesterone safer to be used in pregnancy, micronized progesterones like Duphaston. If your consultant has prescribed medication without any prior hormone assay to confirm any deficiency, it is not proper. Since your wife had a natural conception previously, it is more likely that there is no hormone defect. Ovulation induction is done when natural ovulation is either infrequent or absent, but the uterine response is good for induction. Please contact your consultant for further help. Take care."},{"Patient":"My wife had pregnant for last 2 months, and she is patient of thyroid and have a regular dosege of 100 mg of eltroxin, but due to some mistake she has taken 50 mg instead of 100 mg. I have consult the doctor now her FT3 is 2.25, Ft4 is 0.8 and TSH is 51.775, Is it safe to carry forward this pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through the query and understood your concern. The need for supplementation of thyroxine increases during pregnancy in a sequential manner and the idea is to maintain a euthyroid state. This is needed to prevent the risk of abortion, preterm delivery and low birth weight, which are a consequence of uncorrected hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since the TSH levels are high, the dosage of medication needs to be raised to lower the TSH levels. The pregnancy can be continued after a sonogram of the pelvis, preferably in the trans-vaginal route to check the status. A single fault in the dosage intake is harmless and it can be corrected by taking another dose. Hope your query has been answered.

Propyl-thiouracil or PTU, is given to treat hyperthyroidism. The serum TSH levels are an earlier evidence of abnormal function than the value of the hormones T3 and T4 themselves. In fact, the absolute values of T3 and T4 can be done to assess the seriousness of the situation. If your TSH is within normal limits but on the lower side and if your absolute counts are normal, you do not need the medication, especially since it is not completely safe in pregnancy. Propylthoiuracil is preferable during the first trimester, while Methimazole is preferred during the later stages due to the hepatotoxicity of the former.

Since you are taking medicines that are likely to contain hCG, it is possible that you may get a false positive HPT.Also, your current menstrual history suggests some uncorrected hormone imbalance. Prolonged use of Clomiphene is not advisable. Please contact an expert in infertility to plan further management and avoid self-treatment of any sort.Hope I have answered your query.

Patients not exposed to this virus have negative IGM/IGG antibodies. Patients recently exposed have IGM positive and IGG negative antibodies and finally those who have a past infection carry IGM negative and IGG positive antibodies. In your case the latest scenario seems to be your case and it is unlikely that the pregnancy was lost due to CMV infection. You can get pregnant again anytime you want.

I have seen 2 Urologist and they both say I do not see anything wrong I told them that my penis skin on shaft tears when getting and erection and sometimes it feels like it is over filling with blood. Like you blow up a balloon to normal then overfull it and it tears and takes about 3 days to stop hurting. I also notice that sometimes I will get this ring of tight skin that forms like a collar around the shaft near the rim of the penis and it hurts extremely to try to roll the skin down and most of the time it will not move but the pain is intense. At one time it would have red bumps on the rim on one side and felt like the erection was crooked and leaning to one side and over hard if that is possible. My regular doctor increased my blood pressure Medicine to see if lower my blood pressure would help. Not a chance. I can not find out what is causing the problem. It only does it when and erection occurs. I am circumcised but it also feels like after and erection is achieved there is no skin movement, for example if you try to masturbate and pull the skin back and forth there is none or very little movement and the rim gets very tight and hurts but the tearing is near the base and midway up the shaft.

Nausea, tender breast, craving, lower back pain, and stomach aches but the pregnancy test keep coming up negative. Do i need to go get a blood pregnancy did? r is this normal? HELP! Thanks","Doctor":"Early pregnancy symptoms are nausea, vomiting, dizzyness, somnolence, breast tenderness but are not specific and depend on personal social and cultural issues. Hypersensitive nipples is a far more sensitive symptom of pregnancy than the other ones and seldom described. Anyway, if there is a missed period along with suspicious symptoms you should perform a pregnancy test to confirm or rule out pregnancy. Abdominal pain is not a symptom of pregnancy but it is frequently reported during early pregnancy and it is related to the ovary that ovulated and is harbouring the progesterone producing Corpus Luteum that is nourishing the developing products of conception. Good Luck!"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am about 37 weeks pregnant and when I went to the Dr. on monday we were told I am almost 3 cm and 50% effaced. He said we d probably have the baby by Monday, said 70% chance of that. I was curious what your opinion on that was? I am still having contractions but haven t gone to the hospital","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, From your question, I guess this is your first pregnancy. During first pregnancy, the effacement of the cervix takes place much before - may be about one week before the woman goes in labour. Your cervix is just 50% effaced; however, the cervix has started dilating. According to WHO definition, the woman is in active labour when the cervix is more than 4 cms dilated. During last few weeks, woman does start appreciating the contractions of the uterus. In fact the uterus is continuously contracting and relaxing throughout the pregnancy; however, there is no perceivable pain. These contractions are called Braxton Hick's contractions. When woman goes in labour, these contractions become stronger and woman starts getting pains. The labour contractions start at the lower back and radiate in front. then they are coming from above downwards. Successively, the intensity, duration and frequency of true labour pains go on increasing. When you are in labour, along with the pains, there is frequency of urination and there is blood stained mucous plug (show) found at the vaginal opening. From your history, you seem to be in imminent labour. You may start labour pains within a week's time. Wish you happy motherhood. Please start breastfeeding the child within half an hour of the delivery and for six months, give the baby exclusive breast feeding. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. Nirja. I am at the ninth week of pregnancy and the doctor says that he doesn t hear the baby s heart beat. since this is my second pregancy, I was wondering if there is any chance that he might be wrong or if there are case in which you can t hear the heart beat. thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. By 9th weeks of pregnancy all embryos should have a visible and audible heartbeat by Doppler Ultrasound. At 9 weeks the embryo should measure about 2.3 cm and must always have a heartbeat 120-180 beats per minute. If frequency is less than 80 bpm prognosis is no good and there could be a pregnancy loss within the next few weeks. if the embryo size is 9 weeks and there is no heart activity you are certainly facing an early pregnancy loss and uterine evacuation, pregnancy termination, is indicated. If the embryo is less than 3-5 mm there could be a mistake in pregnancy dates (wrong last menstrual period date) and the patient should be seen in about 2 weeks to confirm embryo health and growth. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"I m 33 weeks pregnant and have been forced to change my medication (due to inability in the country) from 100mgs imipramine to 25mgs nortriptyline.

What are the expected effects on my baby? 2) could his change from imipramine to nortriptyline have something to do with my recently elevated blood pressure - now 142/89? thanks sandy","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. Nortryptiline has not been assigned any category by the FDA while it is a category C drug with AU TGA, which means the drug may cause harmful effects on the fetus without causing malformations. Neonatal withdrawal symptoms and anti-cholinergic symptoms may occur when used near term. Labile hypertension may also be associated with the use of this medication and regular monitoring is mandatory with its use. If you have switched over the medication yourself, please contact a specialist immediately for proper guidance.

Can i use mt pills myself for abortion. please suggest me the pros and cons. Tahnking you sujata kashyap delhi","Doctor":"Dear Sujata,WHO has advised Tab. Mifepristone followed after 24-48 hours by Tab. Misoprostol for termination of pregnancy up to 9 weeks or 63 days of gestation. MT pills do contain these medicines. However, in India, medical termination of pregnancy by these pills is legal only up to 7 weeks after which the pregnancy may be terminated by aspiration of the uterine cavity by MVA kit. These medicines are prescription medicines and should be obtained by Obstetrician's prescription only. These medicines cause abortion within 3 days of the last dose of Misoprostol. It is advisable to confirm the completeness of abortion by ultrasonography and also make a follow up visit to the Obstetrician 7 days after the last dose of Misoprostol. These medicines cause developmental abnormalities in the baby. Hence in case of failure of the medicines, the decision to terminate the pregnancy should not be reverted to continuation of pregnancy; the pregnancy then should be terminated by surgical procedure like MVA or so. I hope this serves the purpose of guiding you.

Firstly, let me express my appreciation for the grace with which you have accepted facts. In the current scenario, endometrium is not congenial for launching of a fertilized ovum. Also, you seem to have the difficulty of ovulation as evidenced by the failure and infection of the ovary also has to be excluded, since tuberculosis often affects the pelvic organs together. You cannot plan for a pregnancy until you are free of the disease and all treatment stopped. The diarrhea can be a side effect of the medication. Regular monitoring throughout treatment is mandatory.

I am wondering if #1 this can cause harm to my babies (I m pregnant with triplets) and if this will show up in mine or my children s blood test when they are born?","Doctor":"Yes and no. Smoking marijuana during pregnancy has not been linked to fetal growth impairment. However, there is concern that marijuana can cause abnormal brain development and lead to impaired cognition, increased susceptibility to drug abuse, and other abnormalities.  That being said, there is no no way to know for sure if your babies will be affected until they are born. I recommend that you stop smoking marijuana immediately. Marijuana stays in the bloodstream for about 30 days, so if you stay pregnant for at least another month, it should not be in your blood or your babies' blood. I also encourage you to seek counseling for this. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"I am 5 months pregnant, and have painful carpal tunnel in both hands, they are a little swollen.

Blood clots are much less likely to occur in your hands than your lower legs, and massaging your arms and wrists can definitely help with the swelling and pain. It may not be a bad idea for you to see a massage therapist or a physical therapist, as they can direct their massage techniques to help alleviate your symptoms. On a side note, please do not hesitate to go the emergency room for leg swelling and pain, chest pain or shortness of breath. Your history puts you at an increased risk of having another DVT or a pulmonary embolism.

It could be high blood pressure. should I go to the ER or wait and call my dr in the morning?","Doctor":"You should go to your delivery hospital immediately. With your history of gestational diabetes, you are at increased risk for preeclampsia and eclampsia, which can be deadly for you and baby. Preeclampsia is a disease unique to pregnancy- you typically see elevated blood pressure with protein in the urine and a bad headache. Eclampsia is preeclampsia plus a seizure. Seizures in pregnancy can significantly damage your blood supply to your brain and your baby. Please go get evaluated immediately. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"Hi. I am in my first trimester of pregnancy, and last night I awoke with some pretty bad cramps. They felt like dehydration cramps, or just that I needed to go to the bathroom really bad. Nothing was coming out right away, but I started to feel faint and had to sit down on the floor a couple of times, and also felt nausea. I drank some sips of water, and broke out into a cold sweat after the faintness passed. Then I finally was able to pass my stools, and had some of the worst diarrhea I ve ever had. I drank some more water and went back to sleep. This morning when I woke up, I felt I needed to poop again, and liquid spurted out into the toilet, that I discovered was blood when I looked into the toilet. I ve gone a few times since then, and the bloodiness seems to be lessening, getting pinker, not as much, etc, but feels kind of bubbly when I am pushing out. My rectum does not hurt, I am not aware of a hemmhroid or tear.... Does this sound serious, or can I wait a bit to see how I feel in a few hours?","Doctor":"You could potentially be very sick. Please go get evaluated. Bright red blood from the rectum is never normal, especially when it comes with diarrhea. Depending on how much blood you lost, you could be anemic."},{"Patient":"I am 32 years mother of 3 children. I had normal deliveries for all my children, but the first one with 4 degree tear, the second one with Elective Episotomy and third one with 2 degree tear. I am having Umbilical Hernia soon after my third delivery which was on 8th march,2007, i don t feel any pain during my normal life. I have checked with a surgeon, he said that there is no need of correction as of now as it is small and advised for weight reduction as i am weighing around 85 kgs and my height is 151 cm. we are thinking to have 4th pregnancy after reducing some weight like 10 kgs, it may be after 10 more months. Will this hernia create complication to pregnancy and normal delivery. Should there be only c-section and hernia correction. please advise us.","Doctor":"No, an uncomplicated umbilical hernia should not necessarily create problems with your next pregnancy and delivery. Your history of 4th degree tear is much more concerning than the hernia, and you have already overcome that issue. If your umbilical hernia becomes more problematic (stuck out or painful), you could potentially require surgery. Hernia surgery in pregnancy is generally low risk and most patients tolerate it well. Overall, I wouldn't worry about your umbilical hernia until it becomes an issue. Many women have uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries with these. The only time I would be potentially worried about your hernia is during pushing. The abdominal pressure could force intestines or other tissues out through the hernia, which would make your hernia more concerning.

A simple cyst should not cause an elevated hCG. However, your hCG is not rising appropriately. What does that mean? Well, early in pregnancy we expect the hCG to double every 2 days, approximately. If it consistently does not double correctly, the pregnancy is abnormal and will likely end in a miscarriage. Your doctor is tracking your hCG level with blood tests- there is no reason to continue the urine home pregnancy tests. I'm sorry to tell you that this is not a normal pregnancy. There is a high chance that you will not end up with a baby in 9 months. Good luck!!

However, when she went to the OB-gyne upon internal exam, the OB-gyne told her, she can t confirm the pregnancy and she has to prescribe her with Dydrogesterone Feosol, to confirm it, saying it will make her have a menstruation if she s not pregnant or if she s not pregnant, she won t be having a menstruation. However my sister-in-law is afraid to take it because she s concerned if what the drug will do if in case (just in case) she s pregnant already. Please help us be more enlightened on what to do. Sincerely, Ivanna","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Dydrogesterone is a retroprogestational medicine. If the periods are delayed, these type of medicines were given in older days to confirm the diagnosis of pregnancy when clinically the diagnosis was dubious. In non pregnant delayed menses, the withdrawal bleeding used to appear within 4-7 days. Now a days, to confirm the diagnosis of early pregnancy, we perform hormonal assessment by Pregnancy test on urine or Beta hCG test on blood. At 4 months duration of pregnancy, in fact, no test is required to confirm the pregnancy. At this stage, the pregnant uterus can be easily palpated from the abdomen clinically. Moreover, if at all required, ultrasonography will give direct visual evidence of pregnancy. However, Dydrogesterone is a Progestational medicine. In cases of unstable pregnancy, we do give progesterone preparations to stabilize the pregnancy. This medicine, that too in single dose, will not cause any ill effects on the baby. However, my advice would be to go for ultrasonography which not only will confirm the diagnosis of pregnancy, but in addition will provide the information about the growth and normalcy of the baby.

If you have always had regular menstrual cycles, you can easily calculate your age of pregnancy from your last menstrual period.

You are experiencing Rh incompatibility and its outcome, which results in premature births and abortions if not properly treated. If the first child is born with a negative blood group, the risk of sensitivity is less. Yet, immunization of the mother is mandatory after the delivery or during next pregnancy with anti-D immune-globulin. In the current scenario, please see a specialist in high risk pregnancy, before you plan another pregnancy, to plan further management. Repeated unhealthy pregnancies only lead to increased risk of another failure and also deteriorate the mother's health. Hope you find this information useful.

It can be due to absence of ovulation. You can simply wait for the onset of periods or induce the periods with Tab Regestrone 5 mg twice a day for 5 days.  I hope this answer helps you.

I am not supposed to start my period for 8 days, but I still took a pregnancy test and it came back negative.

Home pregnancy tests read well 3-7 days after a missed period and when performed with a fresh early morning sample of urine. You have done the urine test way too early to know the proper result. At this stage, you can get an estimation of the serum beta-hCG tires for confirmation/exclusion of pregnancy. This is more sensitive and specific. Your symptoms are not specific for an early pregnancy alone. Please get a blood test and see a specialist if positive. If negative, you should suspect gastro-intestinal causes and get treated accordingly.

The medication comprises of Ergotamine, which is contraindicated in pregnancy. The rest of the components (paracetamol, prochlorperazine and caffeine) have not been shown to cause any harm to the fetus when used during pregnancy. In the current scenario, I would ask you to contact your consultant and get further medication and avoid self medication. Drug intake should be restricted in early trimester and can be allowed as needed during the second trimester. Hope your query has been answered.

With a twin pregnancy, all the pregnancy symptoms are exaggerated. This is because of the increased uterine size and as the pregnancy advances toward term, pressure effects are felt more. The edema can be relieved by using foot-end elevation while taking rest, avoiding prolonged standing/sitting and while lying down, trying to use the left lateral position as much as possible. The backache can be alleviated by providing some back support as this is mainly due to increased pressure on the spine. Take frequent small meals and plenty of liquids to maintain adequate nutritional balance. Get regular follow up and check blood pressure and hemoglobin levels constantly.

You need to get checked by an obstetrician immediately for these chils and the decreased fetal movement.Any fever or infection at this stage cannot be taken lightly and needs to be evaluated.You need to measure your temperature 4 hourly. Also do you have any complains loss of fluid, or breaking of membranes?It is a possibility that you have ruptured your membranes and are going into labour. But if you have chills and decreased fetal movement, any womb infection called chorioamnionitis needs to be ruled out.Also you need to get a ultrasound and fetal heart tracing done to check for fetal well being.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I believe I am 5 weeks pregnant and have been taking tetrasyl for several months. We had IVF to conceive our first child so did not believe it was possible to fall pregnant naturally otherwise I would not have carried on taking tetrasyl. How dangerous is this to our unborn child?

Only minor abnormalities are known to occur in few women.Do not be overly concern and get a NT scan at 11 weeks and an anomaly scan done at 20 weeks to check for anomaly.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor Me and my girlfriend had sex on 7th day from her starting day of period. During sex she din t have her pantie but I had my under wear on me. But my under wear got wet and its near to my girl friend vegina. Is there any chance of pregnancy for her?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Firstly, your body play took place on the 7th day of menstruation. There is no egg present on this day. The egg is released 14 days prior to next expected menses and has life of only 24 hours. The sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period on about a week to 10 days around the day of ovulation is fertile period. This is roughly from day 10 to day 20. So there is no possibility of conception by intercourse on day 7. Moreover, body play with clothes on and no vaginal penetration by penis  has no chance of pregnancy even if the ejaculation takes place in the clothes. However, to avoid such stressful situations in future, I would advise you to practise some reliable contraceptive methods like condom, birth control pills or intrauterine contraceptive device. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"i was released from the hospital a couple fridays ago after healing from a bad kidney infection last night when i went to go to bed the pain in the side of my infection ,, the pain was the indicator that something was up.. this is the same pain i had when i went into the hospital started up Again .. thinking nothing of it i went to sleep because it wasn t so bad i ended up waking up at about 4 54 the pain had gotten a little worse but not much i was up till about 6 And i threw up ( an other reason i was made go to the hospital.) im quite worried that my infection has come back ... but i don t want to go to back unless i have too.. im also almost 24 weeks pregnant should i head back to hospital or what do you think this is ?","Doctor":"Yes, you should head back to the hospital. If you are having the same pain and symptoms you had with a previous kidney infection in this same pregnancy, it is likely that your infection is back. Pyelonephritis, or a kidney infection, is more common in pregnancy than in the general population. As you know, it can cause serious pain, fever and other symptoms. More importantly, pyelonephritis has been linked to preterm labor. It is important that you go back to the hospital. If your infection has returned, it can be treated again and help give your baby more time."},{"Patient":"lease do not judge me, I have a problem, a serious addiction. I realize I need help and I feel extremely horrible. As I write this I am currently high off of a SINGLE line of meth. When I first became pregnant I was addicted to meth and when I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks I stop using completely...prior to stopping I was so heavily addicted I was injecting meth. I have been completely and totally clean up until this point, partly b/c my conscious wouldn t let me use. I am freaking out, I am so scared and I want to know if this will effect my pregnancy or my baby and if so how. Please do not be harsh, I understand I was wrong and it was a mistake. I am 19 years old and I m trying my hardest to do what is right which is why I am posting this. I would also like to mention, just to provide a little background info, I have had 2 previous miscarriages; one of them was when I was 15 and I miscarried at approximately 2-3 months pregnant, and my most recent miscarriage was January 18th, 2010 (this year) and I was also 2-3 months along and had to have a D&C. My current pregnancy was shortly after my D&C earlier this year, and like I said I am now 23 weeks pregnant w/ a precious little boy. Please please please get back to me and let me know if my son will be okay, this was a huge mistake...I m desperate, please help.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.The answer to your original question- \\"can conceiving while being high on meth be dangerous\\" is YES. Drug use early in pregnancy may badly affect the baby.The fact that you have gotten to 23 weeks is encouraging. Most of the organs and important structures have formed by now. The fact that you have been clean up until now is excellent.It is hard to say whether a single line of meth at this point will affect your baby or not. I urge you, however, to stop all meth use from here on onwards.Meth use is linked to preterm labor and many other pregnancy complications. If your baby is born with you having recently been on meth, your baby could go through withdrawal.Additionally, child protective services may need to be involved. I hope you and your baby will be OK. The most important thing for you is to stop taking meth. The next thing to be mindful is to get checked up.You need to make sure your baby is OK. Third, you need to make sure you have prenatal care. You need ultrasound to make sure the baby is healthy and to ensure your baby is growing. Good luck to you.Hope I have answered your query.

What could be causing this, should i be worried and how do i stop it?","Doctor":"Pregnancy does a lot of funny things to your body. I understand why green stool would be worrying to you. As long as you don't have any other worrying symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain or fever, you shouldn't worry. Try getting some probiotics in your system- yogurt is a good option. If you have any additional symptoms that make you worry, go get checked out. Also, if you have vaginal bleeding, contractions, leakage of fluid or not feeling baby move, go get checked out.

Before you get pregnant, it is important that you see your endocrinologist to make sure you medication is dosed correctly. It will also be important for you to see your doctor more frequently during your pregnancy to make sure your thyroid hormone is at the appropriate level.

If you had a negative test recently, I would retest in a few days. It could just be that you ovulated late and your pregnancy test is not positive yet.

Not sure when to tell the family and the anxiousness is just adding to stress","Doctor":"You can get an ultrasound whenever you want. There have to be cash pay ultrasound locations close to where you live. This may help alleviate your stress. The reason your doctor's office doesn't do ultrasounds until 18 weeks is because there is likely no medical reason to. If you have been healthy and have had no issues, there is generally no reason to have an ultrasound until 18 weeks.

However, pre-ejaculation secretions come out unknowingly and contain some sperms which are capable of fertilizing an ovum. Though she has taken unwanted 72, post coital emergency contraceptive pills, she has consumed them rather late - after 6 days. These pills are very effective emergency contraceptive pills if taken within 72 hours of the unprotected sex. Now the key factor is when did you have this venture of unprotected sex! The egg is released (ovulation)14 days prior to the next expected menses. The egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Therefore a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is fertile period. If you had your sex during fertile period, the chance of pregnancy would be high. So do your calculation of the days to find out the risk of pregnancy. Now you have to wait expectantly for her menses to appear. One hitch in this also is that after Unwanted 72 pills, there is a possibility of delaying period by about a week or so. So the best option for you is if at all she misses her period, about 3 weeks after this incidence of sex, get her pregnancy test done on the overnight first morning urine sample; done earlier, these test may give false negative results. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test which gives reliable results even few days before missing a period. If she is pregnant, you have an option of Medical termination of pregnancy till 9 weeks of gestation.To avoid such stressful situations in future, please practise reliable contraceptive methods like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine device.

I haven t been sexually active in almost 3 months and was with that person for about 4 months so I d like to think that std is out of the question (although from what I ve searched it looks like herpes. The rash is really dry, sometimes shiny, and itches like crazy. I also have tiny little bumps on my head that are not pearly peniles. I have no other symptoms or rashes or discharge that I m aware of but any advice is welcome. If I had to guess I would say maybe a male yeast infection.? I don t know though someone please help. If necessary I can post pictures","Doctor":"dear userabout your question i would like to tell you that these symptoms of rash on the penis refer to having viral or bacterial or some times fungal  infection....so if you found small blisters around penis and itching it suggest viral infection of hsv2 that aquired by sexual contact..you should see your doctor to examine you clinicallyyou need to do some investigations for that as urine culture as primary investigative test of bacterial infection as in this case you should have antibiotics for treatment .........discuss with your doctor to do urine culture and if bacterial infection suspected do  antibiotic sensitivity test as it will help alot.......you should drink alot of fluids and limit your sexual contact with others untill treatment completed........wish you healthy life"},{"Patient":"I am currently trying to have a baby, but its seems that I cant.

I started this Jan. 25 and its now Feb.24. my period came on on the 21 of feb. what should I do","Doctor":"Hi there,,Do not worry. Anxiety and frustration only increase your chances of failure.There are many factors involved in conceiving a healthy pregnancy, and it is not mandatory that when you follow all the necessary steps too and every thing is normal with you and your partner that you will conceive in the first cycle of trying itself.Most couple 85% conceive in the first year of trying. Only 15% face infertility problems. You should at least try for 1 year naturally before approaching a doctor for infertility or worry about it.The factors which decrease your chances of successful conception are women's age if more than 37 years, one or both partners drinking or smoking, stress, any medical problems or medications.If you or your partner has any medical issues like hypertension, diabetes, thyroid , previous surgery (esp. abdominal) any significant illness in the past then consult doctor prior to 1 year for help, otherwise you could try to conceive or a year and then seek helps if at all unsuccessful.Do not forget to take folic acid daily while trying to conceive.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello doctor, I am 35years old second pregnancy positive, my last month period is 2nd January 2014, today I took ultrasound sound scan it shows single intra uterine gestational sac of GS measuring 7.91 mm corresponding to 5 weeks 1day. it is possible to growing baby. what will I do.","Doctor":"Hi there,,Yes, its possible that that you may have ovulated later than usual and the pregnancy was conceived. With a scan report corresponding to 5 weeks, I would advise you to repeat the ultrasound after 10 days to look for fetal heart. This would confirm the normalcy of the pregnancy.Do not worry, take your multivitamins especially folic acid and schedule a repeat ultrasound after 10 days.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I had a short period this month of about a day or two which is very abnormal for me being that it usually last about 5 days. About a week after that I began to spot a little which was pinkish and extremely light, now it is sort of brownish and its still light but heavy enough to have to guard it. What could be the issue? I am on birth control (IUD), but for some reason I think I may be pregnant.","Doctor":"There is a small chance you could be pregnant. I have definitely seen a few pregnancies in women with IUDs, but it is not likely. They are a very good form of birth control. If you think you may be pregnant, it would be reasonable to take a home pregnancy test. The other option is that the IUD is causing you to have lighter periods. The hormonal IUD (Mirena/Skyla in the USA) are famous for decreasing periods- both the heaviness and frequency. I don't know what type of IUD you have, but it is possible that your decreased periods are due to your IUD. If your pregnancy test is negative, I would attribute it to the IUD."},{"Patient":"i was fooling arnd with my bf on 23rd february. we were naked. but there was no penetration at all. no ejaculation either but some pre ejaculate myt have been there. it was not around the vagina though. i was due for periods on 2nd march.

The fact that you have a negative pregnancy test is also reassuring. It is much more likely at this point that your stress is contributing to keeping your period away."},{"Patient":"I m 35 and 2 days pregnant .

I have been diagnosed with Hydronephrosis 4 weeks ago and was put on an antibiotic, which I have to take up to delivery, my question is are these contractions and symptoms normal ?","Doctor":"No- the contractions and other symptoms are not normal. You are still considered pre-term and I think you should go to your delivery hospital to be checked out. The fact that they are irregular is reassuring, but they shouldn't be happening at all. They are especially concerning with your history of hydronephrosis and antibiotics. Kidney problems, specifically pyelonephritis, is linked to preterm labor. Your headache could be nothing serious, but it could also be preeclampsia. I definitely think it prudent you go to your hospital to be evaluated. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"Please type your query here.

Exercise is great for you and is an important aspect of a healthy pregnancy. Listen to your body, though. If something hurts, stop or decrease the intensity. If you notice any abdominal cramping or vaginal bleeding, stop and go get evaluated."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 21 wks pregnant and I have a chesty cough.last night I was coughing alot and today I can barely walk with the pain in my side.Is this dangerous for my baby, am I after doing damage cos when I cough it really hurts and I need to hold my belly?","Doctor":"Generally, no. Coughing during pregnancy does not hurt your baby. You should be evaluated, though, to see if anything can be done for your cough to help you feel better. As long as you are not experiencing vaginal bleeding or abdominal cramping with the coughing, the baby should be okay. If you notice these things (Cramping or vaginal bleeding), it is worthwhile to be evaluated."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m two days away from being 10 weeks pregnant and the past few nights I have been feeling a tightening sensation in my stomach and it feels like my muscles are twitching and this is my second pregnancy. I was just wondering if maybe this is little movements of the baby, some people have said they experience this and was told it is the baby. It only happes when I m laying flat and really still, I have tried moving positions but it still happens.","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. Since this is your second pregnancy, if you had a normal vaginal delivery in your last issue, you will be well aware of uterine contractions. The twitching sensations you are experiencing right now are more likely to be early Braxton-Hicks' movements. Fetal movements can be appreciated in later pregnancies as early as 12 weeks onward. Abdominal muscle cramps are another possibility, owing to electrolyte and mineral imbalances. A clinical evaluation and a follow up sonogram helps solve the confusion. Please take adequate bed rest and avoid stress. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I want to know does pregnancy cause increase in sgot/sgpt/alkaline phosphatase levels. My ALT is 288, AST is 271 and alkaline phosp. is 277. what should be done.what medication are safe during pregnancy to reduce this.","Doctor":"You could potentially have HELLP syndrome. This a disease of pregnancy on the continuum with preeclampsia. In HELLP syndrome, we see elevated liver enzymes, as well as low platelets, elevated pressure, and frequently, protein in the urine. This can potentially be dangerous and progress to full blow eclampsia- seizure in pregnancy associated with elevated blood pressure. Eclampsia can be deadly. If you truly have suddenly elevated liver enzymes in pregnancy, you need to be evaluated immediately. You may need to be delivered emergently. Other potential causes of elevated liver enzymes in pregnancy are fatty liver of pregnancy, Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (you would have itching all over), hepatitis (food-born vs. blood-born), or it could be benign. I recommend you get a thorough evaluation at your delivery hospital today to make sure it's nothing serious."},{"Patient":"I didn t have an ultrasound till i was 29 weeks pregnant. The ultrasound said that i m due on august 28 and that i concevied on december 5. I either conceived at the end of november or on december 6. Is there any way to know if the ultrasound is correct or when i really conceieved?","Doctor":"Ultrasounds at 29 weeks are not as accurate as we would hope them to be. Once babies reach approximately 18 weeks, they start growing at different rates. It's difficult to know if your baby is actually 28 weeks and is big, or is 30 weeks and is small, or is 29 weeks and right on. Ultrasounds at 29 weeks can be up to 2-3 weeks off, actually. The estimation of 29 weeks is just that, an estimation. In short, no, it is not entirely possible to know the exact date you conceived 27 weeks previously."},{"Patient":"I have a red circular rash on tip of penile head.

Could I still be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, HPT positive indicates that you are pregnant. However, heavy vaginal bleeding indicates that you are having threatened abortion. 1. Please restrict yourself to bed.2. Save all the pads. If you find any white 'clots' on the pads, it indicates that the baby is being expelled out - incomplete abortion. Then you have to report to the Obstetrician ASAP. If the bleeding is alarming, report to the hospital; you may require blood transfusion. 3. Report to the Obstetrician for further follow up. You may be given Progestational preparations to stabilize the pregnancy if the baby is viable. 4. Repeat HPT after 8 days. If it becomes negative, you will have to undergo termination of pregnancy, since it indicates missed abortion. If HPT is positive after a week, continue on progestational support. 5. Ultrasonography will reveal the condition of the baby and will help to take early decision. 6. Threatened abortion with pain in abdomen usually cannot be salvaged. So if you start having pin in abdomen, please report to the Obstetrician. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi...

If you feel that the vitamin B tablets are causing you to feel nauseated, you could definitely discontinue them. It is not mandatory to take supplements in pregnancy, unless you have a documented deficiency or follow a unhealthy diet.The folic acid is the only vitamin that is proved to be beneficial in first 12 weeks and thus is recommended. The usual dose recommended is 400 micrograms.You can take other multivitamins if required after 20 weeks to prevent the nausea, as this pregnancy induced morning sickness usually subsides after 20 weeks .Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi I am Monika and 23 years old.

Is it ok to stop consuming both medicine.","Doctor":"Hi there,,Zeptol (Carbamazepine) and Clobakem (Benzodiazepine) are given for epilepsy control. And the fact that you are taking two drugs would mean that it is not under very good control. Could you tell me more about when was your last epileptic seizure ? And when did you last visit a neurologist.Epilepsy itself poses a risk to pregnancy and discontinuation of the medications is not advisable as it can cause the seizures  to recur and this could harm both you and your baby.I would strongly recommend you to take Folic acid 5 mg from today itself. Also get your obstetrician to see you immediately and get an ultrasound done to see if the exact weeks of pregnancy.You will need to follow up with your neurologist to taper the dose of the medications depending on how well your epilepsy is controlled.Epilepsy and medications used to treat it both are known to defects in the unborn baby. The risk would depend on a lot of factors, but is usually less than 5 %.Taking folic acid before getting pregnant and during pregnancy can decrease  the risk to a certain extent.Regular ultrasound and first trimester screening will be required to see for the proper development of the baby.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Hence, if you have taken them in this cycle, the menstrual period can be delayed for about a week or so. Delay by 13 days is a bit more delay. However, since your pregnancy tests are negative even after 13 days missed period, you are not pregnant; hence you may take Tab. Deviry for 5 days; 4-7 days after that you should get withdrawal bleeding. To avoid such stressful conditions, in future, if you do not want to go for pregnancy so soon, please follow some reliable contraceptive methods like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine devices.

Can Jan 31 encounter be the father even though he did not ejaculate in me? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to next expected menses. Considering that egg has life of 24 hours and sperms are active for 72 hours, a period of about 8 days is fertile period. You had period on 22 January, hence your next period would be on 21 Feb. (considering your period of 30 days).  So the ovulation day falls on 8 Feb. Thus the fertile period would be from 3 February till 11 Feb. If your period is different from 30 days, please add or subtract those many days in this calculation. According to your calculation, the fertile period starts on 2 Feb. So the chances of pregnancy due to intercourse on 31 Jan. are remote, though cannot be completely excluded, since variation by couple of days has to be  expected. It is too close to the fertile period. Though there was no ejaculation, you cannot exclude pre-ejaculation fluid passage which happens unknowingly. It does contain some sperms which are capable of fertilizing an ovum. So though the maximum chances of conception are due to sex on 2 Feb., for legal purpose, you may opt for DNA test to ascertain the paternity. I hope this helps you.

If your bladder is entirely empty during masturbation, then chances are that the sensation of having to urinate has more to do with pressure on your bladder, or potentially a precursor to ejaculation.Also, if your bladder is empty, then you know that if any fluid does come out of your urethra during masturbation or orgasm is not urine. It is similar to male type ejaculation, seen among women during orgasm.Urinating after masturbation is also a good idea, because it flushes out any bacteria from your urethra and can help prevent urinary tract infections.Hope, it helps for your information.

Any woman who has been having unprotected sex without using contraception is at risk for pregnancy. However, pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the symptoms people associate with pregnancy like breast tenderness, cramping, bloating, and mood changes are also common with PMS.  So it really is not possible to predict pregnancy based solely on those type of symptoms.The most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period.So if you are at risk for pregnancy, see if your period arrives on time and if it does not, then perform a urine pregnancy test according to the package directions.  The urine pregnancy tests sold in stores are just as accurate as the ones in a doctors' office and are accurate even on the first day of a missed period.  I strongly advise against testing before you are late for your period as the results can be less reliable and conflicting.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Im 13 weeks pregnant with my 3rd child (4th pregnancy actually, 2nd pregnancy was miscarriage). just heard the heartbeat monday. some mild discomfort as well as pain when applying pressure on upper left abdominal area under rib cage, more towards my side but not quite on my side. what could it be?","Doctor":"HI,    Thanks for the query.

There is a mention of the lower part of the placenta is touching the opening of the cervix on the inside, but this really is not relevant in the first trimester.  Your cervix is also not dilated, which is normal in pregnancy until the baby is full term.An ultrasound in the first trimester cannot tell if the baby is physically or genetically normal. This is determined by blood tests that will be performed on you late in the pregnancy, and a detailed ultrasound that looks at the baby's body when it is a bit larger, usually around 18-20 weeks gestation.So, in summary, for now, you have a completely normal-appearing live first trimester pregnancy.

I my menstruation is regular but this time i missed my periods for one week & it shows pregnancy test positive. by abdominal USG it shows only thicken endometrium wall 13mm. ans normal sise & shape. no others abnormality found. so what does it mean? am i pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.So, if you had a positive pregnancy test and did the test correctly, you should be pregnant.  However, if there is no gestational sac visible on the ultrasound there are a few possibilities of what may be going on.First, the pregnancy may just be too small and early to see on an ultrasound.  That can be normal if your period is only a week late.Secondly, the pregnancy may not be growing a fetus, which is a kind of a miscarriage (called a \\"chemical pregnancy\\") that gives you a positive test without development of a fetus.  Most people with this condition will eventually start bleeding and pass the pregnancy.The third possibility, which is the most concerning, is that your pregnancy is located outside of your uterus.  This is called an ectopic pregnancy.  The most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is in the fallopian tube.  The problem with a tubal pregnancy is that, as the fetus grows, the tube is not designed to expand and it actually can burst, resulting in severe internal bleeding and even a risk of death for the mother.Because of this, it is extremely important that you be closely followed by a physician for the early part of your pregnancy.  You first need a blood level of your pregnancy hormone taken and then repeated along with another ultrasound in a few days.  The hormone level should double every 48 hours in a normal pregnancy, and furthermore, if the hormone level is high and there is no visible intrauterine pregnancy then it is very suspicious for a tubal pregnancy.Signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include spotting, abdominal pain (especially if it is only on one side), and sometimes right shoulder pain.  Dizziness, shortness of breath and fast heartbeat may indicate internal bleeding.  If you have any of these symptoms, you should go to an emergency room for evaluation or call an ambulance.  So in summary- when you have a positive pregnancy test with an ultrasound that does not show an intrauterine pregnancy, you need to be ruled out for an ectopic pregnancy.  A blood pregnancy hormone level (called a bHCG) should be done first, and depending on the result your doctor will be able to determine what is going on with your pregnancy and determine the best course of action.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi there i just found out i am pregnant.

However, if you were only a day late with your period, you are at most 5 weeks pregnant.  At this time, there is no fetus yet and only the gestational sac has formed.  Therefore, there is no developing brain yet that can be harmed by the alcohol you already drank.So you do not need to worry at this point about the alcohol you consumed before you knew you were pregnant. Many women find out they are pregnant after a history of alcohol consumption and have completely normal pregnancies as long as they stop drinking.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes for the remainder of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Pain in lower abdomen and pelvic region with lower back pain..Also at times scroutum and base of penis.Get up multiple times at night to urinate.After ejaculation lower pelvic and abdomanal pain is worst and worst in scrotum and head of penise.Burning while urination however not quite as bad as all these symptoms started 7-8 YYYY@YYYY ago after i Gave MYself a enema for constipation.Was thinking maybe bacteria reversed into prostate area.ETC Did a basic urinalysis but no infection found.My lower abdomen is sore and gets more painful if a apply more and more pressure.Have tried tamsuilosin but i have to many sideeffect but it does help some with lower back pain.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

I dont know what it is, I know it cant be an STD, but i still dont know what it is.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.There are two main possibilities of what you may be noticing on your perineum, both of which are common during pregnancy.The first possibility is that the extra skin is actually a skin tag, which is a bump that grows from a combination of the hormones of pregnancy and the skin in the area rubbing against itself or your underwear.  The following is a link for some images for vulvar skin tags:  second, and more likely diagnosis, is an external hemorrhoid.  Hemorrhoids are bulging veins near the anus that cause the skin overlying them to grow more- causing the appearance of extra skin.  Here is a link to a picture of a typical external hemorrhoid:   Hemorrhoids can sometimes itch or bleed if they get larger; if you experience these symptoms you should contact your prenatal care provider.The good news is that both of these conditions usually resolve after the baby is born and require no treatment.  You may find that other moles on your skin may get larger during pregnancy as well, and they typically decrease in size after the birth.So I hope I was able to answer your question and that these images help clarify your condition.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi im on micrognynon 30 and have been for over 3 years now. i have never missed a period while i have been on it so im really worried as my period hasnt come yet. i always come on on the sunday as i finish my pack on a thursday, yet last time i was a day late and this time, its now monday, i have nothing only small cramps but nothing else. after my last period i started my pill again on the friday my normal day and that day i fooled around with my boyfriend, we didnt have sex but we did rub against each other but i made sure he didnt enter me at all.. im really worried that i might be pregnant as i have never missed a period before on the pill, also i have been really down and stressed during this course but that was 2 weeks ago now","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, I want to reassure you that if you have been taking your birth control pills as directed and you didn't miss any that the chances of your being pregnant are extremely small.  The failure rate of birth control pills in general is about 1 in 200 per year, meaning one out of 200 women has a chance of getting pregnant on the pill over the course of a year.Many women can miss periods for reasons not due to pregnancy. Your period can be affected by diet, traveling or changes in your schedule, and especially stress.  Even worrying about pregnancy can cause enough stress to delay your cycle.  Also, some women stop menstruating completely when they have been on the pill for a long time, especially low-dose pills like the Microgynon you are taking.I suggest you purchase a urine pregnancy test (the over-the-counter ones are just as accurate as a doctors' office) and follow the package directions.  If you are not pregnant, you can just wait and see what happens with your cycle and even if you never bleed just start your new pack on time and you will be protected against pregnancy.  If your irregular periods continue to bother you, you may want to see your GYN provider who may be able to prescribe a different pill for you that may help you have predictable cycles.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi I am 8 weeks pregnant I have had the Mifepristone Pill yesterday at my hospital, I have been asked to go back today and have next tablets inserted inside me My question is what are my chances of having a normal healthy pregnancy if I don t want to go ahead with the next tablets will the embryo be affected with the pill at this stage.. Is there anything I can do? Sara","Doctor":"Dear Sara,Continuing pregnancy after consuming Tab. Mifepristone will be hazardous decision. Mifepristone and Misoprostol, both the medicines are known to cause developmental abnormalities in the baby. Hence, once the medicine(s) are consumed, decision should not be reverted to continuation of pregnancy. After Tab. Mifepristone, Tab. Misoprostol have to be taken after about 24-48 hours. So if you have not delayed it for more than 48 hours, you may still go to the hospital and get Tab. Misoprostol inserted. If you have crossed this time, you may have to repeat Tab. Mifepristone which should subsequently be followed by Misoprostol. Even if these medicines fail to terminate the pregnancy, please do not continue the pregnancy; opt for surgical evacuation of the uterus, may be by MVA aspiration. I hope this helps you.

And now my belly is feeling weird can you tell me why.","Doctor":"Hi,    Thanks for your query.    I understand your concern.    In pregnancy, pelvic & hip joint ligaments get softened, being stretched due to growing fetus back ache & some times hip joint pain becomes a common feature in pregnancy/.Gravitational change in posture add to it ( body tends to fall forwards due to growing fetus , the line of gravity tends to deviate in front..while back muscles try to pull the body back & keep balance )/ Calcium & vitamin D deficiency add to the problem by making the bones weak.   In later months of pregnancy abdomen bulges, most of it is occupied by fetus. So the intestinal coils have to adjust in small space with lots of loops/ kinks / also pregnancy hormones make intestinal movements sluggish. This in all hampers digestion. causes indigestion,re3gurgitation of food/ vomiting ,/ with abdominal discomfort & pain.      All of these3 can be managed well by life style changes in pregnancy.

From last 12 years, My testicles always hangs in the scrotum like balls very loosely and they are never tight.

About 12 years back, I started to have nocto-urinal emmisions (night-falls), every week. After some months, there were some filling of itching over the scrotum, I used to make itching by hand, many times to remove itching.

I feel Itching even now and then and I use to itch around the scrotum by hand and itching is gone.         I still have nocto-urinal emmisions (night-falls), after 15 days or 1 month. I even masturbate, sometimes, so that I could not have nocto-urinal emmisions (night-falls). I feel ashamed on it.

He has also stated that due to 4 previous c-sections I am not a candidate for either vaginal or laproscopic surgery.  I saw him for my annual screening due to my other doctor being on vacation.  Do you have any thoughts on a mandatory abdominal surgery after c-sections?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, At the outset, let me assure you that caesarean section has nothing to do with your heavy uncomfortable periods and fibroids. In fact, your heavy painful periods are due to fibroid uterus. Had it been only heavy menstruation, thermal ablation would have helped you. Thermal ablation is destroying the lining of the uterus (endometrium) by very hot  fluid. It is the endometrium of the uterus which gets thrown out as menstrual discharge. Hence, once the endometrium is destroyed, there is no menstruation, and no heavy bleeding. However, you have fibroid uterus. This fibroid(s) will remain in the uterine cavity though your menstruation has been stopped by thermal ablation. This fibroid can undergo atrophy after menopause, however, remains as a vulnerable tissue for any type of degeneration including cancer. I would advise you to go for hysterectomy and not thermal ablation. Of course, it is advisable to undergo hysteromicroscopically directed biopsy of the endometrium to find out the status of the endometrium before hysterectomy. In about 30% of cases, cancer of endometrium is known to coexist with fibroid since both these conditions are result of high oestrogen condition. I hope this helps you.

Repeat the Ig-G and Ig-M of rubella after  3 months and if Ig-M is negative and Ig-G is positive it would mean that you are cured of the infection and have developed immunity to it. Then you need not worry about the rubella infection in any pregnancy from now as immunity once acquired remains life long.With the nuchal translucency of 4.5 mm it would have been preferable to undergo blood test called first trimester screening and then a  decision if further tests such as CVS (Chorionic Villus Sampling ) or amniocentesis is required or not should have been decided. To go straight away for an abortion was to drastic decision. The NT scan is just a screening test and its not necessary that all fetus with abnormal NT are born with birth defects, it just implies that these babies need more monitoring.Now you need not worry, take Folic acid 5 mg for three months prior to trying to conceive and you can try to get pregnant as soon as the Ig-G rubella comes positive and you are mentally and physically ready for another pregnancy.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"helllo doctor im 27years old married for 3 year had 3 misscarriages of 5 weeks,6 weeks and last one of 9 weeks last pregnancy health was fine with good caridac activity i was on hcg5000iu twice a weak and duphaston tab i also hhad taken ayurvedic treatment before getting pregnant for last pregnancy like uttarbasti,basti. i had heard heartbeat at 7 weak and on 11 weaks growth was only 9 weak with no cardiac activity. doctor said you must have to take clexane injection so ur pregancy might b succesful.is it true??","Doctor":"Hi there,,Very sorry to know about your 3 consecutive pregnancy losses.

The treatment for them is injection Clexane from early pregnancy as soon as fetal heart is seen. This can prevent the recurrant loss.But do keep in mind that Clexane also has side effects and you or your partner will have to learn to take the injection twice a day for the remainder of the pregnancy.The Ayurvedic medications will not help you and the content and purity of ayurvedic preparation are questionable.

If your pregnancy test is negative, many women do not have regular periods come back after discontinuing the depo-provera injection for even up to 6 months.  This, however, does not mean that you cannot become pregnant.  If you are not actively trying to get pregnant, a good way to help regulate your cycles until your own body resumes a regular cycle is by taking birth control pills.  Birth control pills make you get a light, regular, predictable cycle every month and will help control breakthrough bleeding (the brown staining you have all the time).  Many women have irregular bleeding in the first 6 months to a year of using the shot, and unfortunately the same thing can happen after you discontinue it.So, in summary, all the irregular bleeding you are having is likely due to your discontinuing the Depo shot.  If you need contraception, the monthly cycle birth control pill would be a good option that can also help you have regular cycles.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, i am on the Contreceptive pill but forgot to take one, carried on as normal and then had an upset stomach a week later, and carried on taking my pill for another 3 days until my pill free week. i didnt have another pack to carry on with and didnt expect having sex any time soon. i ended up having sex but used a condom which later had spilt. after 28 hours i went for the morning after pill. now i am due on my period and i am 2 days late. im reallly worried that i am pregnant.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.  So, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective.Many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side-effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case.  If it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so I would repeat it in a week if that is the case.In addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill.If you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks.  You should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I had taken out my nuvaring for a day or two to have my ring free week. I was planning to see my boyfriend in a week so since my period hadnt come i put in a new ring. I ended up seeing him sooner than expected and forgot i hadnt had it in a full week yet. we had sex twice on friday with no condoms, i took the ring out on monday and I have no period yet 6 days later. should i wait longer or will a pregnancy test work right now?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If you put a new ring in sooner than it needed to be replaced, and it has been in only for 3 days and you removed it, you likely will not get a period at all since the ring has not yet been in for three weeks.  In addition, you are still protected against pregnancy if you did not have the ring out for more than seven days.  You do not need a week for the ring to be effective except when you first start using it, as long as no more than 7 days goes by between wearing rings.So if i understand your timing correctly, you do not need to worry about being pregnant. A pregnancy test will only be positive at least 2-3 weeks after an unprotected encounter, so it is too early to test now, however you are not at risk for pregnancy.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am married for an year now.

I want to now how many time take MTP tablet.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for writing to us.Period inconsistency may be due to hormonal imbalance, mental stress, PCOD, over weight, high prolactin, pelvic infection etc.Intake of MTP tablet should be limited to 1-2 times in whole reproductive life to avoid ill-health effect. Repeated intake is NOT recommended as it may create future problem in conceiving. I suggest to use regular combined OCP if you don't want child for next one year.Medical abortion at home without doctor's prescription and guidance is NOT recommended. For proper dosing and direction of using those pills, you need to consult with local doctor, which will be helpful also in emergency.It can be done up to 9 wk safely by using abortion pills (Tab Misoprostol and Tab Mifepristone, present in MTP Kit) under observation or guidance of gynecologist as it may cause unnecessary excessive vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain etc and may require surgical method (D & C) to complete abortion.

You probably have PCOS, which is causing the irregular cycles and which is why the doctor has prescribed you the ovafor.You need to first get completely evaluated for PCOS before proceeding with the treatment.I would advise you to get the blood tests such as FSH,LH, TSH and prolactin done. These will help determine if the cause of irregular cycle and infertility is them.You also need to do ultrasound pelvis to check for problem is in ovary and womb.Your partners semen analysis is also necessary to get a complete picture.Kindly do the above tests and discuss with your gyanecologist.If PCOS is diagnosed by blood tests and ultrasound, medications such as metformin need to be started.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hey. i am 16 weeks of amenorea and a lot of contraction. i take natural progesterone utrogestan but I am living in Kenya and my doctor in kenya asked me to get an injection of primolut 250mg, I have called my doctor from my country in Belgium who said not to take that injection because its useless in my case and not good for baby and forbidden since many years in pregnancy in belgium, my cervix is closed but long of 2cm only and many contractions. primolut injection or not? thxs a lot","Doctor":"Hi there,,Both Primolut and Utrogeston are forms of progesterone and given safely in pregnancy. They are given in women whom we suspect to have threatened abortion to prevent from losing the pregnancy.Any one form of the progesterone is fine, you need not take both. They both have similar effectiveness and since you are taking utrogestan you should continue it. And more so if your cervix is long and closed the likely hood of you losing this pregnancy is very small.You need to relax and be positive, once reached 16 weeks and with cervix closed and no prior history of miscarriage, you are very unlikely to miscarry.Please continue the utrogestan till 24 weeks and relax. Also continue the Folic acid and other vitamins you may be taking.Anxiety and stress  will only make matters worse, continue the utrogestan.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, am 38yrs old.

The only reason TORCH can be of concern is if a person gets TORCH during pregnancy, the baby may be affected.You need to be evaluated for fertility. This includes tests of ultrasound pelvis to see the womb and ovaries.The HSG ( dye test ) to see if the fallopian tubes are ok or not.Your partners semen analysis also needs to be done.Have you already done theses? And has any cause for infertility recognized? TORCH is certainly not a cause .Take folic acid while you are trying to conceive and depending on the above tests further treatment can be advised.Visit a good gynecologist with above results.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello dr... i am 8 weeks pregnant... now i am suffering from severe sore throat, fever, malaise, dysphagia. consulted ENT surgeon - he said it is an attack of acute tonsilitis... he asked me to take augmentin, combiflam (paracetamol + ibuprofen)... is it safe in pregnancy... my pain is very severe...","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If you are having acute tonsillitis, you have to take antibiotics to control the infection. You have been prescribed Augmentin. Augmentin contains a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic in a group of drugs called penicillins. Amoxicillin fights bacteria in the body. Clavulanate potassium is a form of clavulanic acid, which is similar to penicillin. Clavulanate potassium fights bacteria that is often resistant to penicillins and other antibiotics. Hence it is safe to take in pregnancy. For pain and fever, I would advise you to take plain Paracetomol. Some researches have found that any NSAID like Ibuprofen may lead to miscarriage of pregnancy. I hope this helps you.

Chord never leaks. Please undergo ultrasonography. It will visually locate the site from where you are bleeding. If it is from behind the placenta, you have to be on the bed. Scan also will inform whether the foetal heart activity is present or not. Also it will inform about the status of the cervix (mouth of the uterus). If it is short and internal mouth is opening, you may require reinforcement stitch to the cervix after the bleeding stops completely. If the baby has not been affected, I would advise you to take full bed rest and start Progesterone preparation with Obstetrician's advice. So please report to the Obstetrician ASAP.

Precum does contain few sperms which can fertilize the egg. However, the precum can cause the pregnancy only if enters the vagina. You had masturbated your partner and his precum was ejected outside your vagina. Hence, there is no possibility whatsoever of pregnancy due to this hand job. Moreover, both the pregnancy tests have reported negative. So forget about pregnancy. The discomfort in your breasts can be due to rough handling of the breasts. I would advise you to use a reliable birth control method like condom, pills or intrauterine device in future during peno-vaginal sex to avoid such apprehension.

It falls into Pregnancy Category C; meaning there by that animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus; however there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.Considering this potential risk, you have to take informed decision about whether to continue this pregnancy or opt for termination of pregnancy. If  you want to go for termination of pregnancy, take the decision before you complete 9 weeks, ideally 7 weeks of your pregnancy since up to this stage of pregnancy, it can be terminated effectively and safely by medicines.

The reason part of me thinks that I might be pregnant, is because my last menstrual cycle was unusual. It was five days early, lighter, and shorter than what I am used to. Usually my period lasts three to four days and is 28-30 days between cycles. This last period was 1 1/2 days long to 2 days long. The reason that I think that I may not be pregnant is because I have had some stress in life that I have been dealing with. I live with my boyfriend, and we just moved along with starting a new job and quitting because of circumstances. I havent taken a pregnancy test of any kind other than ones on the computer that I have come across and they say that I may be or it is a possibility. I havent told anyone about this except some of my closest friends. My boyfriend doesnt even know yet because I dont want him getting his feelings hurt incase the test doesnt come out in our favor. So this is why I am asking you. Please feel free to comment and ask me questions. I have my reasons to believe that I can be and I can t be. I have expressed the reasons that I think why I may not be. But the reasons to let me believe that I may be pregnant are, other than my menstrual cycle, because of some symptoms I have been feeling. Although I was working for a short period of time, I felt more exhausted. I was falling asleep at a sooner time than I had in a long time. I was on my feel quite a bit with this job, but also noticed how much my feet were bothering me when i would get off them when finished with work for that day. Also when I mentioned to my boyfriend that my period was over for this month and that it came five days early, he said at least it came. And then I asked what it was he meant by this and he said accidents can happen. Although he said this to me the other night, it has been on my mind quite a bit. But later that night I also was planning on wanting to do a romantic night just for the fun of it because we hadnt had one in awhile. However I was turned down and he went back to playing his computer game. Even though this has taken place, looking back I have also felt some other symptoms other than being tired and my menstrual cycle being off, I feel like I have had an increased appetite. One night for dinner when we ordered a large pizza, I ate half of it by myself, I had eaten the first two pieces before I even knew they were gone, another day I had a bag of popcorn as a snack/lunch and I had it gone in maybe two minutes. Although I feel I have an increased appetite, I feel like I am using the bathroom more frequently. I have also been having more headaches, but not too severe. Along with everything else, I seem to have a lot of back pain and I can t get comfortable no matter which way i try to sit or lay down. Yet part of me thinks this is all too good to be true or too soon to tell. I still think that since this has been on my mind so much that it is playing tricks on me. But I guess time will tell when the next menstrual cycle comes around. But please share you opinions with me and let me know what you think. Thanks!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You seem to be in totally confused about the situation you are facing currently. Menses appearing 5 days earlier would not suggest any chance of pregnancy; however, only scanty bleeding for about 36 hours may suggest the possibility of pregnancy. Some of your symptoms like frequency of urination supports the possibility of pregnancy. Occasionally, some amount of bleeding is noted at around the time of expected menses even during first 3 months of pregnancy. Some call it implantation bleeding, some say placental sign. This confuses the diagnosis of pregnancy. I feel, there is no valid reason for you to defer the pregnancy test. Even period is missed and all other cardinal symptoms of pregnancy are present, the confirmation of early pregnancy is done by pregnancy test. Please perform pregnancy test on an overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after the expected date of menstruation; done earlier, it may give false negative results. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test which is very sensitive and specific test and gives reliable results even few days before menses. Once you have confirmed the diagnosis of pregnancy, please take care of your other symptoms like fatigue, lethargy, pain in legs, etc. They can be due to anaemia or Hypothyroid dysfunction. Haemogramme will tell the status of your haemoglobin also. It should be above 12 gms %Get your Thyroid function test to know about Thyroid status. TSH should be below 3. Hyperthyroid state does cause voracious appetite. Hypo- or Hyperthyroid state may alter the menstrual pattern. No pain is a symptom of pregnancy. So once your pregnancy status is clear, have a consultation form your doctor regarding the pain. And finally, what you suspect could also be very true. In the absence of pregnancy, most of these symptoms could be due to extreme stressful situation you are undergoing. Please manage your stress appropriately; take help of a counselor if required for it. Continuous stress may lead you to PCOS also. I hope this helps you.

May be, even if you are pregnant, you could have performed pregnancy test on urine too early. Ideally pregnancy test on urine gives reliable results about ten days after missed period or three weeks after conception. You have another option to go for Beta hCG test. These tests are very sensitive and give reliable results even few days before missing a period. Else, you may repeat pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample after about a week which wil give you reliable results. It is likely that due to the irregularity in your pills, the menses regularity also is disturbed. If your reliable pregnancy test confirms that you are not pregnant, you may take Tab.

Also, all that was done was that I was put on pelvic rest, does this seem right?","Doctor":"Hi there,,Bleeding in the 3rd trimester is due to one of two causes Abruption, which is associated with high blood pressure and pain abdomen, trauma to abdomen, or it is due to placenta previa where the placenta is attached to the lower part of the womb and it causes painless vaginal bleeding. An ultrasound to identify the exact location of the placenta is essential.A physical examination to monitor your blood pressure, urine albumin and fetal heart rate pattern is also necessary.Rest is advisable, as repeat bleeding may make delivery a necessity. Blood cross matched to your blood group should be made available and corticosteroid injection to help fetal lung maturity needs to be given.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello Sir,I'm taking prenatal tablets(one aday) from Dec .My periods on that month was on 25th.From Jan onwards we are trying for baby,My doubt is that ,for Jan and Feb my periods is on 25th itself.normally i'd periods on 27th or 28th day.Now m a lil nervous too.Is this a problem?What are the step taken to get pregnant easily?Waiting for your replyRegards,Binu Tijo","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for writing to us. Followings are my comments:1) Pregnancy depends on proper timing of ovulation & unprotected sexual intercourse. Ovulation occurs approx 14 days before next due date in regular cycle.2) Late or irregular period may be due to hormonal imbalance, mental stress, ovarian cyst, weight gain, irregular diet habit, thyroid disorder, pelvic infection etc.3) Above conditions should be ruled out and you need to take Progesterone pill (D16 to D25) to regularize cycle.4) Ovulation prediction kit should be used in this context to predict ovulation and you should prepare for that day for unprotected sexual intercourse.5) You would need to do this for at least 6 months to 1 year to make sure that you have given the natural process a chance.6) Vitamin E, Zinc and folic acid supplements are very much helpful in improving fertility and chance of pregnancy.If with the above procedure, you fail to conceive, then you may need some initial investigation to narrow down the possibilities. These include:1) Fresh semen analysis for husband2) Ultrasound pelvis to check reproductive organs grossly.3) Hystero salpingography (HSG)-for tubal patency test.4) Hormonal test-thyroid profile, LH/FSH, Oestrogen & progesterone level.5) For ovulation- Day 21 progesterone level assay or serial ultrasound on day 12-16 for follicle measurement.6) For cervical factor- Post coital test & anti sperm antibody test.7) Blood sugar (PPBS) etc.Hope, it will be helpful for your information. Good luck."},{"Patient":"We had an unprotected sex on 26 jan. 12 days after i experienced brown spotting once in a day for six days.

Early pregnancy test is NOT always give significant result.On NEGATIVE test, I can suggest progesterone pill to induce period if you don't get your period within next 1 week.Other reasons of irregular late period could be PCOD, hormonal imbalance, over wt/ extreme loss, mental stress, emotional upset, eating disorder, thyroid problem etc.You may need to undergo one USG lower abdomen and hormone test in the absence of pregnancy. Kindly, consult with your gynecologist and take advice accordingly. Cyclic hormonal pill is quite effective to treat irregular period.You should control body wt, avoid stress, take healthy low carbohydrate diet with avoidance of fatty food and sleep properly.Be well."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 39 1/2 weeks pregnant.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1 )  Please do not worry. 2 )  As you said that your urine pregnancy test is negative, and your Periods are delated,  it suggests that there was no egg formation in this cycle. 3 ) In such cases I usually suggest to wait for the period to start or Induce the periods with Tab Regestrone 5 mg twice a day for 5 days. 4 ) Secondly, PCOS is a lifestyle disorder. I will suggest you to opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Include more portions of fruits, salads and vegetables in daily diet. Continue with metformin,  you can opt for egg formation medicines like  Tab  Fertyl and ovulation study.  I hope this answer helps you.

I'm a bit worried","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The ultrasound you had just says that you have a normal pregnancy at about 6 weeks 5 days gestation.  It is normal to not see a fetal heartbeat before seven weeks, so the doctor just wants you to come back the next week to check for the heartbeat.  So there is nothing to worry about on the ultrasound you just had, and the follow- up visit is normal if they cannot see the heartbeat yet because the pregnancy is so early.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi i had a positive hpt on 38 th day of my cycle ,i had visited my pcp for conformation .she said that i am 4 to 6 weeks then an today is 47 th day of my cycle and i found very light pink (creamish)dischare.i din't book appointment with gynic yet.

I took a test last week it was negative.  I have a slight white discharge. Could I be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and the symptoms of irregular hormones (which can also delay your period) are very similar to the symptoms of pregnancy.  Women sometimes don't ovulate at the same time as usual, and other factors, such as weight changes, travel, and stress, can also make your cycle abnormal.Furthermore, in your particular case, your husband has been sterilized.  And you had a pregnancy test that was negative, which is just as accurate as the ones in a doctor's office.So I think you do not have to worry about being pregnant.To be totally secure about your husband's sterility, he could get a sperm count done to make sure the vasectomy worked, if you would find that reassuring.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"My daughter is 10 weeks pregnant and had been very sick the last 4 weeks, she is using Zofran, pheneragn, and a patch not sure of all the exact meds, I was very sick when I was pregnant  until week about week 12 and then slowly I would start to feel better, using hospital ivs and Zofran, she started feeling better yesterday and seems to be doing fairly good today, i also had 3 miscarriages and was not sick with any of them.

It is normal for pregnancy hormone levels to peak between 8-10 weeks gestation so the relief she feels is just to the levels getting back to normal. Most women feel the best during pregnancy in the second trimester, so everything she has experienced is normal for the course of most hyperemesis patients.Furthermore, every pregnancy is different, and there is no reason to assume your daughter's pregnancy should mirror your own.

You  should get investigated ASAP. 1. Please get your vaginal examination done to rule out any cause in the cervix or vagina. Sometimes, cervical erosion, which is a classic feature of pregnancy due to raised oestrogen levels, may cause some bleeding. However, it would not be for continuous 3 days. 2. Please get your ultrasonography done. This will reveal from where the bleeding is coming. If it is from the chorionic tissue, you will need some attention. In such case, please take absolute bed rest. Inj. hCG or Progesterone preparations will help stopping this threatening to the pregnancy. You may have to continue progesterone preparation throughout the pregnancy till baby reaches full maturity. 3. If there is no alarming type of finding in the ultrasonography, then this bleeding may be ignored labeling it as implantation bleeding or placental sign. 4. If the bleeding turns dark brown, then it is not a good sign. This happens when the baby has become non-viable. I feel ultrasonography only will guide you regarding the further management of your pregnancy. Please do not waste time. Report to the Obstetrician ASAP with ultrasonography images and/or reports.I hope this will guide you.

I have taken 2 tests one on the first day when my period was due and one today, both negative, my husband and I are trying to convince but it's only been 4 weeks so I'm worried there's something wrong","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Pregnancy test done in the first week after missed period may be false negative, particularly performed on the random urine sample. Ideally this test should be performed on overnight morning first urine sample after 8-10 days of missed period.However, delayed period for one week with stabbing pain in left iliac fossa should not be taken lightly. Please report to the Gynaecologist. You have to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is a serious condition wherein the baby is implanted somewhere outside the uterine cavity - most commonly in the tubes. In this condition, the hCG hormone which gives pregnancy test positive is low and hence the pregnancy test may be negative or weak positive. There is always a risk of rupture of such pregnancy which causes threateningly alarming bleeding. Such accident usually needs lot of blood transfusion and surgical intervention. Ultrasonography will help you find out whether the pregnancy is located in the uterus or somewhere else. Also please repeat pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample after 4 days. Alternatively you may opt for Beta hCG test. This is very sensitive test. If it is positive and/or weak positive and the uterus is empty, it suggests ectopic pregnancy. Then Laparoscopy is advisable. If it reveals unruptured ectopic pregnancy, it can be managed through laparoscopic surgery and further catastrophic bleeding can be prevented. I hope this guides you for further steps.

You have miscarried twice in the past and hence are naturally stressed out due to the current situation. It is good that your scan has revealed that the foetal heart is normal and fine. I would have appreciated if you were informed about the site of the bleeding; however, since your doctor has not made any of the mention about it, it should not be from the chorionic tissue. Since you are having spotting/minor bleeding, I would advise to take some natural progesterone preparation from your Obstetrician. Also restrict yourself to the bed till your bleeding stops completely. Repeat the ultrasonography after a week to find out the status of pregnancy and baby. Depending up on the findings of this ultrasonography, further management can be planned. I hope this helps you.

Previously 8 weeks miscarriage happened 1.5 yrs back d&c done. I am diabatic with irregular periods","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You had previous miscarriage of 8 weeks. Hence you have been prescribed Sustain 200 for being on the safer side. Sustain 200 is a progesterone preparation which helps to stabilize the pregnancy. In the scan, sac was found without heart activity. At 5 weeks, probably it is rather too early for cardiac activity to be noted. A repeat ultrasonography after one week may note the cardiac activity. If cardiac activity is noted, please continue Sustain to keep the pregnancy stabilized. However, if the cardiac activity is not noted even after one week and the margins of the sac are irregular, it is a pregnancy without baby in the gestational sac. This condition is known as Blighted ovum. Such pregnancy does not grow and needs termination of pregnancy if it does not get terminated naturally. So at this stage, continue with Sustain 200, repeat the scan after a week or more and then let the Obstetrician take further decision. I hope, this clarifies your doubts.

She is into her 7th month of pregnancy and her Haemoglobin level is 9.6. What kind of specific precautions we need to take. Also is there a need to arrange for blood during her delivery. I am not thalesemia carrier and my blood group is B Rh Positive.","Doctor":"Hi there,,A hemoglobin of 9.6 is on the lower side though its what's expected in a thalessemia minor patient.Yes its better that she delivers in a well equipped hospital which has adequate B negative blood which is cross matched to her kept ready for her if required.The negative blood group also is slightly more difficult to arrange and should be kept in mind .Since you are yourself not a thalessemia carrier it implies that the baby will not be affected by thalessemia.Your wife will need to do her anti-D titres at 28 weeks and if negative she should take inj. Rhogam 1500 IU at 28 weeks and again after delivery of baby if baby blood group is Rh positive she should repeat the inj. Rhogam within 72 hours of birth.This is to prevent her from being sensitized to the Rh positive red cells and can prevent complications in future babies.

I have been advised to take Doxinate tablet only when necessary.Is it safe. And pls suggest me good diet and also what to eat at midnight after vomit.It ll be a great help.Thankew in advance!","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the vomitings might persist upto 5 months in a few pregnant woman.Take doxinate. It is safe and it is the first line of drug in treating vomitings during pregnancy.Its good that the vomitings are controlled by medicines.There is nothing specific regarding vomiting at midnight.But avoid spicy and oily diet .Take bland diet at night.The vomiting can also be due to gastritis.So if there is heartburn antacids also might be helpful.Take adequate fluids upto 3 litres per day,coconut water to prevent dehydration caused due to vomitings.Nothing to worry as such.They will subside spontaneously around 5 months mostly.Hope this helps.Best regards...."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My anomaly scan is done last week and my weighs about 486+_ 71 gms.. And everything is normal. But right from starting my weight increased by 10kg (from 56 to 66 kg now). Is this increase in weight will give any risk during normal delivery ?This is my first baby.","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.Usually the required weight gain in pregnancy depends on the pre pregnancy weight.If the pre pregnancy weight is :-1)Normal weight:-about 11-16 kg of weight gain is desirable.2)If overweight or obesity-not more than 7kg.3)If underweight-upto 18 kg weight is desirable.So if the weight gain is more than the desired one any high BP and any diabetes in mother should be ruled out.So I suggest you to consult doctor and get BP and blood sugars done to rule out hypertension and diabetes.If they are normal nothing to worry.And depending on your pre pregnancy weight check your weight gain.If the weight gain seems more avoid high carbohydrate diet and practice antenatal exercise or walking daily.Avoid stress.Nothing to worry.Hope this helps.Best regards....."},{"Patient":"hi, im 11 weeks pregent. im having very little brown colour bleeding since 3 days. doctor did the scan and told that baby is fine. and the leakage is from outside the utrus. & she suggested me to take duphaston for 15 days. im having slight lower abdominal pain on my right side. is everything fine with my baby, pls help.","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion there are various causes for bleeding during pregnancy like :-1)Thyroid abnormalities .2)Progesterone insufficiency.3)Abnormal pregnancy like miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.4)Bleeding from cervix.etc.So all the above causes should be ruled out by physical examination and necessary investigations.Ultrasound helps to know the well being of fetus.As ultrasound is normal you need not worry.Thyroid profile helps to rule out any thyroid abnormalities.As per your information the bleeding is from outside the uterus which might indicate the bleeding from cervix.Don't worry in some cases even though with the presence of bleeding everything will be normal and pregnancy continues till term and have good outcome.Relax.Avoid physical stress and intercourse.Take folic acid and progesterone supplements.Take iron rich diet and iron supplements to combat anaemia caused due to blood loss.Hope this helps .Best regards..."},{"Patient":"Hello there.Last week I stayed with my BF for 6 days and we had a lot of sex during the time without protection.

Thank you.Additional Details Can this be taken as a sign of pregnancy ? The discharge is lumpy thick sticky and white","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the lumpy white discharge cannot be taken as the sign of pregnancy.The first sign of pregnancy is missed period.Other symptoms of pregnancy are nausea,vomitings,increased urination,sore breasts start 2 weeks after missed period in case of pregnancy.A urine pregnancy test is done a week after missed period for accurate results.The White discharge which you have is the normal discharge seen during the menstrual cycle under the influence of hormones.So relax.Nothing to worry.Avoid stress.It is too early to feel any pregnancy symptoms.So wait and check for the period.Hope this helps.Best regards...."},{"Patient":"I m pregnant and am having more then constipation problems.

You seem to have extreme constipation resulting in prolapse of rectum... where lower part of rectal mucosa bulges out due to excessive straining. It may get infected, swollen, start bleeding.

Really i need your help. Because im in middle east now thats why i cant get pregnant","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, WHO has recommended Tab. Mifepristone to be followed after 24-48 hours by Tab. Misoprostol for termination of pregnancy up to 9 weeks of gestation. After last dose of Misoprostol, usually abortion starts within 24 hours; however, occasionally it may be delayed up to 7 days. The completeness of abortion can be ascertained by ultrasonography. For this purpose, pregnancy test on urine is not useful since it requires more than a week to become negative. These medicines are prescription medicines and should be obtained by Obstetrician's prescription with advive regarding the dose and schedule of medicines. It is advisable to have a follow up visit to the Obstetrician after 7 days of medicines. These medicines cause developmental abnormalities in the baby. Hence, in case of failure, the decision should not be changed to continuation of pregnancy; pregnancy should be terminated by surgical methods like MVA aspiration. I hope this helps you.

Furthermore, pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and some of the same symptoms (like bloating and breast tenderness) can be caused by PMS as well as pregnancy.So the most accurate way to determine if you are pregnant is to do a urine pregnancy test, which can be purchased at a pharmacy or chemist without a doctor's prescription.  The over-the-counter pregnancy test is as accurate as one in the doctor's office, and looks specifically for the presence of the pregnancy hormone in your urine.Many women can miss a period from weight changes, traveling or change in your daily schedule, and stress, among other hormonal factors.  Even worrying about being pregnant can sometimes make you skip a cycle.So in summary, the interpretation of the Dettol test can be quite variable, so i recommend proceeding with a urine pregnancy test to confirm your diagnosis.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi my sister has the implant taken out on 5th November and straight away tried to get pregnant. Well she is now pregnant but she had a period in December and a little in January but the midwife says she can feel her uterus and is about 12-13 weeks but from her period and her clear blue test she is only 6 weeks. Could she be having twins or just have a thick uterus?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The Clearblue test is not very accurate in predicting gestational age.  The amount of pregnancy hormone in a woman's urine can vary depending on the time of day she did the test and how much water she had to drink before the test, so i would not rely on that test to determine how far along she is.  Furthermore, many women have some bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy, so the bleeding she had in December and January may not have been her real period at all.The most accurate way to test the age of a pregnancy, is an ultrasound exam to measure the fetus.  This is normally done during the course of her routine prenatal care.  An ultrasound is also necessary to determine if there is more than one fetus present.In your sister's case, if she conceived in November, the measurements of her uterus at this point would be accurate.  So I would recommend that she have an ultrasound exam (which I am sure will be done soon as part of her routine prenatal care) to confirm her due date and the viability of the pregnancy.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes to your sister for her pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi,i used mifepristone tablets the day before yesterday,i then used misoprostol tablets (4) for abortion.

I experienced cramps and bleeding with cloats,for almost two hours,the problem is am experiencing bloating  and slight abdominal pain plus am stil bleeding,,is that ok?","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion presence of bloating and abdominal cramps along with bleeding is normal.The bleeding after taking the abortion pills is heavy with passage of clots initially.Then the bleeding decreases but will continue till a week or more.The cramps are due to uterine contractions to expel the products of conception.The bloating can be due to sideeffect of abortion pills.So whatever you are experiencing is normal.

Ideally, the pregnancy tests on urine should be performed 8-10 days after missed period on overnight early morning first urine sample for reliable results. Done earlier, the tests may be false negative. However, there is another test - Beta hCG test which can give reliable results even few days before missing period. However, even after 8 days you have got the faint positive line; i.e. weak positive test, it suggests that the hormone hCG is low. This happens commonly in following conditions:1. Test performed too early - may be delayed conception. 2. When the baby has become non-viable. This is known as missed abortion. Then hCG gradually starts declining and hence week positive test.3. Ectopic pregnancy: In this condition the baby is implanted somewhere outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the tube. It is a very serious condition. Subsequently tube ruptures and causes alarming bleeding. It needs blood transfusion and surgical intervention.   The best option for differential diagnosis is ultrasonography. In normal pregnancy, intrauterine sac will be seen with foetal cardiac activity.In non-viable baby (missed abortion), the foetal heart will be missing and sac will be irregular. In such cases timely termination of pregnancy is indicated lest the serious complications like threatening bleeding due to clotting defects (DIC), infection, kidney failure, etc. If the uterine cavity is empty in spite of (weak) positive test, it indicates that the implantation is somewhere else; i.e. ectopic pregnancy. Laparoscopy will help to confirm the diagnosis. If it is unruptured ectopic pregnancy, it can be managed by laparoscopy only. Please report to your Gynaecologist and undergo ultrasonography for correct diagnosis and managing the pregnancy appropriately. I am sure this helps you.

Two consecutive miscarriages are also seen in about 3% of the women. But if a women has 3 miscarriages in a row we need to check for problems.I would advise you to try to conceive and take folic acid 5 mg at least three months before getting pregnant.Once pregnant follow up regularly with your doctor, most women after 2 miscarriages go on to have normal full term pregnancies.

So, baby needs close monitoring and special consideration after fetal lung maturation. Always consult with your doctor.Be well and take care."},{"Patient":"My girl friend has last period on 1st October. We have sexual relation.

It is very traumatic to loose your baby at such a late stage of pregnancy.If there is some defect in genetic or chromosome of the baby then there is a possibility that these defects show up in the later half of the pregnancy.The fact that this baby had so many multi organ defects implies that it must be having major structural problems leading to death in the womb itself.Up till 20-24 weeks the organs are forming and after that the increase in size, but if there is a major defect growth is hampered and baby will not survive.Do try to get the baby analysed for chromosome problems after birth and also get the doctor to document all defects in detail as it would be helpful in knowing if this could repeat again in next pregnancy or is a one time incident.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"My wife is being diagnosed with Obstetric cholestasis by our gynaecologist in Cape Town. She is 39 weeks pregnant, beginning 40th week tomorrow. My questions are: 1. is there any information you may be able to share re longitudinal research on the risks, there is so little research on OC on the web and we are trying to gauge the risk my wife is in (and so much would like a natural non induced birth). Obviously we wont rely on your research or in any way disseminate any info you may send us. 2. my wife's bile results are 19 (norm on our test was stated as 0 - 10) (her S-ALT score is 53 (norm range given as 10 - 32) and her S-AST is 40 (norm range 10 - 32). Is 19 a high risk bile acid level? Any views you may have would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks Charles","Doctor":"Hi there,,Obstetric cholestasis At term (40 weeks) with bile acids of 19 should be induced for delivery. There is no point waiting for labour to start, as every day more is a added risk for further rise in bile acid levels and may affect the baby.The problem of Obstetric cholestasis is it can cause sudden death in a full term baby as the bile salt can cause problem with the heart rhythm of the baby. And at 40 weeks the baby is fit to survive, so delivery should be induced immediately.The risk though less than 1 in 100 is still very important to make note as the baby is absolutely normal and has reached 40 weeks and to be affected by bile salts at this stage would be tragic.Also the risk of passing meconium during labour or in-utero is higher and also is the chance of operative delivery (caesarean or forceps) in women with Obstetric cholestasis.  The risk of bleeding after birth in mother is also slightly higher and kept in mind.Vitamin K oral should be given to mother after 36 weeks.The liver function tests should be repeated 10 days after delivery as it takes that much time to get back to normal.Also the risk of repeat obstetric cholestasis in next pregnancy is very common up to 90% and should be informed to the doctor early in next pregnancy.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi , I am 8 weeks pregnant .

What should be the next step .","Doctor":"Hi there,,Do not worry. If the last scan showed embryo with a good fetal heart, this decreases the chances of miscarriage drastically.Also, the discharge you are having is light brown not red or bright red, so it makes it more likely to be old clotted blood.A repeat scan is required only after 10 days of the last one, so do not worry. HCG values are of little help now and need not be repeated.So please continue Folic acid, Duphaston and see your doctor as scheduled.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello,my sister is 11 week pregnet, during 7 weeks she had an early scan,  Report is like this Gestational Sac Seen , Sac Margins appeared regular, yolk sac seen and measured 3 X3mm (mean = 3),cardiac activity present.She was on anti depress drugs from last 3 years, as soon as she missed her period , immediately on same day she stopped all medicines. is any chance of any abnormality ? dr suggested NT Scans in 13 weeks + first trimester screening + blood test pl reply ?","Doctor":"Hi there,,At 7 weeks scan every thing looks as expected.  And the doctor is right in suggesting a NT scan and blood tests at 13 weeks.Since she was on anti depressant medications for 3 years, it is not wise to discontinue them suddenly without any medical advise. She should consult her psychiatrist who will advise her if she can safely discontinue or not.Also other forms of therapy for depression like cognitive behavioral therapy should be offered to her. Pregnancy is a stressful time and her depression could get worse if she doesn't get appropriate medical help.Drugs could affect pregnancy and women who have taken anti depressants have a slightly 1% more chances of having babies with birth defects. These are easily checked by both NT scan and 20 week anomaly scan. So do not worry a lot about them.I would recommend her to take Folic Acid 5 mg at least till 12 weeks.Though its more important to take it before conception it is still advisable to continue it till 12 weeks.Depression is also more common post delivery and this should be kept in mind after delivery especially if she has baby blues and mood swings then.

She is about 6 weeks pregnant, I have been there since the day we found out she was pregnant. She has symptons such as excessive farting, cramps, is tired a lot her boobs hurt all the time and are getting bigger. She says that she is always hungy and craves vegtables, all the time. Also, she gets her fair share of morning sickness, and crazy dreams. She also trips over her words and forgets things, and her eye twiches. Now, I seem to be having some of these same symptoms, but because I am a girl, I am wondering if I am just having sympathy symptoms or is it a possiblitly that I am indeed pregnant. It is to early to take a pregnancy test, it is to early to test myself becuase I am not supposed to get my period for another week or so.

I normally have my period regularly and light for 2 days and hardly any symptoms. My period is 2 days late, extremely sore breasts, headaches and low stomach cramp. Am I experiencing PMS symptoms?

Even in pregnancy the progesterone hormone is on the rise and can cause similar symptoms too.The best way to tell if you are experiencing these due to pregnancy or PMS is by testing for Beta HCG which is the specific pregnancy hormone. Doing a home pregnancy test will detect it. And we can known the cause of your symptoms.The treatment of PMS, in case that this delayed period is due to PMS is to have a healthy diet and exercise and if the symptoms are too bothersome , medications such as SSRI( Fluoxetine, Paroxetine) in the second half of the cycle can be considered.If the urine pregnancy test comes positive contact a doctor for pregnancy care.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello im 21 years old I had my first pap smear done 4 weeks ago I am also pregnant yesterday that I went for my second prenatal appointment thwy told me it came back as abnormal but my doctor didn't explain me why and im so curious to know what's going on should I worry or take any precautions ?","Doctor":"Hi there,,PAP smear is done to assess the risk of cervical cancer in women. An abnormal PAP smear could mean a lot of things from mild infection, incomplete reporting to early stages of cancer.You need to ask the doctor to give you a detailed report. If it is infection or if the smear reads mild inflammation,or atypical cells of unknown significance, you could just ignore the result till after pregnancy, and you could repeat a PAP smear 3 months post delivery.But, if the report says CIN changes then your cervix needs to be evaluated further.One way would be HPV-DNA test.But, generally 1 in 6 PAP smears in women under the age of 25 years turn up as abnormal and on follow are described normal. So please do not worry much for the same.One more thing, pregnancy itself can make getting a smear and reading of the smear to be altered.

The fact that the ultrasound is normal and fetal heart rate is good implies that things are ok. Once the fetal heart beat appears there is very little chance of you having a miscarriage.I understand with your previous history of miscarriage you must be very anxious but the stress and anxiety can make matters worse for you.The bleeding should subside by around 12 weeks. The oral form Duphaston is easier to take and less cumbersome. Threatened miscarriage is common in early pregnancy and only supportive care with rest is advised. You could continue either of the progesterone, whichever you are more comfortable with.Get a repeat scan after 10 days to check for fetal well being.Do not worry.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi dr.

The usual antibiotic given is penicillin, but if your are allergies an alternative is given.It would be advisable to take antibiotic for the strep b infection now also, and you could consider taking it with an local antifungal cream for the thrush, especially if you have group B strep in your urine culture.Do remember to repeat strep b culture at 36 weeks and please inform your obstetrician that you have had this infection during this pregnancy, to make sure you get intrapartum antibiotics to prevent transmission of bacteria to your baby.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"my mom is having the signs of acute phycosis again.. she had the same problem an year ago & due to medications, she became normal again.. now all of a sudden since past 2 days she seems to have developed the signs of it again!so please suggest what should b done rite now","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concerns but I would recommend that you refer to her doctor for a prescription of antipsychotic medications to improve her condition.

Strip test may not be useful to detect the cause. better submit your urine for microscopic examination to the laboratory. Since your culture test is negative, the chances of crystals in the urine are high. After microscopic examination, you will realize which crystals are being passed and then accordingly, you will have to modify your diet. Whichever the crystal, please drink plenty of water. An Ayurvedic medicine named Cystone may prove to be useful in such problems. Any vaginal infective discharge also is responsible for burning urination when the terminal urine dribbles on the inflamed vaginal opening. Please report to your Gynaecologist if you are having any vaginal discharge.  Fungal infection (can be treated by antifungal medicines), Trichomonal infestation (can be treated by Metronidazole) or Bacterial infection (to be treated by antibiotics) are common infections of vagina. I hope this should give you relief.  Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am 38 weeks pregnant. I lost my plug at 35 weeks. I had a leep done 4 years ago and have scar tissue.

Am i still at risk of getting pregnant? 2) i have been having irregular periods for about 5-6 months now. what could be the cause/ 3)  i usually have boils around my private part before or during my periods...is it normal or what could be the cause?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Let me answer your queries one by one. 1. In fact there was no risk of pregnancy from the unprotected sex performed just 3 days after the period as it was far away from fertile period. The egg is formed 14 days prior to next period. It has life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about 8-10 days is considered as fertile period. Intercourse during this period has maximum chances of pregnancy. However, your menses being irregular, it is very difficult to locate the day of egg release. (May be you could be having problem in egg release also.) Still, considering your menstrual irregularity, you have taken a wise step in taking Postinor 2 after the unprotected intercourse. Postinor 2 is quite effective post coital emergency contraceptive pill if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. You have taken it after 10 hours. So you need not worry about pregnancy. You are well protected. 2. Your irregular menses need to be investigated thoroughly. There are many conditions that lead to menstrual irregularities. Some of them are Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Thyroid dysfunction, any other reproductory dysfunction, ....... it will fill your complete desk top if I start enumerating all of them. I can guide you on this issue thoroughly if you inform me your age, menstrual pattern,  age of menarche (first menstrual appearance), marital or sexual history. You can inform me all this by asking a Direct question. Else, you may report to the Gynaecologist. Irregular menses may result in infertility due to non-release of eggs. For the time being, you may try cyclical birth control pills for three months for regularization of menses as a preliminary step. 3. Boils around the private parts are usually due to infections; may be sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhoea, herpes genitalis, etc. You need to report to STI specialist for correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. You may need antibiotics treatment. Also you will have take care of genital hygiene and be demanding for clean sex only.  I am sure this has given you some direction on your reproductory health problems.

I have carefully gone through your query, and I think I have understood your concern. I will try to address your medical concerns and would suggest you the best of the available treatment options.With your history it appears that you were not on birth control pills and you had unprotected sex. It always involves risk of pregnancy.Usually  I suggest to take PLAN B or i pill within 24 to 72 hours of unprotected sex act. This usually helps to prevent pregnancy.Just starting contraceptive pill may not have pregnancy prevention effect as that of PLAN B pills.You need to take 5 low dose pills at a time - 2 times with interval of 12 hours,to equal the action of PLAN B. This leads to lot of stomach problems. and starting single pill daily will not be of use. In view of your irregular cycles, I will suggest you to get urine pregnancy test after 3 weeks of that sex act. Even if it is positive ,you can opt for termination with pill safely till 9 weeks of pregnancy.I hope my answer helps you.Thanks.Wish you great health.Dr Purushottam S Neurgaonkar"},{"Patient":"Hi doc ..i am 26 yrs ild n married since 5 months .. i was on tab cerazette for a month  and had on and off bleeding .. stopped the tab and took a scan which showed a small intramural fibroid of 1*1 cm .. other wise normal scan thickness ovary everything fine ..nw i don get bak my periods since 2 n half months .. 6 of pregnancy test showed negative .. nw i really willing for a baby .. tel me wat should i do to get bak my periods and be a mother  .. am mentally being upset about this ,.. kindly help me","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion your ultrasound report is normal but for small fibroid which also might not be the reason for your failure of pregnancy.Actually there is nothing to worry in your case as you are just married 6 months back and you can try for natural pregnancy for another 6 months.Because usually infertiliy treatment is started if pregnancy doesn't occur even after 1 year of unprotected intercourse.But meanwhile rule out the reasons for irregular periods like any thyroid abnormalities,overweight or obesity,anaemia,stress etc.Weight reduction in case of overweight or obesity helps in regularisation of periods.Avoid stress and anxiety as they cause hormonal imbalance and delay fertility further.If all the above causes are ruled out the delay can be attributed to stress induced hormonal imbalance.Adapt healthy lifestyle like exercise and healthy nutritional diet daily.I suggest you to consult gynaecologist regarding medicines for periods as the pregnancy test is negative.Regular intercourse increases the conception chances.Nothing to worry as such.Hope this helps.Best regards....."},{"Patient":"I am almost 7 weeks pregnant and have noticed I have been having small pieces of whitish colored tissue pass when I discharge as well as when I urinate.

If she does not want to continue this pregnancy, she can terminate it by medicines. Tab. Mifepristone followed after 24-48 hours by Tab. Misoprostol are medicines which can terminate the pregnancy safely and effectively up to 9 weeks of gestation. Usually within 24 hours (some times up to 7 days), the abortion takes place. It is advisable to have a follow up visit to Obstetrician after 7 days. However, these medicines are not 'over the counter' medicines. You should have Obstetrician's prescription to buy them. They should be taken by Obstetrician's advice only. These medicines cause developmental abnormalities in the bay. Therefore, if they fail, the decision should not be reverted to continuation of pregnancy. Then the pregnancy should be terminated by surgical methods like MVA or so.

When it is of substantial amount, we suspect risk to the life of the baby. However, the bleeding was trivial and after such bleeding, you have been examined in the hospital and sent home with assurance. So no need to worry about the baby. It is likely that the mouth of the uterus (cervix) has started preparing for the delivery by getting gradually merged into the uterine walls. This process known as effacement of the cervix causes dislodgement of the mucous plug in the cervical canal with some bleeding. When such blood stained mucous come out immediately, it is red in colour, however if it remains inside the vagina (due to very little amount or position) or cervix, the blood and thus the discharge becomes brown. However, 36 weeks is too early for starting labour process. So I would advise you to have complete rest in the house in a view to postpone the starting of labour pains as far as possible, at least for one week more. It would be good practice to monitor the well being of the baby by listening to heart sounds (if you can do that) and/or counting the movements of the baby by clock. In left side position lying, in two hours, 10 movements are perceivable. If you note foetal movements getting affected, please report to the Obstetrician ASAP. I hope this helps you.

I haven t had any symptoms of being pregnant other then nauceuos and headaches. ( sorry forgot how to spell it, in a rush). so by any chance could u help me?","Doctor":"Sure. Nausea is experienced in 50% of pregnant women. Headaches are not that common but still can occur. Vascular headaches are due to vasodilatation and increased circulating blood volume along with the increasing hormonal levels related to pregnancy."},{"Patient":"I think I am pregnant, I am not sure though.. could you help?My breasts constantly ache, I get back aches, I get a lack of breath sometimes, dizziness, fatigue (often) My breasts feel as if they have got heavier, my nipples have enlarged. I am on the contraceptive pill, however I have not been taking it correctly and therefore I am unsure whether my pregnancy chances could be high. Please get back to me asap. Many thanks.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Had you been taking birth control pills regularly, I would have written off the possibility of any pregnancy. However, since you are irregular in contraceptive pills, I cannot say that you would not be pregnant. The first cardinal symptom to appear is missing a period. Some how, I do not find any mention about your last/missing period in your history. All other symptoms appear about 8-10 days after missed period. The other cardinal symptoms of early pregnancy are:1. Nausea & vomiting with pica2. Frequent urination3. Breast symptoms and signs like engorgement & tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples & areola with areolar widening, Montgomery's tubercles  under areola and secretions through the nipples. However, if you have not missed period, these symptoms cannot be weighed much as they may appear due to some other causes also. Heaviness and tenderness of the breasts can be due to the oral contraceptive pills you are taking. Nipples enlargement also can be due to the pills or due to rough overhanding. Breathlessness, backache, fatigue & dizziness are not symptoms of early pregnancy. Irrespective of your pregnancy status, you should get investigated for these symptoms. Please get your haemoglobin tested and report to the Physician. If you have missed period, pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period will clarify your doubts. Done earlier, these tests may give false negative results. Alternatively you may opt for Beta hCG test which can give you reliable results even few days before missing period also. If you have not missed your period, please wait for your menses. If they appear, forget about pregnancy. If they do not appear, you may opt for pregnancy test(s) as suggested above. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I am 30 yr old male, single, i am facing Ed caused by Traumatic masturbating syndrome, now i stopped that and practicing normal way but still struggling to get harder erections while having sex. can i take viagra initially to get on track?","Doctor":"Hi, I suggest you not to take these tablets with out andrology check up.

Yolk sac is seen. No cardiac activity noted at present scan. Cervical length is normal and internal OS is closed. Both asnexae are clear. No e/o free fluid in cul-de-sac. Corpus Luteal cyst is noted in left ovry. Is everything normal with me???","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,When you saw some amount of bleeding after missing period, it is but natural for you to get stressed. However, ultrasonography after the incidence of spotting has not revealed any bleeding from the chorionic tissue and the other findings are normal.It is good no note that the gestational sac is well defined and round, meaning there by that the embryo is viable. Even the embryo of about six weeks also is noted. 5+ weeks of pregnancy may be rather early for depicting cardiac activity. You need not infer any conclusion at this stage. The scan report is optimistic. Please repeat the scan after about a week or more. After 6 weeks duration of pregnancy, usually foetal cardiac activity is noted. With the current scan report, I feel you would have cardiac activity noted in scan after one week.

Puregon 150 is an hormone which does cause ovulation induction and help in egg formation in women with PCOS but you also need to take other medications and lifestyle changes such as weight loss, exercise, metformin.I would also like to know your age and if your partners semen analysis is done or not. These are important as infertility has to be addressed carefully.If you have been trying for a year and all factors are normal then it would mean that you have unexplained infertility.

It is possible to terminate the pregnancy of this duration by medicines safely and effectively. Tab. Mifepristone followed after 24-48 hours by Tab. Misoprostol terminate the pregnancy effectively up to 9 weeks of gestation. Usually, the abortion starts within 24 hours, but may require up to 7 days also. However, these are not 'over the counter' medicines. You can buy them only by Obstetrician's prescription. 7 days after the last dose of Misoprostol, it is advisable to have a follow up visit to Obstetrician. These medicines are known to cause the developmental abnormalities in the baby. Therefore, if these medicines fail to terminate the pregnancy, the decision should not be reverted to continuation of pregnancy, but the pregnancy should be terminated by surgical technique like MVA or so.

However, healthy sperms should reach the ovum to fertilize it. Hence, if you are ovulating normally, please get few more investigations done to assess the remaining factors:1. Semen examination of your partner after 4 days abstinence. This will inform us about the quality and quantity of the sperms. 2. Tests for patency and normalcy of the genital tract. Laparoscopy with hysteroscopy will provide us this information. Without patency, the sperms may not reach the ovum. Depending up on these factors, you may require further management. If all these factors are within normal limits, then your case will fall under unexplained infertility where Artificial Reproductory Techniques like intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization with embryo transfer, ICSI, etc. may be useful.I would definitely like to help you further if you ask me Direct question with uploading all the advised and previous reports.

I am still waiting anxiously....Do you think I am alright sinCe the bleeding is gone now? Or should I still go to the ER?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Heavy bleeding with abdominal pain at 10 weeks of pregnancy  is not a good sign. There is a great risk that baby might have been jeopardized.  If you have not expelled out the baby during the bleeding you had, you should confirm its safety by ultrasonography. Usually, early pregnancy bleeding - diagnosed as threatened abortion is very difficult to salvage when associated with pain. Urine pregnancy test will not give any information about viability of the baby since it requires about a week or more for these tests to become negative after the baby has become non-viable. Please report to your Obstetrician or Emergency Room ASAP. If you cannot do that, please get ultrasonography done to find out the status of the baby. Till that restrict yourself to the bed. If the baby is non-viable, you may have to undergo termination of pregnancy without delay to prevent complications like infection, heavy bleeding due to clotting defects (DIC) or due to incomplete abortion, etc. Waiting anxiously at home is not going to help you, it may worsen the situation. I hope you got the message.  Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi, ahries right now ?

The hormones that seem to have the most to do with this process include the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), estrogen, and progesterone.

The first cardinal symptom of pregnancy to appear is missing period. Though you have not missed your period, your last two (?)periods were suspiciously scanty. The other cardinal symptoms of early pregnancy are nausea & vomiting with pica, frequent urination and breast symptoms which include engorgement & tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples & areola with areolar widening, Montgomery's tubercles under the areola and secretions from the nipples. You have many of these symptoms. Since your last two cycles are suspiciously scanty, pregnancy test on the first early morning urine will reveal the diagnosis.

Please guide.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,For normal pregnancy mothers, traveling between 14 weeks to 28 weeks of pregnancy can be permitted. However, you have low cervix which is some what shorter in length for which you are on some medications. I believe, these medicines are to quieten your uterus which might have been irritable. With this risk factor, travelling for more than 8 hours would be rather tedious. Though actual time in carriages is five and half hours, home to airport, boarding time, landing time, all these have to be considered. So total traveling time would be definitely around 8 hours or so. Air flight may be smooth; however, uphill road journey for three and half hours might be strenuous for your uterus. Please consult your Obstetrician. He/she have clinically examined you. If according to him/her, it is safe to travel, you may; however, from your history, I feel you should avoid travel, deliver in Mumbai and then go to the mother's place after delivery. Whenever there is any risk, we always advise to deliver at well equipped hospital. Then why should you travel from place like Mumbai to some other place?

as per your information all the above causes might have  been ruled out by physical examination and necessary investigations.Ultrasound helps to know the well being of fetus as it is normal you need not worry.Don't worry in some cases even though with the presence of bleeding everything will be normal and pregnancy continues till term and have good outcome.May be the bleeding might be from cervix.Anyways relax.Avoid physical stress and intercourse.Take prenatals and progesterone supplements.It might subside spontaneously.Take iron rich diet and iron supplements to combat anaemia caused

opinion there is no chance of pregnancy after regular period.The first sign of pregnancy is missed period.And other symptoms of pregnancy like nausea,vomitings, increased urination,sore breasts start 2 weeks after missed period.So the symptoms like sore breasts, abdominal cramps if present before the period it can be due to premenstrual symptoms but not due to pregnancy.Once you get the period the pregnancy is ruled out.So relax.Avoid stress.Hope this helps.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"I am married 11/2 years back.Now I am 23 now.i got my period on march 20 until now i didn t get my period and

then there might be no chance of pregnancy.You can even confirm it by doing a ultrasound or serum BHCG test.Usually the pregnancy symptoms like nausea, vomitings, increased urination,sore breasts start 2 weeks after missed period in case of pregnancy.As you don't have any symptoms and the pregnancy test is negative the chances of pregnancy are rare.But as a benefit of doubt you can confirm it by doing serum BHCG test or repeat urine pregnancy test.If the test is negative the missed period can be due to hormonal imbalance induced by stress or any.Nothing to worry as such.Avoid

my bum after i am really worried that something might be wrong with my baby is all this normal as it leaves me saw for the day afterwards","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the bleeding during passing motion suggests the bleeding is from rectum.It might be due to anal fissure or piles.It needs physical examination for accurate diagnosis.Passing hard stools or constipation will provoke fissure or piles.And constipation is a common complaint faced during pregnancy.But nothing to worry as it will subside with treatment.Take adequate fluids upto 3 litres per day,high fibre diet and laxatives to prevent constipation.Once the constipation is treated the bleeding subsides spontaneously.But kindly consult doctor to check for any piles.Topical ointment can be applied to decrease the pain.Also take iron rich diet and iron supplements to combat anaemia caused due to blood loss.Sometimes iron supplements also cause constipation so check if they are the culprit and in that case the preparation need to be changed.Relax.Avoid stress.Hope this helps.Best regards....."},{"Patient":"I'm 26 weeks pregnant and was in a car accident yesterday. I went to the er and they said everything was fine. I went to sleep and around 2am I woke up and vomitted. Now I can't stop throwing up, I cant even hold bread or water down. My stomach is sore from constantly vomiting. What do I do to make this stop? Im miserable.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,This vomiting does not seem to be related to pregnancy; it seems to be related to accident. Did you have any injury to your head? In that case you need to undergo MRI (X-ray of the skull would not be advisable during pregnancy). Sometimes, in certain injuries, delayed bleeding is noted inside the skull giving rise to uncontrollable vomiting. In such case, you would find rigidity in the neck and inequality in the pupils. Please report to ER or neurosurgeon again and explain about continuous uncontrollable vomiting. If you have any severe pain anywhere after the accident , that also can give rise to vomiting. Please do not ignore the matter and report to neurosurgeon ASAP.

Is it safe if after 2 days of sex, my gf takes a single tablet of unwanted 72? Would there be any chance of pregnancy or any other side effect? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the unwanted 72 comes under emergency contraception.The emergency contraception is used when the protection is failed like irregular intake of birth control pills or tear or slippage of condom etc.But it should not be used for regular usage.Unwanted 72 is high dose progesterone hormone.It causes hormonal imbalance.So if used regularly it might cause heavy bleeding.So restrict for emergency situations.Unwanted 72 is effective in 95% cases in preventing pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.Intercourse can be done without protection in case of safe period of menstrual cycle.Safe period is the one where there are no chances of pregnancy with unprotected intercourse.Safe period is said to be roughly around 1 week before and after the period and during the period.But this safe period method or natural method is applicable only in case of regular cycle.So kindly check for the safe period and if inevitable you can go for unwanted 72.Hope this helps.Best regards...."},{"Patient":"I was recently at my first sonogram saying i conceived on the 10th of july and my due date is april 2nd.

Last week she had  a blood test and found her TSH was 15.  Doctor prescribed to take thyronorm 75mcg daily.  Even though she is taking the tablets regularly, we are worrying much about the baby's growth, because in internet we read, TSH should be in level till 12th week of pregnancy.  Does anything harm will happen to my baby's growth?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Low thyroid hormone levels are common in women, so thyroid disease is not unusual to see in pregnant women. It is true that the mother provides most of the thyroid hormone for the baby until late pregnancy, and profoundly low levels can cause developmental problems in the baby. However, if the level is corrected with medication, there is no reason why you and your wife cannot have a healthy baby. So I recommend your wife to follow your doctor's advice and take the medication as prescribed. The level should be checked again in 3-4 weeks to see if the dosage needs to be changed. I want to reassure you that with propermedical care there is no reason your child should have any developmental problems. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.

Misoprostol 400 mcgm vaginally or sublingually every 3 hours up to 5 doses. Usually the termination takes place 8-10 hours. Since you have taken only 3 doses, you will have to repeat the dose for two more times. I hope you have taken appropriate dose of Misoprostol. If this medicine fails to terminate the pregnancy, the decision should not be reverted to continuation of pregnancy since this medicine can cause developmental abnormality in the baby. In such case, proper dosage of Misoprostol may be repeated by appropriate route of administration or the pregnancy should be terminated by surgical methods like Extra-amniotic Ethacredine lactate or Dilatation and Aspiration method.

You have to rule out the pregnancy first before you think of any other diagnosis. Some of your pregnancy tests are faint positive. It so happens when:1.The baby in no more viable 2.When the pregnancy is located somewhere outside the uterine cavity (ectopic pregnancy). Ectopic pregnancy is a very serious condition. It usually ruptures and then the bleeding is life threatening. So my advice is to go for ultrasonography. If the uterus is empty in spite of faint positive pregnancy test result, it should be investigated further for ectopic pregnancy, may be by laparoscopy. Ectopic pregnancy will need immediate intervention. If it is unruptured at the time of laparoscopy, it can be tackled laparoscopically also. If it is ruptured, it may required opening of the abdomen and lot of blood transfusion. If the uterine cavity shows baby, it is intrauterine pregnancy. If the baby's heart beats are seen, then the pregnancy is normal; if they are absent, then it is missed abortion  and needs termination of pregnancy ASAP. Delay in terminating missed abortion may lead to serious complications like severe bleeding due to clotting disorders (DIC), infection, kidney failure, etc. So without delay, please get your ultrasonography done to decide about the further line of action. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. Please help me my wife is pregnant for 8 weeks 5 days from december 25 as first day of mensural cycle . Baby is only grown 6 wk and 1 day size and there is no heart beat found in vaginal ultrasound. can u tell if there is any medication in ayurveda to bring the heart beat on for the baby. please call me at 0000","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Absence of heart beats at almost 9 weeks of pregnancy with the size of the baby only 6 weeks is suggesting that the foetus is non-viable. You may please repeat ultrasonography to confirm the diagnosis. No where in the world is there any medicine which can instill life again in a non-viable baby. So please be prepared for the situation and face it bravely. You will get normal baby next time. If non-viable baby is confirmed and still it does not get aborted naturally, it is missed abortion. Then she has to undergo termination of pregnancy. In fact the baby is appears to be non-viable for almost 3 weeks. So I would not advise you to waste more time in terminating the pregnancy lest the risk of complications like severe threatening bleeding due to clotting defects in the blood (DIC), infection, kidney failure, etc. Please proceed for the termination of pregnancy ASAP. Before the procedure, better you undergo certain examinations on your blood for assessing DIC:1. Bleeding Time & Clotting Time2. Platelet count3. Prothrombin time4. Fibrinogen Degradation ProductsEarlier you terminate the non-viable baby, better are the chances for next conception. Once any infection sets in, future conceptions may have problems.

Your menses are overdue for one week, you are having nauseating feeling and you are having a sensation of pressure on the bladder, which might be giving you sensation of frequent urination. The other breast symptoms may start appearing within next  few days to week. They will be engorgement & tenderness of breasts, dark discolouration of nipples & areola (if this is your first pregnancy) with widening of areola, Montgomery's tubercles under the areola and secretions from the nipples. However, pregnancy diagnosis is never confirmed only on subjective symptoms since they can be due to some other causes also. Hence I would suggest you to go for pregnancy test on urine. Overnight first morning urine sample is the best sample for pregnancy test as it contains concentrated hCG hormone. Since you have completed one week after missing your period, you should get reliable results from this test. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test which is very sensitive thought costly, and/or ultrasonography which will provide you direct visual evidence of pregnancy.

According to an ovulation calendar, I think this is the time I would be. I found my BC and started to take it again..Please help me!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Birth control by contraceptive pills is governed by the continuous action of the pills taken throughout the cycle. Hence regularity in the consumption of pills is prerequisite for their success. However, missing a single pill or so does not take away the protection against the pregnancy. Missing up to 3 pills in a cycle is permissible according to WHO guidelines. When you miss pills like this, the ovulation calendar gets disturbed and you cannot rely on fertility window.  Since you have missed three pills, there are good chances that you may conceive during this cycle. Wait for up to a weeks after finishing the pack of the pills if it is 21 pills pack, otherwise till you finish complete pack if it is 28 pills pack. By that time if you do not get menses, go for the tests for confirmation of pregnancy. Pregnancy test on urine is to be performed on overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period. Done earlier, these tests may give false negative results. Alternatively you may opt for Beta hCG test which gives reliable results even few days before missed period. If you are pregnant, you may opt for Medical Termination of Pregnancy which is very safe and effective up to 9 weeks of gestation. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I have been trying to conceive. I had intercourese before and on the date of my ovulation and fertile days.About 10 days later I started bleeding light then heavy.For about 4 days.It was 10 days after ovulation and two weeks early from my normal menstrual period.The questions are:could that be implantation bleeding? Could i be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I have gone through your history. I feel there is some confusion in calculating the days of ovulation and fertile period. Ovulation takes place 14 days prior to next expected menses. The egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence the fertile period is a period of one week around the days of ovulation. Since the ovulation takes place 14 days prior to next menstrual period, your bout of bleeding cannot be 10 days after ovulation and two weeks before expected date of period. This statement suggests that you are having some misunderstanding about ovulation day and fertile period. Whether it was an implantation bleeding or it was Mittelschmerz (ovulation bleeding) can be decided only on confirmation of the pregnancy. You may take pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period; done earlier these tests may give false negative results. Alternatively you may opt for Beta hCG test which is very sensitive and can give you reliable results even few days before missing period.  Since you had considerable bout of bleeding, I would advise you to go for ultrasonography after 10 days of missed period (in case pregnancy test is positive) to assess the safety of the baby. It will inform you whether the bout of bleeding has disturbed the pregnancy or not. This will resolve your dilemma. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I have missed 2 periods. I am irregular but I have never missed a period entirely. When I was supposed to have my period I have spotting and light cramping. My boyfriend and I use protection only right before he climaxes. Should I take a pregnancy test?","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion there are various causes for irregular periods:-1)Thyroid abnormalities.2)Polycystic ovarian disease(PCOD).3)Anaemia.4)Overweight or obesity.5)Stress.etc.So I suggest you to consult doctor and get the necessary investigations like ultrasound,thyroid profile done to rule out the above abnormalities.Weight reduction in case of overweight or obesity is most important and helps in regularisation of cycles.As you have spotting during the time of expected period and as you are sexually active definitely the pregnancy should be excluded.So I suggest you to consider doing a urine pregnancy test.At the same time cause of irregular periods should be evaluated.Nothing to worry.Hope this helps.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"hi mam, i am seven month pregnant, today in USB it was found that there is a cord seen in the neck of the baby, so i am worried about it. will it harm to my baby, any there any precaution to be taken, or any way so that baby any untighten the cord. please help me","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. 15 percent of completely normal, healthy babies are born with the umbilical cord around the neck without any complications. The persondelivering the baby can undo the loop or cut the cord at birth. I do suggest, however, that you deliver your baby in an institution that has constant monitoring of the baby's heart rate during labor. Certain heart rate patterns can be detected of there is cord compression, and then if there are any problems, they can be diagnosed early and dealt with in a safe way. So in summary, you really do not have to worry if the baby has a cord around the neck, but you should have the baby's heart rate monitored closely during labor. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.

If the values decline it implies that its due to the miscarriage.Typically in a normal pregnancy the HCG values double or increase in 48 hours, if it is a failed pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy the values may decrease or not increase as expected.Also HCG values take at least 3 weeks after an abortion to normalize. So if it more than 3 weeks after your miscarriage it is unlikely to be due to it.Very rarely a condition called molar pregnancy has to be kept in mind, in this the HCG values remain elevated inspite of no normal pregnancy. This is a serious condition and need to be ruled out in your case if its more than 3 weeks from the abortion and if you are not pregnant and if the HCG values are still elevated but not doubling. IF so then please see a gynaecologist immediately.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have pcod,and i am taking metformin 500 mg twice a day .i got married 2 yrs back.still i am not pregnant.i consult a dr,and follicular study was done.my follicular size is 17 mm on day 17 th.dr adviced me to take lupi HCG inj on day 17 th.is there  chance to get pregnant.","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the PCOD is one of the treatable causes of infertiliy.PCOD is routinely seen these days due to altered lifestyle and stress.Main problem in PCOD is absence of ovulation.So ovulation induction drugs like clomiphene,HCG injection are given.They are successful in ovulation induction most of the times.The follicle size of 17 mm on 17 th day is not so bad.The injection might help in inducing the ovulation.Nothing to worry even if the cycle failed because the success rate in first cycle of treatment is very rare.Iam sorry my aim is  not to disappoint  you but just trying to explain you the probability.So relax.Avoid stress.Weight reduction in case of overweight or obesity is first and most important in PCOD.Metformin is a good medicine which increases the chances of conception.Adapt healthy lifestyle like exercise and healthy nutritional diet.Laparoscopic ovarian drilling also increases conception chances in PCOD.Hope this helps.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"hello , i am 15 years old. my boyfriend and i had unprotected sex the day after my period ended, he didn t ejaculate at all because i made him stop when i realized there was no condom there which was about 5 minutes after we started.

Apart from the missed period, the other symptoms of pregnancy are:1. Nausea & vomiting with pica2. Frequent urination3. Breast symptoms: Engorgement & tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples & areola with areolar widening, Montgomery's tubercles under areola and secretions from the nipples. These all symptoms start appearing about 10 days after missed period. You are having a few of them. Dear madam, the pregnancy is never diagnosed only on symptoms in early stage as these symptoms can be due to some other underlying cause also. So please get your pregnancy test done on overnight first early morning urine sample. This will confirm your pregnancy. Moreover, brown bleeding during any stage of pregnancy is not a good sign and indicates risk to the baby. So please report to Emergency Room where you will be subjected to ultrasonography to assess the safety and health of the baby. You are probably underfeeding yourself because of nausea. Please force feed yourself to feel more energetic. Banana in cold milk is very good to overcome nausea. This nauseating feeling lasts for first three months. Then gradually you will feel better. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am 29 and I am pregnant after treatment. I had my last period on 11.03.10 & my egg got ruptured on 27.03.10. After 6 weeks I went for scanning & my doctor said that the fetus is very small (3.2) and without any heartbeat. They asked me to come for rescan after 10 days. Pls reply me Is this is normal and I ll get possitive result during my next scan. Pls help. Thankyou.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, It is indeed a sad incidence. Your scan report suggests that the baby inside your uterus is non-viable for some time. When such baby does not get expelled out naturally, we call it as missed abortion. Your doctor wants to confirm this diagnosis by a repeat scan after few days. If missed abortion, please do not delay the termination of pregnancy; otherwise there is risk of complications like heavy threatening bleeding due to clotting defects (DIC), infection, kidney failure, etc. Get the pregnancy terminated ASAP if the diagnosis of non-viable baby is confirmed. Before undergoing termination of pregnancy, you might have to undergo following investigations on blood to rule out possibility of DIC:1. Bleeding time & Clotting time2. Platelet count3. Prothrombin time4. Fibrinogen Degradation ProductsI do not want to dishearten you, however, the possibility of Missed abortion seems to be very high.

Basically nature has its own  mechanism. Usually after 40 weeks if pregnancy, labour process starts .Strong contractions of the muscles of the uterus push the baby out of mother's body through birth canal. So eventually baby comes out of mothers body. It can not remain in side or ddoesn't get dissolved or absorbed into mother's body. I hope this answer helps you.

Uterus is anteverted and gravid, yolk sac seen, Early fetal pole visualized, no cardiac activity. I am worried why no heart beat?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.There are two possibilities of what may be going on if you do not yet see a heartbeat with your pregnancy.The first, even though you are sure of your LMP, conception can take place at a different time in your cycle than you expected.  The egg can live inside you up to 72 hours after ovulation, and sperm can remain alive inside you for up to 5 days.  So you actually may have conceived a week later than you thought, which means that you are only 6 weeks pregnant.  It can be normal to not see a heartbeat at 6 weeks.The other possibility is that the fetus died already at 6 weeks, which is a miscarriage that has not come out yet.The way we can figure out what is going on is to check another ultrasound in a week or so.  If there is no heartbeat by 7 weeks, then the diagnosis of a miscarriage is correct.So I know it is hard to be patient, but there is nothing that can be done to prevent miscarriage.  One of every 10 pregnancies are miscarriages, meaning 90 percent of the time after a miscarriage women go on to have a healthy baby.I hope I was able to answer your quesion and that this information was helpful to you.Best wishes, and good luck with the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I got an injection of Methotrexate last Friday for ectopic pregnancy. Would there be any contraindication to starting my garcinia cambogia again? With all the address stress, cramps, and nausea I am eating like crazy and gaining weight. I was told not to work out for now until the Hgc levels have dissipated, but I have worked so hard to lose weight, the thought of gaining it back is making me even sicker..","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Garcinia Cambogia is a supplement, so it is not tested for interactions with other drugs like prescription medications are.  So there is no evidence that taking the supplement while on Methotrexate is harmful.I want to strongly caution you against exercise though, especially if it has been less than a week since you were diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies can still rupture after a methotrexate injection, so the straining of your abdomen during vigorous exercise could possible traumatize your swollen tube.  You can bleed heavily internally and could need emergency surgery if your tube ruptures, and  without prompt medical care some women even die from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.So your cravings from pregnancy should dissipate as you hormone levels fall, so hopefully you will feel less hungry over time.  In the meantime, you can take your supplement but please be very careful and do not do any heavy exercise until your levels have fallen.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"My friend is 31 weeks pregnant and has had fever and chills for 3 days.

If it is above 38 degrees Celsius (or 100.4 Farenheit) she should call her OB provider to see if she needs to go back to the hospital.If her fever is not elevated, she may just be cold, so lots of blankets, hot tea and warm clothing will make her feel better and it may just take time for her to get over this illness.Make sure she drinks lots of liquids and also pay attention to the movements of the baby.

You may need to re-evaluate your relationship if the baby's father pressures you into doing things that can harm you or the baby, but for now, there is nothing to worry about.

It is completely normal for some women to have an increased sexual drive during pregnancy, and any form of sexual activity that does not cause you physical pain or harm will not affect the baby. Certainly there is no medical evidence that the fetus has any conscious awareness of anything that is going on around you. So, while the baby may be able to hear at this age, there is no way for it to know what any words or sounds actually mean. So there is no harm that will come to the baby from watching a movie of any type. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was reassuring.

The fluttering you occasionally feel I nyor chest is called heart palpitations, which are occasional irregular heartbeats. They can be caused by pregnancy itself, but thyroid disease, anemia and other heart problems should also be ruled out. I recommend you tell your prenatal care provider about your symptoms, and they will likely refer you to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. If it is abnormal,you may need to see a cardiologist for an evaluation. The good news about this is that none of these problems have any affect on the baby, but it is important you have a medical evaluation of your symptoms to make sure your heart is healthy. I hope I was able to adequate answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.

I know that it is advised to avoid raw or undercooked meat during pregnancy, but if the steak you ate was from a reputable restaurant or butcher, the meat is unlikely to be contaminated with toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis is present mostly in vermin and birds, which is why cats frequent y are carriers. It is also endemic in parts of Europe, so imported meats sausages and cheese also should be avoided. Furthermore, catching toxoplasmosis is really only harmful during early pregnancy. So you really do not have to worry about accidentally eating a small amount of undercooked meat.

Am i pregnant? Today is the 25 day of the cycle and i have a 28 day cycle. Can you suggest me the best date when i can take a pregnancy test, if you think i could be pregnancy.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Since your menstrual cycle is of 28 days, you had menses on 26th January, the period between 9th and 14th February is a highly fertile period for you. The egg release (ovulation) happens 14 days prior to next expected period. The egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence your intercourse falls in the fertile period. It gives a good possibility of pregnancy. However, the first cardinal symptom of the pregnancy is missed period. You are yet to miss your period. All other cardinal symptoms; i.e. nausea & vomiting, frequent urination and breast symptoms like engorgement with tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples & areola with areolar widening, Montgomery's tubercles under areola and secretions from the nipples appear about 10-15 days after missed period. Home pregnancy test on urine should be performed on overnight first morning urine sample 8 days after missed period. Earlier, these tests may give false negative tests. You are yet to miss your period. So HPT done at this time may by misguiding. Wait for your period. If you miss the period, then perform this test after a week. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test. These are very sensitive and specific tests and give reliable results even few days before missing a period. I wish you all the best luck for your motherhood.

You need not worry so much and if you want to get he period right away, you should take progesterone tablets for three days and stop.

What you need to known is only a certain amount of iron can get absorbed each day and even if you take excess it will not be absorbed but can increase the side effects, like constipation and gastric upset. Also iron tablets are often difficult to take by some women. The number of months you need to take depends on your hemoglobin levels.Also calcium is advised after 20 weeks as that's the period when bone formation of the baby starts and this extra calcium is needed.Do remember not to take the iron and calcium together as they can interact with each other and decrease each others absorption.So do not be concern, take whichever iron preparation suits you best and take it at a different time from the calcium. The 100 mg iron should be more than adequate.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, My wife is carrying and child is 35w 4d old.

This will most definitely 99% of the time resolve by itself after delivery.It does not indicate anything significantly wrong with your baby.If the baby passes urine in the first 24 hours of life, that would indicate that the kidneys and renal systems are working fine.You could just get an ultrasound of the baby done at 3 months after birth to reassure  yourself.Do not be concerned.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"good day dr, today im in day day 8 of 3days embryo transfer. 11 days po. i got a positive pregnancy test , my beta is 21. i start having very light brown discharge with tiny black piece of blood. since an hour im feeling a very sharp pain in the uterus which is on and off but its still there. is that pain normal during early pregnancy or something to warry about.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,At 8+ weeks of pregnancy, light brown discharge with pain in uterus is not a good sign. Brown discharge at any stage of pregnancy indicates the risk to the life of baby - most of the times non-viable baby. Moreover, pain in uterus is due to the efforts of the uterus to expel such non-viable baby out of the uterus. Hence, such in condition with pain in uterus, it is almost not possible to save such pregnancy. To confirm the status of baby, best option is to undergo ultrasonography. It will reveal following important information:1. Whether heart activity of the baby is visualized; i.e. whether the baby is viable2. Where from the bleeding is coming - from the chorionic tissue attachment site or elsewhere. Pregnancy test of urine may not be conclusive since it requires about a week or more for the pregnancy test to become negative after the baby has become non-viable. If bleeding is from the base of the chorionic tissue, it indicates impending danger to the baby. If baby heart activity is seen with chorionic bleeding, then you will have to take strict bed rest. Injection hCG or Progesterone preparations with Folic acid may be prescribed to you. Progesterone or hCG help stabilizing the pregnancy while Folic acid will help the regeneration of the damaged tissue. However, if the baby's heart activity is not visualized, it means the baby is non-viable. This is known as missed abortion. Brown bleeding is always stale old bleeding. Hence the chances of missed abortion seem to be very high. If it is missed abortion and you do not abort naturally, you will have to undergo termination of pregnancy without delay lest the risk of alarming bleeding due to clotting disorders (DIC), infection, kidney failure, etc. So please report to your Gynaecologist ASAP for further action. I hope this gives you required message.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"gravid uterus showing intact g. sac with no fetal node Sac meas.

Meclozine is an antihistaminc agent which can control the vomiting of pregnancy. This is safe during pregnancy. However, being antihistaminic medicine, it can cause drowsiness; hence driving, working near stove, etc. should be avoided while under the effect of this medicine.

After that incidence, since August 2013, you are having on going sexual relations with your husband and no one else. So the father of the baby will be your husband only.

So unless you ejaculate in the vaginal opening or right next to it, there really is no chance for pregnancy.If you had sexual activity before her period became late, to be safe, i would have her perform a urine pregnancy test.In my career though (over 15 years) I have only seen one patient who got pregnant as a virgin.

The baby does normally urinate inside you when the baby is healthy.Prominent renal pelvis can indicate slow flow of the ureters to the bladder, or narrowing of the urethra (the tube that leads out of the bladder).  It can also be normal and can go away over time.So normally, if found at 19 weeks, you would be followed by ultrasound about every month to check the kidneys.  If the renal pelvises still look prominent when the baby is full term, the pediatrician will need to evaluate the baby after birth to make sure it can urinate properly.But again, most cases like this seen at the anatomy ultrasound go away by the end of pregnancy.Either way, the condition does not affect the pregnancy and delivery at all.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information is reassuring to you.

Few days earlier i slipped and fell down badly and it stroke my head and waist. Is this the reason of not having periods?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Having your period come late or skip occasionally is common in many women, even when they are not pregnant.Most of the time, a delayed period can just be a chance event, but it also can be cause by stress, changing time zones or traveling, recent weight gain or weight loss.  If that is the case, you usually will get it somewhere between 2 and 4 weeks late.A fall usually will not affect your menstrual cycle, unless the stress of your injury was a factor.Either way, there is nothing dangerous about missing your period once and a while. If you miss your period for more than 3 months, you should see a gynecologist so you can be evaluated for hormone imbalanced and the doctor can prescribe appropriate medication to help your period to come.If you are at risk for pregnancy (meaning if you had unprotected sex in the last three weeks), you should repeat the pregnancy test in a week or so just in case.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hi doc, this is my fourth month of pregnancy,and my thyroid level is much higher than normal.now i want to know what complications i could fac e in near future.is this also bad for the baby. what are the contolling measures for it. thanx","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Overactive thyroid is actually normal in some women during the first trimester of pregnancy, because the pregnancy hormone stimulates the thyroid and its levels are highest in the first trimester.  It is not dangerous unless your levels are very high and you have symptoms (like a racing pulse or heart palpitations). Severe overactive thyroid can lead to a condition called thyroid storm, which can cause heart failure and other complications; but again, this danger is only to the mother. Your OB provider should refer you to see a specialist if your levels are so high that you may need medication.When the baby is born, it is important for the baby's pediatrician to know about your thyroid history, as sometimes the baby's hormone level can be too low after birth because it has received so much thyroid hormone from you while it was inside.I want to reassure you that treating your thyroid hormone level really depends on how high it is, and many patients do not even need medication.  Discussion with your prenatal care provider should help in determining if you need medication. You may need to see an endocrinologist who can prescribe medication to lower your levels of thyroid hormone if they are at a dangerous level.  I hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was reassuring to you.

This mixture will not help you terminate the pregnancy. Otherwise it will not cause any harm to the baby. For termination of pregnancy by medicines up to 9 weeks of gestation, Tab. Mifepristone followed after 24 - 48 hours by Tab. Misoprostol is the correct method. These medicines are not 'over the counter' medicines. They need to procured by Obstetrician's prescription and should be taken in precise dosage with Obstetrician's advice. It is advisable to have a follow up visit to the Obstetrician 7 days after the last dose is consumed. These medicines have a very good success rate. However, if the fail, the decision of termination should not be reverted to continuation of pregnancy since these medicines cause developmental abnormalities in baby. Please report to your Obstetrician for termination of pregnancy by scientific way. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"My wife had a NT of 3.9mm at 12w4d. There was a nasal bone present. My wife is 46years old. We used donors eggs from a 22 year old. We are waiting for blood work and are very scared. She is pregnant with twins. The NT on the other baby was 1.6mm. We are looking for some comforting news. Has anyone had a 3.9mm NT and ended up with a healthy baby? If she miscarries on one will she lose the other baby? It is hard to always stay strong for my wife. I pray constantly.","Doctor":"Hi there,,Please do not worry.The NT(Nuchal Translucency ) value is only a suggestion that something may be not fine. It doesn't say that for certain. It is just a screening test, not a definitive diagnosis.The main concern when the NT is >3 is if it could be a Down's baby, but since the eggs used were of a 22 year old women, it implies that the risk of Down's by age is less than in 1000; and even if the NT measure is more it increases the risk of Down's only slightly. It would have been a greater concern if your wife's eggs were used as that would make the risk of Down to be 1 in 40 and a positive NT would further increase the chance.If the blood tests also indicate a risk then we need to do a definitive test like amniocentesis, where a bit of fluid around the baby is taken for analysis to check for Down's, and other chromosomal(gene) anomalies. But this would be slightly more complicated as you are carrying twins.It is definitely possible that both babies are normal and you will go on to have normal kids, we just need to be sure that with the blood tests, but do keep in mind to inform the laboratory that you are carrying twins and they will correlate it with the ultrasound findings to give a clear indication if further testing by amniocentesis is required or not.Be strong and do not worry.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"HI Doc, today is Nov 13, my period is 15 days late I took a few pregnancy test from the time my period was to be finish all was neg.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options options. 1 ) First  of all do not panic. 2 )  For any woman to get pregnant, 3 things need to be in normal limits. A ) Semen analysis and spern count and good motility sperms.Please get your partner's semen analysis done  with at least 4 days gap of sex activity. B )  PLEASE get tubal patency test like HSG done. This is X ray test to be done within first ten days of your period C )  To determine about structural normalcy of your uterus and tubes and ovaries,  USG will be of help. Also from day ten of the cycle you can do a  USG  test to know the day of ovulation called as follicle study. You can have sexual activity on at least alternate days between day 10 to 20 of the cycle, this is the most fertile period of cycle. Or ovulation study can tell you day of egg formation and you can have Intra uterine insemination or sex activity on that day. I will suggest you to take B 12  and Folic acid supplements at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant.  This  helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy.  I hope this answer helps you.

There is little chance of pregnancy if your partner did not ejaculate inside you or near the opening of the vagina. In addition, the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed period.So if your menses are delayed longer than a week, you may perform a urine pregnancy test. It will be accurate by three to four weeks after your sexual encounter. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.

I went ahead and did the next round of chlomid starting day 3 of that period. I should be ovulting today, but instead found out that I am pregnant.

This has been shown to have affects that could cause abnormalities in a fetus. Furthermore, animal studies suggest that taking Clomid while pregnant can cause birth defects. However, if you only took it for 5 days, there may have been little effect. You should promptly see an obstetrician who can refer you for an ultrasound to check the fetus and discuss the risks and benefits of continuing the pregnancy.

(However, they may be irregular considering your PCOS). Hence, due to unprotected sex on that day, there should have been high risk of pregnancy otherwise. However, within one hour after the intercourse you have taken Ipill which is very effective post coital contraceptive pill. So you need not worry about the possibilities of pregnancy.Ipill contains high amount of Levonorgestrel which is a Progestational medicines. Therefore, after Ipill, there is possibility of the periods getting delayed by few days. You need not be worried about  delayed periods. You have been given Regesterone pill to be taken upto 26th February. After discontinuing these pills, you should get menses within 4-7 days.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. In a woman with regular cycles day 10 to 20 of the cycle is the most fertile period of cycle. If you are sexualy active, in this period, try to have sex at least on alternate days during this period. Irregular cycles suggest that you are not ovulating regularly in the fertile period.  I will suggest you to get FSH, LH, AMH  test done on day 2 of the cycle. With the prescription from your doctor start ovulation induction medicines and follicle study from day ten of the cycle.  At follicle size of 18 mm injection HCG  5000 I will help in ovulation.  Try to have sex or go for IUI at the time of ovulation. Usually ovulation after starting of 26 mm of the follicle, has shown poor pregnancy rates.

Please correct me if I am wrong. Any vaginal bleeding at any stage of pregnancy is a warning sign of some risk to the pregnancy. Since you have not mentioned any thing about pain in her abdomen, I presume she is not having any pain in abdomen. Painless, causeless recurrent vaginal bleeding during this stage of pregnancy is a classic feature of placenta being situated in the lower part of the uterus near cervix. This is known as placenta praevia. This is very serious condition and needs hospitalization of the pregnant woman. In this condition, any time alarming bleeding may start which requires emergency surgical intervention. However, this bleeding is usually fresh bright red bleeding. Dark bleeding is blood about to clot. It becomes brownish when it is stale blood. Both these are suggesting risk to babies life. Is her baby moving? I would advise you to get her ultrasonography done to find out:1. Where from this bleeding is coming.2. Where is the placenta situated.3. Whether the baby is viable or not.Dear Madam, bleeding during the pregnancy cannot and should not be managed at home lest the risk to the life of mother and/or baby. Please take her to the emergency room and get her admitted in the hospital. Obstetrician will decide about the further line of treatment after:1. Considering her general condition2. Considering the reports of ultrasonography3. Any other relevant factorI hope this conveys you clear instructions and you act accordingly.

I have been feeling quite queezy and faint at times with a possible fever but this comes and goes. The breast itself does occassionally ache but there is no obvious areas of reddening.

The substance you see coming from your nipple is called colostrum and is the milk that your baby will drink the first hours after birth. At 3-10 days this substance transition to mature milk. So don't squeeze it. It is not something bad. The bumps you see around your areola are called the Montgomery's Gland and their function is to lubricate your areola and also have anti-infection properties. So do't squeeze them too.

Here's the thing, I was only on the pill for 7 days and for 7 of those days I was taking Amoxicillin, and forgot my pill on the 8th day. My period was due 6 days before I had sex. I am a day late and had spotting of a redish/brown color today. It has stopped completly now. Could I be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,There are few issues in your query which need clarification to you. Let me explain one by one.1. If you miss just one pill during whole cycle of birth control pills, the effect of the pills remains and they do not fail. So the chances of pregnancy are almost nil due to missing of one pill.2. On 6th day of the menstrual cycle, there is no egg present for the fertilization. The egg is released (ovulation) 14 days  prior to next expected menses. The egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is the fertile period. Unprotected sexual intercourse in the fertile period is most likely to result in pregnancy. Your intercourse was far away from fertile period. 3. There only one method by which you can reliably detect pregnancy just one day after missing period; and that is Beta hCG test. This test can diagnose pregnancy even few days before missing period. The other home pregnancy tests which are performed on urine are reliable 8-10 days after missed period. Earlier, they may give false negative results. 4. If you had diarrhoea after Amoxycycline (which is a common side effect of this antibiotics), there is a chance that pills could have got expelled before complete absorption and then the pills may fail to offer protection from the pregnancy. I hope this helps you.

I just had the following question: I have been on the pill (Yaz) since late march. I take it everyday at the same time. For about the last month, I ve been having frequent unprotected sex. Halfway through the month however, I decided to skip over some of the white pills for my period and just moved on to a new pack. Now, I m sometimes having a brown discharge on my underwear and its light pink when I wipe. However, I ve been feeling nausea on and off for the last 2-3 weeks. What do you think is wrong?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If you were consuming Yaz pills regularly, you need not be worried about the unprotected intercourses you had since these pills are reliable birth control pills. If after the menses you have shifted from one brand to another brand of the pills, it is permissible and will give you protection form pregnancy. You have not mentioned which brand you have shifted to; hence I cannot know what are contents and the dosages of the contents in these pills. Some brownish to pinkish discharge you are having on yours panties is break through bleeding. If such bleeding becomes bothersome, you may take two pills on that day to stop the bleeding. Otherwise you may ignore it. Nauseating feeling you are having is due to increased acidity due to the hormones in the pills. Some proton pump inhibitor antacid like Pantoprazole will help you to get relief from nausea. I do not think, you need worry about it. If the new brand of pills is not suiting you, you may switch back to Yaz again after this menses. However, if you have any doubt about pregnancy, you may get pregnancy test done on the overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period (if at all you miss). Earlier these tests may give false negative results. Alternatively you may opt for Beta hCG test which is very sensitive and gives you reliable results even few days before missing a period.

First,  there is increase in the formation of substance called melanin, that imparts dark colour to skin.Secondly,  in many women, during pregnancy there is increase in the insulin resistance which leads to patchy black discolouration. I will suggest you to opt a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Include more portion of fruits, salads and vegetables in daily diet. Drink plenty of water. Avoid deep fried foods, bakery products and refined sugars.  Restrict intake of cereals and pulses to two times a day. Keep watch on your sugar levels. 75 gram glucose test will be of help.

Then I vomited and had diarrhea the rest of the night. I have felt normal the past week. Its now saturday and I have had protected sex but a couple hours later my stomach feels weird like I am bloated. Plus my period is two weeks late and its unpredictable at times. Should I be worried that i m pregnant because I haven t any other symptoms. Plus I have felt fine. - Sunny","Doctor":"Dear Sunny,Since you are in childbearing age group, you had sex twice and your periods are over due for 2 weeks, you have to consider the possibility of pregnancy and try to diagnose pregnancy status. However, your menses are irregular, so you have to keep the fingers crossed till you get the confirmation of diagnosis. However, since your sex was protected sex, hence the chances of pregnancy are minimal. Still better to get clarified and confirmed. Pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample gives best results 8-10 days after missed period. Your periods are delayed by 2 weeks. So this test should give reliable results about your pregnancy status. However, due to irregularities in your menstrual cycle, it cannot be relied up on if it is negative. The best option for you should be Beta hCG test. This test gives reliable results even few days before missed period. I feel you should go for it. If you are not pregnant, you may take tab. Deviry for 5 days and within 4-7 days, you should get withdrawal bleeding.However, considering your nausea and vomiting, the question is whether you can retain these pills in the stomach. Therefore, please report to your doctor to control this gastrointestinal problem before you take Deviry. Even if you are pregnant, nausea can be attributed to it as morning sickness, not diarrhoea for which you have to take some treatment. If you can tolerate oral fluids, oral rehydration solution after each motion should help you. Still if it is not controlled within 24-48 hours, you should report to the physician. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi my name is nia and i m 10 weeks pregnant i went to my obgyn and they did an ultrasound and they said that the baby had a good heartbeat and at my next doctor visit they will hear the heart beat well the problem is that since i smokes ciggarettes could anything go wrong ?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Smoking - whether active or passive  - is definitely harmful to the mother as well as baby in utero. Nicotine in tobacco causes detrimental effects on the blood vessels. Hence rise in mother's blood pressure and placental starving due to constriction of the blood vessels are common effects of tobacco. This placental effect leads to intrauterine growth retardation of the baby. In addition to high blood pressure, there are many effects on the mother's health like hyperacidity, confusion, sleeplessness, risk of cancer, etc. Tobacco in any form is harmful - smoking, chewing, snuffing or applying to gums and teeth (mishri). So avoid tobacco use completely, and also avoid passive smoking also totally. I hope this gives you message.

The only natural way for the sperms to reach egg are through vagina -->uterus --> Tubes --> egg. There is no access to the egg or reproductory system of woman through gastrointestinal tract. Hence even if man ejaculates in the mouth of woman, and/or even if she swallows the semen, there is no risk of pregnancy whatsoever.

Any bleeding during any stage of pregnancy is considered as a risk signal unless and until proved otherwise. Your urine and blood tests have proved beyond doubt that you are pregnant. Now because there is bleeding, I would advise you to go for ultrasonography which will provide you information about:1. Whether the baby is viable or not. It takes abut a week or more for the pregnancy test to get negative even after the baby has become non-viable. Ultrasonography can give you reliable visual evidence. 2. The site from where the bleeding is coming. If it is from behind the chorionic tissue, you may have to restrict yourself to the bed and support the pregnancy by Progesterone. Folic acid may hep you. Any way, start Folic acid tablets to safeguard your pregnancy and baby. I hope this helps you.

Delayed positive test could be due to exceptional additional delayed ovulation from the other ovary. In such confusion, I would advise you to take the help of ultrasonography. Ultrasonographic ovulation monitoring has an edge over the kit:1. It gives visual evidence of ovulation.2. It informs us about the size of the follicle when it ruptured to release egg. Follicles between 18 mm to 21 mm size give best results of pregnancy. 3. It informs about the endometrial thickness also. For successful implantation, at least 10 mm thick endometrium is lucrative.

Is it curable by medicine or surgery is the only remedy.","Doctor":"Hi there,,Dermoid cysts are benign cyst and not cancerous, but you need to remove them, as you have 2 but also because their size is quite large.The main concern with dermoids is they may twist causing their blood supply to be hampered which can cause further pain and ovarian problems.Also the diagnosis of dermoid which at present is made on ultrasound needs to be confirmed by the pathologist, this could be something else other than dermoid as well, and only histopathology after surgical removal of cyst can confirm it.I am afraid surgery is the only option medicines will not increase or decrease their size. Surgery can be open or laparoscopic, its best that you have a discussion about the same with your gynaecologist.Hope this helps.regards."},{"Patient":"I'm married since 9 yrs.

On the scan they could see a sac and foetal pole but no heart beat it measured 8mm is there any chance that the baby could still be ok and have a heartbeat soon or have I been sent home to have a miscarriage please help not got my next scan for another week.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I empathize your feelings and stress about the situation. If at 9 weeks gestational period, the size of embryo is barely 7 weeks and if the heart beats are absent, this scan strongly suggests missed abortion. Even if the dates are mistaken, still foetal heart should be present by this time. You may repeat scan after few days. If still there are no heart beats visible, this is a case of missed abortion. When the baby in the uterus is non-viable and still abortion has not taken place, we call it as missed abortion. Missed abortion should be terminated at the earliest lest the risk of complications like clotting disorders (DIC), infection, kidney failure, etc.. Please report to the obstetrician to confirm the diagnosis and go for termination of pregnancy if missed abortion is confirmed. Before termination of pregnancy, you may have to get blood tested for Bleeding time, Clotting time, Platelet count, Prothrombin time and Fibrinogen Degradation Products to screen for DIC. Please do not delay termination if it is indicated. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am six weeks pregnant. In 2002 I had Grave s disease treated with radioactive iodine. I had a healthy pregnancy and birth in 2003-2004. As soon as I conceived then, my tsh went right up to 6 or 7 and my meds had to be adjusted. I had a miscarriage in December of 09 and then my tsh and free t4 were normal. My tsh and free t4 are now currently normal at 6 weeks as well - tsh 3.05 and free t4 21. I was just wondering if tsh automatically rises with pregnancy and should I be concerned this pregnancy isn t going to work out either?","Doctor":"Hi there,,I understand your concern, but TSH values being normal is a positive finding not to cause you more anxiety. TSH values do rise in normal and in persons who have had hyperthyroidism treated before. The radioactive iodine destroys the thyroid gland and thyroid supplements are required through out when TSH levels go high, more so in pregnancy.You have linked your first pregnancy with high TSH to normalcy and thinking that your second pregnancy where you miscarried due to Low TSH,     but that is not so. 1 in 5 of all pregnancies miscarry even in women without any medical condition so we cannot attribute the lost pregnancy to thyroid.You need to make sure that the TSH levels stay normal in this pregnancy and that you get this checked three monthly atleast.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi,I had a protected sex on 23 june 2015 with two girls, i dont know the quality of condoms due to darkness in room.After a week i had diareah and burning in feets and hands.I went to physician and he given me medicine and i got relief.after fre days i had pain in my feet joints and knees.Igot tested fot hiv on 20th august (58 days) by tridot test result came negative.I again tested by tridot method on 13 sep 2015 (82 days) result came negative.Now i fill mild fever and dry cough.is this test is reliable,Iam taking eptoin 100 and fruisum 5 for past 10 years.Kindly advise Iam very scared and in depression now.","Doctor":"Hi, Have you checked your condom ruptured or not after intercourse?

I have a bicornuate uterus and am pregnant in the left horn. The right horn has alot of endometrial thickening. HCG was normal for date, fetal size was on track, heart rate was 184. What could this thickening on the opposite side indicate?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,During the pregnancy, endometrium not only thickens but even undergoes functional changes which are known as secretory changes. These changes are due to increased levels of hormones Oestrogen (which grows the endometrium) and Progesterone (which makes it secrete). These hormones are secreted in the blood and hence they act all over the body. Thus they are acting even on the endometrium present in the other (right) horn of the uterus even though there is no pregnancy in that horn. You need not be concerned about it so long as your left horn in which pregnancy is implanted grows well to accommodate and nourish the baby. This can be monitored by ultrasonography. I hope this satisfies you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"My last period was in the end of January, I have been having cramping like my cycle is going to start, but nothing. I feel these cramps at least once a week, usually once every couple days. I have also had diarrhea, heart burn, fatigue and mood swings, not sure if this is related or not. I took 3 home pregnancy tests, within about a 4 day timeframe in mid-March, all negative. I am sexually active and the only birth control method being used is the withdraw method. Do you think I am pregnant or is something else wrong?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Let me inform you at the outset that withdrawal technique is one of the most unreliable method of birth control. Pre-ejaculation secretions are deposited in the vagina unknowingly, and they do contain sperms which are capable of fertilizing egg. Therefore, in future, please use reliable contraceptive methods like condom (male or female), intrauterine device or pills. From you history it seems that you have missed your period. Though the other symptoms are not specific of pregnancy, missed period is sufficiently strong evidence to suspect pregnancy. Pregnancy test on the urine is reliable if performed on the overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period. Earlier, these tests may give false negative results. So you may repeat the test after one week to be sure about the results. You have another alternative. You can opt for Beta hCG test. This is very sensitive test and gives reliable results even few days before missing a period. So, you can get it done right a way. If you are not pregnant, you may take Tab. Deviry for 5 days after which you should get withdrawal bleeding  within 4-7 days. If you are pregnant, and if it is unwanted pregnancy, you may terminate it by simple medicines. Meanwhile you may report to your physician for your diarrhoea problem. Please maintain your hydration with Electral like oral rehydration solution. Heart burn and fatigue may be related to diarrhoea and will be relieved once your diarrhoea is under control. Mood swings can be attributed to the stress of uncertainty of pregnancy diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, mood swings also will settle down.Please, hence forward, adapt reliable contraceptive method. I hope this helps you.

I have ALWAYS had periods like clockwork - 29-30 days but this months I spotted on cycle day 27.  I never have early periods and never spot.  I did have unprotected sex with my husband around ovulation - cycle day 13-14 by bbt charting.   The spotting was a small spot of mucus with pink and brown streaks and it happened again later that evening.  I was bleeding heavier the next morning but I noticed it looked pinker than usual and it didn't last the entire day.  I usually have a medium/light flow on the first day that turns into a very heavy flow by that evening or the next morning.  I have noticed brown/pink tissue when wiping yesterday and today and one small tissue clot came out when I urinated yesterday,CD 31.

I had BFN on CD 29,30,31, 32. Could I be pregnant?  THANKS!","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the same symptoms (including a temperature jump) occur with PMS as well as pregnancy, and the most common sign of pregnancy is actually a missed period.  Urine pregnancy tests purchased over the counter are just as accurate as a doctors' office, so if you have already have had multiple negative tests, you are definitely not pregnant.Your menstrual cycle may be irregular this month for a number of reasons- the most common one being the stress of trying to become (or avoid) pregnancy.  So if you are trying to conceive, I recommend just having regular unprotected intercourse (at least 2-3 days/week) without BBT charting, actually because your body temperature only goes up AFTER you ovulate, so if you wait for your temperature to go up, you can miss your fertile time.  Furthermore, if your cycle is longer than average, your ovulation actually occurs later, more around day 16-17.So I would wait a bit longer and see if you develop a full menstrual flow.  Once you do, the bloating and other symptoms should go away.  If you continue to have irregular cycles, you may want to see a local physician for a hormonal evaluation.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best regards, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

The glucophage will help control glucose intolerance and may helps prevent diabetes in pregnancy, which is more likely in women with PCOS.Also since you have a family history of diabetes this should make you check for diabetes at 24 weeks of pregnancy and if detected diet, and insulin may be required.Do not get stressed, eat healthy food and go for regular checks to the gynaecologist.

I would like to know if there is a chance that my wife will become pregnant (which we both do not want at this point in time) after we made out without direct contact of our genitals but with minimal clothes on... I don t even know if I have put forth my question right... Regards, Karthik","Doctor":"Dear Karthik,If your sex play was with clothes on and no penetration of vagina by penis; in short, no possibility of deposition of either semen nor preseminal secretions (which do contain some sperms) in or around vagina, there is no possibility of pregnancy. Moreover, if the whole incidence has taken place beyond the fertile period, you should not be worried about pregnancy. Now let me explain you fertile period. Egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected period. Considering egg's life of 24 hours and sperm activity for 72 hours, a period of about one week around the day of egg release is considered as fertile period. Dear Karthik, if you are sure that you want to differ pregnancy for some period of time, I would suggest you to adapt some reliable method of birth control instead of going through such stressful situation which is not good for your neither for your wife's health. Condom, birth control pills or intrauterine device like CuT are good simple contraceptive methods. You may opt for any one or more of them.

So the chances of pregnancy due to this accident are very low. Morning after pill contains hormones - Progesterone or Progesterone+Oestrogen, which are known to delay periods by few days. Also due to the effect of Progesterone, breast tenderness and nausea may bother. You have got following options:1. Wait for menses to appear for a week after missed period. Mostly they will appear.2. If they do not appear, perform pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample 8 days after missed period. Earlier, these tests may give false negative results.3. Straight a way opt for Beta hCG test which gives reliable results even few days before missing a period. If you are not pregnant and still the periods do not appear, you may take Tab. Deviry for 5 days. 4-7 days later, you should get withdrawal bleeding. If you are not pregnant, nausea and breast tenderness will subside subsequently within few days to weeks. I hope this helps you.

Both these conditions require continuous monitoring and treatment, which is why they are asking you to go back to the hospital for further evaluation.Repeated blood tests and ultrasound are required to known the location and normalcy of the pregnancy.If it is a threatened abortion, there is a high chance of the pregnancy continuing normally, but the first 12 weeks will be difficult.In case of ectopic pregnancy either medical or surgical treatment is definitely required.If your wife is having dizziness then it should not be ignored and you need to see the doctor as advised.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"On Janurary 8th i had un protected sex.

I took it even though I was worried I may already be pregnant. I started bleeding today. Is it still possible i can already be pregnant or does that mean I am not pregnant and plan b is just doing its job??","Doctor":"Hi.Plan b is not recommend for pregnant women because it changes the purpose of its use completely. Plan B is an emergency contraceptive pill that is used to prevent conception, but cannot and should not be used to terminate pregnancy. I would first recommend a visit to your doctor to get an ultrasound examination conducted to check on the status of your pregnancy, because if at all you are pregnant then you need to address that and/or nurture it and avoid using any/all medications unless your doctor decides you need it.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"i think i could be pregnant i have changed from the injection to the pill and i got told that i could get pregnant in that week , the next day me and partner had sex and the condom split, i have had signs of pregnancy like sore nipples even around my nipple have darkened , they have also fatened out they havent gone up a size but they have become move wider and heaviler, i came off my pill after 21 days for my break , i came on 6 /7 days after i had stopped takinging it which is not normal for me its usually about 2 days after. i came on with really bad cramps and slighty heavy bleeding, i still had pregnancy signs. i came off after 4 days which is unusual my cycle usually lasts 7 days are 8, my signs have got worse and i find myself having to sit down and for water and fresh air as i have been going really dizzy and going really sick and it does on and off through the days . i also keep getting strong headakes which i rearly get, i have taken for test 2 before the period and 2 after and all negative , im getting more bloated and going for my tollet breaks depending on the day, i dunno if its in my head are what but i have worked out id be 7-8 weeks pregnant if i am help ??","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Even 2 months after the missed period if your pregnancy tests are negative, I would have otherwise written off the case as 'no pregnancy'. Soreness of the breasts can happen due to many other causes which includes rough handling also. All other symptoms like headache, bloating, fatigue are not pertinent to pregnancy. However, darkening of the nipples and areola with areolar widening makes me consider that you may be pregnant. You have two alternatives for diagnosing the condition:1. Go for Beta hCG test. This is very specific and sensitive test which gives reliable results even few days before missed period. 2. Get ultrasonography done. By this time, it will give direct visual evidence of pregnancy. Moreover, if you are not pregnant, it will help to look for any evidence of Polycystic Ovaries (PCOS). PCOS is known to delay menstrual cycle for considerable time. When the periods start, they are usually very heavy. If you are diagnosed non-pregnant, please undergo investigations for finding out the underlying condition. Blood examination for Prolactin, FSH & LH would be important. Since you are having headache, Prolactin values will be important. If they are raised, they lead to breast secretions. Then X-ray of the head will try to see whether you have got pituitary tumour. Usually this can be treated with Tab. Bromocryptine. Get Thyroid function also assessed. Thyroid dysfunction does alter the regularity of the menses. The symptoms like lethargy, fatigue, etc. may be attributed to low Thyroid functioning. Please have a consideration of your body-mass index. In PCOS as well as Hypothyroid condition, BMI is raised. Try to maintain it betwee, 18.5 to 24.9. I would request you not to depend only on urine pregnancy test and undergo more investigations. Please report to you Gynaecologist.

I welcome you to HCM VIRTUAL CLINIC. I have gone through your question, and I think I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. Bacterial vaginosis is purely  vaginal infection and it is restricted to vagina only. Amniocentesis is done under USG guidance from abdominal side. So there is no vaginal connection.

Well about week or so ago I noticed my upper thigh by my pelvic area felt a little bruised. I didn t think much of it so I let it be. Well today I decided to actually look at it and I have a knot in this area. It s not read or hot or anything it just feels like a big knot and it hurts when I touch it. What is this? And could this hurt the baby?","Doctor":"Dear Haley,Your history and the description of the lesion suggest that you have caught infection at the bruising site which has caused involvement and infection of the lymph nodes that are situated in the groin (Inguinal lymph nodes). You will require an antibiotics treatment. With appropriate antibiotics the infection will be controlled and the gland will subside. If you delay the treatment, it may progress to abscess formation which requires incision and drainage in addition to the antibiotics. Please report to your Obstetrician ASAP. During pregnancy (even otherwise also), infection should never be overlooked, ignored and neglected lest the serious complications. I hope this helps you.

Due to the contractions of the abdominal muscles, you are getting the tightness and soreness in the abdomen. This should not cause any problem to your baby. I would request you to be rather gentle during masturbation. Instead of stimulating whole vulva and perineum, if you concentrate and restrict only to clitoral and labia minora stimulation, you may be successful in limiting vigorous movements of the whole body, particularly abdomen during masturbation. I would advise you to avoid pillow or stuffed animal as a toy for masturbation since their cleanliness cannot be guaranteed. You should not take any chance of introducing any infection in and around vagina. It may prove to be risky for your pregnancy. A clean washed hand or fingers can serve the purpose. Please do not use any latex rubber (condom or gloves are made of it) since its touch to the urinary opening (which is just below the clitoris) causes inflammation of urinary passage. I hope this helps you. The take home message is 'Be gentle; be clean'. Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"I m 33 weeks pregnant and up until a few weeks ago my resting heart rate was in the 70 range. Now it s regularly 110-115. I m also having swelling in my left leg and it s achey from the thigh down. I see my OB today, but I was just wondering.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Swelling during pregnancy can be due to following common conditions:1. High blood pressure (may be essential or pregnancy induced) 2. Urinary infection: The swelling is usually found on the face first, more in the morning. May be associated with burning urination3. Anemia: Pallor is noticeable. Usually and unfortunately it is misinterpreted as fairness in the complexion due to pregnancy. 4. Hypoproteinaemia: Low proteins usually go with anaemia or liver failure. 5. Liver failure, Jaundice, etc. 6. Heart Failure7. No pathological cause. Please get your blood examined from the laboratory to rule out any of the above mentioned conditions. Since you have a history of the irregular pulse varying from 70/min to 115/min, the cause of oedema is more likely to be related to heart functioning. It is good that you have taken an appointment with Obstetrician. With his/her advice, you may plan to visit a Cardiologist also. Please consume high protein, moderate carbohydrate and low fat diet. Take daily iron, folic acid and calcium tablets. Have close monitoring on haemoglobin percentage since this even complicates the other conditions responsible for oedema. I hope this helps you.

It is called as Mittelschmerz. This is very little spotting for few hours. So after the spotting is over, there is no harm in having intercourse.Bleeding on day 6 of the cycle cannot be Mittelschmerz. It is just an extended menstrual bleeding. During menstrual bleeding, intercourse carries risk of infection since blood is a very good medium for the growth of pathogens. On this day intercourse is futile also since there is no egg present on this day. The fertile period is not around day 6 of the cycle. The egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. The egg has life of 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about a week around the day of egg release (ovulation) is considered as fertile period. Those who are keen to have pregnancy should concentrate on this period for sexual relations. You are following further with bbt also to identify the day of ovulation. Now you have more accurate methods available for locating the day of ovulation. Ovulation kits available in the market are good for practical purpose. Ultrasonography ovulation monitoring is a very good method. From day 9 of the cycle, daily ultrasonography informs about the development of follicle & endometrium and the event of egg release also. Follicles which ovulate when they are between 18 mm to 21 mm size have best results of conception and continuation of pregnancy. For successful implantation of fertilized ovum, endometrium of 10 mm or more thickness is lucrative. Considering the life of egg and sperms, you can definitely avoid the intercourse during Mittelschmerz since it is a short phase of the day; and still have successful intercourse during or around the ovulation. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, I have completed one and half year after my marriage, still i have not conceived.

Alo my urine analysis show blood(++) and pus cells 25-30... doc me scared really please tell me wat to do will my urine infection affect my baby...","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the presence of pus cells and blood suggests urinary tract infection(UTI).UTI is most common infection seen in pregnancy.This is due to influence of hormones.Nothing to worry as it will subside with a course of antibiotics.You can as well go for urine culture and sensitivity to know the organism causing UTI and for accurate treatment.So relax.The untreated UTI might irritate the uterus leading to pain and other complications.But if treated it's not going to cause any problem.Take adequate fluids upto 3 litres per day,cranberry juice to prevent UTI.Your blood parameters are also normal as slight variation might be there in pregnancy compared to normal state .Hope this helps.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"Hi I am a 19 year old female. I live with my fiance and we are sexually active. The sex is unprotected. I recently (about a week ago) had my period and seemed normal, but even before I had my period, I was constipated, and lately i m tired very tired, my lower back is sore, and I am having pains in my stomach, on both right and left sides, and some in the middle, I feel bloated, almost like I am going to start my period again, I do have some headaches but not nothing serious. I have not taken a pregnancy test. So I am just wondering if you think it is worth taking one or not. Thank you! LeAndra","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion as you got the periods there is no chance of pregnancy.The first sign of pregnancy is missed period.Once you get the periods the pregnancy is ruled out.Usually urine pregnancy test is done a week after missed period for accurate results.So as you got the period the test is not required.Incase if you had unprotected intercourse done after the periods then there is risk of pregnancy.Then you need to wait and check for the next period.In case if it is delayed the urine pregnancy test can be done.The pain abdomen,bloating,low back ache might be due to constipation.So take adequate fluids and laxatives to prevent constipation.Nothing to worry.Avoid stress.Hope this helps.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"hello i have a question, i missed my depo shot which was due on may the 13th. My breast are extemely sore, I have not had my peroid, but i have taken i pregnancy test a few days ago which was negative. What is the possibility that i may be preganat?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If you have missed the due dose of Depo Progesterone, there is a risk (though low) of pregnancy due to unprotected intercourse. When you are on Progesterone, sore breasts need not suggest the probability of pregnancy as the Progesterone itself causes  breast soreness. Pregnancy test performed too early is known to give false negative results. This test should be performed 8-10 days after missing a period. The test performed on overnight  first morning urine sample gives best results as the hormone in such sample are concentrated. So please repeat the test after a week. Alternatively you may opt for Beta hCG test which gives reliable results even few days before missing a period. About 8-10 days after missed period, ultrasonography gives you direct visual evidence of the pregnancy status. I hope this helps you to resolve the dilemma.

I knew about my pregnancy on 3/12/15 through pregnancy kit. After that I visited gynecologist same day. She checked and inform that everything is fine. Next day morning I spotted slightly, I inform Dr. And she started inj. HCG 5000 iu & tab. Hald Sr. Twice a week. My question is that overall my health is fine. Then why she started injection? Is it safe? Any side effects of this injection?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Let me solve your queries one by one.After confirmation of pregnancy, if some vaginal spotting or bleeding has taken place, it is denoting that the pregnancy is unstable. In fact performing ultrasonography at this stage would inform you following information:1. Whether the baby is still viable and 2. What is the cause of this spotting. If the baby is viable, then in order to stabilize the pregnancy, we give either Progesterone or Inj. hCG.  During pregnancy Progesterone is produced by chorionic tissue initially and then by placenta. Progesterone hormone is required to stabilize the pregnancy. Inj. hCG will strengthen chorionic tissue and thus will help stabilizing the pregnancy. So, your doctor has prescribed you Inj. hCG not for your general health but it is for the supplementation to the chorionic tissue. I hope this clarifies the confusion and doubts in your mind. If you feel you have got some very relevant and important information, you may please cast a \\"Helpful\\" vote to this information.

Usually, the ovulation occurs 14 days prior to the next expected menses. Now, since you cannot predict the day of your next menses, you cannot calculate the day of ovulation by this formula. However, you need not be  disheartened by this. There are few more tools at your disposal which can help you locating the day of ovulation. 1. Ovulation monitoring kit: By using this kit, you can identify the day of ovulation.2. Ultrasonography: This gives you direct visual evidence of ovulation. It also shows you thickness of the uterine lining (endometrium). Endometrial thickness of minimum 10 mm is conducive for implantation of fertilize ovum (blastocyst). The follicle which ruptures at around its size between 18-21 mm gives best results of fertilization and continuation of pregnancy. These tests should be taken from day 9 of the menstrual cycle. Once you know the the day of ovulation and the size of the follicle, you may plan your intercourse on and around the ovulation. However, if these tests reveal that there is no ovulation, you will have to report to the Gynaecologist and get the treatment for induction of ovulation. I hope this gives you required guidance.

It may be a whole in the heart and baby may have to undergo a surgery after birth.

I have carefully gone through your query, and I think I have understood your concern. I will try to address your medical concerns and would suggest you the best of the available treatment options.Please do not panic.If there is hole in between upper 2 chambers of the heart then that is physiological  and it closes soon after birth. If it persists , it is called as ASD - atrial septal defect.If the hole is between lower 2 chambers of the heart, it is called as VSD- ventricular septal defect. If it is smaller than 10 mm usually cardiologist prefer to observe.But for larger holes intervention is needed. Now a days , it can be done by angiography, in very rare cases surgery is required.i will suggest to keep follow up, also get 2 D echo of the baby after birth.And treat under expert cardiologist.I hope my answer helps you.Thanks.Wish you great health.Dr Purushottam S Neurgaonkar"},{"Patient":"ok i am 18 years old i had sex on june the 1st i do not have pregoo symptoms but i took an hpt on the 2nd to be on the safe side and got a negative but here is the thing i usally come on my period on the 12th but monday i started having this really bad cramps i mean horrible like someone is stabing me but it is only on my left side and i had a lil spotting and it was kinda brownish and this morning i woke up and is is fresh red blood and it has clotts in it","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Doing pregnancy test on urine on 2nd June after having sex on 1st June was too early for detection of pregnancy. These tests give reliable tests when the conception is 3 weeks or more old; i.e. about 8-10 days after missed period. So you should have done it after 21st June.  You were expecting your period on 12th. It means your egg release was due on 30th May. Egg has life of 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. In short, your intercourse was on very fertile day. So it is most likely that you were pregnant. It is likely that severe abdominal pain followed by brown bleeding and then subsequently heavy bleeding is due to the abortion process. If the clots you passed contained some white 'clots' also, it means they are products of conception. The best option for you is to undergo ultrasonography. This will reveal whether you have any products of conception still left in the uterine cavity or whether the cavity is empty. If some products are still in the cavity (incomplete abortion), you may have to undergo surgical evacuation of the uterus. If there is any evidence of blood in the pelvic cavity, you have to keep the possibility of the pregnancy outside the uterine cavity (ectopic Pregnancy) in mind. This is a very serious bleeding emergency and calls for immediate medical help with blood transfusion. So please report to your Gynaecologist for appropriate diagnosis and management if required. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 27 yrs old. 4 yrs back I got married. we do nt have kids we are planning for a baby.LAst month I took my 1st IUI treatment. 5th June when I had my beta hcg test I got +Ve result & count is 85.8, docotr suggested me to take another Beta HCG test on 10th JUne I had that test in thta test my count reduced to 8 really I am very upset. I don t know why it happend with in a week time. Are there any reasons for happening like this. I am planning to take my 2nd round for IUI. Pls help me wht diet do I have to follow & what care do I have to take before and after IUI treatment and pls tell me why my count got decreased from 85 to 8.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,It is a good option to undergo another Beta hCG test again after a week. Drop in hCG levels from 85 to 8 is not a good omen. It is likely that the baby is non-viable and hence the hCG levels have started dropping. If next hCG test also shows further drop, the diagnosis of non-viable baby is strengthened. Ultrasonography would further confirm this diagnosis. Such pregnancies usually get aborted by themselves. With such decreasing levels of hCG, your Gynaecologist will advice you the same. Anyway, do not loose your heart. You are young enough and future trials with IUI will give you success. I hope this helps you.

Safe and protected sex will prevent unwanted pregnancy and STDs.I hope my answer helps you.Thanks.Wish you good health.With regardsDr Purushottam Neurgaonkar"},{"Patient":"good morning,i am 25years old and i got married 6months before. On June beginning i came to know that i am pregnant but two weeks before i had to do key hole surgery because they found out that i had tubular pregnancy. But today i noticed,white fluid. Am i having any problem,should consult doctor for this,as i am asked not to conceive baby after 3months.","Doctor":"Thank you for your querysome amount of white fluid is normal after a pregnancy . However, if it in copious amounts, foul smelling, with any itching , burning or pain, it is better to get your OBGYN to see you to rule out vaginosis bacterial or fungal) .After the surgery, have you been advised or using any contraception to avoid pregnancy for 3 months.This is important as any level of pregnancy even an ectopic one depletes nutrient stores in your body. having surgery exacerbates this. you need to give your body time to recover and replenish these stores in order to support the proper development of you baby when you get pregnant next time.I hope this helps. please get back to us if you need further clarification wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Here is what I am going thru. I took a home pregnancy test 4 days in the early morning and it was a clear as day positive. I then went to the health department around 3 pm and had another test done and it came back negative. The nurse said it was bc my urine was VERY diluted and that if I got a positive early that morning then I am pregnant. She then told me to go to the hospital and get a blood test done and I did that. Well to my surprise it also came back negative. I talked to the chemist who processed my test and he said to trust the HPT I took that morning bc it is nearly imposible to get a false positive on those. And he said my body is probably not producing a lot of the hormone. He also said he had a woman who came in every month to get a blood test and her test did not show positive until she was 7 months. I also read online that a woman did not have a positive blood test until she was 6 months and it showed that she was 6 weeks. I feel as if I am pregnant.. I have been have symptoms for about 2-3 months and my last normal period was sometime in june... July I bled for 3 days and in August I bled for 2 days and spotted for 2 days... So my question is... What is the likely hood that the blood test was wrong.. And should I trust the HPT bc I thought blood test were typicallly more accurate!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I believe the blood test you got performed was Beta hCG test. This is very sensitive and specific test which can give reliable results even few days before missed period. This is most reliable test. It is very unlikely that this test will give false negative results unless there is human error in performing the test. Since you had performed HPT on overnight first morning urine sample, you got it positive and later samples reported negative as early morning first urine contains higher concentration of hCG hormones. I would advise you to perform one more pregnancy test at home on overnight early morning first urine sample. If that reports positive, you should consider yourself pregnant. For reliable confirmation, ultrasonography performed 8-10 days after missed period will provide you direct visual evidence of pregnancy. If your HPT is positive (or weak positive) and ultrasonography informs that the uterus is empty, you have to consider the possibility of pregnancy elsewhere outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). This is a very serious condition which may land in bleeding emergencies. Hence, in that case please report to your Obstetrician ASAP. I hope this clarifies the issue. Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"I am 12 weeks pregnant.I am with my parents now.My husband stays with me twice a week and those times i have the urge to make him masturbate me by just rubbing the clit.Will masturbation affect my baby.My first scan reports are normal and gyn dint ask me to stop sex..","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Masturbation by just clitoral tickling will not at all harm the baby in your womb.  However, I would like to give you some more scientific advise regarding sexual relations during pregnancy. It is safe to have sexual intercourse between 14 weeks to 28 weeks of   pregnancy if there is no specific contraindication. Later, physical contacts become quite bothersome and also the uterus is more irritable. During intercourse in the mid trimester, full insertion of penis into the vagina should be avoided. Partial insertion of penis in the vagina also gives good orgasm at the clitoris. Intercourse in side position prevents full insertion of penis. I hope this helps you.

I also have severe cramps in my lower abdomen. I do not have health insurance so I have yet to be seen in ER or by a doctor.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Heavy vaginal bleeding with colicky pains in the lower abdomen is not a good sign. It is suggesting Threatened abortion which cannot be reverted. Please get your ultrasonography performed which will reveal the cause of bleeding as well as the stage of abortion. If the baby is still viable, attempts may be done by giving you Progesterone preparations to arrest the progress of abortion. However, whenever there is lower abdomen pain in Threated abortion, usually we cannot stop abortion. Please inspect your tampons. If white tissue is observed, it is the tissue of the baby and then pregnancy has aborted incompletely which needs completion.

As we don't know about the pregnancy I had chest X-ray during very early stage of pregnancy. Let me share the sequences wise details with you which were happened with me. 1.      My period date is 4th March 2.      Me & my husband stopped planning from 12th March because we need baby 3.      From 18th march I had fever & go to hospital for treatment. Doctor suggest for blood test , so we go for it and its detected typhoid. Doctor has given some anti-typhoid medicine. After 2 day again I had fever, so doctor suggested that I should be admit in hospital for 2-3 day for monitoring the fever. 4.      I was admitted on 1st of april, since last 15-20 day I had chest pain and told to doctor about the pain, he suggested we should go for chest X-ray for further medicine treatment. We told doctor about our planning so he said before X-ray we go for UPT. So we did it, but its negative. So on 2nd april in morning I  had chest x-Ray. 5.      I discharged from hospital from 3rd of april,but from 4th of april I had strong stomach pain due to medicine, as I don't suit the allopathic medicine. I had problem during latrine even I couldn't  sit properly. 6.      I was waiting for my period, So on 6th april morning, we fixed the appointment with gynecologist. Again we go for UPT but its negative. 7.      After 2-3 day I feel relax but worried about the period, so we go for UPT at home on 12th april evening and this time we get the positive result. 8.      So early in the morning we fixed the appointment with the gynecologist. Share each and everything with her. Had sonography. She said nothing to worry everything will be fine because x-ray was done in very early stage of pregnancy i.e. at the time of fertilization. Doctor has stated the treatment. 9.      I was discussed the matter with 2-3 doctor and pathologist, they also said nothing to worry. But I want to know your expert opinion in this regards. Is there any problem of my unborn baby, on its health etc plz help me out","Doctor":"Thank you for trusting us with your query.I'll try to explain with numbers so that you can understand about the various magnitudes.Strength of radiation of Imaging studies like X- Ray, CTS are measure in RADS.usually an exposure of 10 rads will cause harm.1 RAD= 1000 milli radsChest X-Ray is approximately 60 milli rads.As you see, It is highly unlikely that your baby will be affected. What's more is that having a. X-ray even before you know you are pregnant has lesser risk.Relax and be assured that your baby is fine. In the future, X-rays should be avoided but if your doctor d coded you absolutely need them,  it is better to get it done with adequate precautions no to minimise the risk to your baby.Hope I've reassured you and if you further queries let us know.Congratulations.wish you both the best of health."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, My wife is 12 weeks pregnant.

The main vaccines needed for immigration in Africa are yellow fever and typhoid. There are no studies of the use of the typhoid vaccine in pregnancy,  but that doesn't mean that it is harmful.

There are types of antimalarials that are safe to use when you are pregnant.I suggest you see a doctor who specializes in travel medicine or infectious diseases.

The absolute measurements of the femur length, abdominal circumference are used to calculate the approximate weight of the baby. That weight is then compared to the average weight of all fetuses at the same gestational age and expressed as a percentile. If your baby's measurement is not less than the 10th percentile, further survaillance is not necessary.However after 20 weeks your prenatal care provider will measure the size of her belly from visit to visit and if it does not increase over time they are likely to repeat the ultrasound.

The fact that,you had taken emergency contraceptive.. morningafter pill 36 hours of unprotected sex.. assures you of no conception. For morning after pill can prevent pregnancy when taken 72 hours of sex.    At the same time, you had oral contraceptive 5 days before sex.. that might postpone ovulation .. thus avoiding pregnancy.    Taking oral contraceptive from 5th day of menses regularly at a fixed time in a day , regularly for 20 days itself is sufficient for contraception.

I am still feeling the same problems i had before my period. i am a diabetic and i do know some of these symptoms can be cause by that. i still would like to know if i could be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Engorgement of the breasts, widening of the areola and nausea are definitely suggesting the possibility of pregnancy. Though breast engorgement can take place if you out on weight, the areola will not widen without pregnancy. The other battery of symptoms you have mentioned are not pertaining to pregnancy. However, you got your menses, though scantier in amount. Your urine pregnancy test also was negative. This rules out the possibility of pregnancy. Urine pregnancy test done within first week of missed period can give false negative test. I would advise you to get Beta hCG test done which gives reliable test even before missing a period. Else ultrasonography done about 10 days after missed period gives direct visual evidence. Since you did not miss period, but had scanty period, consider that as missed period for the sake of planning these tests for confirmation of pregnancy status. I am more concerned and impressed with the widening of areola; hence do not want to right off the possibility of pregnancy without confirmation. I hope this helps you.

I am 21 weeks pregnant and have been bleeding from my anus most times i go to the toilet for a poo. the poos are hard and hurts abit (stings) today i noticed i had a clot in the blood. it only happenes sometimes when i go to the loo not always.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, During pregnancy, due to the effect of raised progesterone hormone, the blood vessels along with other involuntary muscles get relaxed. The same changes take place in the rectal blood vessels also resulting into haemorrhoids (piles). Whenever these haemorrhoids are disturbed, some vessels break resulting in rectal bleeding through anus. It seems from your history that you have engorged inflamed haemorrhoids in the rectum. Moreover, you have hard stools. The stools could be hard because of slow movement off the residual food in the intestines due to relaxing effect of the progesterone on the intestinal muscles or could be due to amoebic infection. To overcome the problem of bleeding through anus, you have to take care of:1. Hard stools: Initially have some osmotic purge to soften the stools. Though liquid paraffin is a good stools softener, particularly in such  condition, I would not advise that as a medicine of choice as it dissolves the fat soluble vitamins like Vit. A, D, E causing their deficiency. Isub gul, saline purge, Dulcolax would be better to start with. Also include in your diet good amount of fresh fruits, particularly orange, banana, Figs, etc.. Green leafy vegetables always help softening the stools. 2. If the hard stools are due to amoebiasis, you may have to take anti-amoebic treatment with the help of your Obstetrician. Some anti-amoebic medicines are harmful to the growing bay in the uterus. 3. To handle the inflammation of haemorrhoids, you may apply local ointment like Practosedyl. Even though it comes with an applicator, I would not advise you to use the applicator as it may hurt the haemorrhoids causing bleeding. Finger application is preferred as in addition it facilitates the thorough application of the ointment to the piles. Before application, please clip your nails short and flush. 4. Usually, pregnancy piles can be managed with such treatment; however in occasional cases, if they start bleeding too much rendering the mother anaemic and they cannot be controlled, surgery may be required to ligate the bleeding haemorrhoids, particularly if they are prolapsed outside the anus. Please report to your Obstetrician for timely appropriate treatment. I hope this serves your purpose.Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"I took a pregnancy test at my doctors office and it cam back negative; however, she still thinks I am pregnant, because i have been having headaches, nausea, and cannot be around certain smells.

I still get that nauseas feeling but it doesnt last long, and teh headaches have been rare. I have to scheduled blood test on Thursday. CAn I still be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If pregnancy tests on the urine are done too early, they may give false negative results. These tests are reliable about 8-10 days after missed period. If you have done this test before this period, it may be negative even in the presence of early pregnancy. However, you have got your menses also. So negative pregnancy test with appearance of menstruation is in the favour of 'no pregnancy'. However, if there is some doubt in somebody's mind, you have following options to the confirm the diagnosis:1. Beta hCG test is a very specific and sensitive test. This test gives reliable results even few days before missing period.  2. Ultrasonography gives direct visual evidence about the status of pregnancy. However, it might be difficult to visualise the embryonic sac before 8-10 days after missed period. You may opt for either of these tests to confirm the diagnosis about your pregnancy status. I hope this helps you.

I am sexually active and cerazette is the only form of contraception i use so i m wondering what the chances are of falling pregnant? Also, if the chances are quite high, when is a good time to take a pregnancy test? Because i dont have periods anymore i dont know when i would normally ovulate or normally get a period. Any help or advice would be great! Thanks much!","Doctor":"HiDr. Purushottam welcomes you to HCM virtual clinic!Thanks for consulting at my virtual clinic. I have carefully gone through your case, and I think I have understood your concern. I will try to address your medical concerns and would suggest you the best of the available treatment options.As you rightly said with POP, you do not get periods.If you have missed the pills occasionally there are chances of getting pregnancy.I will suggest to get morning's first sample of urine tested for pregnancy, after 14 to 16 days of your last sexual activity. That will be the most late chance of you be pregnant.If the test is negative then do not worry. Please continue taking Cerazette regularly.Even if you are pregnant, you can opt for termination with medicines safely till 9 weeks of pregnancy.I hope my answer helps you.Thanks.Wish you great health.Dr Purushottam"},{"Patient":"I am feeling pain/pressure just above/down to my right testes.

It is lekely that your diabetes which was in latent phase so far has become overt now. Pregnancy is a diabetogenic condition. Therefore, please report to your Obstetrician and get your blood sugar investigated. If diabetes is detected, it needs to be controlled by either Insulin or by oral medicines. Diabetes leads  to many complications in pregnancy which includes high blood pressure, anaemia, urinary infections, foetal anomalies, diabetes to baby, oversized baby, etc. You will have to keep a watch on this. Diabetes itself with or without high blood pressure. and anaemia can cause all the symptoms you have described. Get your blood pressure and blood for haemoglobon checked. Accordingly, you may require treatment. If you are not taking iron-folic acid tablets, please start them. Consume high protein diet. Diarrhoea with stomach pain can be due to amoebic dysentery or worms. Stools examination will clinch the diagnosis. Amoebiasis can be treated with Metronidazole or Secnidazole. If worms are found, you will have to take deworming medicines with Obstetrician's advice as some of them can affect the baby.Most urgent step should be to get investigated for Diabetes.I hope this helps you.

I am not getting put to sleep the dentist is just giving me regular anesthesia I want to know will the anesthesia harm the baby???","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Any dental issue should not be ignored during pregnancy, particularly infections to avoid further complications. However you seem to have impacted wisdom tooth which needs extraction. Most of the time, this procedure needs to be performed under general anaesthesia. Usually, dental exteactions are considered to be comparatively safer during mid trimester; i.e. between 14 weeks to 28 weeks of pregnancy as during this period, the pregnancy is more stable and the uterus is less irritable. Now you are in the 5th month of pregnancy; i.e. in the second trimester. So if the wisdom tooth needs extraction, this is the most suitable time for its extraction. I hope this helps you to take decision.Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"hi, my name is elizabeth im 18 years old and i've always had irregular periods..

Ever since i got off of it i've been bloated hungry, and very sleepy...my boobs don't hurt but my stomache is noticeably different.  Could i be pregnant? and answers help! i appreciate your time, thanks:)","Doctor":"Hallow Elizabeth,If you are having your menses very irregular, after two weeks or so, the chances of your pregnancy are much less, since such irregularity is more likely to be associated without egg release. Moreover, from your history it appears that you had intercourse within few days after menses. At this phase of menstrual cycle, egg is not available for fertilisation. Moreover, you have taken plan B pill within 72 hours of both the condom failure incidences. You have covered yourself to protect from pregnancy. Still, you may undergo pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample after three weeks more if you do not get your periods by that time. I would advise you to consult your Gynaecologist for your menstrual irregularities. Such abnormalities in menstruation can be corrected with simpler treatments if treated early. At this age, it is likely at you could be having Thyroid problem or other hormonal imbalances. Your Gynaecologist will suggest you the appropriate investigations to clinch the diagnosis. Accordingly you will have to be under treatment.I hope this not only answers your query, but gives you some more important advice.Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"We had sex and the condom broke but I pulled or before I came but we still ended up getting plan b 38 hours after the sex.

The egg is released 30 days. The egg is released 14 days prior to next expected menses which in this case would be on 23 Sept. Egg has life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about one week around the day of egg release (ovulation) is considered as fertile period; which in this case would be from 19 Sept to 27 Sept. Even considering your due date as 14 June, the date of ovulation would be 21Sept. so by any calculation, the intercourse on 8 October would be most unlikely to cause pregnancy. You had many intercourses with person A during the period between 19 to 27 Sept.

The last few days I have noticed an increase in fetal movements lasting sometimes 45- 60 mins and only short resting times inbetween. The movements are very strong and sometimes hurt. I am under consultant care due to problems with my last pregnancy, placental abruption (minor), increased liquor volume, breech and post partum heamorrhage due to atonic uterus following c-section. So far this pregnancy has been uneventful and the baby is growing normally. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, You are 31 weeks pregnant. At this stage of pregnancy, the foetus does move freely in the uterus. When you feel it is moving rather too much, I would advise you to count the foetal movements. Count the number of times foetus moves in continuous 12 hours. A healthy foetus moves about 10 times during 12 hours period; or you can say on an average it moves once every hour. Of course, the foetus also has its own body clock. It does sleep at its own time, which may not be congruent with mother's sleep. Therefore I advise to have a foetal movements count for 12 hours. Please make note of each movement on a paper to avoid mistakes in the count. If the count is less than 10 in 12 hours, you have to report to your Obstetrician.I do empathise your concern due to previous placental abruption. However, placental abruption is a sudden event, though the cause may be over a period. So the foetus stops moving when placenta is separated. Increased foetal movements may not be indicating placental abruption. Still for your mental peace, better get ultrasonography done to ascertain the health and growth of the foetus and also integrity and maturity of placenta. If baby and placenta are healthy and normal, you need not worry about the foetal movemts if they are within normal limits. Another investigation you may undergo is electronic foetal monitoring which not only will count the foetal movements but will assess the foetal cardiac activity during movements and during Braxton Hick's uterine contractions. If there is any impending risk, it will be reflected in the foetal heart tracings. I hope this guidance is useful to you.Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"hi my girlfriend is 21 and 3 half weeks pregnant 2 nights ago she went to the toilet and a spot of fresh blood came out yesterday she went to her doctor she had a full examination the dr said she was ok anything heaver come back but this morning the same as happened just a spot of blood whats happening","Doctor":"HI, Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  Bleeding in early pregnancy can be due to-   -A normal thing around expected day of menses  .. due to implantation,It usually lasts for 1-3 days & is scanty.   - Hormone deficiency in early pregnancy results in bleeding.. which can turn in abortion.   - sometimes bleeding along with pain in either side of midline in abdomen, may suggest  ectopic pegnancy,  - chemical pregnancy ( blighted ovum usually starts bleeding & get aborted.   * So when the bleeding is with symptoms like cramping/ increasing in quantity day by day & spotting exceeds 2-3 days.. it's advisable to get a full pregnancy check up along with USG abdomen/  repeated HCG level estimations to come to a definite conclusion about the cause.

I have no past records of any serious illness. pl answer.","Doctor":"Hii have gone through your complaints.dont worry .its quite common in most of  all to have this finding. one thing i need to mention is its not at all neccessary to test if growth is appropriate to gestational age.persistance of it beyond 24 weeks needs to monitor for your BP to knoe chance of pregnancy induced hypertension.Now dont worry.follow the scan next month .regulary monitor your blood pressure.

My last period started on the 17th July and i average a 32 day cycle. I had unprotected sex on the 18th day of my cycle which works out as my ovulation day, however 10 days later, (3 days before i was due on) I got very drunk on a night out and a male friend took me home, I can t remember what happened and haven t seen him since. I realised 6 days after that night i was 3 days late on my period so did a test which came up positive straight away. I m pretty sure from what I ve looked into that the guy i slept with on my ovulation is the father however im having a problem getting this other person out of my head!! what do you think?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If you recall about the fertility period, it is about 10 days around the day of ovulation and the day of ovulation is 14 days before next expected menses. your cycles are of 32 days. hence day 18 would be the day of ovulation. you had unprotected intercourse on that day; so that intercourse is most likely to be responsible for this pregnancy.Moreover, the other unprotected intercourse you had with someone else was just 3 days before the expected menses. it is most unlikely to have the egg still alive till that day since the egg has life of only 24 hours.so, in my opinion, the person with whom you had sex on day 18 should be the father of this child.Still, if you want confirmation, may be for legal purpose, you may opt for DNA test.I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"OK here is my problem. Me and my boyfriend have intercourse on exactly November 14.. that was the last time we had sex because we broke up. Anyways. I got my period two weeks after that but i was on birth control.. we never use any protection so we didnt on that night. But right after my period was done i stopped my birth control. And i had heard that you can get pregnant to up to six weeks after intercourse. Well i didnt get my period in december.. and i didnt get in february and now its march and I still dont have my period. Like is it possible for me to be pregnant i feel silly going to pay for a test and for it to say negative. But i eventually will find out at the end of the month when i go to the doctors but i needed someone's advice.","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion there is no chance for pregnancy to occur 6 weeks after intercourse.Once you get the period there is no chance of pregnancy unless you have unprotected intercourse after the periods.As nothing such happened and the last intercourse was done only on November 14th after which you got the periods the chances of pregnancy are very rare.But just as a benefit of doubt a urine pregnancy test can be done to rule out the pregnancy.It will be positive from one week after the missed period in case of pregnancy.And by 3 months of pregnancy physical examination also helps in diagnosis.I suggest you to consult doctor for further work up.If there was any pregnancy the symptoms like nausea,vomitings, increased urination,sore breasts would be present as all the symptoms start around 6 weeks.But overall the pregnancy appears to be rare or nil possibility because you got the periods and you don't have any symptoms of pregnancy.So relax.Avoid stress.The delay could be due to hormonal imbalance as the birth control pills were stopped.Avoid stress as it also delays the period.Hope this helps.Best regards.,."},{"Patient":"Im 33 weeks pregnant and had a sudden spike in my blood pressure.

All bloodwork came back normal except my liver function panel was a bit off. Awaiting 24 hr protein test results and am on bedrest until all tests come back. My BP s have stayed normal (110/78 range) since the spike. Is it possible to have preeclampsia with normal BP s, or is it possible to have random spikes that high and nothing be wrong?","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion there is no chance of preeclampsia with normal BP.Infact preeclampsia is a combination of high BP more than or equal to 140/90 along with proteinuria and with or without pathological swelling of feet.But at the same time presence of spikes of high BP might also cannot be considered as normal.Mild elevations upto 130/80 might be acceptable but not more than that.The BP should be recorded at 6 hours apart.If at both the instances the BP is high pregnancy induced hypertension(PIH) is said to be present.The presence of abnormal liver parameters,headache,high spikes of BP might suggest PIH .24 hour protein is helpful to diagnose if it is just PIH or preeclampsia.Avoid stress and relax.As there are medicines available which can control BP.Check your fetal movements and other symptoms of eclampsia like vomitings,epigastric pain,blurred vision,decreased urine output.These are called imminent signs of eclampsia.Eclampsia is a condition where preeclampsia is superimposed by fits.Take high protein diet and relax.You might not go upto that eclampsia level but just Iam giving you the information.Hope this helps.Best regards.."},{"Patient":"my husband had two semen analysis daignosed azzospermic so urologist asked us to do hormone tests and they all came out normal fsh lh prolactine and testosterone as well.He told us that we can do sperm retrieval and icsi since the problem is a blockage.But when reading on the internet i still found that men can have normal fsh and still have problems with sperm retrieval.Could my husband have spermotogenisis arrest and do we still need a biopsy and hormone tests are of no use.upon physical examination everything seemed normal as in size of testis ,fructose present in semen ph alkaline and volume 1 to 2 ml","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for reaching out.

Could I still be preg? Should I wait and take a test again next wk","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The spotting you had on 23 rd seems to be ovulation spotting, also known as Mittelschmerz. Your periods are just 4 days overdue. Pregnancy test on urine may give false negative results if done so early. These tests are more reliable 8-10 days after missed period. So you may repeat the test again after one week. You have another alternative of going for Beta hCG test. This test gives reliable result even few days before missing period. All other symptoms of pregnancy appear only after ten to fifteen days of misse period. So, do not go on those symptoms. Get the pregnancy diagnosed by reliable test.

Now after 5 days bleeding has stopped. Are there still chances of any abnomalities in pregnancy or the baby. Do we have gynecologist","Doctor":"Dear Madam,At any stage of pregnancy, retro placental clot is not a good sign. This clot is formed due to separation of placenta and further more, it further causes more and more separation of placenta. Placenta is that organ of the baby which nourishes the baby and breaths for the baby. So if substantial placenta is separated, there is great risk to the life of the baby. Sustain 100 you are receiving is a progestational preparation. Progesterone is known to arrest the process of abortion. However, if the baby has already been rendered non-viable, use of progesterone will still arrest the process of abortion and lead to missed abortion. Hence, I would advise you to get ultrasonography done to ascertain that baby is viable and the size of the retroplacental clot is not increasing. If baby is safe, please continue Sustain, however continue to have repeated follow up ultrasonography. If the baby is non-viable, you will have to undergo termination of pregnancy. So ultrasonography is the key guideline for you. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"Dear Dr. Jain,I suffered an ectopic in 2006 and subsequently underwent and right salpingectomy.

I went back to him and he has now prescribed Primolut N. I am not sure why I am spotting...and he has not explained that. What are these drugs for? He seems to be treating me but i am not sure what for and how it works. Can you help?ThanksTamara","Doctor":"Hi there,,Pain during menstrual period could be due to a condition called endometriosis. It cant be diagnosed with a biopsy, you may require a laparoscopy to know exactly what is the cause of this pain, especially if it persists.The primolut is a progesterone hormone tablet and may help with spotting, but again you need to know the cause of spotting. As long as you are taking the primolut you will not get pregnant. It's best that you get evaluated thoroughly with a laparoscopy and hysteroscopy which will give a cause for the spotting and pain that you have.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"i recently had unproteced sex with my boyfriend...i am supposed to start my period on the 13th... i was reading on the internet and it said that it should take 7-10 days b4 implantation occurs so why are my nipples are already sensitive to the touch && what are the chances of me being pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi, Dr Purushottam Neurgaonkar here.

But, the antibiotics are likely to cause B complex deficiency in yourself.. which would in turn cause loss of taste & less eating .. weakness& this may indirectly affect your baby.   Anti allergic pills taken for a long period is not indicated in early pregnancy ( before 3 months )  Intravenous injections of antibiotics ( permissible in pregnancy)/ broncodialaters do not affect fetal growth..   * Better way to manage your problem is to have consultation of a chest physician & start preventive measures for it.Inform the doctor about your pregnancy & then start with  inhalers / medicines.. syrup, pills  as per his expert advise.

Your picture correlated with the history of bleeding is suggesting the possibility of miscarriage. The white tissues you are passing are most likely to be the products of conception. Please get your ultrasonography done which will inform you about the status of the baby. Along with get pregnancy test on urine done. It is more than 10 days that you had bleeding. So if the baby is non-viable, by now the pregnancy test would become negative. If the ultrasonography reveals that the baby is not viable and still some products are in the uterine cavity, you will have to undergo evacuation of the uterus. If the uterus has already passed all the products, you need not take any further action. Now since it is about 15 days or so that you started bleeding, it is better you get following investigations done on you blood to rule out clotting disorder (DIC):1. Clotting Time & Bleeding Time2. Prothrobin Time3. Fibrinogen Degradation Products. 4. Platelet countIn case of non-viable baby, please do not waste time lest the risk of complications like infection, DIC, etc..

Carbamazepine has always been considered to be safer with pregnancy than the other drugs, but, as you had unfavorable outcome while on this medication, it may not suit you. Treatment also depends on the type of epilepsy you have. Please ask your gynecologist to discuss with your neurologist and decide the better available choices. This should be done keeping in mind that epilepsy is not a disease that is cured overnight and motherhood should not be withdrawn for correctable reasons.

Her blood pressure has been perfect through the whole pregnancy . What could be the problem","Doctor":"Hi there,,Twin pregnancies are known to be more high risk for the mother. More so if she is having identical twin pregnancy. Do the girls share they same amniotic sac ?Monozygotic (same Sac) twins have a higher rate of complications and if her blood pressure is not being controlled, her Obstetrician should plan for an early delivery.Twins mature faster than singleton pregnancy and if the maternal condition is getting unstable it is best to consider delivery.The loss of mucus plug also indicates that she is likely to get into labour soon. Twins may require monitoring post delivery and the pediatrician should be informed and two pediatricians should be available at the time of delivery.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"My girlfriend has been on her period as scheduled but she is concerned that she may be pregnant because there has not been any lining in her period.

I knew that something had happened in my genital region but the pain in my back was so severe that it didn t register right away. Since then, I have had nagging pain in my scrotum/penis. I had an ultrasound and CAT scan at the time and everything looked normal. After a year of severe pain during ejaculation, a surgeon said he detected a very small inguinal hernia and unless we fixed that, we wouldn t know if it might be causing the pain. I let him do it. I still had the pain after that and got another opinion. The guy said he wouldn t treat me any further because there was no hard evidence of any issue. I gave up but for 5 years have had pain like a toothache and worse pain during intercourse. I was recently moving something heavy and during the move, I felt a tear in my penis. It was almost as if that was the original issue which maybe partially healed and when I lifted the object, re-tore. I finally went back to a doctor and got an MRI which didn t show anything. A urologist has looked at this case heavily. I even had him do an exploratory procedure while I was getting a vasectomy. He has found nothing. He believes like I do that there is a muscle tear. The problem is he didn t refer me on to another doctor. I have since gotten more aggressive to try to pinpoint the location and there are times when I can locate the center of the pain. It seems like its between the muscle fibers back in the part of the penis that is concealed by the sack. When I touch it, it feels severe and I almost pass out. My urologist believes that I am correct and there is a tear but he can t help me. After having no success with local doctors, I need to know if this is in fact a possibility. If it is, are there doctors that specialize in this? Is it likely that an injury such as this can be repaired?","Doctor":"Hello, It is due to neuropathic causes related to your spinal injury.

Please do not worry. 1 )  Ate you using sex toy to masturbation.  If you are inserting it deep inside the vagina, it can cause bleeding from cervix. 2 )  As you said you had  bleeding inside in the early pregnancy,  the brown discharge can be the old collection that is passed out. Fresh bleeding is bright red in colour .  So you need not worry about it. 3 )  I will suggest to go ahead with non penetrative masturbation .

But he spilled out his sperms and I am in a doubt if the sperms have reached my vagina and I am pregnant. I took an i-pill on the second day (after 40hrs but before 48 hrs). I had my previous periods completed sometime in the mid of march. On 1st of April i got my periods and lasted for 3 days. After that till now i have not got my periods.I read in various sites tht if one misses the period , then they might be pregnant. But in my case, i got my periods(early i can say). Could you please tell me if i am pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You have very rightly taken a precautionary step of taking I-pill. Though he did not ejaculate in the vagina, the chances of depositing Pre-ejaculatory secretions in the vagina or on the vaginal outlet are very high. Moreover, depositing the semen on the vaginal opening is sufficient for the sperms to enter in to the vagina to cause conception. I-pill has to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. You have taken it within 40 hours. So you are well protected. I-pill is a Levonorgestrel (Progesterone) preparation. Hence few days after its consumption, some withdrawal bleeding can take place. The bleeding you got about 2 weeks after menses was this withdrawal bleeding due to I-pill. Subsequent periods after that may get delayed. So if you are delayed by few days, you need not worry. However, if the periods are delayed for more than a week, you may perform pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample for finding out the status of pregnancy. Alternatively you nay opt for Beta hCG test. The probability of pregnancy is very remote; still if you do not get menses in spite on 'no pregnancy', you may take Tab. Deviry for 5 days and you will get withdrawal bleeding after 4-7 days. I hope this helps you.
