Her age is 6 years. Last month she got a viral fever and we got her tested for CBP along with other tests. As part of that, we found that she has less absolute neutrophil count. Though pediatrician said it is fine, we were worried. So, repeated test after one month and looks this time some other values are in not expected range. We see she is having frequent colds but she is very active.","Doctor":"Hello. I have checked your attached reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your latest reports show absolute neutrophil count slightly low. But your count improved as compared to the last month report. The frequent cold might be the reason for low absolute neutrophils and high lymphocytes. The peripheral smear examination report is normal and any specific abnormality is not mentioned in the peripheral smear report of WBC. So, you may need not to worry about your CBC report as per my opinion. If your kid has clinically improved, then no need to worry."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 21-year-old female. My partner and I were intimate and he came on my hands. We were sitting side by side and there was no genital contact. There was also no fingering or intercourse. I then proceeded to wash my hands with running water and some bodywash gel. I then washed down there using a jet spray and one hand only on the outsides and did not do fingering while washing either. Is there a risk of pregnancy? I also took an Ipill within three hours after that. Please do help.","Doctor":"Hello. There is no risk of pregnancy as intercourse was not resorted to. Also before touching your genitals, you washed with soap which would have killed the sperms right away. There was no requirement of taking an Ipill, but now that you have taken it, it is just double protection and you should wait for your withdrawal bleed in the next few days. Once the bleed starts it would mean endometrial shed and indicate that you are pregnancy safe. There are possibilities that you may face some side effects due to high dose Progesterones like a headache, nausea, bloating before the bleed, but that is normal and can be countered by increasing your water intake till the bleeding starts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Also, please explain where should I get the test done.","Doctor":"Hi. Oral sex does not cause HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) to the recipient. It may cause genital herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and warts if these infections are present in the partner. Your doctor may advise you to get HSV 1 and 2 (herpes simplex virus) and VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory) tests to detect sexually transmitted disease. Urine test for gonorrhea is done only if there is any burning or pain while micturition. These tests are usually free in government hospitals and private laboratory can also perform these tests.

The medical terminology for having different colors at different parts of the iris is heterochromia iridis. Although some people naturally have this since birth, it could be a possible early sign of a few eye related disorders. I would also consider you lucky, thanks to your keen observation, it has made it possible for this condition to be picked up early.

Due to a slightly low AMH for her age (16 pmol) my wife was recommended to go straight to IVF from our fertility clinic. With all of the above, no issues were found and we are diagnosed with unexplained. My wife went for vaginal swab testing in preparation for the IVF where although no major STDs were found they discovered a large amount of E.Coli bacteria colonized within the reproductive tract (presumably vagina and cervix). There was a small number of leukocytes found too. The doctor wrote a prescription for antibiotics which he said should clear it out. Our concern now is, could the E-coli be the reason for infertility? My wife has not taken antibiotics for a long time and we are presuming that she could have had the bacteria there for a long time. I have read that E-coli does pretty much clump sperm together and stop them from moving. Do you have any advice on the matter?","Doctor":"Hi. Since the vaginal swab shows E-coli (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it would be better to undergo a course of antibiotics for you and your wife in order to improve chances of IVF.

Numbness started to affect the skin on my back, face, chest. The doctor advised to stop Nortriptyline but did not express concern over the reaction. What happened?","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that the complaints that you describe, are not common adverse effects related to Amitriptyline or Nortriptyline. I do not find anything really concerning in your symptoms, besides the fact that these drugs do not seem to be effective in controlling your headaches. Coming to this point, I would first recommend performing a brain CT scan or MRI in order to be sure that it is a primary headache. Some blood laboratory tests are also necessary. Considering the numbness in your limbs, get complete blood count for anemia, thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction, PCR, ESR for inflammation, blood electrolytes for possible imbalances. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests, before switching to another drug. In the meantime, it is fine to gradually stop Nortriptyline."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have toenail problem.

Maybe, you can give me a straight answer. What is the acceptable range for blood glucose levels? Some people say the lower end is 70 and some others say the lower end is 130. Please explain.","Doctor":"Hi. Many types of blood sugar testings are there, and the values for that are different. But worldwide, the most commonly used tests for the detection of diabetes are Fasting Blood Sugar and Post Prandial Blood Sugar. Fasting blood sugar test is done by taking the blood sample from a patient after a period of fasting. Usually, patients are asked to report for the test in the morning, before breakfast (after about 8 hours of fasting). The normal range of fasting blood sugar is 70 to 100 mg/dL. Anything between 100 to125 mg/dL is considered as Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) or pre-diabetes. And anything more than 125 mg/dL is considered as diabetes. Post-prandial blood sugar test is done by taking the blood sample from a patient after a meal. Usually, the test is done after 2 hours after a meal. The normal range of post meals blood sugar should be less than 180 mg/dL. Anything between 180 to 200 mg/dL is considered Impaired Glucose tolerance or pre-diabetic state. And anything more than 200 mg/dL is considered as diabetes.

There is a 50 % possibility that you could be an Rh-negative blood group.  There is no blood group combination between couples that has known to cause problems in conception. If you are Rh-negative and your husband Rh-positive, then the problem of Rh incompatibility arises in the baby, that too in the second child.

Hepatitis B virus is transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person and through blood, mucous membranes, and wounds. Yes, other persons can use your things and drink water from your glass if they do not have any injury. You should not have sexual contact with your wife. And she should check herself for hepatitis B.

I am worried about my prognosis. I am a medical student, can I still become a surgeon?","Doctor":"Hi. Going by the details you have provided you have euthyroid. This means that you do have normal TSH with normal T4 and T3. The most common cause is autoimmune thyroid disease, which is confirmed by positive anti-TPO (anti-Thyroid Peroxidase) antibodies. Positive anti-TPO means you have these antibodies in your body which act against the thyroid cells. Most often this is a progressive disease. As of today, we do not have treatment against autoimmunity. Therefore, we replace thyroid hormone in the form of Thyroxine. With TSH near 10 and strongly positive antibodies, I suggest you get your TSH done after 6 weeks. If normal, there is nothing to worry. Apart from the destruction of thyroid cells, anti-TPO antibodies do not cause any other harm. Disease per se is harmless if TSH is kept normal. Keep track of TSH and treat it accordingly. This will never affect your future, and you can continue your studies without fear of not becoming a surgeon. You will become a surgeon, all the best."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For the past few years, I have been having the following symptoms:  Tremors. Pain near the spinal cord. Head stiffness.

For example,Â if we ask where is the fan, then he automatically sees the roof. If the fan is switched off, then he just sees it and cry. If he crosses some particular color lights or television, he will turn his head towards it and watch it. When I took him to his pediatrician, he said he is absolutely normal. Also, his health is good. He asked us not to worry. But, it makes me fear while he drop his head down or getting jerk. He is our second son and it was a cesarean. Now, he is having cold.

He has received three laser treatments, and it looks much, much better. My son is almost 2 years old. Our plastic surgeon would do a scar excision if we wanted him too (or more laser treatments) but is leaving it up to us. I have read that other plastic surgeons say to wait until the teens so that the natural growth factors produced by a child do not result in a more hypertrophic scar after scar excision. Are children really more susceptible to the formation of hypertrophic scars after scar excision? I am trying to determine if scar excision is really the best option for him.","Doctor":"Hi. Your son has a post-burn hypertrophic scar over the submandibular region. Post-burn hypertrophic scar. It is better not to do any surgery now for the scar as if the surgery is done, there will be a risk of hypertrophic scar again. This scar will improve over the period. Scar revision can be done later if wanted when the patient is a little grown-up. To improve scar, the following can be done. Scar massage, silicone gel to be applied twice a day, pressure garment if possible to reduce the chance of hypertrophic scarring."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 45-year-old male, the youngest of my other five siblings. All through my childhood years up to the age of 20, my parents and other four of my siblings were exposed to a very angry behavior of my elder brother, the oldest of my siblings. The age gap between him and me is 15 years difference. For all I could remember is that almost every day this brother would punch my sister (who is three years younger than him) in the face, pull her hair and drag her across the room just because of talking and laughing at home and for his sake when we were at home no one is to talk or laugh in the house. I used to come from school and hide under a sofa untill my mom got home from work. When I got to the age of 20, it was this time that my parents convinced him to get a shock therapy and was given medication for his schizophrenic behavior but after some months he refused to take any medication saying that he is not a sick person. Eventually, my parents convinced him to stay at our native place house where he still resides alone. As a result of this trauma and my silent behavior, I became an easy target to bullies in the school and my surrounding neighborhood areas. I had contemplated suicide sometimes. My sisters (three) are now all married and settled.This experience has affected me and my sister (who is six years older to me) the most as we were very young compared to the other siblings at the time of this trauma. Both of us experienced the same ridicule and sometimes our heads used to jerk suddenly for which we could not control. Now we have overcome this head jerk nervous condition after many years. The ages of my siblings now, in the order of seniority which is 60 years, brother with mental illness, 59 years, sister, 57 years, sister, 54 years, brother, 51 years, sister, 45 years, myself. Please advise on my condition so I may lead the remainder of my life as normal as possible.","Doctor":"Hi. After I read your history that you had a very difficult past, for your brother who is schizophrenic patient, who need proper treatment and if unable to manage, he needs institutional care. As far as your history is concerned which shows depression and anxiety, can you mention that what are the current issues? Do depression and anxiety occur nowadays?

These are some queries in this regard. Whether any other treatments are required after completing six months of medicine? If yes, mention details.

Last week, I started up Depo again (not on my period). 10 days back I had unprotected sex. I am not even sure if he came in me. I took a Plan B the next day. I was supposed to get my period two days later. Should I be worried about pregnancy? I feel like I just flooded my body with hormones.","Doctor":"Hi. Which day did you start Depo again? If we look into your query, you had sex and took I-pill in 24 hours. If the emergency contraceptive pill was taken in proper dose within 48 hours post unprotected sex without vomitings, then it will work and most probably will give withdrawal bleed in 1 to 2 weeks if not taken during periods. I hope you will get periods but as sex was not done in the most fertile period of the cycle, so least chances of pregnancy are there but the withdrawal bleed will come along with periods or periods might get delayed. To be on the safe side and for your satisfaction, you can have serum beta hCG to check your pregnancy status but I hope it will be least likely positive. I will recommend waiting for some time for bleeding. If unable to bleed this whole week then follow up. Unprotected sex with Depo injection. Beta hCG if you want to confirm pregnancy status."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My father got cancer and the treatment was done.

I have seen all your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), suggesting adenocarcinoma of text, which is 3 cm from anal verge with infiltrating surrounding lymph nodes. As I will tell you they did chemotherapy to reduce the extension of cancer cells surrounding the anal canal. As it is now very important to resection of that tumorpart, to prevent further extension. As good news is that this kind of cancer response is good for the surgery, so surgery must be done to treat this condition. So, your doctor has advised correctly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The root canal left a gap between the molar and the tooth beside it. Food got stuck inside and it was causing pain. I came back and she said it was the tooth next to my root canal which was causing the gap. Now that tooth had a filling in it so she offered to redo it so the gap would disappear. After the new filling, the gap was still there so she put some kind of hardening fluid in between the gap and told me not to floss on that tooth. A few weeks later and the gap is back and now my tooth with redone filling is very sensitive. I am starting to feel like this is a lost cause and I do not know where to go from here.","Doctor":"Hi. Your case has become a bit complicated. It would have not gone this bad if the filling of the adjacent tooth would have been done before taking size for the cap, then the gap would have adjusted and you would not be having any food sticking complaint. But do not worry, there is an end to every pain and suffering. You might have to go for these stages of treatment now. First of all, an X-ray of the adjacent tooth that is feeling sensitive should be taken and assessed. The following could be the treatment options you could have. If there is some internal carious activity detected that is causing sensitivity and has not touched the pulp or root of the tooth, then again you have to go for deep filling with some regenerative dressing in the deeper part of the cavity that may regenerate the tissues above the root, reduces sensitivity and inhibits the further carious activity. If there is some carious activity that has touched the pulp of tooth then you would be going for root canal treatment and capping as done before. Then cap will be placed and it will fix your gap. You can have an option of capping at sensitive tooth after deep filling if caries has not reached pulp. Cap size will be adjusted to fill the gap and you will be relieved. It would be great if you can provide me with some of your clinical pictures of teeth and X-ray of both RCT treated and sensitive tooth. Then I could suggest better which option will suit you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is 85 years old and now he has become very stubborn and is not listening to anyone.

You can start weaning (gradually reduce mother's milk and start giving solids). Start giving semisolid food after she is 6 months. If you are breastfeeding your baby then, you can express breast milk and store it for rest of the day before you go to work. Breast milk can be stored for 24 hours in a refrigerator. Regarding solid foods, homemade rice with dal water is a good food to start with. Start with the rice variant which is least allergic. Partially grind the cooked rice and make it easy for the baby to swallow. Banana is another solid food which you can give during the evenings. Start with one banana a day and then make it twice a day. Introduce one new food to your baby at a time with a gap of one week at least, so that you know which food your baby is able to digest easily and which she is allergic to. You can continue with boiled potato, carrot, beetroot one by one. Readymade preparations like cerelac, nestum or farex are also an alternative.

This happened when I was younger, for example, I was discussing something that happened years ago with a friend and realized that I had no memory of it. My memory of things which have happened more recently is clearer but not as good as it used to be. I also experience time loss, I feel like I have suddenly come to a place and have no idea how I got there or what I was doing. I usually only lose a couple of minutes. I have also been becoming increasingly forgetful, that is, forgetting things which I had told that I would do or things my boss has asked me to do. None of this is something I would normally experience. I think it has developed over the last one year. Along with this, I also experience fainting when I stand up and stationary for too long. I am fine if I am moving and I am often dizzy when I stand up. I often feel extremely tired even when I have slept well and sometimes I become very shaky for no reason, especially my hands. I have been experiencing this for years and have been to my doctor. I have been tested for malaria, anemia, diabetes and thyroid problems. All tests came back negative. An ECG of my heart showed no problems and my blood pressure is normal. My doctor recommended an MRI but, as it is expensive I do not wish to do this unless it is really necessary. I used to smoke but have quit and I rarely drink. I will have maybe a couple of glasses of wine a week. Do you have any idea on what could be causing this?","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for sharing such a detailed information with us. I can understand your problem very well. At your age memory disturbances are not usual, because dementia (the most common cause of memory loss) is very common in old age but at your age dementia is very rare. So, in your case, we have to proceed accordingly to rule out other causes as well. Other causes at your age could be thyroid disturbances, diabetes, anemia (nutritional deficiencies), hypertension (increased blood pressure) and heart diseases (ruled out with your ECG). I think you have ruled out most of the physical causes by investigating, as you have mentioned that these tests were negative in your case. Next issue which can cause memory loss at your age could be seizure disorder like absence seizure or other types of seizures. If you cannot afford an MRI scan, you can go for a cheaper option like CT scan/EEG to rule out seizures. Another common cause for your memory loss (which is good to be called as cognitive disturbances) in your case could be due to either depression or anxiety (as you have mentioned above that you never feel refreshed after sleep, often feel tired, shaky hands, fainting, restlessness). I would like to tell you other symptoms which can be suggestive of depressive disorder are low mood/sad mood, loss of interest in work, hopelessness, appetite disturbances, reduced concentration and attention; reduced self-esteem and self-confidence; ideas of guilt and unworthiness (even in a mild type of episode); bleak and pessimistic views of the future; ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide. Symptoms suggestive of anxiety disorders are apprehension (worries about future misfortunes, feeling \\"on edge\\", difficulty in concentrating, etc.); motor tension (fidgeting, tension headaches, trembling, inability to relax); and autonomic overactivity (lightheadedness, sweating, tachycardia - increased heartbeat or tachypnoea - increased respiratory rate, epigastric discomfort, dizziness, dry mouth, etc.) in addition to the memory disturbances. So, after getting all the necessary investigations like EEG/CT scan done, you can provide a more detailed history of your disease and we can make a particular diagnosis. One more thing I would like to ask you is that, are you having some repeated thoughts in your mind which you fail to resist or are you more conscious about dirt? Do you keep checking the locks? These are the symptoms of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) which also can be presented with forgetfulness sometimes. If all the investigations are normal, then you can start pharmacological as well as non-pharmacological methods of treatment for depression and anxiety. You can use some relaxation techniques like breathing exercises, yoga therapy for anxiety symptoms. There are many safe drugs available for early and good recovery, but you have to be sure about your diagnosis first. You can start SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) in low doses and increase them slowly and your problem will resolve definitely.

I have been doing lower back exercises since two days for my back pain. Since then, I think I have been having mild pain around the genital area and this problem of numbness. Is it temporary?","Doctor":"Hi. You have not provided any information regarding your marital status and education which are also relevant for me to diagnose. Numbness around in the genital area after orgasm can be calledrefractory period. This refractory period after orgasm is quite natural and normal in men. This period can last from a few minutes to one hour. So, you need not worry about this. Secondly, the lower back exercises might have not caused numbness of the penis in your case. When we do exercise after a long time, it is natural to have pain in and around that site initially for a few days. This is because our muscle becomes contracted and causes the pain. In case the pain is such that it disturbs your normal activities, then you can take a painkiller on a temporary basis.

Lack of appetite, lower abdominal pain, breathing difficulty, indigestion, bolting and constipation.Â All these symptoms will persist until the pain is there.Â She had been frequently visiting doctors for treatment, but the doctor says that she has no major problem in the stomach.

My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Its botanical name is Caesalpinia bonducela. Its seed is used for medicinal purposes. You can prepare at home by Kalachikai seeds or churnam. Before starting medicine once you should check out your USG abdomen to rule out PCOD and thyroid profile to rule out hypothyroidism.

I am developing pain in my left knee, and the pain has also started in my ankle and shin. How do I get rid of this pain?","Doctor":"Hi. Genu valgum is commonly called the knock-knees. It is the inability to touch both the feet together due to inward angulation of the knee. It is a physiological condition mostly, but less commonly pathological. The management will depend upon: Perhaps if you post your standing x-rays of both legs called long leg views or hip knee ankle views, it will be helpful for me to advise you further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a 7 year old son who vomits or gags at the sight or thought of food that he does not like. He has been doing it for as long as I can remember. Every time I talk to his pediatrician about it, she says that it is no big deal, but I feel it is. He has to sit alone at lunch while at school. He also vomits every day at school. I need to know what is going on. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Vomiting at the sight of food is psychological, but I would like to know to which kind of foods does he do that like is it for milk products, etc.? This also means he might be allergic to some foods. Those foods can be avoided. Is his weight normal for his age? If he vomits daily, I would suggest some medications like Domperidone or Ranitidine. Sitting alone during lunch might not be good in the long run. Try to talk to him at home. The other way is to expose him to foods which he does not like in a graded manner, that is with a little amount initially and then increase the quantity gradually. Your child needs counseling for boosting confidence so that he does not face social isolation in the future."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an 18 year old female.

And when I eat any sweets, I feel weird. I do not know how to explain it. I feel like my heartbeat gets faster sometimes, but when I check my pulse, it feels normal. But today when I ate some chocolate cookies, I laid down because I felt tired and weak. My left arm felt really weak. Then when I got up, I got really dizzy, like more dizzy than I usually get when I wake up, and I had to wait a few seconds so that I can go downstairs without falling. And I always just want to lay down. I always feel so lazy and do not really want to do anything, and I do not know why. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi. No need to be worried, but yes you need to get evaluated for the cause of your problems because at the age of 18, tiredness all the day and weakness is not common. Your problems could be due to low hemoglobin, vitamin D or B12 deficiency, or due to thyroid problems or diabetes. I advise you to get the following tests done:"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 20 weeks pregnant. I wanted to know that does having sex during pregnancy harm my baby? And is it safe?","Doctor":"Hi.

Movement does not seem to influence the pain. Sometimes, I get a bit dizzy too. Pain seems to come randomly. Doctor prescribed Diclac 50 mg thrice a day and Clorom 500 mg twice a day.

What could this mean? Is it pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi. It is a very short description of your query. It could be implantation bleeding if you had recently unprotected sex, or any infection that is appearing as vaginal discharge or could be bleeding or discharge from a local lesion or could be signs and symptoms of cervical erosion or any other pelvic pathology or just unscheduled bleeding due to hormonal effects, etc. Check if you have been taking any contraceptive or any hormonal treatment or imbalance or had any other medical disorder? Have serum beta hCG to exclude pregnancy. If it comes negative, then have tests advised below. Have a vaginal swab to exclude infection, complete blood count and thyroid function test. Have one transvaginal scan, cervical smear and if possible outpatient hysteroscopic examination by a gynecologist. Check on the regularity of cycles, any other abnormal symptoms, revise your medications by discussing with the related specialist and to have complete treatment with regular follow ups. Collect laboratory results and discuss here. Have a strict hygiene, use condoms to avoid transmission of infectons. Have a balanced diet, daily walk and try to have normal BMI. I hope things would be better. In case of positive pregnancy test no need to have more tests but start Folic acid daily and do have a scan after 2 to 3 weeks if remains asymptomatic. Implantation or contraceptive or medicine use. Beta hCG if comes negative then only cervical smear, CBC, TFTS, transvaginal scan. Unscheduled bleeding. Hygiene, revise medication, complete check-up and regular treatment of any health issue you have."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been on Ava 20 (hormonal contraceptive pill) for about three years. I recently just stopped taking it. I had sex about 3 to 4 time in my fertile period. I have missed my period by a few days. So, I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative. I have been having a few symptoms too like sore nipples and breasts, weeing a bit more than usual, acne, fatigue.","Doctor":"Hi. Since you have been actively trying to conceive and having unprotected sexual intercourse on fertile days does put the possibility of pregnancy high up on the list especially coupled with a missed period. A home pregnancy test can be negative in the first few days after the missed period even in case of successful fertilization owing to insufficient beta hCG hormones. I suggest you take another urine strip test after a week if you still do not get your periods. Or could get a blood test for serum beta hCG in a few days which is more sensitive. In any case, you should treat it as a possible pregnancy unless proven otherwise and take your vitamins."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, For the past 10 months, my wife (age 32 years) started developing symptoms of bronchitis (complaints of SOB and fatigue). Her feet and ankles started to swell and used to take Lasix (to treat edema) on SOS basis for the past seven months, which gave her temporary relief. Next month she underwent checkups (did chest X-ray, echo and ECG) and everything was normal with exception of sinus tachycardia (HR was 110+). and slight fatty changes in liver. The doctor also advised taking Hep-B vaccine (Engerix-B), for which she has taken two doses already and the next one is due in a month. Two months back, she traveled for a period of three weeks. There she suffered from acute breathlessness, stomach bloating, feet and ankle swelling, bloating of the stomach. She could barely lie down on her back. After visiting a gastroenterologist and a pulmonologist, she was advised to undergo USG-abdomen. The USG revealed ascites, bilateral pelural effusion. We saw a cardiologist and was advised to do echo, ECG and chest X-ray. The echo resulted in very poor LV EF (25 %) and dilated LV, LA. She is under medication (Cardivas 6.25, Vymada 100, Nexpro RD 40, Rivotril 0.25, Bevon]. She was also advised to undergo cardiac MRI. The MRI results were pretty much the same as echo (did not result in anything conclusive). Blood tests were also conducted (Na, K are normal, NT-PRO BNP is high 504 pg/ml, bilirubin is a little high 1.14). I want to get an opinion and advise on the below. The cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in such a young person. Is it viral infection? She did not have a fever. What is the treatment? Is the condition reversible? Will the dilation get back to normal?","Doctor":"Hi. Your wife has multiple issues including dilated cardiomyopathy and PCOS (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There are multiple causes of dilated cardiomyopathy including viral infections, pregnancy, familial and idiopathic, tachycardia, PVCs, amyloidosis in late stages, etc. Treatment is going well which you told. Carvedilol dose can be increased if heart failure condition allows, Vymada can also be increased upto 200 mg if BP allows, Lasix can be added and Spironolactone should also be started at 25 mg per day. Doses should slowly be uptitrated. Yes sometimes condition is reversible, but after one year chances of reversibility are rare. Then a device called ICD is implanted in the heart to prevent cardiac arrest or CRTd for heart failure symptoms and to prevent cardiac arrest. For PCOS, consult a gynecologist.

I feel bloated most of the time and sometime get headache. If I have burning sensation in feet, I take Mucaine syrup sometimes. I also feel slight pain on left arm. I feel this is due to gas or stomach problem. Help me to cure it.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, I would like to assure you that you are right about the problem being a gastric problem. In medical terms, it is called gastritis. Having said that, since you have mentioned the presence of slight pain along your left arm, I would suggest you take an ECG at any clinic. There is nothing to worry about. It is always good to rule out the possibility of any underlying problems. As of now, you need to follow the below advice. It is very important to make lifestyle changes before succumbing to medications for treating gastritis. Having mentioned your BMI, it seems to be on the more obese scale. You need to keep a check on your weight. The first step is to make diet modifications. You need to consider a more balanced diet in the most practical way possible. Start having three meals a day, each meal should be consumed four hours apart. Each meal should consist of one portion each of a carbohydrate, a protein, and a fat source. For example, breakfast could include a brown bread, boiled or poached egg (not fried), and vegetable fillings. Include a lot of fruits and vegetables in your diet. You can add a fresh orange or mixed fruit juice (made at home), along with the breakfast. You can also end the day with a bowl of fruit salad. Try to start the day with any detox drinks, like warm water with lemon, honey, and ginger. You need to consume at least two glasses of water before moving to breakfast. Make sure to have at least 8 to 9 glasses of water in a day. Cut down on any hot beverages like tea or coffee. Avoid dairy, including milk, cheese, etc. Next step is to maintain a good physical health through physical activity. Start with walking daily for one hour in the morning or evening. You can also choose to practice yoga. It helps with gastritis and helps maintain an energetic lifestyle. Later, include aerobics and cardio and power exercises. It is very important to exercises at least three times a week. It helps in bloating and maintaining good health. Start taking capsule Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily for two weeks. Make sure you carry out the lifestyle modifications simultaneously. Try to avoid, lentils, dal, and chickpeas for a short period of time. They would cause gastritis. Try including a lot of home-made soups and juices in your diet too. Do not worry, you will completely be alright. You just need to follow the above advice. Stay healthy and positive."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

I have a paroxysmal type of afib. Recently its frequency has markedly increased. I am taking Sotalol 80 mg and 80 mg. But now Sotalol increase is required which causes bradycardia when the rhythm is sinus. My cardiologist wants to implant a pacemaker to pace the heart in bradycardia. Please let me know about the role of PM in arrhythmia. My cardiologist says during abnormal rythm PM is inactive.","Doctor":"Hi. The rate in AF is controlled with beta blockers, calcium channel blocker or Digoxin. You are taking Sotalol which is a beta blocker as well as the anti-arrhythmic drug. The permanent pacemaker is implanted when there is tachy-brady syndrome. It means sometimes there is tachycardia episode and sometimes bradycardia episode. If we control tachycardia, during bradycardia episode there will be even more severe bradycardia and if we control bradycardia, tachycardia episode will be severe. So, in this situation, a pacemaker is implanted to avoid bradycardia, and for the tachycardia, medicine is continued. The pacemaker is programmed to pace the heart when the rate drops to a certain threshold such as 60 bpm. Paroxysmal AF is one in which rhythm is restored to sinus within seven days, persistent is seven days to 12 months, long-standing persistent is more than 12 months. Cryoablation technique is used to revert rhythm back to normal sinus. It is done in paroxysmal AF, but some trials exist even for persistent and long-standing persistent AF as successful ablation can be done. Please consult your cardiac electrophysiologist about the possibility of this procedure in your case."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just got my wisdom teeth pulled out. All four of them. I cannot open my mouth all the way to even stick my toothbrush to brush my teeth. What should I do? I got them pulled a few days back and just been brushing the front and sides of my teeth and using a Qtip to wash the back teeth. Another concern I have is that my back teeth have white pus on the top of them. I believe it is the scab from the extraction, it is on my other teeth and I am worried should I try ripping them off. I do not want to hurt myself though or should I just leave it alone? Will it cause any problem like make bacteria grow? Should I try rinsing my mouth out with salt until I can properly brush my teeth?","Doctor":"Hey. That is perfect you got rid of all your wisdom teeth at once. Now you are facing some temporary postoperative difficulties that will end soon and you will be relieved. It will take most likely a week to open your mouth properly, so it is fine if you cannot brush teeth at back. After a few days, you will be able to do the proper cleaning. Regarding the white scab, it is the dead tissue formed that is not much harmful, it will shred away itself during this phase of healing if you are doing your rinses properly. Take a cup of lukewarm water and add 1/4th teaspoon of salt in it and do its mouth rinses five times a day. It is mandatory for two weeks. If you will skip it then some re-infection in the bone can happen which is very painful. So, it is better to be safe than sorry.

I started to experience pain yesterday where the crown is, and overnight the pain got severe. The crown feels sensitive when I touch it. So I am afraid there is an infection underneath it. My dentist is closed for the weekend. Nothing I do stops the pain. My regular doctor said she would need an X-ray to confirm an infection.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand this would be a very painful condition. If it has started with pain so hard inside the crown then infection has definitely occurred. In such cases, re-treatment is done with a very poor prognosis or tooth extraction is done that rules out the cause of infection with 100 % prognosis rate. Things to do right now include taking Ibuprofen 600 mg TDS (thrice a day, that is, eight hourly for three days). Start saline water mouthrinses 4 to 5 times a day. (Take a cup of lukewarm water and add 1/4th teaspoon of salt in it and do its rinses). Do not lay down straight. It will trigger up a toothache. Keep pillows a bit high or some more cushions under your neck while trying to sleep. If only painkiller Ibuprofen does not help much with pain in a day, then you must start with this antibiotic regime as soon as possible. Tablet Augmentin 625 mg BD (twice a day), tablet Gramex (generic: Metronidazole) 400 mg (twice a day), tablet Ibuprofen 600 mg (thrice a day).

When we give him a pain he is moving his hand and leg, but when we touch him simply, there is no response. What would be the reason? Can we expect him back as he was earlier? He is not speaking anything. The injury was on the right side head and the operation was done on the left side. Would like to know why the operation done on the opposite side? Otherwise, he is passing the urine and motion regularly. I will also attach the scan report. Please look at that and help me on my doubts and provide me the status of him.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query with diligence and would like you to know that I am here to help you. He is in coma. The time to recovery will be longer and we cannot predict that now. As he is in coma, he can only feel the pain and not touch. Also, he will not be able to react much while in coma. While in coma, the patient will be unconscious ans so he cannot speak. Moreover, since the injury is on the left side, the speech areas in the brain may be affected. Some injuries like fracture and EDH (epidural hematoma) occur on the same side. Some like SDH (subdural hematoma) and contusion occur on the opposite side. Since you have mentioned it as SDH and contusion, it would have happened on the opposite side."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from panic disorder. I am currently on Paroxetine CR 12.5. For anxiety, should I use SSRI or 5-HTPn?","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns. Regarding treatment of choice for anxiety, SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) groups of medicines are very effective when compared with 5HTPn (5-Hydroxytryptophan). In fact, according to available literature, SSRI is the drug of choice for anxiety. 5HTPn is useful for mild anxiety and most individuals fail to respond to it. In case there is mild anxiety, you can proceed with behavioral methods of treatment rather than medication. Talk therapies are equally effective in mild anxiety."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My daughter aged 10 years had swallowed button cell accidentally. In the x-ray, it is in the intestine. Will it come out through waste?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern about your daughter's health. Yes, button cell would come with stool generally. But sometimes it get stuck at the junction of the large intestine and small intestine. In such a case, she might require a colonoscopy or surgery to remove the cell. But the possibility for such a scenario is very rare. You should give her a soft, semi-solid diet which is good in digestion and also facilitate intesine movement."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I want to ask about canal root treatment. The tooth is 37. I was on holiday with colossal pain. I visited the dentist, and he immediately started the process. He opened the tooth, and the tooth has four roots. He removed the nerves and everthing. On my second visit, it was a day later, when he wanted to fill the tooth he said that two of the roots are bleeding so he cannot fill them and finish the process. So, I need help your help here. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for the query. In case if the canals are bleeding, then there is a possibility that the dentist is good too deep beyond the root tips causing bleeding or the infection has not yet subsided. So, first of all, your dentist can fill the canals with Calcium hydroxide and leave it for a week. It is an antibacterial and will help in resolving the infection and will ease in filling of the root canals. Along with it, you can also be advised a course of oral antibiotics for fixing the infection. Please send me the scan of your x-ray so that I can have a look and advise you how to proceed further towards most appropriate treatment. Also, please tell that is there any pain present in the tooth on chewing or spontaneously too. Please revert back with answers for further help.

Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.2. Gleason grade 4+4.3. Perineural invasion present. What does the biopsy report say? What will be the next step? What medicine should the patient take at the initial stage before any surgery? The patient is on Tamdura for the prostate issue and Diamicron MR 30 for diabetes.","Doctor":"Hi. I am sorry to know about the problem. The biopsy report says that prostate has a cancer disease. Since PSA is very high, it means that there is a chance that it has spread outside the prostate. The next step will be PSMA PET scan to find out the areas in the body affected by prostate cancer. If this scan is not available, you can get an MRI scan of the abdomen to check local involvement or lymph node involvement along with bone scan to find out bone metastasis. The treatment depends on the stage of disease. If it has spread to bones, then bilateral orchidectomy (removal of testes) is the standard treatment. If the patient does not want orchidectomy, then can get regular injections (once in 3 months) to suppress the testicular function. The patient should also take injection Zoledronic acid once in every 3-4 weeks to control bone spread. Other than these, there is a need for calcium supplements and iron supplements. Please consult the Urologist for regular follow up, since the treatment needs to be modified according to the response of PSA and clinical factors. PSMA PET scan or MRI abdomen with bone scan.

Do you feel any symptoms like fatigue, weakness, or loss of energy? This information is important because only SGPT which is just nearly one and a half times raised cannot tell a diagnosis on its own. To answer your concern that it is harmful? yes it is, but whether it is less harmful or highly harmful, that depends upon the underlying condition. The causes of such raised SGPT are many folds. But of note, viral hepatitis, obesity, alcohol, and autoimmune hepatitis are the top most reasons for asymptomatic elevation. Some drugs have a tendency to cause raised SGPT commonly Paracetamol. Your rest of the urine report is completely normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I want you to tell me about your symptoms and current body weight before I can suggest a target set of investigations. Let me know about yourself in detail, like prior history of hepatitis, family history of hepatitis, prior blood transfusion, any travel history. I also want to know some personal information, like alcohol consumption, marital status, and sexual history.  Recommending your investigation without any information regarding the case is not a cost effective option. I hope you understand my point. Raised SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase). Viral hepatitis. Alcohol hepatitis. NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). Autoimmune hepatitis.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It is not like home glucose monitor will be 10% higher. It can be higher or the same or even lower than laboratory results. In fact, in my observations, I have noticed it be slightly lower than the laboratory test result. What I recommend is calibrate your home glucose monitor with the actual laboratory test report.

It gives me uncomfortable itching around the anal area. I have tried creams, seen a doctor and a colorectal specialist, taken Metamucil and sitz baths. I did pretty much everything, but the problem persists. Some days are better than others, but the problem has never entirely gone away, and I cannot take it anymore. Is there any way that this condition can be cured once and for all? I want my normal life back. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns regarding pruritus ani as I have analyzed each detail that you have provided. I have managed lots of cases with a matching condition and feel that you too will make good use of the information and suggestions. First, please get your stool tests done on three consecutive days. You need to wear loose undergarments made of thin cotton and dry up skin after every bath and whenever there is moisture. Use antibiotic and antifungal creams mixed in equal quantities to take care of any germs inhabiting the area. For now, no steroid creams need to be used. If you are using one, taper that off slowly till you are comfortable without one. It might lead to a temporary increase in discomfort, but it is an absolute requirement. You can have sufficient antiallergics like Levocetirizine once or twice a day to neutralize itching completely. The affected area need not be touched, and for that, the above medication helps a lot plus there is a useful contribution from one's determination too. Deworm your GI system with Albendazole or another suitable agent about which you can get advice from your physician. I am sure the problem can be managed even though it might not be possible to do so in a matter of days. The key to treatment is to let the skin heal, remove any cause of irritation, and break the cycle of itch and scratch, which is bound to have resulted in thickening of the affected skin."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My wife is taking Glycomet GP 2, one in the morning and one before dinner, to control her blood sugar. Now, she has developed arthritis. Is it advisable to take Oasoft two tablets twice daily? Which is the better medicine for RA?","Doctor":"Hello. She has probably osteoarthritis, not RA (rheumatoid arthritis). Oasoft (Glucosamine) is given for osteoarthritis, especially knee. She can take one tablet two times a day. The important is physiotherapy which can be practiced with the help of physiotherapists and weight loss to decrease stress over the joint. Also, she should use hot water fomentation, Diclofenac gel or spray whenever needed for pain. She can also use Capsaicin ointment if Diclofenac is not helpful, which is applied as a thin film two times a day. If the pain is still present, she can also use Tab Naproxen 250 mg whenever needed. So you can get these prescribed, and visit orthopedician for the same.

During these all 8 years I have had several UTIs with some leading to severe kidney infections. Last week after almost two years of not having a UTI I felt the horrible symptoms again. When going to the doctors UTI urine test came back positive. The doctor prescribed me seven days Nitrofurantoin antibiotics which cleared the pain and seemed gone entirely. Unfortunately two days later, the symptoms came back (please note that I had sex with my partner the day before) with burning sensation when urinating and painful when standing with the need to go toilet every 2 to 3 minutes. I went back to the clinic the same day to get it checked and take more antibiotics. But to my surprise, the urine test came back clear for UTI, and my symptoms disappeared. Then the doctor advised me to get tested for Chlamydia as the symptoms can sometimes be mistaken to be UTI. I have been diagnosed with Chlamydia at the beginning of this same relationship and was treated for it. My partner was also tested, but his results came back negative. Is it possible that the treatment that I had for Chlamydia 8 years ago did not clear it entirely and this lead to several UTIs and kidney infections? And also, would the antibiotics for UTI clear Chlamydia? Thank you in advance for your help.","Doctor":"Hi. In UTI, initially, a broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic given and then according to urine culture report, a specific antibiotic prescribed. A certain antibiotic like Azithromycin if prescribed for UTI will be effective against chlamydia as well. For chlamydia, Azithromycin is an effective drug. If chlamydia infection present recently then some irritation, itching, discharge like complaint present and swab culture can be done for that if needed. Frequent intercourse, pelvic hygiene if not maintained, stone in the urinary tract, diabetes mellitus, etc., are some causative factor for recurrent UTI. Maintain pelvic cleanliness especially after intercourse. Wash and clean the pelvic area immediately after intercourse. Consume fruit juice like cranberry juice more. Wear loose undergarments rather than tight underwear. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 24 and having an active sexual life. I have two questions. First I have noticed that my performance is erratic as in there are times when I can last 5-6 minutes and then the very next day it can go to 30-35 minutes. It is different with different partners. Second and more alarming is that I have been experiencing a stinging pain in my scrotum on the left side it usually happens when I stand up while sitting or laying and sometimes while walking. I tried finding the source of the pain by pressing in different regions but could not find one. Also, it happens at the back side of the scrotum. It is limited to the left side and has been increasing with each passing day. I thought of UTI, but my pee does not burn. Can I have some suggestions for my problems? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. If there is any history of injury to scrotum then most likely it is a hematoma or infection post trauma. The pain could occur because of pressure over testis by tight underpants. This sometimes results in a picture similar to an infection. I would advise you to get USG scrotum done. This will rule out any hematoma or infection. A urine analysis should be done to rule out the cause. Please provide the reports for further assistance.

In case her sugars are in control, there is no harm in giving her a little rice. I would recommend you buy a glucometer for her so that you can monitor her sugars at all times. Meet your local doctor, so that he can advise you on how to manage the dosages at the different sugar levels. This would come in handy during fasting as well. Because, in the case when your mother is not eating anything, not even water, that means she will not be able to take her medicines as well. So, you would have to check her sugars during that period and analyze if she can take her medications or not. You would have to understand; she would not be able to eat high-calorie food like the others when you break your fast. However, you can try and reverse her daily cycle in those days, and she can eat her dinner and breakfast and take her medicines accordingly to her sugar levels."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 weeks pregnant with my third child, and I have not felt any movement or had any symptoms of pregnancy.

I did go to the hospital to get it treated. The doctor cut off half of my nail, cleaned and dressed it, and kept re-visiting to get the dressing changed. The doctor said that I could stop re-visiting. And then she told me that the nail would have to be removed again after it grows back fully. But, I am hesitant and kind of rejecting to do so. After a month, the nail is not loose anymore, but the nail seems to be growing outwards, and between the nail and the nail bed, there is a gap (kind of like a hollow gap inside). Should I just wait until the nail fully grows back? Should I cut it? What should I do? I am really worried that it will not grow and it will completely fall off once I start wearing shoes. Please note: I am going on a horse riding and hiking camp the next month. Just in case if it does not grow back by then, what should I do or wear to protect it?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your worry. I think you need to follow your doctor's advice (get the nail removed surgically), as it seems that the nail is detached from its bed. But get the procedure done only by a surgeon or a dermatologist. And get it done as soon as possible, because the earlier you get it done, the more the chances are that your nail will grow back before next month. If the nail has not grown back completely before then, do a good sterile dressing during camping. Hope this helps. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 24 year old female. Suddenly, I am having large floaters in my eyes. Is it possible that it will decrease with time? How long will it take to decrease?","Doctor":"Hi. I reviewed your history.

Hence, this requires evaluation by indirect ophthalmoscopy, to rule out vitreous degenerations. Most of the floaters are caused by vitreous degenerations and may not require treatment. These will resolve over time.

He had two stents ten years back. He has no BP or diabetes. From last 20 days, he is suffering from right index finger sensation like insect biting and then feels depression in right side chest like something release. It is not continuous. It is happening around three to four times a day. What could be the reason?","Doctor":"Hello. Depending upon your description of the problem it seems most likely that your father is having some neurologically related problem regarding the affected area. Most commonly the nerves in the wrist might be the culprit especially a nerve known as a median nerve. There could be a problem associated with nerve impingement at the level of the spine as well. An MRI of cervical spine would help to rule that out. The depression in the right side of the chest needs to be confirmed that it is not related to a cardiac thing. Hence, doing an ECG should rule it out. On other routine evaluation, we need to be sure that his blood pressure and blood sugars are within normal limits. So, please check those out. Hope this helps.

Due to which my skin becomes yellow and show extreme pigmentation of yellow color in sunlight.Please suggest me the treatment. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. As you have mentioned that you ate a lot of fennel seeds a few months ago, then if it had any side effects, it should be at that time not after so many months. The yellow colored pigmentation you are currently talking about may be due low hemoglobin or jaundice. For that, you need to get your blood tests done. For hemoglobin, you can check your Hb, and for jaundice, you can go for a serum bilirubin test. But I advice you to visit a nearby general physician as he will do the clinical examination. In clinical examination, he would check you and will tell you whether you need these test or not, or maybe there is some other reason behind yellow pigmentation. So, visit a doctor at least once so that a clinical examination is performed and you will come to know about the proper cause. Once the cause is known, it would be easier for you to take treatment rather than receiving a generalized treatment. Thank you. After two weeks."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,How having an IUD can potentially change or affect intercourse for a woman? What are the ways a woman's intimate life may change with an IUD such as certain position hurt more, etc., and why? I would like you to touch on the differences between hormonal and non-hormonal IUDs. How they impact intercourse? Also, kindly share some tips to solve IUD-related problems a woman might stumble across during intercourse. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. IUD or intrauterine devices result in effective contraception for long. The IUDs are an active, cheap and safe method of contraception. Most of the IUDs release a small quantity of hormones daily and provide effective contraception. In general presence of IUD does not affect the sex life of female or even male partner. The string attached with IUD lies in the cervix, and this is not a sensitive part, so practically woman doesn't feel the string. The effects on sex life occur because of psychological reasons only. Sometimes, certain positions especially when female is on top results in pain during sex. Even the partner sometimes feel the pain. Missionary position is relatively safer. Hormonal IUD releases a small amount of hormones daily and provides contraception while non-hormonal like Copper-T has copper filament attached which provides contraception. Copper-T feels heavier than hormonal IUDs.Non-hormonal will not cause any hormonal effects so will not affect sex life. First of all, a female should be reassured that the IUD will not cause pain. In most the pain occurs due to psychological reasons. They might feel string sometimes but they should ignore the feeling totally. Caution should be there when female is on top during sex. Thanks. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just recently started urinating blood when I go to the restroom. I have a constant urge to urine and I have no idea why out of the blue this is happening. I am a male, 36 years old, 6â2\\", 190 lbs. I have no medical issues or past history of kidney problems or cancer. Can it be due to STD?","Doctor":"Hi. Painless hematuria must be evaluated thoroughly and some factors must be taken into consideration like smoking, occupational exposure to certain substances, family history of kidney disease or cancer. Do not get scared sometimes it is something simple like urinary tract infection or mild trauma in the urinary tract or mild stone. Please get the following investigations done so that proper treatment can be initiated. Infection, trauma. Urine routine and microscopic examination, abdominal ultrasound, abdominal CT scan."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I have not had a period and have been testing positive for pregnancy. I went to Urgent Care this week and got a blood test. The doctor called me to confirm that I should be 8-10 weeks pregnant. I went to Planned Parenthood for an ultrasound yesterday, and we only saw a gestational sac and nothing else. I had more blood work done, and a doctor called me today to say that my HCG levels are over 32,000 and my pregnancy is not viable. I need to schedule a surgical procedure as this could be a molar pregnancy or a blighted ovum. I feel very, very sick with pregnancy symptoms (nausea, extreme fatigue, breast tenderness, headaches, etc.,). I called back to schedule a D and C, and they said the earliest they could see me would be five days from now. I am worried. Should I go to the hospital immediately?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. The diagnosis of a blighted ovum or molar pregnancy can get easily confirmed on the scan. If in doubt, MRI can confirm the diagnosis. It is not a healthy pregnancy as by 5-6 weeks any pregnancy will be seen and also the cardiac pulsation. So at HCG of 32000, a sac with the fetal heart will be seen. If this is Blighted ovum, it is not an emergency. You can wait for five days and get it removed. But more natural method would be the use of Mifepristone 200 mg two tablets orally and vaginally and after 48 hours have four tablets of Misoprostol 200 mcg. You will bleed and have periods like a regular one. A surgical evacuation will not be needed. But if this is a molar pregnancy, it is like an emergency. As time passes, the beta hCG will raise. Your blood level of hCG will get increased and reduce the hemoglobin level, which will result in giddiness, vomiting, and nausea. You need to arrange the blood donor and have a vacuum evacuation under anesthesia. So I would advise, you should confirm the diagnosis and do the needful. Do not get stressed out; you will be fine. It is not a life-threatening condition."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I woke up this morning to go to school. When I lifted my head and looked right, I heard a big pop and my left side of my neck and upper shoulder are sore. I have been icing and heating it.

After careful analysis of the history provided, I would like to say that you are having a neck strain and probably resulted in torticollis. Having said that, I would like to also mention that it would take time to heal. It is basically a tear in the muscle and few structures around your neck and it would take time to heal, not more than two weeks. Also, it is not dangerous, so do not worry and be patient. As of now, you need to continue with the hot and cold application maneuver. Start applying Diclofenac with Menthol ointment on the area twice daily for five days. Take tablet Diclofenac with Serratiopeptidase twice daily for one week after food, capsule Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily before food for one week, tablet Thiocolchicoside twice daily after food for five days. Follow the above advice and it would fasten the healing and provide quick relief. Do not worry. All the best in your sports event. Hoping it would be a week away.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

How long does it take that to return to normal after blood levels are normal? Currently, I am taking Klonopin and Zoloft for anxiety.","Doctor":"Hi. Once your hormone levels have normalized, your symptoms should resolve too. Five months is too long for your symptoms to linger once your thyroid hormones are within the normal range. We need to look at other causes of the symptoms you are experiencing now like muscle weakness. If your electrolytes are deranged like a low potassium level, this can cause muscle weakness. I understand that you are on Klonopin and Zoloft. Are they for an existing anxiety disorder as this itself can cause muscle weakness along with anxiety? Also, it is advisable to get your thyroid hormones checked again as it has already been five months since last checkup. Let me know if you have other symptoms like dizziness, feeling tired, pigmentation, abdominal pain, etc., as these would need further evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 27-year-old, 5 foot, and relatively an athletic female. I have been suffering from some pretty severe chapped lips. I realized this was common because of the cold weather and dry heat from the furnace, so I was treating them with a two-step process with intensive lip moistener. About a month ago, I realized my lips started to feel different. It feels like there is just a very thin layer of skin on them. They feel odd or numb when I touch them, and they are extremely chapped. After looking online, I put Aquaphor during the day and Hydrocortisone cream at night. I stopped that last week because my lips seem worse. They are not peeling at all, but they look cracked and get very dry. They also throb throughout the entire day and are swollen. Nothing has helped, and I am starting to get concerned. I worry that I possibly over-treated and burnt the first layer of skin of my lips (if that is possible). I started running around the time my lips got chapped but I have taken a week off, and nothing changed with my lips. My diet has not changed. I try to stay hydrated (I drink around 50-60 ounces per day). I am on 10 mg Adderal once daily. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Chapped or cracked lips is usually a common complaint in winters. From your clinical image (attachment removed to protect patient identity), your lip cracking does appear significant. Applying Vaseline and moisturizer are good remedy options. But given recurrences, you need to consider food allergies and repeated lip licking. Kindly mention if you have a habit repeated lip licking, have been noting an exacerbation following intake of certain foods, and if you have been applying any other creams. Continue Vaseline and intensive moisturiser as previous."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 26, male and height 163 cm and weight 82 kg. I am suffering with small lump like peanut size and smooth in nature outside of the anus and it is paining and bleeding while passing the stool from the last 10 days. Earlier I did not have that lump and pain or bleeding. Could you please suggest some medication or treatment plan?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, I would like to assure you that you do not have to worry because there is always a solution to your problem. Having said that, I would like to let you know that, it is very important for a doctor to have the area inspected and examined before reaching a conclusion, as you have mentioned presence of a lump. Therefore, you need to consult a surgeon in person and allow him to examine. Do not feel uneasy or worry about it at all. As of now, use Smuth ointment at the anal region. It helps in counteracting the pain and discomfort. Do a sitz bath twice daily. Sitz bath needs filling up of a tub with warm water and mixing in some salt in the water. You need to sit in the water for about 10 minutes twice daily. These would help ease the pain and fight your problem. Again, I would like to remind you to see a surgeon in person for inspection and treatment. Stay healthy and positive."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have had a sore throat for eight days. I have tried over the counter throat drops, throat sprays but nothing has worked. Is there anything else I can do and is it just a sore throat?","Doctor":"Hi. Most of the times, a sore throat is due to a viral infection. This occurs with or without some amount of acid reflux into the throat from within the food pipe. This condition is called Laryngopharyngeal Reflux Disease (LPRD) and this may present simply with a sore throat and without any other symptoms of gastritis.  I would, therefore, recommend antiseptic mouth gargles with Chlorhexidine or dilute Betadine, three times a day before and after meals along with a good proton pump inhibitor such as tablet Esomeprazole 40 mg once in the morning 15 minutes before meals for one week. I would also advise taking an anti-inflammatory medication such as Ibuprofen or Paracetamol once daily for three days after breakfast, to reduce the throat pain.  In my opinion, your sore throat should subside in three to five days. If it worsens or you develop fever, then an antibiotic may be necessary for which you can consult an ENT otolaryngologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am worried that I may have leukemia.

Acute leukemia usually has bleeding manifestations while chronic leukemia rarely has bleeding manifestations. Chronic leukemia is usually seen above 40 years and acute leukemia below 40 years. Chronic leukemia could have multiple lymph nodes enlargement and also spleen enlargement. Look at the total WBC count and also for the presence of immature forms or blast cells.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Anyways, are there other reasons as to why people believe that you are gay like mannerisms, type of clothes you wear, etc. Sometimes, one's own suppressed homosexuality is also projected onto others, and hence people who have such repressed feelings feel that others view them as gay. It might be that you have no such homosexual component in your behavior, but still, people view you as such. In that case, I would suggest you be confident of your heterosexuality and let people have their opinion. Be strong and face others. Do not be intimidated by what others feel and say.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have consulted a cardiologist at a hospital. I have undergone TMT, 2D echo, and ECG. The doctor prescribed Modlip ASG 75. I am diabetic for past 12 years with good control (HbA1c is below 6 for past 8 years). I am 5 feet 6 inches tall. I was 68 kg 12 years back, and I am 54 kg now. My serum cholesterol is 107, triglycerides is 44, HDL cholesterol is 44, and LDL cholesterol is 54.I had ulcers in the intestine. My chest congestion cleared after 10 days of Modlip ASG 75. I have developed backache (just at the back of the heart). I have never experienced backache in that area. It develops and increases with physical or mental strain. Is it due to the side effect of Statin or problem with my heart? Is it safe to use Aspirin with Statins, as I am underweight and have ulcers? The doctor advised me to take Modlip ASG lifelong. Is angiogram required in my case or will any cardiac MRI show actual condition?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Echo and TMT (Treadmill test) are normal. Your backache is not due to a heart problem. You can stop Aspirin and continue Statin. I suggest doing periodical Echo and treadmill test once a year. At present, an angiogram is not needed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 20 year old girl. Last month on 22nd, I had protected sex. And on 28th, I got two or three drops of bleeding, and it was my date of periods. After that, I did not get any periods. Am I pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. From what you have said, it looks like you are not ready for a pregnancy. As the bleeding on 28th was not like a normal period, pregnancy chance is very much possible. It may just be a delayed period, due to the stress and tension you are having. But we need to check. Please have a home pregnancy test or a urine pregnancy test. If the test is positive, we need to deal with the unplanned pregnancy. If the test is negative, then we can give you medicines to induce periods. You may also need tests to check why there is a delay in periods, in spite of not being pregnant. Hope this helps, Take care!"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, What are the everyday habits that could affect our teeth? I want to get some insight on how certain practices such as smoking, biting nail, opening things with the mouth, etc., affect the teeth.","Doctor":"Hi. Smoking adversely affects the gum health as the gum disease becomes less apparent in smokers and they show symptoms once the condition becomes severe. Secondly, it can cause pigmentation leading to smoker's melanosis (brown to black pigmentation of gums). Other ill effects can be oral and lung cancer. Opening things using teeth can make them attested gradually by making them sensitive and more prone to decay and fracture. Holding needles and pins in between teeth can cause notching of teeth which disturb the appearance as well as cause sensitivity of teeth. Tobacco chewing habit can cause teeth staining, per cancerous conditions like leukoplakia, oral submucous fibrosis, and even the deadly oral cancer. High sugar intake can cause an increased incidence of tooth decay."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 29 years old. My problem dates back a few years from now. If I am working sometimes I do not get to eat anything maybe have a cup of tea while working. Then I start feeling quite dizzy. I get water and it is still there for quite a while. It goes for 10 minutes or so after eating. ECG and echo, thyroid, BP are normal. Fasting glucose is 5.6. What is this and how can I stop it?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, I would like to reassure you that, there is nothing to worry about. Secondly, the reason for your current trouble is pretty much explained in your history itself. No matter how hard your job is and the pattern of your work goes, it is mandatory to ensure a proper diet. By diet, I mean, you need to do the following. Make sure you drink enough water daily, at least 8 to 9 glasses of water a day. You need to make sure you have food every four hours. Again, I would like to repeat, regardless of the kind of work you have, keeping healthy is very important. As you have not mentioned your height and weight, I am assuming you are within the normal BMI range. You need to make sure each time you eat, each meal should be inclusive of a protein source, a carbohydrate and a fat source, like for breakfast, whole wheat bread, egg, vegetables, and just a teaspoon of peanut butter or tahini. Include fruits in your desserts after dinner. In the morning hours, soon as you wake up, it is normal to have a low glucose in blood that makes you go dizzy if not compensated well. Therefore, it is important to not skip breakfast. I would recommend making it a little snack instead of a breakfast within the first hour of waking up, like a whole banana, followed by a proper breakfast later in the day. This would ensure normalization of blood glucose level in the morning hours. Before having anything in the morning hours, the minute you wake up, you should make it a habit of having at least 2 glasses of water, with or without lemon in it. It acts as a detox helping flush out the toxic metabolites from your body. It is okay to have tea or coffee along the day. But make sure, you also include a lot of plain water too apart from the beverages. Keep yourself active in the day, through yoga, hiking or workouts or any other physical activity. It helps keep you alert and stimulate blood circulation to fight any dizziness. Having said that, I would like to say that you are fine, just make these changes in your diet and you would be good to go. Stay healthy, happy and positive."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, When I was 13 or 14 years old, I was diagnosed with SVT (supraventricular tachycardia). During initial days, it would last several minutes, and by the age 15, it was down to a few seconds (10-15). I saw a cardiologist, and he said that for the age 15 the SVT was so irregular. Also, he stated that I do not have to go for checkups anymore unless something happened again. I am now 17 (female). I have never taken any medications. I have only had palpitations, recently. When I stand up, my heart rate seems to go straight up causing me to get lightheaded for a few seconds, and make me feel a bit out of breath. Recently while playing skirmish outdoors, I was running around for about 30 to 40 minutes. We decided to have a short break, and as I was walking, I noticed my heart was going so fast I could not even count and could not catch my breath at all. I tried deep breaths and still could not breathe. Then, suddenly everything started turning black, and I could barely see. I had to hold onto a bin, and I was sure I was going to faint any second. My heart still racing and I barely walked to a chair. It took about 20 minutes for my heart to slow down. For the rest of the day and the following two days, I felt weak. I felt as if my heart rate was higher than usual, and thumping in my chest. Should I have gotten help at the time? What are SVT emergency symptoms? When should I seek medical advice?","Doctor":"Hello. The episode that you described is probably an SVT episode. The warning signs are the same which you had such as sudden palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath and chest pain, and lastly, it can lead to syncope. However, these are not directly life-threatening. This can be an SVT like PSV (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia) or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. Blood pressure falls during these episodes, and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually, ECG is normal as it is generally done in between the events. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24-hour Holter monitoring which will correlate your symptoms with heart rate and rhythm. To abort such incidents, you should try to cough hard. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tablet Metoprolol or Ciplar LA 20 mg (Propranolol) once a day. Another option is of electrophysiological study which is an invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am asking a question regarding my daughter who is 3 and 1/2. She was seen by her dentist a few months back. They performed a cleaning and also put sealant on her molars, as they have deep grooves. I just recently noticed a few dark spots in her molars, but I am wondering if that is due to the deep grooves. Everything looked good, the dentist said a month ago, so I am quite alarmed if she has a cavity in that short amount of time. May I please provide you with a picture?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, your daughter has deeply grooved teeth (attachment removed to protect patient identity). By book, its treatment is in the following steps. Cleaning, that your dentist did perfectly as there are no residues of plaque or tartar at tooth surfaces. Deep fissure sealants, that is done to seal any carious activity if could occur in deep grooves. It is also done by your dentist. After the sealant treatment if any dark spots mean carious activity is seen it means that through micro cracks bacteria has traveled inside the enamel causing carious activity to start. Now, this is treated with fillings. It does not happen in a day or two, it takes like six months to cause slight decay in the tooth. In your daughter's case, this activity might have appeared after a few months. Now your dentist will check if there is a catch in these black spots (carious cavity), then fillings will be done. Sometimes, there is no catch in these black spots, means carious activity is arrested and not propagating inside the tooth and they are not harmful to teeth and can be left untreated or just sealants are done to arrest them. If the black spots are becoming more evident, propagating to inside layers of teeth (harmful) and now some ditch or catch is formed in those grooves it definitely needs filling."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 23 years old, male, 5'5\\" and around 53 kg in weight. My problem is that I do not have steady hands and cannot hold my phone steady. I smoke and drink few times in a week and I was talking to my family doctor for all this and they took all types of blood test and thyroid tests. The reports were good but still I have the problem and right now I am not in my hometown and I want a solution for all this. I need help.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, I would like to assure you that it is not a serious problem. So you do not need to worry. Secondly, as you have mentioned all the result being perfectly normal, it is just a fluctuation in the blood pressure that is causing these symptoms. Your blood pressure would be okay under normal circumstances but would fluctuate at the time of emotional stress, smoking or drinking. As of now, you need to check your blood pressure and undergo an ECG test just to ensure it is good to go. You need to drink at least 8 to 9 glasses of water a day as the unsteady hands also is a result of reduced electrolytes and fluid content in the body. Have a normal and good diet where you eat meals including a carbohydrate, protein, and fat in each meal which should be four hours apart. Do cardio and yoga at least twice a week. You need to avoid drinking, smoking and hot beverages like tea and coffee for a long time until you are symptom-free. Do not worry, follow the above and you would be alright.

I went to pee just now and saw the color is a bit reddish brown. And one week before fever, I had a few mosquito bites which are itchy on both the legs.","Doctor":"Hi. It could be a viral fever followed by acute glomerulonephritis if there is blood in urine, judging from the reddish brown urine you mentioned. Or it could be a urinary tract infection. In both cases, you must get a urine routine and microscopic examination plus a complete blood count test done initially. If you have other symptoms like abdominal pain, vomiting, etc, you must let me know. For now stay hydrated and get the tests done as soon as possible. If you continue to pass blood with urine, you need to go to the ER."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to ask you about the problem of the decline of the gums. Is there an effective treatment?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, there are following treatment options for your case. Scaling of all teeth and then follow medications. You should get mild scaling treatment for teeth and then start using Chlorhexadine gluconate mouthwash for two weeks twice a day. Do saline water mouthrinses (take a cup of lukewarm water and add 1/4th teaspoon of salt in it) once a day before you sleep for two weeks or start using mouthwash and doing mouthrinses without scaling but it will delay the healing of gums. I would recommend you first option as in your case I can see in anterior teeth gums are receding (attachment removed to protect patient identity). After scaling, the dead tissue of gums get shredded away and new healthy gums come over after 14 days and receding is stopped right there. Do give me followup after two weeks. Stay happy and blessed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am unable to have a BM, it has been almost 10 days. I have no abdominal pain. I am also passing gas. I have been eating a lot of fiber.","Doctor":"Hi. I am afraid 10 days is too long to go without a bowel movement. I understand that you usually go every couple of days but if it has been that long, you may need to take some measures. Firstly, you need to drink plenty of water and eat whole grain stuff, bulk-forming food, in addition to the fibers for roughage and water for maintaining a soft consistency. If you are not having any abdominal pain yet, chances are you may have it soon unless you clear the bowel soon. You can try glycerin suppository after a heavy meal which includes the things mentioned above and then uses a glycerin suppository. Have you been skipping meals or not eating enough? Have you been anxious or depressed lately? As these things could contribute to chronic constipation like your case. If you still do not get a bowel movement or if there is a pain, you may need to go to the hospital where they may give you an enema wash."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, This patient is complaining of prolonged chest pain for three weeks now.

The angiogram report showed mid LAD 12 mm length and segment eccentric calcification. Soft plaque in LAD causing 50% stenosis.Â What is the recommended course of action?","Doctor":"Hi. I appreciate your concerns and can well realize the sensitivity of the issues. There is considerable calcification of LAD (left anterior descending artery). If it reaches up to 75% that is quite possible in the near future, then complications and consequences can be severe. In case of single artery involvement in coronary artery disease (CAD) it is best to have an angioplasty of the vessel with stent placement.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Her Hb levels never in life had gone above 10. At the start of pregnancy, it was 8.5 but now it has touched 7.7. We did serum ferritin test and her level was 50 (normal) which I guess means no iron deficiency. She is a beta thalassemia minor as per the detailed reports. Can you please guide here? Our gynecologist would be consulting a hematologist today but if we can get an opinion here it would be great.","Doctor":"Hi. Thalassemia minor is hemoglobinopathy and so hemoglobin level can never be above 12 in such patient. In pregnancy, plasma is increased and so hemodilution can lead to more fall in hemoglobin level in CBC. Orofer XT like Iron tablet can be prescribed for such case. It would be great if the Hb level remains around 9 or 10 during pregnancy. The Iron infusion can be given in second or third trimester of pregnancy only if needed.

The amount of food eaten would vary from child to child. Decreased intake, fussy child, and worm infestation are commonest causes for decreased weight gain. It is important that you start experimenting with a variety of food in your baby's diet. These will provide the calories, proteins, vitamins, and minerals that are essential for her growth.

It does not offer any ongoing protection. In your case, it should work well up to 99%. The symptoms you have described are due to the hormone progesterone. This can happen just before periods, it can also happen in early pregnancy. Please do a urine test for pregnancy, a week after the missed period, if you do not get your periods on time. MAP pill itself can delay your period. Hope this helps, take care. Please do not hesitate to ask further queries to an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

She started it out very gently and it is getting worse. Last weekend she was coughing almost non-stop. I took her to a Walk-in clinic and they gave her a cough syrup and an antibiotic. I was told to start the antibiotic four days later if she does not get better. I have started the antibiotics after six days. But, she was getting weaker and coughing with choking. I took her back to the doctor. They told me that she might have whooping cough. I was not entirely surprised as she had hypoxia at birth and she did not get that one vaccine: the pertussis. She only got DT. From chest x-ray, we came to know that she had pneumonia too. But, not on both lungs and the x-ray was not entirely white, so it was a smaller pneumonia. By that time we were on day three of the antibiotics. They made a sample test from the nose for whooping cough. I was told that even if she has it the results might come back negative as she took Azithromycin.Â We were told to wait and see after the antibiotic. The result came back negative. The same night her cough got so bad that she was not getting any air. She was coughing without being able to breathe. She was vomiting and a tone of white long, phlegm or mucus came out with the vomiting. It was white, sticky and lots of it. In the emergency room they turned out that she had bronchospasm. They treated her with Albuterol and steroids. She was put on Albuterol for two hours there, then we came home with an inhaler. She has been using that three to four times a day ever since then. She has been very weak. They checked her again for whooping cough and that too came back negative. She took the second dose of Prednisone three pills. She felt better and was so happy. But, the next day she did not feel that good. Today, she had more coughs and it is a second sound behind the usual cough sound. This second one is like the laryngitis cough, but not barking sound.

I am not able to walk as usual. The local doctor diagnosed it as a ligament tear. He suggested to take rest and wear a knee pad. One month is over, and there is no improvement seen yet.

You have not mentioned your age, profession, and how you developed the pain (like after a slip or after a fall or just by itself). When you have a limp that has not settled over one month and you do not have balance when you walk then it is not normal. You have to be personally examined, and if necessary, an MRI scan of the knee has to be done. You could have a problem in the meniscus (a washer-like structure between the bones) or the ACL, PCL, PLC, etc. (ligaments or cords that connect the two bones). These are best seen only on an MRI.

What are the procedures followed for valve replacement? Is there any consequence after the surgery? Can he lead a normal life after surgery? Which valve do we need to choose irrespective of cost? How many days does he need bed rest? My father has high BP, and always it ranges around 170/80.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for writing in to us. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. The valve replacement surgery is usually done using open heart surgery technique, and the surgeon connects the blood vessels to a heart-lung machine and then stops the heart. After this step, an incision is made into the aorta and using careful precision the aortic valve will get replaced. This operation is 98 percent successful. For people less than 65 years, the valve implanted is a mechanical valve, and this is because a mechanical valve will work for many years. In patients older than 65 years, a biological valve is used. He can lead a near normal healthy life. He has to follow up with his doctor regularly and be on medications for a long time. He will be in the hospital for a week and should not be on bed rest. Only thing is he must avoid physical exertion after surgery and take strict precautions for three months after surgery. The blood pressure will get controlled with medicines and doctors make it a point that operation is not risky due to that. Regular medication has to be taken and should get echocardiography as instructed by the surgeon and cardiologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to ask you that, can I have braces because five years back I had teeth whitening due to which I have many cracks in my teeth. So can I put braces or will it worsen it?","Doctor":"Hi. I want to answer your question in two parts. Firstly, I would like to give an honest opinion about your question that is will the braces further create more cracks in your original teeth? So answer is yes if you will go for conventional orthodontic treatment (in which manually metal brackets are put on teeth) and I would say no if you will go for invisible aligner type orthodontic treatment (in it only invisible tray is given to wear, no bracketing is involved). Secondly, I would like to give my suggestion regarding your case. I would suggest going for ortho treatment inspite of the fact your tooth enamel is weaken. If your teeth are severly malaligned, crowded or you have any difficulty in eating, air passage, etc., like there is a genuine cause that needs to be corrected through ortho braces because you are 20 and it is an ideal age for treatment. More you delay, more it will become difficult for teeth to move. Treatment will take more time as age grows older like one year treatment at 20 might take two and a half year time at age 30. If there is no severe ortho issue and you want braces just for a cosmetic reason then I would suggest you to avoid ortho treatment. If you opt for doing ortho braces treatment then your enamel might get weakened due to bracketing but later you can get it fixed by veneering procedure. It will look fine later. Hopefully, you will be able to decide well now about what treatment you should go for. I might give a better opinion after seeing picture of your teeth."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I got married a few months back. I have yellowish-white, odorless discharge. It leaves stain and itches quite a bit. I noticed something weird, and after intercourse, my husband could see something similar around his genitals. And that is itchy too. I tried using Abzorb antifungal powder, but no help from that. We are not in our country right now and so cannot get access to most medicines. How to cure my discharge? Before marriage too, I have experienced something similar. I had treatment for that, but do not have that prescription now. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. From your history, this is a genital infection. This is not the same that occurs before sexual exposure, as that is not yellow or itchy. These two feature makes infection as the source. It is usually seen as a genital or urinary infection in males, which is not always very evident. When there is a trigger like sex, it appears. As you do not have access to medications, I can only suggest you both to have a lot of water to wash away the infections in the bladder as usually both genitals and bladder get infected together. Use Vaginal washes (V Wash or Intiwash) twice a day and after every penetration into the vagina. Your husband also can use the same. These are not chemicals, and so there is no side effect. Both of you should pass urine after sex, as this will wash out infection in the bladder. If you can get some vaginal suppository of antibiotic plus antifungal, then use it for five to seven days vaginal at night. It is cruel to say to a newlywed couple, but if you can postpone penetrative sex for a few days, the problem will be solved or at least use a condom. It will prevent infection transmission. Vaginal infection is transmitted during sex, so partner is the source. Both have to be treated at a time, or else you will get infected the next time of sex. You may have white or yellow or grayish discharge with or without itching, foul smell, pain at beginning of sex due to dryness (as the lubrication will be reduced) and late towards the end, when fully erect penis touches the innermost vagina (due to inflammation of the structures around the uterus) and pain radiating to the back or thighs. Associated to infection, the bowel movement is affected, and also features of gastritis will be present. Bleeding of periods will be thicker, darker, may smell bad and more days with spotting after the periods too. Pain is throbbing even before periods and last after periods over also. Before treatment confirm that you are not pregnant. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and you both take the treatment mentioned below with consent. All these should be taken on the same day by both of you. Later you have capsule Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for one week, Vaginal wash with V-wash or similar cleanser twice a day and vaginal pessary Clingen forte or Candid-CL or Cansoft CL once at night for five nights. Your partner can have a local application of antibiotic and antifungal cream (Candid B or Candiderma or Lobate GM) on the penis twice a day after wash for seven days. Do not have sex till the infection is entirely gone. Do treat it as delay may send the infection inwards and may affect both you and your partner's future fertility. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions. All the best."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I need help reading the results of my echo a few months back.

During the eruption time, there are some inflammation and redness in gum pad known as pericoronitis. If the orientation of the tooth is not in a proper path, the dentist decides to extract it. This is a universally accepted method because there is no sufficient space in the jaw for the tooth to come out. If the tooth was left as it is, it can cause more problems in the future. So I suggest you go for extraction. This is the best way to cure your problem, do not be panic because the whole procedure will be performed under local anesthesia."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 32. I have PCOS for past seven years.

I feel sorry for the dullness and tiredness you feel. It is really troublesome for a patient at this early age.

You have a very high body mass index that makes the heart issues justified even at this young age.  2. Your ideal weight for this age and height must be between 60 kg and 65 kg. Above 65 kg means a very high risk.  3. You need to keep a balanced diet intake, physical activity on a regular and healthy pace. Do not go for any heroic measures or faster weight loss measures that may even make you more unhealthy.  4. Your laboratory reports, which are out of range, will be discussed here in detail as you need to know about them. Please follow the suggestions so that you may live a long healthier life.  5. Avoid smoking, alcohol, spices and fried foods, junks and energy drinks. Only a bland diet, homemade and good hygienic. No refined foods. Keep wholegrain foods in your scheduled menu.  6. You have a high level of cardiac marker that shows a risk to the heart due to its own blood supply. In simple words, the pipes which supply blood to the heart's own muscles are somewhat at a high risk of blockage due to the disease inside them. This situation may lead to future heart attacks or pain and discomfort in the chest.  7. Your symptoms also suggest the heart disease related to the muscle's blood supply. This kind of symptoms warrants a prompt, thorough evaluation of the heart from a cardiologist who will need to run a specific laboratory tests on you to see what is happening inside.  8. The cardiac evaluation is also necessary, because sometimes there is not any cardiac disease and the values of the above said test that the hs-CRP is still high. And sometimes, the symptoms you have right now are also due to anxiety and other non-cardiac causes. So, clinical evaluation is the most important next step. Make an appointment as soon as possible to see how is your heart.  9. Fortunately, as for many other tests, your blood cholesterol levels are also very much in the normal range and this is very encouraging sign for your good health. Please keep away from oily edibles and remain physically active.  10. You have high levels of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme that is high in liver damage and disease related to the biliary system that is attached to the liver. You also have high liver enzymes that once again indicate you have some liver problems, for example hepatitis or other issues. You need to go for a thorough abdominal ultrasound and viral marker test from the same laboratory test for this purpose.  11. Other test derangements also implicate the same liver issues. When you get the laboratory results I mentioned below, come back with uploading the results as you did before. I will review and let you know how to proceed further. 1. HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) and anti HCV (hepatitis C virus), both by ELISA - enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 2. Abdominal ultrasound.

The pain if persists after 3 to 4 days can be due to many reasons including some infections also. It may be due to the large unhealed wound because the third molar generally requires a surgical intervention or it may be because of a dry socket (but that is highly unlikely as you mentioned you have followed the instructions properly, but it cannot be ruled out completely). I would like you to have a visit to the same dentist for the said tooth socket in order to rule out ay other cause. I would also advise you to follow the same instructions given by the dentist after the teeth removal for the coming five days again. Maintain good oral hygiene and avoid touching the injury site with finger or tongue."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I took a CBC test a few days back. Is everything normal? My eosinophil count has increased from 3 to 6 and I am worried as the normal range is 1 to 6. Can you please get back to me on this and if it is fine? Absolute is slightly high but within range. Please let me know if everything is alright.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your complete blood count report and understood your query regarding about eosinophilia (attachment removed to protect patient identity). First of all your reports are normal and counts are also normal, no need to worry regarding this. Your absolute eosinophils count 480 is within the normal range, and of course, in percent form, it is higher normal levels up to 6 %. If we will talk about eosinophilia if more than 500 cells divide into three categories of mild, moderate and severe. It is called eosinophilic syndrome when it is more than 1500 cell for more than six months. If we talk common cause is a simple parasitic infection, any allergy like rhinitis or skin eczema, up to blood malignancy. So you do not have to worry as you said your eosinophils count has increased from 3 to 6 % until you have any symptoms like rashes, pruritis, breathing difficulties, diarrhea, arthralgia. Repeat your absolute eosinophils count after three months, or if you have any symptoms above, then contact me. Otherwise, it is not significant."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have my wife's blood test report. We fear that she might have blood cancer. For the last four months, she is having joint pain, sudden breath difficulty, hand pain, and chest pain. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. As per the report, only apparent problem is that she has mild anemia, microcytic hypochromic (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Usually common in young females. Otherwise, platelets and WBC are normal. Does she have any other symptoms like fever or bleeding? Also, why are you thinking of cancer? To be sure you can repeat CBC with a peripheral smear. If needed, serum iron studies can be done to confirm iron deficiency anemia."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 38 years old and a little obese. I have noticed two or three cherry color spots on my chest and back. Are they something to be worried about? I hope it is not a sign of some serious disease. Secondly, I am experiencing some generalized itching on my body. Last year same time of the year, I felt the same. Is it due to winter and dry skin? I am putting coconut oil and it gets better and also having Allegra 180.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case. These red spots are called cherry angioma and these are nothing to worry. They are just like black moles which normally do occur on our skin. These are due to swelling of the blood vessel. In winter we take bath with hot water which makes our skin more dry by evaporating water from our skin. Heaters do the same. As a result, the skin becomes drier. Use mild to moderate hot water, coconut oil or liquid paraffin both are fine. Or mix one teaspoon of Betamethasone lotion with two tablespoons of olive oil and apply two times a day for five days only. Take Allegra for five days only. However, if other family members are also having an itch then it is not due to winter issue."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have anxiety for the last five months. Recently, I had an echocardiogram, it says grade 1 diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with E/A ratio 0.7. Rest other parameters of the echo are fine. Sometimes my diastolic BP goes to 90 due to anxiety. Can you please tell what is this dysfunction? Will it cause future issues and will it go away if I get rid of my anxiety and BP? My ECG is found to be normal.","Doctor":"Hello. Diastolic dysfunction in the echo is, in fact, abnormal function of the left ventricle during relaxation phase that is diastole (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It occurs when left ventricle muscle is hypertrophied due to increased blood pressure. Grade 1 is the initial phase, but do not worry it is reversible. Control blood pressure and it will be fine within a few months. No need to repeat echo but controlling BP is essential. According to the latest guidelines, optimal BP is <120/<80 mmHg. To reduce BP avoid anxiety, avoid smoking (if you smoke), avoid alcohol or any other form of addiction (if you are addicted), reduce salt intake in the diet, avoid junk foods, oily foods, ghee, etc. Do regular exercise, maintain a healthy weight."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been experiencing acid problems.

I have been taking it for three days, once daily but I experience side effects such as muscle weakness, headache, and shortness of breath. How long should I take the medicine? And can I switch to Esomeprazole?","Doctor":"Hello. I will definitely help you with your problem. Burping after eating is a very common problem. It is known as gastroesophageal reflux disease. I will suggest you some precautions to prevent it. Eat less quantity of food every time than before. You may eat five to six times a day but with lesser quantity. There should be a gap of two hours in the night after eating and go to bed. Walking for sometimes is a must after every eating. Avoid spicy and fatty foods as much as possible. You may switch to Esomeprazole it is more effective. Also add one more drug Levosulpiride for 15 days. You should take syrup Sucralfate two tablespoons three times a day. It will help to heal ulcers and for fast recovery. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 22 year old male. I do not have an eyebrow.

It feels a little swollen and a little pain in my lower back above the right hip. I can feel the pain more when taking a breath. My lower back feels like it is burning. Give me any advice.","Doctor":"Hi. I have studied your case. As per your history, there can be hip arthritis which can be degenerative or due to avascular necrosis of femoral head (AVN). I will advise you to take an x-ray of hip again and you can consult me with the reports or with your doctor. After clinical examination, if AVN (avascular necrosis) is suspected, then you will need MRI. Till that time, you can take analgesic and cartilage protecting medication like Glucosamine sulfate. For hip arthritis, joint flexion, extension and rotation exercises will help. If required intra-articular injection can be given. Diet rich in calcium and protein will help. If the pain is in pelvis then, ultrasonography or MRI spine may be required. Hope this answers your query.

The side effects of Depakote (Sodium valproate) on the liver are quite common and well known. It does cause an increase in liver enzymes level and symptoms like weakness, lethargy, jaundice (yellowing of skin and sclera), loss of appetite - all due to its effect on the liver. But, there is no role of any liver supplements to prevent Depakote-induced liver dysfunction. What you can do is get liver function tests (LFT) done regularly and check for an increase in liver enzymes. Only if the value is at least three times the normal, the medication can be stopped. For a detailed reply, kindly give more details regarding your illness as well as the current medications. Consult a general practitioner online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I need advice. I am thinking of studying medicine in Bulgaria. I failed twice in my first-year pharmacy degree UK. I think I have a weak memory. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, I like to extend my best wishes for medicine in Bulgaria, as this is the only profession in the world which pays you both respect and money albeit it requires very hard work. As you have mentioned in your narration that you failed twice in your pharmacy exams, I like to tell you that memory is not the only reason for failing in anything, say academics, sports, business and so on. Other than memory, it could be your disinterest, change of plan, your engagement in other activities, substance abuse, not keeping good health, etc. With such a brief description, it is very hard to tell you about your memory, but I assume that if you secured pharmacy, that indicates you are not the weak memory kind of guy. I suggest to have an assessment of your caliber and plan accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am pregnant, and my entire body is itching. What could be the reason? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. If there is itching alone (especially involving palms and soles) without any skin rashes, it could be a condition called obstetric cholestasis. In obstetric cholestasis, the liver is unable to send out the waste product called bile acids, and they accumulate in the blood and get deposited in the skin leading to itching. This can be picked up by a simple blood test. It can affect the baby if the levels are too high. We generally deliver the baby by 37 weeks to avoid this. You will need other tests to check for liver function, hepatitis virus, etc. And we need to monitor the baby through scans, CTG (cardiotocography), etc."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

The part that came off was very thin but I am worried my tooth could become more sensitive and more could break off so I would really like to fix this in some way. What is the best way to go about this?","Doctor":"Hi. The sensitivity is because of the exposure of the second layer of the tooth (dentin). It can be easily cured by using anti-sensitive toothpastes. Replace this toothpaste for night brushing and you will find best results in two weeks. You have also mentioned that the edges of the broken tooth is sharp and hurts you.

The change that we normally expect to see in you would be more on the minus side that is to say that your power must naturally progress to more on the minus side than becoming less. We see these changes occurring due to a process called nuclear sclerosis, which is part of the normal aging process of the lens inside your eye. Since the power has become lesser, this change cannot be simply ignored as due to aging and your doctor must be suspecting a cause for which he has asked for laboratory work.

Their immaturities often increase frustration and provoke anger but you need to understand they are too small to understand anything. You need to learn effective ways to tackle your child. There are counseling sessions on parenting which could be taken.

Besides it being annoying am not in any pain.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. The loosened portion of the tooth should be the filling done in the tooth after the root canals are filled.This is called the core material. Because the tooth is exposed for a quite long period of time, there is microleakage in the filling which made it loose now. Please do not attempt to remove it because you might end up leaving a big hole in the tooth. This will further clog the food particles that you munch. There will not be 100 % pain since the tooth is root canal treated (equivalent to dead tooth). But leaving the tooth unprotected will lead to damage of the tooth further and the root canal treatment would fail. I request you to visit your dentist and get the tooth refilled and if financial conditions suit you go for the cap fabrication once again. This will help you save your tooth for another decade. The cap fabricating materials have improvised nowadays that they can be really strong to protect the underlying tooth structure. Example: Zirconia crowns. X-ray to check the status of the RC treated tooth. Re-restoration of the core followed by crown fabrication ."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 24 years old, male. I had LASIK one year before and now I feel dryness in my eyes. I use refresh tears but do not feel it effective. Please prescribe me any medicine so that my eyes does not remain dry.","Doctor":"Hi. Dry eye post LASIK is quiet bothersome, here are a few things you can try. Refresh liquigel- This has twice the concentration of the drug as in refresh tears. You can use it upto 6 to 8 times a day. Some patients do report transient blurring with this medication which goes away in a few minutes. Hot fomentation is quiet useful in a majority of cases- Wrap your hands around a hot coffee mug making your palms warm, close your eyelids and give this warmth to your eyelids by pressing your palm against your eyelids or the traditional way is to soak a clean cloth in water that is comfortably hot, squeezing out all the water from the cloth and then pressing the hot cloth to your closed eyelids atleast for 10 minutes, twice a day. Clean your eyelashes and eyelids with cotton buds soaked in baby shampoo. Try to keep the area around your eyes and your eyelids as clean as possible. I feel you should improve with these."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am in my mid-cycle. There is a pretty good amount of bleeding and cramping. There is also some bloating. I have missed only one birth control pill. This has happened only when I have missed about 3 pills. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Normally when you miss your contraceptive pill, it may lead to withdrawal bleeding because of hormonal effect of the pill on the endometrium which suddenly withdraws. You should consult a gynecologist online and start taking the pills again based on her suggestion."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am hypertensive from the past 2 years. I forgot to take the morning dose of my antihypertensive pill, tablet Teleact. Can I take it now?","Doctor":"Hi. Take the dose immediately whenever you remember that you forgot to take the morning dose. This approach is better than not taking the dose at all."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have these bumps around my vagina. They look like skin tags. They do not itch, but when I have sex, they start bleeding. I hurt them while shaving, and they started bleeding. What could I have? Or could it be some sort of STD?","Doctor":"Hi. With the symptoms you have provided, it is not an STD (sexually transmitted disease). But if you have any doubt, I advise you to take an ELISA test. Most probably, you do not have skin tags, but a collection of vasculatures, as they bleed on any injury. You can get it removed by laser or cauterization. And avoid injury to the area as much as possible."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am having some obstruction feel in the throat and vomiting sensation for the past 20 days.

I read that only sponge bath should be given to the baby till the umbilical cord comes off and is completely healed.","Doctor":"Hi. In this cold winter, it would be preferable to give a sponge bath with lukewarm water, cleaning all areas of the body. One has to be careful that the baby is not exposed to cold. Keep the baby warm. Breastfeed the baby as it gives the mother's warmth also."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, For the last two nights, my right eye and the right side of my mouth have been bothering me a lot and I thought it was because of a headache but it is not. I have had a root canal done over a year ago in the right side in the back of my mouth and one done again behind that tooth. Could the pain from a root canal or failing root canal cause so much pain to my eye? And today on the second day I have felt like I have had water up my nose all day and my eyes burn. I use gadgets a lot.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. The reason for pain in the eye region should be due to any tooth infection in the upper front tooth region precisely the canine tooth. It could be a hidden decay in the tooth which bothers you a lot. I advice you to get it checked with the dentist along with an X-ray for the tooth in suspicion. There are least chances that the failed root canal treatment could cause this. A root canal treated tooth is equivalent to a dead tooth and this might not cause any pain at all. Moreover, you have mentioned that your nose waters and the eyes burn. I find these symptoms are irrelevant to the dental history you have given. Considering your age, I suspect that there are more possibilities for you sitting around with the electronic gadgets for longtime. This is the main reason for the symptoms you have mentioned. I highly recommend you to drink plenty of water and eat food that cools up your body such as watermelon, cucumber, lemon juice, etc. Oiling your head is again another tip which can help you reduce the body heat."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, About 4 weeks ago, I got oral sex from a partner whose HIV status is unknown to me. I did only that with her. I always thought that it represented no risk of contamination to HIV. Now the thing is that about 1 week after that intercourse, I did a general blood test and found out that I have herpes type 1 and 2. I am aware that herpes increases the risk of contamination to HIV. But when I received the oral sex, I did not have any visible sore on my penis. Now about 4 to 5 weeks post that intercourse, I started to have flu-like symptoms (fatigue, sore throat, etc.) and several mouth ulcers. Could it be a sign of HIV or is it nothing as I was not exposed to anything and did not have an open sore on my penis when I had oral sex?","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly pre-existing lesion of herpes or any genital ulcer on the penis during sexual intercourse or oral sex increases the chances of HIV transmission. Your blood report came positive for Herpes 1 and 2. Herpes 1 mostly causes oral ulcers, and herpes 2 causes genital lesions. And there are two tests, Herpes IgG, which indicates any past infection or subclinical exposure and herpes IgM, which indicates active infection. Please tell me which test was positive in your case. Coming to your symptoms, they may be suggestive of the acute HIV syndrome. To rule out HIV, please get a western blot test done for HIV 1 and 2 at the earliest. ELISA test, which is generally done for HIV will be negative in the window period (4 to 6 weeks after contracting HIV). Also get an ELISA for HIV done 8 weeks after your exposure. If it is negative, get a repeat test done after 3 and 6 months for understanding. Please tell me a few details to help you better. Did you have sexual intercourse also? If yes, you need to get a few more tests done to rule out other STD's. Did the person who performed oral sex have any oral or genital lesions?"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from irregular periods. I am currently taking medication Levothyroxine 50.

From your query, I understand that you are suffering from hypothyroidism. I need to know when was it diagnosed, and what was the thyroid profile at that time. Irregular periods and weight gain is a part of hypothyroidism. I would like to modify your dose as well as advise you ways to reduce your weight. All will be well once we modify your dose."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have hypertension. Please suggest some natural ways to treat it.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that you are not interested in taking medications for hypertension for a long time. So I am suggesting you a natural way of dealing with hypertension. Take raisins. Soak it in rose water overnight. Chew and eat it in the morning. You have to follow this for 21 days with 1 raisin on the first day, 2 raisins on the second day, 3 raisins on the third day and so on till you have 21 raisins on the 21 st day. Then stop this and after a gap of 2 weeks, repeat this. Follow 4 to 5 cycles like this. Meanwhile, keep taking your allopathic medication during this period. Afterward, you can taper off the medication. Keep checking your blood pressure after every 21 days. This might work for you depending on your body condition. Also, try to do meditation and yoga."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It is a common problem which women face. An underwired bra or any kind of pressure on the breast could have caused a plugged milk duct. It is recommended to position the baby's chin pointing to the lump and to change the baby's feeding position. Unplug the duct by taking steam or manually preparing the breast for feeding the child, try to unplug it with some moist heat pack, massage, pumping, and nursing. Once you start feeding, it will start unplugging without any additional effort. Before nursing, gently massage your breast with hot water steam. Do try this and it will help you a lot.

Now I am with severe pain. Unable to drink, eat, etc. What should I do to relieve the pain? OTC is not working.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. You said it is an eight months old treated tooth and also with incomplete root canal treatment. With this, I suspect that the tooth is severely infected and you might need to take a course of antibiotics along with pain killers as an emergency till you seek a dentist as soon as possible. Also do not worry that the temporary filling has fallen out. That is okay because if it was there, you would have got a swelling due to the severe infection pressurized within the boundaries of the tooth. Re-root canal treatment is highly questionable at this stage.  Meanwhile, take the tablets as per the prescription. Capsule Amoxycillin 500 mg orally eight hourly for five days, tablet Metronidazole 400 mg orally 12 hourly for five days, tablet Ibuprofena and Paracetomol (200 mg and 500 mg) combination drug to be taken orally eight hourly for 2 to 3 days. Note: Please do not repeat the course unless prescribed again. All medicines are to be taken after food only. If you get any skin rashes or allergies immediately stop taking the medicine. If you having any gastric irritation during the course of the medicines, please take tablet Omeprazole 10 mg 12 hourly 30 minutes before food along with the other prescribed medicines. However, I advice you to visit a dentist as soon as possible to get it virtually treated because antibiotics are mere ad-ons to the actual treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had sex with my fiancee on the 11th day of her cycle and only once.

If her cycle is regular of around 28 days, there is 20 to 25 % chance of pregnancy. Unwanted 72 does not work effectively after 72 hours of unprotected sex, so no point in taking it now. If she misses her next period and pregnancy is confirmed, you need to consult a gynecologist for medical abortion as such medicines are not available over the counter and need a prescription.

Yes, you will need all tablets, as they have an additive effect. Other two antianginal like Starpress (Metoprolol), has many beneficial effects other than this, and decrease mortality. So it needs to be continued. Also, Nitrofix (Isosorbide mononitrate) is also important and needs to be continued, otherwise angina will recur. You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high-calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly and BP should not be persistently more than 140/90 mmHg.

Phenytoin, especially in the first trimester (initial three months) of pregnancy, can affect the baby. It can increase the risk of congenital anomalies like fetal hydantoin syndrome or neural tube defects. If you are still planning for pregnancy, you should switch to other medication for seizure (after discussing with your neurologist). But if you are already pregnant, it is little risky to switch to another drug because while switching from one medication to another increase some risk of recurrence of seizures. And seizure during pregnancy can cause abortion or fetal distress. So, if you are pregnant already you can continue with Phenytoin. The risk of congenital anomaly is increased from 1 to 2 % (without any medication) to 5 to 7 % (with Phenytoin)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 23 year old male.

PNP deficiency is a very rare condition, in which the body is unable to produce certain immunity related cells called T cells, this happens due to some gene defects and is usually inherited. (But parents might not be affected). This causes the child to get frequent infections involving different body organs, especially the brain, lungs, etc., causing much sickness. Child would be prone to unusual infections also, as the body mechanism to take care of infection is not complete. Till today, the only curative option is hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which carries the risk of failure and side effects. Otherwise, the condition is life-threatening, and children might succumb in the first or second decades of life. He is being treated for his brain infection and its complications, presently.

Does this pain increase on applying pressure over the area, if yes it could be costochondritis and it is a musculoskeletal type of pain and needs prolonged NSAID therapy? You will need to check vitamin D level and need to be on NSAID therapy. Overload and overuse, as during weight lifting, or pushing heavy objects, may lead to muscle strain as well. If possible, any activity that causes or exacerbates the problem should be reduced and/or stopped, at least temporarily. You should get Diclofenac gel for topical application. Also, you will need tablet Naproxen 250 mg twice a day for 1 to 2 weeks or longer or Ibuprofen, along with antacid like Pantoprazole. So you can get this prescribed.

You will also have to undergo an ultrasound done to rule out ectopic pregnancy which is dangerous. If your pregnancy if seven weeks or less, then you can be given medical management of abortion by pills by a registered gynecologist under supervision. If pregnancy is more than seven weeks which is more likely as your LMP (last menstrual period) was two months back, then you need to get a dilatation and curettage by a gynecologist which is the safest method.

He is suffering from homogenous (right) hemianopia. Is there any treatment for this? Please suggest me.","Doctor":"Hi. How has the hemianopia fared over these two years? Is it increasing or decreasing? PCA (posterior cerebral artery) is one of the arteries supplying the visual pathway and its lesions usually cause visual field defects. Most of the defects will improve over time as and when the blood supply to the affected part (occipital lobe) will improve, unless of course the main trunk of the PCA is involved, which is known to cause persistent defects. The things which your father still has intact are his central vision, using which he can still read and perform most daily activities. Also his ability to move his eyes will also be working fine. Overtime he will be able to adapt using these two to be able to overcome the hemianopia, that is to say that he will be able to move his eyes and head to make the objects in the hemianopic field come into view. Now, coming to treatments and their results, eye movement exercises or scanning training like I mentioned in just a while ago. Incorporation of prisms into his glasses to enable seeing objects in the hemianopic field while head and eyes are straight, it can be an option in case his neck has a problem and he has problems moving his eyes. Both these treatments are given by orthoptists or optometrists. Regarding their usefulness in hemianopia, I will say that in most studies, patients usually improve and their fields come back to normal soon, so they never got enough time to train the patients with using these methods. Perimetry . Observation, orthoptic measures."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am sweating too much I guess. I am not sure if it is because of the heat here but I sweat.

It is likely because of weather only and body sweats in order to keep body temperature down. So naturally if you try to stay in cold environment as much as possible this will automatically reduce. However, for reducing perspiration, you should ask for Aluminum chloride hexahydrate containing powder 6.25 percent to be applied over heavily sweating area like axilla, groin and back. You should use this powder in the morning. So you may request chemist for this.

Currently, I am taking Metformin, Lisinopril Depakote.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. It appears you have a fissure. The first thing is your stool should be soft. For that, you should eat high fiber diet like fruits, apple, banana, oranges, green leafy vegetables like spinach, raw cucumber. Avoid smoking, refined food, fatty, and oily food. You should have plenty of fluids and regular exercises. Also, syrup like Lactulose 15 to 30 ml bedtime to maintain your stool soft.  Secondly, you can apply 2 % Lidocaine gel before each stool to relieve pain. Also,topical Nitroglycerin typically applied rectally as a 0.2 or 0.4 percent ointment twice daily for eight weeks will help in healing. Sitz bath will be helpful, during a sitz bath, the anus is immersed in warm water for approximately 10 to 15 minutes two to three times daily.

The surgery was very complex and painful. Few days into it and I started feeling something hard and sharp coming out from my gums towards my tongue, went to the dentist again. She was not able to take it out so she clipped and ground it, but it is not very smooth and I can still feel it. She told me told me that eventually, gums will cover it. Is that true or do I need to see an oral surgeon?","Doctor":"Hi. Complex wisdom tooth extractions will definitely have post-operative pain and discomfort. Lucky you that the procedure did not end up in swelling of the gums or face. That something hard feeling is nothing but the bone spicules that is left behind once the tooth is removed. The bony remnants will naturally fade away with time by a process called resorption. A kind of dissolving process. Do not panic about it because that is the process which heals your gums after the extraction. It will take a minimum of two weeks time for resorption but I advise you not to disturb that gums area with any sharp objects or tongue which will purposely delay healing. If any stitches were put, then you have got to remove them by the dentist in seven days from the day of surgery. Gargle your mouth with lukewarm salt water three times daily which will soothe the gums around. Also, do not brush aggressively and avoid hot and spicy food for a week. Otherwise, you will be fine."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I heard that a high intake of protein powder will affect kidney functions (by forming kidney stones). Is it true?","Doctor":"Hello. Too much of any nutrient is not good for the body.  But when you say 'high amount', it is a relative term. What seems 'high amount' to you may not be really high. If you think you are taking too much protein, please do mention what kind of protein you are taking and in how much quantity. Because it is also important to know the quantity and quality of protein you are consuming. As a thumb rule, it is good if your diet consists of 30% protein.

We have two generations of antihistamines: First generation antihistamines like Chlorpheniramine, Dimenhydrinate, Diphenhydramine, Doxylamine are considered safe to use during pregnancy. These medications have a sedative effect (cause sleepiness). The newer non-sedating antihistamines like Cetirizine, Desloratadine, Fexofenadine, and Loratadine are best avoided in pregnancy as we have no strong evidence confirming its safety in pregnancy.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It can occur because of any vitamin deficiencies or stress. If oral sex was a reason, the ulcers should appear deep into the soft palate. Hence, I suspect it to be due to other reasons. I advise you to apply Dentogel 15 gm thrice a day with good oral hygiene to get rid of the pain and to heal them. The gel will make the area numb for a while so do not panic. Also, it will give a slightly bitter taste. I also advise eating whole nutritious food rich in vitamins instead opting for fast food. Drink plenty of water. Avoid hot and spicy food.

You had protected intercourse and so the chance of HIV is less. The mentioned symptoms are not suggestive of HIV. But still, for peace of the mind, it is advisable to investigate with CMIA combo ELISA test for HIV after six weeks of exposure. Your rashes seem to be an allergic reaction. You can be prescribed Levocetirizine for seven days which is anti-allergic medication. Your blood pressure can be raised due to severe anxiety related to HIV thoughts.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a wide midline maxillary diastema. Is it curable and what are the chances of its relapse. I have missing lateral incisors.","Doctor":"Hi. Midline diastema can be corrected basically by two methods. One, using a filling material or crowns which can be done in a single or few appointments. Secondly, by using braces treatment which can be relatively for a long time success depending on the severity or combination of both the above methods. Since you have mentioned that it is a large diastema the combination method would be the one I prefer. But I do not want to misguide you without even seeing what exactly the condition is. I request you to send me a picture for a more appropriate advice. Else, I advise you to visit your nearby dentist preferably a specialist in smile design to analyze your current complaint."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is suffering from a vomiting and acute headache from the last two weeks. I have visited a local doctor and he has suggested some tests. After doing all the tests he prescribed some medicine for vomiting and headache. But the problem continues. When we revisit the doctor he was suggested for MRI and further blood tests. I have already done all the tests. I am sharing the test reports with you. Please check the reports and suggest what kind of treatment she needs to recover from the problem. My mother has hypertension and essential hypertension and taking Telma 40 and TVS 10 medicines from the last one year. Also taking Vasograin for an acute headache.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the MRI brain report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), suggesting multiple sebaceous cysts in the brain, and ring like enhanced lesion on cerebellum (small brain) right side which can be infective lesion like tuberculoma, neurocysticercosis, toxoplasmosis or tumor lesion like astrocytoma or medulloblastoma or secondary metastatic tumor or may be benigntumor. That is why she is developing that condition. Her condition might be worse if she will not get proper attention. Kindly follow following instructions. Admit her in any hospital under neurologist. Keep her in ICU. Make her BP stable. Go for diffusion-weighted MRI for a clearpicture, CT thorax to rule out any lung or breast malignancy. Do lumbar puncture and CSF fluid analysis. Rule out through blood cultures any parasitic, worm, bacterial or viral infection according to that treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 19 years old and from the last two years, my sore throat is not going away. I am having a lot of post nasal drip. I tried taking OTC anti-histamines, nothing helped. Today I noticed a hard lump under the chin at right side right at the point where throat begins. What is causing it?","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms listed by you point to chronic tonsillopharyngitis mostly secondary to the post nasal drip. Delving into the details, the constant post nasal drip is causing inflammation of the posterior pharyngeal wall and the tonsils in the throat. When these get infected the adjacent lymph node (the jugulodigastric node), palpable under the angle of the jaw where the throat begins, gets swollen. I checked the picture you have sent. It shows enlarged tonsils with granular congestion of posterior pharyngeal wall. We need to investigate you as to why there is chronic tonsillopharyngitis. We must evaluate the cause for post nasal drip. Most probably the post nasal drip could be due to some inflammation inside the sinuses. To rule out the same we must do a non-contrast CT scan of paranasal sinuses. At the same time, it will be prudent to get a monospot and streptoccal test done for the throat. Routine blood investigations will be helpful to check for agranulocytosis, infectious mononucleosis, lymphocytosis, anemia, etc. In the meantime, avoid spicy and cold food products. Desist from smoking and drinking. Drink plenty of fluids. I suggest you take a course of anti-inflammatory medicines, Chymotrypsin-Trypsin-Bromelain, taken twice daily in empty stomach for five days. I would also suggest taking Omeprazole 40 mg twice daily before meals for 10 days. In the meantime, you would get the tests done and get back to us with the reports. If the diagnosis is in the lines that I have thought, you would require treatment for the sinusitis which would remove the causative factor for chronic tonsillitis. In any case, the investigations will help us arrive at the most decisive diagnosis. Do revert back for further support and help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have numbness in my right side of the face and right arm and right hand. Blood pressure is normal.","Doctor":"Hello. Is it sudden onset or gradually develops from last many days. If it is gradual and it is there since long time period, then it is most probably spondylosis both cervical spine. It is a spine problem where you get numbness, pain, and other symptoms due to compression of nerves between spine. Do you have any history of trauma to your spine, does this pain increase on neck movement, is it associated with tingling, needles and pins sensation, if yes then it further supports the diagnosis. You will need vitamin D level, X-ray cervical spine, spine AP/lateral view and further may need MRI if X-rays are not informative. The treatment for this is physiotherapy to release the nerve compression, traction, cervical collar, medicine and if none helps, then surgery. Till the time you can have tablet Neurobion forte once a day which is a nerve vitamin. You need to visit a neurologist for all these investigations. If the problem is suddenly and of short duration, then it can be a minor stroke and needs further investigation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been to several dentists who said my gums look good and everything else but some cavities and one root canal I had to get done. I am on Invisalign treatment and much teeth (front mainly, top and bottom) seem wiggly. I looked and the mirror and see where they were. Can someone please help me or calm my nerves til I can get to a dentist?","Doctor":"Hi. Your upper and lower front teeth are perfectly looking good and I could also see few cavities in the photo that you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The wiggly kind of appearance you feel should be because of your teeth cutting tips have a very transparent enamel inside which there are 'w' shaped pattern visible. Those are called mamelons which are completely normal features of the tooth when it is developed. Also, the transparent enamel gives the greyish hue which might make you think that teeth are discolored but it is actually not so. Also, you should know a fact that, all the front teeth should not be of the same size and same level. By the nature of law, the central incisors have to be bigger than the lateral ones in the upper row. If you understand all these facts, you will believe in the dentists of why they had told you need not require any treatment for the front teeth."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have PCOS. I want to know what happens to all these unreleased follicle eggs on ovaries? Why I have spotting after the period? And how can Yasmin help me? If it prevents ovulation so the number of follicle eggs would increase? What are the side effects once I get off Yasmin pills? Can you answer me with an explanation, please?","Doctor":"Hello. The unreleased follicles are multiple and tiny and small as the follicular phase is very long. FSH hormone is very high. They are all unripe and immature but one of them grows till ovulation (takes a long time in PCOS patients) and other undergo apoptosis, that is get dissolved. Some women experience spotting at the time of ovulation but not necessarily it could be due to ovulation. It could be mainly because of hormonal imbalances. I myself prescribe Yasmin to PCOS patients and works wonderfully as it is a low dose hormonal pill. It regularizes the menstrual cycle, the follicular phase becomes 14 days and luteal phase becomes 14 days, periods come on the exact date. It has Estrogen and Progesterone component which is active and it mimics like normal body rhythm (how it normally should be) unlike what imbalances happens in PCOS and corrects them. Spotting does not occur. The number of follicles do not increase even if it inhibits ovulation by a complex mechanism but the follicular phase which is very long in PCOS patients gets corrected thereby leading to normal FSH levels. Free androgen circulating in the body get decreased. Side effects on stopping Yasmin are again irregular or delayed periods and hirsutism may increase as male hormone androgen is increased than estrogen and progesterone. But before starting Yasmin there should be no cardiovascular disorders or gallbladder disease or active liver disease as it is a hormonal pill. It gives protection from breast cancers and ovarian cancers as well. Once periods get regular after three months, Yasmin can be stopped. It has to be taken for 21 days from the first day of the period then wait for periods and again start a fresh pack."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a wheezing problem and breathing shortness when I suffer from cold. I noticed I have dust allergy also. Day by day my problem is increasing. Now I have to take Levolin inhaler three times in a day. Is there any measure to control my problem?","Doctor":"Hi. The whole problem can be attributed to dust allergy and bronchospasm due to cold. I would suggest the continuation of inhaler therapy for at least three months, a patch test to seek out the allergen, and dust free surroundings, (dust can harbor mites which are known to cause allergy. As you said your problem is increasing day by day I would suggest an ECG and echo just to ensure we are not dealing with an additional cardiac cause here, because usually once the cold or allergy is removed the patient usually returns completely to normal. Allergic rhinitis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a problem. I am getting frustrated with a silly thing that is my job. I had a breakup, I am fighting with people on small things. What to do?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. Did all these problems start after break up? If it is so, this is commonly called as an adjustment disorder. If severe it could lead to depression too. My advice will be to first understand that you are experiencing this problem and it is due to certain chemical changes probably triggered by stress. Your change in behavior may be the result of this. Try to distract yourself from situations which make you upset and keep yourself engaged. Try to plan a new resolution and work towards it. Try daily exercises or yoga. Try meeting new friends and take a break from your schedule. Try out doing something which you always wanted but never did in the past. The symptoms you are experiencing is temporary and it will pass. If nothing is helping you and you are experiencing low mood, sleep disturbances, etc., then a small dose of antidepressants like Escitalopram at around 10 mg dose will help you a lot."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a concern in my mouth. I am a 25-year-old woman. Is it normal for the underneath of my tongue to look like this?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the picture you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is 100 % normal for the tongue to look like. The undersurface of the tongue looks in this color because of the artery and veins supplying the tongue is quite visible clearly. This is the same sort of thing seen in the inner surface of the elbow joints. And the string running through the tongue is the muscle attachment called frenulum which again is a normal feature. Do not panic for this. You have told you have never seen it in this color. But I think you have never probably seen this keenly. Moreover, it is the way we see things. You should be worrying only if your tongue turns red, purple or even matte white for that matter. The top surface of the tongue will still look whiter in most of the normal times because that is the part which carries the taste buds and oral bacteria all around. I mean you should not see white patches in your tongue. Good oral hygiene includes tongue cleanliness too. I advise you to use a plastic tongue cleaner or back of the toothbrush head to clean the tongue after every brushing."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am an 18-year-old male and I am trying to find out if there is any way to lower my hairline. I had a big forehead since birth and I am wondering if there is any way to change that.","Doctor":"Hello. There are two ways we can use to achieve a lower hairline or a smaller forehead. The first is a surgical approach to remove a portion of the forehead skin and effectively lower the hairline. The second is to make the forehead appear smaller by grafting hair to the front of the hairline. Occasionally, these two procedures can be combined but as it is a very expensive method the only way which you can do is undergo a hair transplant by FUE (follicular unit extraction) method to create a new hairline to hide your big forehead."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

Even now, I am having trouble with them and my balance. What can I do to stop this?","Doctor":"Hi. The treatment includes some medicines and psychotherapy. Once you begin to accept panic attacks, you can start to change the way you respond to them. For example, instead of reacting to physical symptoms, with nerve-racking thoughts, such as âI am losing control,â you can respond to them with increased calm and clarity. Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, mindfulness meditation or yoga can be practiced to help you get in touch with your relaxation response. Repeating positive affirmations, such as âDespite my anxiety, I accept myself,â can also help in getting past fear. By working on changing how you react, you can remain in control during panic attacks. The next time you have a panic attack, try to remember the three Aâs of overcoming your fears: Acknowledge, Accept, and Alternative response. These three steps can assist you in changing the way you react to symptoms and get through panic attacks with less fear. Listed here is a simple step-by-step exercise that can help you overcome your fear of panic attacks: Acknowledge - The next time you notice increased anxiety or panic symptoms, simply pause and take a breath. Take this moment to recognize that you are experiencing heightened panic and anxiety. This simple act of acknowledging your symptoms at the start of a panic attack can give you a sense of power over your fears. Accept - Rather than trying to run away from or resist your symptoms, come to terms with the fact that you are having a panic attack. Acceptance does not mean that you are giving in to panic, but can provide you with the clarity needed to get through panic attacks. Alternative Response - Instead of becoming wrapped up in your fear, remind yourself that these are simply symptoms of a panic attack and that you have nothing to be afraid of. During a panic attack, your flight-or-fight reaction may be trigger feelings of stress and fear. Reframing these feelings can allow you to cope with them more effectively. So, for example, if during an attack you start to react with fear or a need to flee, remind yourself that your symptoms will soon subside. Instead of thinking âI am afraid of my panic attack,â try to reframe this to âI am feeling overly excited.â When frightening thoughts, such as âI am going to lose my mindâ arise, try to shift this perception, by repeating to yourself, âI am okay,â or âThese feelings will pass.â You can book for an online therapy or telephone counseling for further counseling and treatment from us."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, My mother (80 years old) got a hemiparalysis attack last week.

The report revealed that besides a mildly hydronephrotic kidney, for which I have already seen a urologist, everything else was normal except for the following.Â A focus of calcification is in the gallbladder lumen or the posterior gallbladder wall. TheÂ gallbladder wall is minimally prominent. However, the gallbladder is collapsed.Â All of my laboratory blood work showed that my kidney, liver and pancreas functions are normal. The gastroenterologist did not really give me any insight. He said to find a surgeon in case I have another attack, so that the gallbladder can be removed. I have found a surgeon, but I would like to get a second opinion from a different gastroenterologist. I have had a dull ache since the initial attack, but I have not had any more excruciating pain. Should I wait to get the gallbladder out if I do have another attack? When the report says focus of calcification, does that mean I just have one gallstone? Though I do not have any extreme pain, is this an emergency? Any advice you can provide would be helpful.","Doctor":"Hi. We are here to help you.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I keep thinking, and questions keep running in my mind. I am also depressed. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. The problem of sleep and excessive thinking might be due to depression itself. For sleep problem, try to avoid caffeinated drinks after 5 PM. Go to bed after completing your work, get up in the morning on fixed time. In my opinion, you need to consult a psychiatrist either online or in person for a detailed assessment of your problem. After a full assessment only, I can advise appropriate treatment for your depression and sleep problem. It is unlikely that eight months long problem is going to disappear on its own."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am trying to figure out if I have ADHD. I cannot concentrate at school. While reading, my mind wanders off, and I forget everything. If I stay still, I shake a bit. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. The information you have provided indicates towards ADHD (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder). But at the same time, there are other conditions that have similar kind of presentation as you have reported. Other than this, there are a few other criteria that should be present before saying whether it is due to ADHD or not. According to the classification systems by APA and WHO, around 10 criteria are required, and few psychological tests are administered before making a formal diagnosis. If you want to be sure about your diagnosis, it will be better to meet a psychiatrist in person or to have an online/telephone counseling with a psychiatrist at icliniq. They can help you understand your problem so that you can take appropriate decision."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had protected sex with a male prostitute. I did not receive it, I was giving and later I received it from the prostitute. This occurred before five months. I got tested at the health department for HIV and ECT and they came back negative.

My throat is red and I have had a bump on the back of the tonsils and it was white but it went away and today I now have bumps and kind of white-yellowish bumps. I have had diarrhea one day and I was feleing warm. All of those other symptoms that happened have gone. Just today, my throat is making me scared. It does not hurt or anything. It is just how it looks and the bumps.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your anxiety but anyways sore throat and tonsillitis can happen to a normal person also. You have tested for HIV and that test has come negative. You need not worry as that test came negative which has a good sensitivity.

He is born with hypospadias and had a stage 1 surgery to fix it back two years back. Everything went well so far. However, the following symptoms are now showing up. From the last week, he started to complain when passing urine saying it was stinging him. We went to GP and urine sample showed no infection. Since yesterday, drips of blood are there in his urine. We went to A and E and urine still showed no infection. However, the doctor advised seeing GP tomorrow to get a referral to a Urologist. The doctor is not sure what this could be due to mentioned that a scar could have reopened? Antibiotics prescribed to avoid potential infection? Could you please give us your feedback on these symptoms and let us know what kind of intervention is likely to happen if a complication was established? If it was a buildup of scar tissues or a urethral stricture for example, how would you treat it? We are deeply concerned as the first surgery was so painful and intense.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. I would like to know a few more details. You mentioned stage 1 surgery was performed two years back. When was the second stage done? Did he complain of any urinary problems after surgery? The most likely cause is an infection given his history is surgery, now that infection has been ruled out, other factors like bleeding from the surgical site have to be checked out. It is also possible that this may be totally unrelated to surgery, young children do sometimes get blood in the urine due to unexplained causes or calcium in urine, but given the history of surgery, the factors related to that have to be ruled out first. Yes, it is possible to get a stricture after hypospadias repair, and that can also cause bleeding due to high pressure during urination, and it has to be checked out, even if there are no complaints. If it is established that it is a stricture, then the treatment will vary according to the location and severity. It can be endoscopic or repeat surgery or sometimes just dilatation would suffice. It is impossible to predict, without knowing the actual details about the previous surgery and without evaluation of the child now as to what treatment he will need."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 1.4 years old.

It is my 29th day of being smoke-free. Everything was going fine until last 7 to 10 days my bowel movement has been strainful. Few days I have seen very small sized hard stools and sometimes small stool with very little water. I started taking Metamucil. However, the stomach felt bloated severely after eating anything. I sometimes feel a sudden hunger spike that becomes uncontrollable and once I eat, the stomach swells like a balloon. I also started taking one capsule of Triphala to ease out my symptoms. From past 4 to 5 days, I have started feeling fatigue and a very strong one like light handedness and no energy in my legs. I had a sore inside my mouth and that has healed significantly now. The acid reflux is there, especially while making out with my partner I felt food coming up. The consistency of stool after eating Metamucil has been more like rubber shaped long zig zag sausage with uneven and weird cracks and sometimes mucus as well. I feel gas below my stomach and sometimes have to strain hard to pass. I got my CBC done two days back (normal report), kidney, liver, thyroid (normal), Hb (normal), sugar (normal). I also got my FOBT stool test done (negative report). Are the above symptoms cigarette withdrawal symptoms? Or stomach bug? or IBS? I take the following tablets daily. one Magnesium tablet, one Menevit tablet (for sperm health and male fertility), one Omega 3 1000 mg capsule, one 64 Billion Probiotic capsule.","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your post, it is normal to have hard stools after quitting smoking for that you have to add a salad, do exercise, and take enough water. It is a temporary phenomenon which usually settles in three months till intestines adapt nicotine free blood. You have started laxative Metamucil which has caused gastritis. You need to stop that and continue Nexium at least 10 days daily before breakfast. That will take care of the issue. There is no need to take omega, probiotics, Menevit or Magnesium tablets. Do not take unnecessary medicines. It is not IBS."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I find pimples like area on my mid back for more than two weeks. Old ones fade and new ones keep coming.

The family is discussing marriage, so I was thinking about my sexual problem. I need solutions for premature ejaculation problem, and strengthen my penis.","Doctor":"Hi. Masturbation per se does not cause any sexual problem in the future life, so do not worry excessively about it. However, to manage premature ejaculation you can learn about the start-stop technique or squeeze technique. There are medications available for this purpose like Dapoxetine 30 mg one hour prior to sexual activity.

I would like to know if there is actual swelling outside or inside the throat. If not, there could be following reasons for feeling like a blocked throat. This is called globus pharyngeus which is little inflammation of the throat. The medications you have taken during infection might have caused dry throat and muscles and membranes are affected due to strain. Anxiety can also cause this feeling as we are swallowing more when we get anxious. I would also suggest seeing for any ulcers in the throat. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), gastritis can also cause this feeling.

Recently his treating doctor found more lymph nodes in his jugular and submandibular regions. FNAC reported a highly suspicious deposit from a malignant carcinoma and excised biopsy was recommended.

He needs a good oral diet and maybe if required admission and supportive care in the form of IV fluids. It looks like a recurrent disease in sub-mandibular nodes. It needs to be evaluated whether the nodal levels were included in the radiation therapy field or not (in-field recurrence vs out-field recurrence). In-field recurrences are difficult to treat and second-line chemotherapy or surgery can be planned (depending upon the response at the primary site: nasopharynx). Out of filed recurrence can be treated by radiation dose only if the meaningful dose of radiation has not been delivered in those regions. The biopsy can be performed if FNAC results are doubtful.

If the embolus is still there, we will go in for injections, low molecular weight heparins such as Enoxaparin or Dalteparin and oral ones such as Warfarin. They have dangers but are necessary and life-saving. If the embolus has been dissolved, we can maintain on low dose Warfarin also. Tablets such as Clopidogrel and Aspirin are not used in embolism, they are fine for heart blockages.

Now, two months after completing the tablets, my TSH is 11.5 (max 5.5). Why?","Doctor":"Hi. As long as you were taking Levothyroxine, your body levels of T3, T4 hormones were maintained at normal levels. Due to your goiter, your body is not producing T3, T4 hormones adequately. But, that is getting compensated by excessive synthesis of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) which stimulates the body to produce T3, T4. Once you take Levothyroxine, your body levels of T3, T4 hormones will be maintained at normal levels and the stimulus for TSH secretion decreases and hence TSH comes to normal. But, once you stop taking Levothyroxine, the T3, T4 levels come down and body starts producing more and more TSH to compensate low T3 and T4. My advice is to continue taking Levothyroxine and let your TSH come to normal, then let us plan to reduce the dose later. This may take a few months to years.

Once during the first day of my period, and then in the middle lower abdomen (where the uterus is) on the 9th day of my period. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Many individuals experience such pain. The period day pain is dysmenorrhoea (pain due to menses). The mid-cycle pain is ovulation pain called as Mittelschmerz in our term, due to the release of the egg. This usually indicates the ovulatory cycle."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have CML-CP. I am on Gleevec for the last one year. My query is about the skin whitening as it has turned too white. Will this side effect go away?","Doctor":"Hi. For further information consult a hematologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The symptoms include: Also, panic attacks are followed with constant apprehension regarding a future episode and change in lifestyle due to such episodes. If you have at least 4 to 5 of the above symptoms, then you have a panic attack, or else you could have any other illness.

I developed this problem out of nowhere. Three years back (got married two years back), I consulted a psychiatrist and was put on medications - Feliz S, Ciplar, Clonotril, and Tolaz. I took them for around two months and started to feel better, returning back to normal. I was never completely free from it since then, but it was kind of manageable. But from last three months, it has returned with full rage, I am feeling completely helpless and trapped. The symptoms that I experience are, scared of everything like I am losing control or will lose it eventually. Scared of maintaining my relationships with my partner. Feeling detached from the surroundings. Cannot relate to anything. As if, I belong to an altogether different species. Restless mind, constant intrusive thoughts; of doing silly things, smashing things, throwing stuff at others, abusing them, harming others (Do not feel very attached to my baby also). Anticipating crazy outcome of the events, like I would do something crazy in front of others. I ponder over and over again over everything I say, everything I do, watch all my actions like a maniac. Do not feel like doing anything. I have lost interest in my favorite activities also. Scared to be with my husband or with anyone for no reasons, I love him a lot but still not able to manage things. Get irritated easily.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand that what you are experiencing is not manageable with anybody. It has been observed in many studies that any anxiety disorders have a high chance of relapse during pregnancy. First I would like to tell you that medications are not that bad. They have the risk, but in the third trimester, they are considered relatively safe. The decision of starting any medication during pregnancy is taken after due consideration of risk and benefits. In your case with available history, I am more in favor of starting medication. The other option that is suitable for you is CBT (Cognitive behavioral therapy). You can contact any nearby available psychiatrist for this, or you can seek for an online therapy help at icliniq. Although you have mentioned severe anxiety in your description, your primary diagnosis is not clear to me. The previous psychiatrist prescribed Tolaz (Olanzapine) along with other medications that are antipsychotic. Antipsychotics are rarely prescribed in anxiety disorder, as they are not indicated for this. If you had a psychotic episode in the past during your first consultation, then my answer will be completely different. Other than antipsychotic prescription, your history also points toward obsessive symptoms that require more intense treatment. For the confirmation of the diagnosis, please upload previous medical documents or book an online consultation so that future treatment can be decided at the earliest. You are not alone with such a horror story. These problems are found in many people like you, and currently, a lot of help is available in the form of medications and psychotherapy. Rather than focusing on your anxiety symptoms focus on getting help and treated. We at icliniq can help you to any possible extent. Before you proceed for a consultation, please try to get your thyroid profile done from a medical diagnostic center. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male, and I get severe pain in the backbone and the surrounding area. What could it be?","Doctor":"Hi.

Some say that it will turn into bad materials after they reach the belly. I do not believe it. Is that true? Why is it so?","Doctor":"Hi. Any food that is deep fried in oil or that contains oil in considerable amounts is not good for your body. Excessive intake of oil might lead to cholesterol deposition in your blood vessels, which in turn can reduce blood supply to the heart. This poses a future risk of heart disease. Moreover, excessive intake of oily food is also a risk factor for obesity. If you indulge in regular physical exercise and control your intake of oily food on a daily basis, you can take a small serving of maybe a small cup of your favorite fried potatoes once a week. This again depends on your age, physical activity, and medical history. Just to stay on the safer side, I advise you to undergo a laboratory test called lipid profile. The blood sample will be taken on an empty stomach. This test will give you an insight into your blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have two children with a different father but my eldest seems to experience trauma or stress.

She is not being able to accept the change in her life. As an adult, it is easy for us to accept and move on with the change in our life but for her, it is not easy to replace her father with someone else and she is having lots of insecurity. That is the reason she becomes sad when she sees you with them because she still cannot accept two other people in her life. She is having dysthymia and identity crisis. She needs some social support and venting about her feeling. I think a few psychotherapy sessions will help her a lot. Medications will not be of any help to her.

Avoid using antiseptic medicated soaps as they disturb natural face flora. Use Clindamycin 5 % cream, apply in the morning after face wash, and apply Adapalene cream 1 % at night time. You will see the effect in two weeks. I do not think at this stage you need any oral tablets. I just mentioned the generic names of drugs, kindly ask the pharmacy to get these medications as brand names are different in every country. Let me know if you have more questions. Also, do not get pregnant while using these medications as these are teratogenic, and may harm the baby.

Instead of white rice and bread, change it to brown rice and bread. Coffee can also increase your metabolism. Include green tea around three cups a day.

What is your mother's BP on these medicines? Your mother is taking multiple medicines to control BP, still, BP is not under control, the cause may be due to secondary hypertension. The most common cause is kidney disease. Is there any history of heart disease or stroke? For proper BP control follow these guidelines. Avoid junk and fatty foods, reduce salt intake in the diet. Maintain a healthy weight, BMI should be less than 25. Measure BP at home, with the patient seated and backrest, the cuff should be at the heart's level and arm resting on the table. The patient should be relaxed for 15 minutes. Then measure BP. Repeat BP check in other arm. Remeasure BP in the arm with higher BP after 10 minutes. Lower of the two readings is the patient's BP. Take medicines at same times daily, take sound sleep. Regarding BP control, I would recommend to have renal function tests and electrolytes done and ultrasound of kidneys. These reports may change medicines or doses for hypertension. I recommend tablet Amlodipine, Valsartan, HCT 10/160/12.5 daily in the day time. Measure daily BP at random times and note it for 10 days. Continue Bisoprolol. No need for Aldomet. After 10 days, we will see how much BP is controlled and what is the BP trend. Then will decide further about management. Continue Insulin, keep blood sugar levels under control. Non or poor compliance to medicines, inappropriate doses, renal disease. Urea, creatinine, electrolytes, ultrasound of kidneys for size and parenchymal changes.

I went to see a general physician, he said it is a side effect of the medicine and it will go away in some time. But now one month has passed. The marks are comparatively light. And mouth gets dry occasionally only. But I feel (because of dry mouth or spicy food maybe) the lining of cheeks gets damaged which again creates a problem. I want to know, how much time will it take to heal properly. And should I avoid some particular food items? The doctor I went to only gave me probiotics for five days.","Doctor":"Hi. As such it is not serious but I will tell you there can be some factors responsible for it like drugs Chlorpheniramine which you have taken. Anxiety can cause dryness in the mouth and ulcers are commonly observed in stressed patients particularly females of age group 20 to 30. Morever patient can be diabetic. Now assess yourself if you feel any of these. But so for drugs are concerned it must go after two weeks. Youdo not need to worry. But if you are worried, stressed, then relax. Otherwise, you will feel like that always."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have two pins in my foot after having a hammertoe surgery. The doctor said that I would need to be sedated to remove them. Although it is an office procedure, is sedation common?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, sedation is common, as it will ease the doctor to do the procedure, and also it calms you during the procedure. The sedation is a very short one will last for only about 3 to 4 hours. But my advice is to avoid driving for the day."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have eczema. There is redness in my cheeks. I have used Corticosteroid cream for six days. Are there any side effects in using it?","Doctor":"Hi. Corticosteroids should never be applied without a doctor's advise. Also, there are certain steroids which should never be applied on the face. If you could send me photos and details, I will be able to give you proper suggestions. Till then, do not use anything on your own. It does more harm than good. Consult a dermatologist online for further treatment -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is it safe to take Vyvanse 100 mg for ADHD symptoms?","Doctor":"Hi. Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) is a stimulant. I basically do not approve giving stimulants to target ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) symptoms. And the dosage 100 mg is way above safe dosing range. One side effect to watch out for is motor tics or involuntary movements when you take such a dose. The occurrence of this side effect is dose-dependent and if it occurs, it means that you are using above the therapeutic dose. Consult a psychiatrist online before taking such a dose -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 44 years old male. I am attaching pictures of my seven year CBC history. Here is what happened this year. On my annual physical 11 months back, my WBC was low. Three months back, my GP checked it again. WBC came back in range but platelets were low. Over seven years, platelets have been between 134 and 165. GP sent my CBC history to two oncologists for review of low platelets. One said do test for H.pylori, hepatitis c, and HIV. Did the tests, all came negative. Both the oncologists asked to follow CBC. My father died of multiple myeloma at age of 64. The other day, I noticed a small bruise on my hip. Probably no big deal but have a heightened awareness now. My question is due to my father dying of MM and/or my CBC history, am I at a higher risk of blood cancer? What or when should I be concerned, what to look for? I certainly do not want to go to an oncologist with a single bruise.","Doctor":"Hello. Your CBC does not suggest multiple myeloma (attachment removed to protect patient identity). In the case of multiple myeloma, anemia can be there and clinical symptoms like a constant headache, kidney system related symptoms, etc., can be present. But as your father was having a history of multiple myeloma, you are also at risk. But it does not necessarily mean that you will develop cancer in the future, the risk can be there but exact percentage cannot be predicted. So if you suffer from any unusual symptoms related to multiple myeloma like a headache, affected vision, weight loss, bone fractures, fever, etc., then you have to consult a nearby doctor for detailed evaluation. Your CBC is not showing any dangerous finding but still, I suggest you investigate with peripheral smear examination report and serum immunofixation electrophoresis for further work up. Peripheral smear examination will show any abnormal cells if present and electrophoresis will help in identifying monoclonal M band if present. You can revert back with that report."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I and my fiancee have ureaplasma parvum (DNA analysis). I have no symptoms, she has a little excreta. Should we take antibiotics or not?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. Men usually do not get significant symptoms in this infection. Women usually get some whitish discharge, not very significant. It would be best to get it treated and both of you would need treatment as it can be sexually transmitted. However, it is completely curable. I would suggest you visit your local urologist for a clinical examination before any treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have itching and infection in my private area for the past one month.

Looking forward to your response in order to help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have been getting these irregular beats for about a week. Sometimes I think I have been getting some slight chest pain also but not sure if that is a placebo-like effect or not. My uncle who is a doctor thinks they are ectopic beats in relation to lack of sleep and stress.I find myself waking up from breathing related issues frequently often just as I am about to fall asleep. Earlier this week I had a good nights sleep and the heart issue seemed to disappear for that day only. I have made big changes to my lifestyle over the past week as this has really freaked me out. So I am not worried if this is the diagnosis but want to check with a cardiologist.","Doctor":"Hi. These extra beats are called premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Normally heartbeat is caused by an electric current in microvolts. That current is generated in an area of the heart called the sinus node. That current travels from one part of the heart to other parts, that is, from atria to ventricles. Not only sinus node but also other parts including ventricles generate currents too but that is not evident on ECG because that is canceled by currents coming from the sinus node. Sometimes when sinus node current bursts are slowed or ventricular tissue is irritated, ventricles generate current and that travels up the whole ventricle and ventricle contracts and that is called a premature ventricular contraction. In fit and young people, some PVCs are a normal occurrence and are of no concern. Other common causes, as your uncle said, are anxiety, excessive use of coffee, tea or some medications. In your ECG, your heart rate is between 50 and 60, that is normal in young fit people at rest, so some PVCs may appear. Mostly such PVCs occur on rest when the heart rate is slow, when heart rate raises such as during walking or exercise, PVCs disappear, that is normal. I would recommend to avoid anxiety, refrain from alcohol (if you drink), and tea or coffee may be taken (not excessively). To be on the safe side, a blood test called serum electrolytes may be done, in which we will see potassium levels (low or high potassium levels may cause some heart rhythm problems). To summarize, no need to worry, it is normal. Further, on follow up, please provide the following information, so that I may guide you more. A complete 12 leads ECG. Is there any family history of sudden death, or heart attack especially in first degree relatives? Is there any history of loss of consciousness?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have an anal fissure. I am taking homeopathy for the past 25 days. It worked for the first 20 days, but for the past five days, my pain has increased significantly. Is it homeopathy aggravation or something else?","Doctor":"Hello Can you please mention the name of the homeopathic remedy taken? The increased pain after an immense relief can be due to two reasons. The first, the given remedy acted superficially hence you noticed immediate relief. However, since the action of remedy is not completed it stopped working at a certain point where you started getting pain again. The second reason is the aggravation of homeopathic remedy which occurs if the remedy is taken too often in large doses. It is important to know how many doses and in which potency the remedy was taken. If this is an aggravation of remedy, stop the remedy, the pain will subside slowly over the time. If the pain does not subside completely, you can take Nux Vomica 200C one dose (four pills or two drops in a spoon of water) once a day for three days. This remedy will help to reduce the aggravation. Also, it is important to know if the fissure has started to heal in the last 20 days or has it got worse. This can be determined by the physician who will perform the physical examination. Hence, I would advise you to consult a physician and get it checked."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an 18 year old female, and I do not know what is happening with my body.

I would be able to help you more if you could send me the following details: Since how long do you have these lesions? The exact site and morphology of these lesions. Does your skin appear to be dry or flaky? Is there any history of similar lesions in family, friends, or roommates? Are you living with a pet? Send me a picture of the site."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got my wisdom teeth out two weeks back. It is now paining a lot, and I also have a bad taste in my mouth. Is it due to infection?","Doctor":"Hi. Sadly, Yes! Your history is giving symptoms of post-operative infection. If the pain is sharp just at the socket point, then clean this area thoroughly and start saline water mouth rinses at least 8 times a day for 2 weeks. This is best for the fast healing of the wound. Take a small cup of lukewarm water and add 1/4 th teaspoon of salt in it. I suggest you try using the following: If sharp lancinating pain persists even after following these instructions for two days, then it would be better to visit your dentist and ask him to look if you have alveolar osteitis (dry socket) signs. If yes, then he can give you a dressing and thorough wash of the wound."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My nose feels partially obstructed, and my head feels swollen. What to do? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Nasal obstruction most commonly occurs due to nasal congestion secondary to allergy or infection. But sometimes it could be due to Deviated Nasal Septum (DNS), which requires examination or x-ray of PNS for confirmation. Most likely in your case, it is nasal congestion with sinusitis. I suggest you try taking tablet Allercet-DC (Cetirizine and Phenylephrine) twice a day for 3 days. Take steam inhalation thrice a day."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had acne since three months.

I am not sure what to do. What are your suggestions? Currently, I am on Ativan, Ambien, Lamictal, Effexor, and L-methyl folate.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Are you a diabetic?

I saw your images not clear (attachment removed to protect patient identity), but it shows the pustular and nodular type of leisons followed by healing with pigmentation. You may use Clindamycin gel local application twice a day after face wash. Apply only the area that pustular acne are. Do not apply near the eye. You may take capsule Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for one week. Check your hormonal status like serum estrogen and testosterone levels. Check your blood sugar levels. Avoid chemicals (new soap or creams) application on the face.

How do I know if it is in the stomach? What should I do? I do not think it is acid reflux because I already take PPIs for more than one month and it seems to be still there. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Halitosis or bad breath usually originates from oral or nasal passages. The cause of it is bacterial decay of residual food and debris. Most common causes of halitosis are periodontal diseases, dental caries, oral cavity infection, and coated or uncleaned tongue or decreased salivation. Other causes which are thought of after ruling out the above are a tonsillar abscess, any esophageal pathology which allows collection of residual food in esophageal like a diverticulum or motility disorder like achalasia. Lung pathology like lung abscess can also be the cause of halitosis. Gastritis due to H.pylori can also cause halitosis. Also, bezoars in the stomach can also be a cause."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am hoping you can answer this question for me. I am submitting a photo of what I am hoping is a skin tag.

My query is that I have a problem of excess heat in my body. I experience severe burning in the foot, especially in the mornings. Please advise remedy.","Doctor":"Hi. Burning sensation in the feet may be because of nerve damage, also called neuropathy. In most people with neuropathy, the leg nerves get damaged first. Damaged nerve fibers are more likely to be overactive and misfire, thereby sending the pain signal to the brain even though there is no wound. This is often accompanied by numbness and tingling sensation on the feet as well. Diabetes is also the most common medical condition that can cause burning feet. Other conditions that can cause burning feet are alcohol abuse, chronic kidney disease, HIV, vitamin deficiency, low thyroid level, drug side effects, peripheral artery disease, infection, and inflammation.  Treatment of the burning sensation on the feet is to treat the cause and also to prevent further nerve damage and pain. More information about your symptom is needed so that a proper diagnosis can be made. Information needed to include how long you had the symptoms, how often do you have them, how bad is it, your lifestyle, if you smoke or drink alcohol, the medication you take."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) since I was a child, and I did not know that I have this type of sickness until I read about it on internet.

First of all I would like to inform you that OCD like symptoms occur in various disorders other than OCD itself. And the management of different disorders varies according to etiology. Regarding your question about self treatment, I would suggest against it, as every drug is associated with one or another kind of side effect and they can be better managed only in expert hands. Besides this which drug is suitable for you can be decided by a psychiatrist or other trained mental health professional. Most of the patients do not respond completely to only medication in case of OCD, as they also require some form of psychotherapy treatment. What I suggest at this moment is, first take an online psychotherapy consultation that will evaluate you in detail to decide further course of action."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

I want to say that a part of the teeth which is hidden under gum is showing. I am a smoker and I am already trying to leave it. Please suggest me some treatment. I usually brush once daily.","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. Receding gums can be a problem associated with many factors. It is known as the recession of gums. I would like to know if you have a habit of brushing your teeth hard. Smoking causes stains on teeth and there could be the urge to remove these stains by brushing hard on the tooth surface leading to the recession of gums. I would like you to have an appointment with your nearest dentist in order to get the teeth cleaned (scaling) properly and also to assess the severity of the recession so that the treatment can be done accordingly. Meanwhile, I would also advise you to brush with a soft or ultra soft-bristled toothbrush twice daily and also floss daily. Also do not scrub the brush onto the teeth hard, be gentle while brushing. I would love to hear from you regarding the follow-ups."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My age is 28 years old. My body weight is 80 kg and height is 5 feet 11 inches. I am facing a premature ejection problem. When I start sex, I discharge within one minute. Please kindly give me any medicine for treatment or guide me what I can do.","Doctor":"Hi. Quick discharge or premature ejaculation is very common and is usually not associated with any disease but may be due to anxiety, sometimes. However, there may be a problem with prostate gland and thyroid hormone. Most often it is a chronic problem and you have to take medicines off and on. Also, there are exercises to control it. You can learn to control quick discharge by doing this exercise. Pull your muscles that you pull at the end of urination for few seconds then release. Repeat this several times daily. Another is the stop-start technique. When you feel that you are going to ejaculate stop the sexual stimulation and divert your mind, the penis will relax, after some time start the stimulation again and repeat the procedure. Over a few months, you will gradually increase your ejaculation time. You can apply Lignocaine gel to head of penis 10 minutes before sex and wipe it off before starting sex."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 39 years old, female, 5'4\\", 120 lbs. Healthy, no illnesses to note. Curious if CBC values are anything of worry as some have declined although in normal range over the past four years.","Doctor":"Hi. You have got very good reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your Hb,TLC,TPC counts are in normal range. In addition, you have got a very good lipid profile with good cholesterol HDL being high and bad one LDL being low."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a query on ectopic pregnancy. My wife is having one and her beta hCG levels were 125.25 ml after taking her first shot of Methotrexate. Yesterday, she got her second shot and her beta hCG levels today were 141. I wanted to know how much time Methotrexate takes to low down those levels and I was wondering if we were a little hurried in taking the second dose so quickly.","Doctor":"Hello. I hope you had taken the Methotrexate dose under supervision only. The usual protocol is to check for a repeat beta hCG on the fourth day of taking Methotrexate. Early testing may cause undue anxiety and panic as it takes some time for the levels to come down. Moreover, a few times the levels get slightly elevated after a Methotrexate. So stay calm and follow the instructions of the gynecologist you are following. Just report to the emergency in case of any acute pain, giddiness or bleeding."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Last year when I had tested for routine medical they found a small stone in kidney. I took Cystone for a month. Last week I tested because of a mild pain in the back, they did scanning and some laboratory tests. I have attached those reports. The doctor suggested taking Cystone for 60 days. Just to have a better opinion could you please see my reports and advise. Also, the report shows a cyst. Is it problematic?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and the attached reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I would concur with the suggestion given by the doctor. The stones are currently too small to require any treatment. If you are only mildly symptomatic, the best is to continue with Cystone and drink plenty of water. Usually, these stones pass out with this itself. It would be necessary to check after 3 to 4 months with an ultrasound again to see whether they have been cleared. If they are still present, a decision on treatment can be taken at that time."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a few doubts regarding annual flu vaccine. Is it a must to get an annual vaccine shot every year? Is it mandatory for kids? What will be the effect if we miss the dose a year? As all the doctors are not suggesting the vaccine, I am confused whether should I get it for my 5-year-old son or not. He used to get cold and cough often till 4 years. But he is quite fine for the last six months without severe cold or a cough. Please clear my doubts.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. Flue vaccines are annual because every season there is change is strains of Virus. WHO notify six monthly which strain to be used for next shot. It is not a mandatory vaccine, but it is optional. I usually recommend to my patients if they have poor immunity. Baby born premature, asthma, recurrent respiratory infections, repeated hospital admissions, on chronic medications, poor immune state (nephrotic syndrome, TB, HIV), if swine flu is endemic in that geographic area. If the baby is healthy, no above risk factor, then you can exercise not to give. As flu is air born disease and kids are in general high-risk population, I would recommend. It will be safer to give."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Our 12 weeks NT scan indicates developing placenta is fundo posterior lower edge reaching internal OS. The doctor advised 30 days complete bed rest. I need your opinion on the same case and also doing an ultrasound scan after two weeks. This scan was done 10 days back and since then I am on bed rest. I have a family vacation (one hour flight) planned to travel in 15 days. Is this something possible and non-risky to do?","Doctor":"Hello. At 12 weeks gestation with placenta fundo-posterior with lower edge reaching internal is a fairly acceptable finding for early pregnancy. It does not really call for bed rest if there has been no episode of any bleeding per vaginum. The safest distance of placenta is more than 2.5 cm from internal os but that is in the third late trimester when the lower segment is formed. The placenta tends to climb up by 32 to 34 weeks and the present low lying status shall change. However, care should be taken to avoid intercourse completely throughout pregnancy and not to lift the weight of any kind which can cause an increase in the intra-abdominal pressure which can cause bleeding. She can walk and do her daily chores with care. Travelling is advised even in normal pregnancy after 18 to 20 weeks when the placenta matures and the fetus has become resilient to any pressure changes with an increase in amniotic fluid. Unless it is absolutely necessary, she should not be traveling as a precautionary measure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother has gone for the Mantoux test and the report stated 15 mm raised surface. There is a swelling on the left side of the neck near the shoulder. Firstly we went to a homeopath because we thought that it is a stone. After 3 to 4 days it started paining after that we went to the mentioned doctor. He has given those medicines and has written some of the tests. And now he has written a new test called FNAC (which I do not know). So today my mother has gone for the test and yet the report is pending.","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed your query and here is my advise. The swelling could be due to infective enlarged lymph nodes, reactive node enlargement or tuberculosis. You cannot rely on the Mantoux test. It is not the test for tuberculosis. To confirm tuberculosis and to rule out the nature of lesion you need to investigate with fine needle aspiration cytology. In this investigation, a needle is inserted into an enlarged node and material taken outside over slide which is stained and examined under the microscope. It is five minutes OPD procedure, so do not worry about that."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My cum is not coming out by force or thrust. The cum is just flowing out of my penis. Three years earlier the cum was coming out by force or thrust. I am having erectile dysfunction may be since last two years or two and half years, and I was not having erectile disfunction earlier. I am taking Megalis 20 and Tentex Forte prescribed by a doctor and through these medicines, I am having a proper erection. I am having only one testicle, my another testicle was removed when I was of 13 years due to its under development. I want to have my cum come out by thrust or force from my penis to have a baby as I am married. I am 37 years of age, and my height is 5 feet 8 inches.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. I would like to know whether the amount of semen ejaculated had been the same over the last three years or has it decreased? Firstly, the speed with which the ejaculate came out does not unduly affect your fertility. I would suggest you have a semen examination if not done before to check for the sperm count which is more important. Secondly coming to your complaint, I would ideally like to do a full physical examination given your previous history. It could either be some blockage in the path of semen or the semen could be going back into the bladder. I would suggest you to visit your local urologist for a detailed clinical examination, an ultrasound to check if there is any blockage and a semen test to check for the volume and sperm count. Another possibility is incoordination of the muscles that normally gives the speed to the ejaculate, which cannot be tested to identify. As I said before, if your primary concern is to have a child, then I would suggest you to get a semen analysis first. If it is normal then you do not have anything to worry about."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Why my ortho does not put brackets in power chains while missing one or two spots? I have straight teeth and I am in the sixth year with braces. I think instead of closing gaps, this is creating gaps. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. There are different types of power chains that are available for the treatment depending on the interlink space. 1. Short (connects every alternate bracket). 2. Long (connects every third bracket). 3. Closed (connects each bracket). So depending on the stage of your treatment, either of the types can be used which may or may not connect individual brackets. Also, we would require the history of the type of malocclusion you had in the first place as the duration of the treatment varies with the complexity of the malocclusion. Complex malocclusion which require a lot of rotations and closure of gaps may take longer than usual. Also, the density of your alveolar bone and your body's bone remodeling rate affects the duration of final results. So in order to give a definitive diagnosis, we would require your treatment history which includes - 1. Preoperative and post-operative clinic photographs (intraoral and extraoral both). 2. Preoperative dental x-rays (OPG and lateral cephalogram). 3. Treatment history including the types of malocclusion, brackets used, wires used and the movements caused. 4. Oral hygiene maintenance routine that you follow during the braces treatment. Waiting for your reply. Brush twice daily with flouride containing paste. Use of salt water gargles everyday especially after meals.Tongue cleaning on regular basis. A periodic check up with your dentist once every 6 months. A visit to the dentist for oral prophylaxis (teeth cleaning and polishing) once every six months. After providing the required information."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My sister is having severe stomach ache and yellow vomiting and the pain goes around her abdomen to the back. She is suffering from this pain for the past one week. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I can imagine you must be very upset about your sister. And I really feel sorry that she is in pain for a week's time. Well, the pain you mention that is severe and radiating to back is suggestive of pancreatitis. However, the possibility of peptic ulcers cannot be completely ruled out. Ideally, the pancreatitis that is inflammation of the pancreas (a gland at the back of tummy) should be managed in the hospital. However, the pain of ulcers (peptic ulcers) in the stomach and small bowel can be managed at home. But before making a diagnosis it is required that you provide further history about her pain. Did she have this before? And if yes, how long it last? Did she frequently have heartburn or acidity issues? Is she on some medications right now? You mentioned her age, what is her marital status? Did she have fever? or yellowish eyes? or dark yellow eyes? You mention she has yellowish vomiting, but is she able to take orally or she is throwing up everything like water or food that you give to her? You see all this information can help us to decide the most probable cause of the underlying pain and consider some treatment to see the response. For time being, you can give her capsule Esomeprazole 4o mg now and half hour before meals. Expect the reduction in pain if it is due to peptic ulcer disease. The pain of pancreatitis will not settle with this capsule. If she is unable to take orally, then you can visit a nearby nursing clinic and get IV Omeprazole 40 mg. Pancreatitis. Peptic ulcer disease. Complete blood count. Serum amylase and lipase. Liver function tests. Urine detailed report. Ultrasound abdomen. Follow up to discuss after investigation, or earlier before getting tested, if you have more concerns."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband had duodenal ulcer two months back and was treated immediately by a gastroenterologist.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The soap you have mentioned is fine, but make sure you are following a good facial routine, which means cleansing, toning, and moisturizing. Also, I hope the soap you are using does not make your skin over dry, as this could be one of the reasons for dullness. I would better recommend a face wash which is more gentle and hygienic than soap. You may try Cetaphil face wash and moisturizer depending upon your skin type, and you can also tone your skin with rose water sprays regularly.

The steroids block the inflammatory chemicals in the body. Acute gout can be treated with medication that reduces uric acid like Colchicine, antibiotics if the pain and swelling are caused by infectious causes to stop the infection, surgery if your pain is caused by injury.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The reasons are elevated platelet count (about 700,000 to 900,000 platelets per microliter of blood), positive JAK2 V617F mutation analysis, etc. There are different opinions coming from doctors in my country. Avoiding details, some advice me to take Hydroxyurea, some say that Hydroxyurea is unacceptable for guys of my age because of hard side effects and advise me to take Interferon alpha. Some say that I should not take any medicines and exclude disaggregates and I should just monitor platelets count to be lower than 1,000,000 and some other indicators. Kindly advise.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your situation through which you are going. I have reviewed your query and below is my advice for your case. Usually, in case of essential thrombocythemia, there is no need to undergo treatment with Hydroxyurea in all case of ET. It is myeloproliferative neoplasm and the chance of acute myeloid leukemia is less in such case. In young age group people usually there is no need for starting Hydroxyurea. You need to check your blood pressure, sugar level and cholesterol value to decide further regarding treatment. It is advisable to maintain a healthy lifestyle and take more green leafy vegetables. Regular exercise advisable in such case to prevent clot formation. The smoking should be avoided strictly. In such high platelet count to reduce clot formation in the blood, you may need to given Aspirin in a low dose which you are taking. You can continue Aspirin and maintain a healthylifestyle with active exercise."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My height is 173 cm, weight 75 kg. I have a chronic digestive problem for 10 years.

Chronic digestive disorders which are common include irritable bowel syndrome, stomach ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cancer, infections, gallstones. The symptoms of digestive problems include diarrhea, stomach cramps, bloating, gas, stomach pain, vomiting, blood in stool, reflux of food, weight changes. The treatment usually includes a combination of medication and lifestyle changes depending on what the disease is. Since you did not get any help from alternative medicine, it is best that you be checked thoroughly and tests done so that a proper diagnosis and treatment can be given.  The tests that can be done depending on your symptoms include blood tests, endoscopy, abdominal X-ray, abdominal sonar. More history from you about your symptoms is needed so that an informed diagnosis can be made."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 33 years old male.

My father was a heart patient with triple by pass. I want to find out if my weakness is due to heart problem. I have had ECG and 2D echo done. Both were normal. Are there any other tests that can be done to find out if heart is healthy and functioning properly? Please advise. Currently, I am taking Eltroxin 100 for hypothyroidism, Nexpro, and Domstal for acidity.","Doctor":"Hello. I passed carefully through your concern and would explain that as your cardiac tests (ECG and echo) have resulted normal at rest (attachment removed to protect patient identity), an obvious cardiac disorder is primarily excluded. As you have coronary risk factors like strong hereditary for CAD (coronary artery disease), and probably hyperlipidemia (in the settings of hypothyroidism) and a suspicious symptomatology, an exercise cardiac stress test could be an option for further investigating any possible cardiac implication. Nevertheless, most likely factors responsible for your weakness seem to be outside your heart.  First, you should clarify whether your actual thyroid therapy is appropriate and no dose adjustment is necessary. In this regard, blood thyroid hormones level should be checked. Another issue to clarify would be the investigation of other possible influencing factors like anemia (check a complete blood count), pulmonary function (pulmonary function tests), blood glucose level, blood electrolytes level, blood pressure values. You should discuss with your doctor on the above-mentioned issues."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25 year old male. I am facing serious premature ejaculation issues since the last 7 years, and it has become worse with time. I have been masturbating five times a week since the last 10 years, but now when I masturbate, I ejaculate within 10 seconds. I also have two huge nerves or veins on my penis. They are quite huge and look odd. The head of my penis has also become huge, and the rest of the penis is getting thinner. If I do not masturbate for a week, l get wet dreams. My body structure is very thin, and I feel weak throughout the day. I want to solve this PE problem. Can I train myself with start and stop technique while masturbating? Will it help? Or should I stop masturbating? Please suggest a solution for my PE problem. I do not want to take antidepressants or SSRIs as they have major side effects.","Doctor":"Hi. There is no relation between premature ejaculation (PE) and masturbation. Due to anxiety, the ejaculation will happen sooner. This can be managed by calming down and avoiding stress. Think that everything will be fine. It is normal physiology that during erection, veins appear prominent. Penis size varies from individual to individual. For thin people, the penis will appear longer, as the fat in the lower abdomen is less. Getting wet dream is a normal phenomenon, and only if anyone tells that he is not getting it should be evaluated. My suggestion is to distract yourself. Do meditation and yoga. Masturbate whenever you have the urge."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 32 year old healthy male. After defecation, I have secretion of seminal fluid, which is followed by pain in the penis.

To treat chronic iron overload in the body due to thalassemia major, he can be given an intravenous injection or subcutaneous infusion of Desferal. Usually, in such case, 1 to 2 gm daily dose of Desferal might be needed. The only thing can be done for such iron overload due to thalassemia is Desferal injection or subcutaneous infusion.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

It is very nice to know the effect of health education imparted to you. On self-examination, if there is a normal smooth contour of testes, uniform consistency, no lump or heavy mass felt, then no need for further evaluation.

For pneumonia, if Augmentin (Amoxicillin with Clavulanic acid) given, then this medicine tend to cause loose motion with color variation of stool. If this is the case then you can stop the medicine, if it is continued till now. If the baby is exclusively breastfed, and passing adequate urine (5 to 6 times a day), then no need to worry. At this age, the stool consistency and frequency is highly variable, which is a normal physiological process. Focus on exclusive breastfeeding which is highly recommended. As top feeding also is a matter of concern for loose motion later.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

If the bite was unprovoked and if it caused bleeding then you should get a course of anti-rabies vaccine plus a shot of tetanus immunoglobulin, to be on the safe side. Even though it is a pet, it is not immunized so the standard protocol is to get vaccinated if the above-mentioned factors are present. Also, wash the wound with soap and water thoroughly. If the skin was not broken and if the attack was provoked, then it is not necessary to get vaccinated. However, given the nil immunization status of your pet, you may want to be on the safe side and get the shots."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 22 years old male. I am an athlete. One of my legs vein swells when I do sit-ups. Only for a short duration. I am tensed is there a problem. Kindly help me.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your concern. The swollen up vein could be varicose veins. And if you keep doing some activities that increase the pressure in the lower body or abdomen, it can give rise to immense pressure preventing backflow of the blood to the heart via veins. So, there is swelling in the veins. If you continue to do the same activity then you may lead to damage the valves in the vein. Now, at this stage, you may have a check up with some cardiologist to know the exact cause of the swelling. However, nothing to panic. Until then, I request you not to indulge in those activities that bring the swelling in the vein as a precautionary measure. You may continue with moderate activities that will anyway help you achieve the same result."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 26 years old. I went to my PCP for a pregnancy test and it was positive. Had an ultrasound a few days later and the technician said he did not see pregnancy in my uterus so he performed a transvaginal ultrasound to see if I was pregnant in my uterus but I was not. I took a pregnancy test there it was negative. I went back to my PCP 10 days later for blood work to see if my hormone levels are going up or down. Two days later she told me I did not need to come back in for a second bloodwork because I definitely was not pregnant. So she prescribed me Medroxyprogesterone 5 mg for 10 days to restart my cycle because I still have not. I am on day 7 and I took a pregnancy test yesterday night and it gave a visible faint line positive result. So I tested again this morning and I still have a positive result. Could this be because of the Medroxyprogesterone?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? You are about 14 weeks gestation, based on your last menstrual period. At this size, the embryo is easily visible. The blood test will also have high hormonal levels. Pregnancy hormone detected by scan and urine is serum beta hCG. If the fetus is healthy, the levels of this hormone increases exponentially. So if it is 2 Iunits today, in 48 hours it will be 4 IU, and so on. So by 14 weeks, the levels should be very high and easily seen on the scan. Mostly doctor noted a very low level of this hormone. It takes a few weeks for this level to fall to below detectable levels. If you want to still confirm the health of the baby, ask the doctor for the beta hCG result. After 48 hours of the test, check the same beta hCG. If the embryo is healthy, the level of hCG will double. If the baby is unhealthy, this level will fall or rise, will be less than double. So, Medroxyprogestrone acetate will not cause pregnancy hormone reaction, so this hormone is not causing pregnancy hormones. If your doctor feels that levels are very low. I would advise you to wait for 10 to 14 days. You will have periods, if the baby is not there."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a lot of chest pain and arm pain for the last few months.

Just let me know what your preferences are and I could help if you would like to explore birth control options."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I do have hypertension for which I take daily tablet Metpure XL 12.5 mg. Being pure vegetarian, I feel uric acid is very high. Has this to do anything with my BP tablet? Do I need to do any extra test regarding kidney or anything? What all vegetarian food do I need to avoid?","Doctor":"Hi. You seem to have high uric acid levels but asymptomatic hyperuricemia does not need treatment. You may have a family history of hyperuricemia which explains why you have it despite being a vegan. Also, being obese or losing too much weight can increase blood uric acid levels. Your blood pressure medication is not causing this unless you are taking Thiazide diuretics. Please keep an eye on your uric acid levels and serum creatinine to check renal function. You may want to check your thyroid hormones as well as hypothyroidism can also cause hyperuricemia. Please do the following investigation and keep us posted on the results. Serum creatinine, thyroid function tests."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had unprotected sex 10 days back and then took Unwanted 72 after four hours. I have not got any withdrawal bleeding yet. What does it mean? When should I take the pregnancy test? Also, I am a patient of PCOD.","Doctor":"Hello. You have rightly taken the emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. The success rate of ECP is 99 % and ideally,the withdrawal bleed should start in the next 4 to 7 days, but if it has not yet, then you can opt for a serum beta hCG test after eight days post last intercourse to rule out pregnancy, if any, due to possible emergency contraceptive pill failure. If the hCG levels are less than 3 mIU then you are pregnancy safe else you are pregnant.  If the test is negative then you can safely wait for the menses to return for at least two weeks and then, can get an ultrasound pelvis done to check for endometrial thickness and post that if the endometrial thickness is more than 9 mm then you can opt for a withdrawal bleed with Progesterone."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have foot pain while moving feet to left and upwards or back since last night. The similar uncomfortable feeling started to happen to me before some time (like sudden feet muscle or vein cramp or pain while standing up from sitting). Before, when I was awake and just when it started I used to straight and stretch my feet and fingers and there was no pain or it was gone within five seconds before to start. If this is the same thing, this time it happened when I was sleeping. I was not able to stretch my feet and fingers so woke up with pain and then it started getting more painful. I started to feel pain in every step while moving feet to left and upwards or back. This foot is now bit puffy or swollen than the other. Any suggestion about medication, rest, exercise?","Doctor":"Hi. I want to ask some questions regarding your condition. What work do you do? Do you stand a lot of time? Is there any recent history of bedrest? What medicines are you taking nowadays? Do you smoke? Swelling in foot or leg, pain on movement and pressure may be due to a condition called deep vein thrombosis. This condition occurs in those people who stand a lot of time, or who recently had surgery and are on bedrest or those patients who have some type of cancer or taking cancer treatment, and in those people who have a genetic disease in which blood clots easily. Otherwise, this condition is rare. This condition requires Doppler ultrasound of the leg to be diagnosed. Moreover, the leg pain or foot pain requires examination of pulses, which of course is not possible here. I would recommend to consulting a rheumatologist regarding this condition, as I do not think it is due to vascular cause. CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), CRP (C-reactive protein), S. uric acid. Take simple muscle relaxant and painkiller. Tablet Paracetamol or Orphenadrine citrate 2 to 3 times a day or at time of pain. Tablet Tizanidine 4 mg twice a day."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have pain in the right knee for two months.

Recently, my weight started increasing so again I started jogging and gym workouts. In the gym, I was doing leg workouts like squats, leg extension, leg press, and deadlift.

Restrict foods that worsen your constipation, if any, and consequently complicate fissure issues still. Try to avoid constipation by all means lest it injures the anal canal or anus. High-calorie foodstuff including sweets, cakes, pastries, greasy, oily, hot, spicy and fast foods are best avoided too. Take a glass of freshly prepared juice made of ripe bael fruit, honey (one tablespoon), black pepper, cardamom, etc., all, daily evening.

I am in a long term relationship and have only had this singular sexual partner since 2017. I am not on birth control of any means and in some cases, I have had to use emergency contraceptives post intercourse. In the past two months, I have used contraceptives twice, once in the end of March, and most recently about two weeks ago.

According to your history, you have not got periods this month and you are having some abnormal discharge. I saw the picture. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  My first suggestion would be to do get a urine pregnancy test. I understand that you have used emergency contraceptive but sometimes it fails. We need to know whether you have a pregnancy in which cases sometime the discharge is of nature as you described. You may be in the process of a miscarriage. If this is negative, then the next step would be to get a pelvic ultrasound done because the discharge seems unusual. But let me assure you that there are more chances of you having a miscarriage due to the failure of emergency contraceptives. In case your urine pregnancy test is positive you need to take proper treatment like pregnancy termination kits or Misoprostol tablets depending on the condition of the conceptus (baby) at this time. In case your pregnancy test is negative you need a pap smear, ultrasound, and sos biopsy of the tissue you are discharging. Whatever it is, it can be managed properly if it is addressed on time.

Lipomas are essentially non-malignant and non-dangerouscollection of soft fatty tissues. Homeopathy has no medicines to cure lipoma. However, homeopathic scope in lipoma aims at reducing the size, pain if any, and can control new growths. Also,homeopathic medicines can soften the consistency of lipoma making you feel comfortable and confident. Surgery is the only option to remove it, but it is also a temporary one. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask a homeopathy specialist online -->"},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, I have stopped taking my medications, Effexor 75 mg for a few days. I am wondering when my dizziness and brain zaps would stop.","Doctor":"Hi. The sudden discontinuation of Venlafaxine (Effexor) particularly seemed to cause discontinuation symptoms during the first three to seven days. Ideally, it should not be stopped abruptly. It should rather be decreased sequentially over two to three weeks. And, another strategy is to consider switching to Fluoxetine, which may suppress the discontinuation symptoms and it has little tendency to cause such symptoms itself; and then discontinuing that. My advice is to wait for a few more days and if the symptoms still persist, meet your physician again and suggest to put on Fluoxetine.

VeinGogh treatment is usually used for the treatment of varicose veins where the veins are dilated on the legs. This technique is not used for the treatment of scleral veins. The recommended way is an evaluation to find out the underlying cause and set the treatment option accordingly. The common causes are chronic inflammations of sclera and tumors of the ciliary body.  Hence I advise you to consult an eye care ophthalmologist online for treatment accordingly -->"},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, My 9 month old daughter had an immunization for measles.

There are no other side effects like itchiness or pain or anything. It is just annoying. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi. Two years you have taken antibiotics which is really not very suitable for the whole body generally. Recurrent antibiotics could give resistance to it and the body starts to respond it slowly and then gradually develops resistance as the intake is continued. Recurrent antibiotics can harm normal flora of different body parts actually including vagina than organs prone to infection easily. Genetically, on stress, excitement, ovulation, Fertilization, implantation secretion could increase. Have one vaginal swab to exclude any infection. Collect report and discuss here. Strict hygiene. Avoid unnecessary medications. Have mud mask for acne. Use condoms for sex to avoid sexually transmitted infection. Have soft comfortable undergarments.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have severe chills that I needed to wear thick sweaters and jackets at home without AC or fan. I do not feel the heat. And just cold water or slight cold breeze in the morning makes my head frozen or close to shutting down and it is getting worse. It always starts with the nose and then my head. Sometimes, I have to sleep to make the symptoms less severe. I am not under any medications nor do I have any medical condition.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from severe chills that you needed to wear thick warm clothes at home without AC or fan in summer now. Chills are the sensation of feeling cold. Chills are caused by rapid muscle contraction and relaxation. They are the body's way of producing heat when it feels cold. They often occur alongside a fever which is when the person's temperature is higher than normal. However, a person can also experience chills without a fever like you and there can be many different reasons for this. Possible causes include hypothyroidism is when a person's thyroid gland does not produce enough hormone that regulates their metabolism. Some people like you are more sensitive to the cold and may feel chills more frequently. Any type of viral or bacterial infection sometimes produces chills before a person gets a fever. Chill is a classic symptom of Malaria. It can have three stages. 1. Cold stage where a person experience chills. 2. Hot stage where they have a high temperature. 3. Sweating stage. Anemia may develop due to poor diet, age, chronic illness, medications, gynecological diseases, etc. Most common symptoms include waking up tired, looking pale, and always feeling cold with chills. Hypothermia can be resulted from dropping body temperature below the normal range due to any causes. Hypothermia can be dangerous especially when your body temperature falls further. If the temperature falls below 96 degrees you should seek medical care immediately. So you should monitor the body temperature with a thermometer during chills. You can do some investigations like CBC (complete blood count) with PBF (peripheral blood film), thyroid function test (T3, T4, TSH), RBS (random blood sugar), etc. Treatment depends on causes. So we should find out the exact causes of your suffering and then treat them accordingly. I want to add that dehydration, anxiety, panic attacks may cause chills too. When your body does not have enough fluids it is hard to maintain regular body temperature and this can lead to hyperthermia and fever like symptoms including chills. Again anxiety is more often associated with feeling sweaty than feeling cold but sometimes it can cause a chilly feel as well. And if you have panic attacks you might experience full body chills according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). In order to cope up with your chills, you can do the following â¢ Drink lots of fluids including oral rehydration saline and plenty of rest. â¢ Sponge with lukewarm water. â¢ Don't bundle up in blankets or use AC or high speed fans. â¢ Enjoy a warm soup and drink warm beverages. â¢ Use a humidifier. Please inform the results after undergoing the investigations."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is fever an immune response of the body to act as defense mechanism against infection, why is Paracetamol prescribed to reduce temperature?What will be happen, if not used?","Doctor":"Hi. Very much impressed by your query. Yes as you said, fever is an immune response of the body to act as defense mechanism against infection. Most of the time Paracetamol is not needed if body temperature is not crossing >102 degree F. But any temperature >102 degree F causes many biochemical and physiological damages to the body, such as: Because of all this Paracetamol is used. But definitely not required for a low grade fever.

I reviewed all your performed tests (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and would explain as follows. Your total cholesterol or HDL ratio is high. This means that you should make some diet modifications in order to reduce cholesterol levels. Starting statins may be needed. Your vitamin D levels are slightly low. For this reason, it is necessary to start Vitamin D supplements. Your other tests are normal.

She is an alcoholic. She drinks every single day and mostly when she is alone. She is drunk most of the time, in office, at home. She started drinking approximately two years back. She loves a guy from a different religion and is not allowed to marry him. The guy has stated the same problem regarding marriage. She blames God for this and considers it her destiny to drink and lose contact with her senses and outer world. She thinks she is the worst person is the world. She never wears any makeup, chews her nails, in short, she does not want to look good for anyone. I am the only person who knows about it and I begged her to see a psychiatrist but she is not agreeing. How do I help her? What can be done to make her feel good about herself?","Doctor":"Hello. First, you need to listen to your friend, her pain, her feelings. Most of the people just want someone to listen. They do not do it to know the solution of the problem but just to pour out the stress and internal conflict from their mind. After two to three sessions of listening you can slowly start making her understand when her mind is light after ventilating things and is more receptive. You need to tell her that alcohol is not the solution of her problems. Alcohol would lead to addiction disorder and it would be harmful to her physical and mental health both. Running away from any problem does not solve it. You can then convince her to get psychatric consultation, if she finds it hard to go to some one and facing them, online chat consultation is the solution. If she needs my help, I would be happy to help her."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a female 44 years old. After sex, there is a brown discharge. It only happens at that time. There is no other discharge after that. Is it something to panic about? I am taking BP medication Nebicad H and Thyronorm for thyroid.","Doctor":"Hello. This is called post-coital bleeding especially occurring in form of darkish brown mucoid secretion mixed discharge or often in form of spotting and usually accompanied with pain. The most common cause of such complaints is usually cervical erosions or cervicitis which can be confirmed after a per speculum examination and a pap smear by your gynecologist. This is usually due to a frictional lesion of the cervix during intercourse and a repeat friction causes fresh bleed each time increasing inflammation. The treatment is usually a 10 days course of antibiotics with complete abstinence from intercourse for three weeks and a repeat PAP smear after a month to evaluate the recovery. Other possible cause could be a cervical polyp, a cervical growth or often vaginal dryness secondary to chronic vaginitis-causing vaginal abrasions and bleeding. The best next step shall be a gynecological examination and a PAP smear."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Majority of times after I floss and then brush my teeth afterward I use cool mint Listerine mouthwash.

I do all that I can to have fresh breath why am I not getting no benefits out of it? I am so frustrated. This issue is there for the past one month.","Doctor":"Hello. You do not need to be frustrated. It is very common. There are various factors affecting your bad breath. You can try these things to improve your oral hygiene. Avoid foods and beverages that cause bad breath, eat more fruits and vegetables, take sufficient amount of water, try sugar-free gum if your mouth tends to get dry. Brush your teeth at least twice a day. Make sure to reach the gum line as well as tooth surfaces. Floss at least once a day. Rinse with a mouthwash twice a day. If you do not like the odor of your mouthwash you could change its flavor. Sometimes when we are empty stomach for a long time, bad breath still comes out of the mouth. Our digestive system also affects our breath, so take care of your digestion.

In your query you have mentioned a little bit of blood, a little for you could be a sizable amount in the eyes of a physician. Also, you have mentioned that you developed vomiting mixed with blood during or after your pregnancy. During the course of pregnancy some mother's can develop esophageal varices (dilated veins), but usually, these varices do not bleed. You should get an upper GI endoscopy done in consultation with a gastroenterologist. Endoscopy will just rule out the worrisome diagnosis and if it is esophagitis it can be treated with PPI (proton pump inhibitor) and dietary and lifestyle modifications."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had unprotected sex with my fiancee two days ago and I gave her Unwanted 72 and we had sex just after the departure of her period.

I am just wondering what I should do. It is warm to the touch.","Doctor":"Hello. There must be crushing of the tissues and what is called internal degloving and a collection of blood called a hematoma and that causes the part to be swollen and warm to touch. As long as there is no fracture then you do not need a plaster but a sling to rest the arm is mandatory till the pain comes under control and the swelling reduces.

My son was born with aortic stenosis. Is this because of the vaccine?","Doctor":"Hi. Could you provide more information: The above are the important factors causing heart defects in newborn. The incidence of the heart defect in the general population: First look at the incidence of congenital heart defects. The crude incidence of congenital heart defects is approximately eight per 1000 live births. Among them, aortic valve stenosis accounts for 3 to 5 % of all the congenital heart defects. Some studies have documented a higher prevalence of aortic valve stenosis in white children than in black and Hispanic children. There is a strong male sex predilection in aortic valve stenosis: the male-to-female ratio is 4:1. Now let us go to discuss the etiology (cause) of the defect: Causes of aortic valve stenosis are multifactorial. There can be family predilection too. The recurrence risk in offspring of an affected father is approximately 3 % but is approximately 15 % in offspring of an affected mother. Abnormal fetal hemodynamics are theorized to contribute to the development of aortic valve stenosis. It is associated with some maternal infections (rubella) but literature regarding association with the vaccine is not available. A definite genetic defect for aortic valve stenosis has not been identified, although it is associated with some syndrome, like Down syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, etc. Conclusion: By the above discussion, it is clear that it is a multifactorial defect, we cannot blame it on the vaccine itself. Management: The management depends on the type of the problem. Some children may require balloon dilatation. Hope this will help you.

He lost his wife four months ago due to sudden death. We have consulted a psychiatrist and he prescribed some medicines, but no relief yet. Give me suggestions.","Doctor":"Hi. Your brother is probably suffering from complicated grief reaction or depression. Generally, medicines take some time to have a proper effect. If he has started the medicine in the last one week, then it is better to wait for a few more days.If he has already taken the medicine for more than one week, then there is a possibility that the current medicine is not going to work for him within the current dose ranges. In such a case, we can either increase the dose of medication or change to another medicine which has better potential for your brother.I suggest you provide me the following details: With the above said details, either post a query or book a session for an online therapy for further consultation; so the needful can be done for him. Regarding loss of concentration, it is generally one of the symptoms of depression.

First of all, I would like to say that the epidural analgesia taken seven years back is definitely not the reason for her chronic headache.

We consulted a local gynecologist and the problem turned up to be high toxoplasmic infection reading was IgG 82. She received Rovamycin Forte for three months along with other supplements like Folinext and Ecospirin for six months. Now my wife is pregnant. Again we visited the doctor and she advised to perform toxoplasma IgG which again came back positive with IgG 78. Her first day of the last menses was 27th feburary. She has been receiving Rovamycin Forte once again and Duphaston, Folxt, Ecospirin and Doxinate. But now the problem is, she is unwell and been vomiting nearly every day during evening hours. There is a little brown discharge seen. In this situation, I am very much concerned about what will happen next? Will it be a miscarriage for the third time? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. We consider toxoplasmosis when IgM are positive, it meas the person has an active infection. When IgG are positive, it means you are protected from future infection. Your wife is in her first week of pregnancy, so spotting is a common finding due to implantation. Vomiting is also common until 12 weeks. She does not have to worry about it. She can try small frequent meals, baked bread, etc. I recommend an ultrasound at five or six weeks to evaluate the well-being of pregnancy. The symptoms that you prescribe does not mean that it will be a future miscarriage. It is common in every pregnancy. If this pregnancy terminate spontaneously, then after that you have to perform several examinations. But I recommend you to be positive. Ultrasound scan."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I feel there is an excessive discontinuity since a few days in my sleep. I could not get adequate sleep for the whole night and along with lack of sleep at night, I feel some anxiousness and stress also and these mentally stressed feelings remain throughout the whole day. Till now the anxiety level is not extreme actually but due to this mentally, I feel uneasy. And always I am being surrounded by some kind of bad tension, which tensions actually. I want to remove them out of me but I could not. These bad thoughts or tension do force me to think, to be surrounded by them. I could not be able to get rid of these.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. Some unconscious underlying anxiety resulted in rumination thoughts and worries. These are disturbing the sleep and you are not able to sleep properly. The lack of sleep is further deteriorating the symptoms and ultimately a vicious cycle is getting formed. Insomnia-worries-insomnia cycle should be broken. If these symptoms are resulting in impairment in your day to day functioning then please visit a doctor for evaluation. A psychiatric consultation is needed for an evaluation of anxiety. Drugs like Paroxetine can be utilized for the relief of symptoms of anxiety and will also help in making your sleep sound and peaceful.  Apart from these, I would also advise you to improve the sleep hygiene. Fix your time to go to sleep and waking up. Avoid taking tea, coffee, alcohol, carbonated drinks in the evening. Bathing with warm water in the evening also helps in good sleep. Avoid any activity like watching TV, reading books or playing games on the cell phone from bed. Use your bed for sleeping only. If you fail to get sleep with in 10 minutes of going to bed then get up and try to distract yourself. Avoid trying to get sleep. Do not think that you will not be able to sleep. This will increase the rumination. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Recently I have been experiencing severe tooth pain and cannot reach a dentist at the moment. Due to the pain, I have been taking Advil. Yesterday I took three Advil, two at once and then waited eight hours to take one more. Today I have taken two Advil every eight hours for a total of six all together. Each Advil is 200 mg, so I was just wondering if I will be okay? I take Albuterol (asthma pump) before a workout or when needed.","Doctor":"Hello. In an emergency, if you have severe pain and take some painkiller then it is fine for temporary relief. But you should not take it as you have taken. If there is an infection causing your dental pain then your painkiller gives only symptomatic relief, but your dental infection will still be present. Excess intake of any medication (such as painkiller) may be harmful. Many dental pain needs treatment as well as medication. Only medication gives you symptomatic relief. So I recommend you to see your dentist to find out root cause and treatment. Do not take any medication without the advice of a registered practitioner."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My hair is breaking recently a lot on the top. It is quite embarrassing. I use sulfate free shampoo and mine is chemically treated hair. Hair is so frizzy. What is the solution?","Doctor":"Hi. Chemical treatment is a common cause of hair brittleness as it breaks disulfide bonds that gives strength to hair. This would take some weeks time to resolve. I suggest you take an oral Biotin supplement like tablet Revilus once a day for six months. In addition, I suggest you use a serum Q-sera serum. Use it on scalp skin, twice daily. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, We are living in a building. It has four floors. We are on the third floor. There is a mobile tower on the roof.

Normally, it is said that radiations from the mobile tower are not carcinogenic. However, there is no proof for that. This statement is based on research. Currently, there are no guidelines stating that one should stay away from mobile tower radiations, so there is nothing to worry as such. Your child should not be affected by that. No special precautions are warranted."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, A few days back, I found these red bumps on my thigh and they had appeared out of nowhere. They are definitely lumpy and itchy.

I have gone through your case. In my opinion, you are having an urticarial rash. It is a type of allergy which could be due to many factors. Some are following. Drugs like painkiller or antibiotics, dairy product, meat or chicken, insect bite, artificial, sweating or heavy exercise. Please note if you have any of the above factor and try to prevent it as a part of treatment, (though many times difficult to find the causative factor and difficult to prevent it as well. But keep trying). Take tablet Cetirizine 10 mg at night for 14 days. Take soft and home made diet. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I took Digene and gastric medicine thinking it is a gastric problem but I do not find any difference. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from chest pain with some numbness in the left arm. Chest pain can result from various conditions such as: Muscle strain inflammation of the muscles and tendons around the ribs can result in persistent chest pain which can be become worse with activities. Acid reflux can result in a recurring discomfort in the chest. Peptic ulcer disease which are sores in the stomach lining can cause chest tightness or pain. Panic attack may cause chest pain in addition to nausea, dizziness, fear, rapid heart rate, fear, etc. Costochondritis is the inflammation of the cartilage of the rib cage. It can cause chest pain which may be aggravated with activities or posture changes. Any respiratory related diseases like pleurisy, TB (tuberculosis), pneumonia, etc., can cause chest pain. Again cardiac diseases such as MI (myocardial infarction), pericarditis, HOCM (Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy), MVP (mitral valve prolapse), etc also can cause chest pain. You should undergo CXR (chest x-ray), ECG (electrocardiogram), CBC (complete blood count), echocardiography, endoscopy of upper GIT (gastrointestinal tract), etc to find out the underlying cause of your chest pain. Treatment depends on causes. So please inform me of the investigation results, and check your blood pressure regularly. In the meantime, you can take Gaviscon syrup (two teaspoons three times daily), Domperidone (one tablet three times daily), Lansoprazole capsule30 mg once daily for your chest pain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a big night with lots of alcohol and several lines of Cocaine.

I am otherwise very healthy (good diet, daily exercise). I do not drink that often and the Cocaine use was a one-time thing.","Doctor":"Hello. The one-time cocaine use will not affect the present pregnancy as the lot of sperms which fertilized the ovum was manufactured three months back, when you were not exposed to cocaine, so unlikely that the present would have undergone any morphological or DNA changes. Nevertheless, medical follow up with NT scan, triple and quadruple marker tests and level 2 anomaly scan would be imperative during the course of pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Can an interstitial lung disease be detected on a 64 slice chest CT angiography or a 128 slice 3 mm of the chest with no contrast?

These are Prozac, Zoloft, Clonidine, Buspar, Vistaril, Risperdal, Luvox, Remeron (currently on), Seroquel (currently on), and Cymbalta. I am reaching out because I am struggling a lot and I feel hopeless. I do not know what to do at this point. Some of my symptoms are crying multiple times a day every day, feeling extremely overwhelmed, no energy at all. I cannot stop my mind from racing and thinking about too much at once, and more. My anxiety is so severe that I cannot go anywhere alone, I sweat, my heart races, I panic. What should I do at this point? I have a 2-year-old little boy.

This has impacted me greatly.","Doctor":"Hi. The description given here about you and your symptoms are really thought-provoking for any psychologist. To know that you are already under treatment for MDD and GAD is depressive in itself because you are just 18. Over and above you went through an ordeal of negative life incidents and now you are with an infant whom you should take care of. I do understand. I would like to know that are you employed? How do you get the funds to live on and then for treatment? Do you have an own home to live?  The first step in any psychological disorder is to accept the disorder as it is and understand, the treatment process will be long enough. Understanding this aspect will help you overcome the depression associated with the thoughts regarding your disorders. Once you understand it, you worry less about it. These disorders are like any other physical endocrine disorders like diabetes, thyroid, etc. These physical disorders have to be maintained life-long with the help of medicines and the more you worry about them, you will lose your sleep, but worrying is of no use there. The same is applicable to you too. I suggest cognitive behavior therapy, relaxation therapy, and progressive counseling. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 26 years old.

You can also do a dual marker testing for Downs syndrome. Then you must continue Iron and Calcium till the end of pregnancy from the third month onwards. At five months, that is between 18 to 20 weeks do an anomaly scan. At 24 to 28 weeks do a glucose tolerance test with 75 gm glucose.

Fingers popping is common and not considered to be a cause for worry. It, however, must be remembered that you should avoid popping them. Jaw cracking is another condition that as long it is not painful it can be observed, but if you have pain in the areas just in front of the ears when you clench your teeth or you feel a click, or you are unable to either open your jaw fully or if the jaw dislocates then you should see a doctor.

Stomach pain with blood in stools is something to worry about. The cause for it can be acute infectious gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or ulcer in your gastrointestinal tract. To diagnose all of these, I need to ask you some questions. Do you have any fever? Do you have weight loss? How is the appetite? Is the blood in stools fresh blood or is it brownish red? Do you have any history of piles? Are the stools hard? Do you have any diarrhea?

The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Till now I have not get periods. What are the chances of pregnancy? Please tell me. I am very worried about this.","Doctor":"Hello. It depends on when sexual intercourse happened (in relation to ovulation). The pill provides about 95 % protection against pregnancy. If the pill was taken when the period was due in next 2 to 3 days, it will delay your period. If it was taken more than a week before expected period, period should start on or before expected date. You can judge yourself accordingly. Sometimes, the period can start as late as 15 days after pill. You can wait till then and if period does not start, you can get a pregnancy test done to confirm or rule out the same."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 15-year-old female. I weigh 130 pounds and am 5 feet 2 inches tall. I have recently had a red rash that is spread over my cheeks and the bridge of my nose. It has very clean margins and looks a lot like the malar (butterfly) rash that goes along with lupus. However, the blood test that my doctor ordered for lupus came back negative so I am wondering what this could be. I have had two episodes of this rash, the first of which happened about a month ago and lasted for about five days to a week, and a little over a week ago the rash came back. It stings and has gotten dry and somewhat stiff. Though the rash itself is somewhat similar to the ones associated with rosacea and eczema, I do not have any of the symptoms expected with the two conditions. In addition to the rash I have also been having stomach issues which include nausea, vomiting, and a generally upset stomach. On to of these symptoms I am also experiencing fatigue, soreness in my joints, what I believe is Raynaud's phenomenon in my toes. I have also experienced slight dizziness so often upon standing up.","Doctor":"Hi. It looks like the rash one has from lupus (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But you are tested negative for it. Considering your other symptoms it is auto-immune in origin. Other causes could be drug-induced malar rash, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma. In autoimmune diseases, there is a formation of antibodies against your own body substances and cells. It does not have any specific cause. The cause is multifactorial, genetic, environmental, etc. It affects almost all organs in the body. You have to do the following investigations to find the involvement of the particular systems. Complete blood count, ECG, and echo, urinalysis, X-ray chest, blood urea and creatinine, ESR, CRP, liver function test. If the abnormalities are present in any of the above tests, finally we have to do the antinuclear antibody titers, ENA profile, anti-ds DNA antibody, complement levels C3 and C4. NSAIDS, Hydroquinone, and Methotrexate, etc., are commonly used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Nowadays plenty of monoclonal antibody treatments are available. It cannot be cured. You can reduce the severity of the disease and avoid experiencing the symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have these itchy white spot on my penis head and also a rough skin after erected. The white spot will be better after applying Clotrimazole ointment, but I can still see some bumps under the skin.","Doctor":"Hi. Your concern is balanoposthitis. It is a candidal fungal infection which causes secondary irritation and redness. Start using Lulifin cream (Luliconazole) once daily bedtime for 30 consecutive days. Apply Efficort (Hydrocortisone) 0.127 % cream once daily during daytime until redness subsides, then discard it. Check your fasting and postprandial blood sugar levels. It is not contagious and not harmful."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am here to ask some questions regarding HIV and some other possible STDs for the woman having unprotected oral sex (cunnilingus). I tested for HIV after 12 weeks and two days of exposure. I had no sex during this period. The HIV 1/2 rapid screen test showed me a negative result. Does the result conclusive? I consulted a doctor, and she told me that doing a home testing is inaccurate. Is it true? Since, in these three months, I do not have any severe symptoms. Now, it is four months after my exposure. I have small red bumps in the back of my throat. I do not have pain and difficulty in swallowing. Is this a strep throat or pharyngitis? Is it due to STDs? Is it possible for me to have STD symptoms after three months? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Please say whether the throat pain got resolved with medications. If you have it, then it is unlikely to be a cause due to HIV infection. Secondly, the home kit for HIV has a low sensitivity and low specificity. So, it is inconclusive. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a standard test advisable for HIV testing. Since it is four months, the window period for acquiring an HIV infection has overlapped, and hence, having a negative report at this point is very sure to conclude as not having HIV infection. I would suggest you get tested for ELISA now and repeat it after four weeks again or after a month. Also get a swab sampling done for your throat pain and consult a physician."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My reports are as follows. My blood phosphorous level is 4.58 mg, and it was always 3.2 mg. Rest kidney test is fine. Seeing my report, can you please tell me if my kidney is failing? I am too much worried. I am having Metformin 1000 mg as I am prediabetic and Voveron painkiller last week?","Doctor":"Hi. As such increase in phosphorus is not a marker of kidney disease. It can happen due to an increase in the daily products intake, pain-killer intake, and dehydration. I do not find any reason to worry."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 30-year-old female. I weigh about 45 kg with a height of 5'3\\". I am experiencing severe stomachache, hyperacidity, dizziness, and nausea. This is the first time I felt and I feel like there is too much acid on my stomach. What medications can I take?","Doctor":"Hello. You are experiencing dyspepsia, and epigastric pain if I am not wrong. It is due to hypersecretion of gastric acid or due to some insult against the gastric mucosa which is a protective layer of the stomach. This layer gets eroded due to various reasons like alcohol, painkillers, etc. Over secretion of acid might be due to stress, lack of sleep, lack of alkaline food in the diet, etc. So check these factors. Kremil S is not competent. Maalox only gives momentary relief. So let us use PPIs (proton pump inhibitors) for a few days and shut down the acid production significantly. This might give the gastric mucosa some time to heal and become tough again. Remember, these medications which I am going to prescribe are not to be taken perpetually. Take them as advised. Gastritis. Gastritis. Capsule Esomeprazole and Domperidone early in the morning on empty stomach and at bed time. Capsule Lactobacillus one in the afternoon. Discontinue Maalox. Sleep well. Abstain from alcohol for at least 10 days. Stress relief. Continue this treatment for ten days and follow up after that."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My girlfriend had her periods 16 days back but two days back she had a white spotting and today she had blood coming out of her vagina for a second but stopped. Please tell me what does this mean.","Doctor":"Hi. The reason for this kind of bleeding can be some abnormal uterine bleeding or simply ovulation bleeding. Today is her 16th day of period probably ovulation day and her detailed obstetric history is not known. So watch for any pain or repeat episode of bleeding and if so get one ultrasound pelvis done."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 41 years old, male having severe constipation. The stool is very hard. Hence difficulty passing it. Please suggest some good stool softener. Tablet form would be preferred. Any other medicine?","Doctor":"Hello. For that, you should eat high fiber diet like fruits, apple, banana, oranges, green leafy vegetables like spinach, raw cucumber. Avoid smoking if any, refined food, fatty, and oily food. You should have plenty of fluids and regular exercises. Lifestyle modifications are advisable to maintain the response. Also, it is worthwhile to get a thyroid test done if not had recently. In medicines, we usually prescribe tablets like Bisacodyl 5 to 10 mg depending upon the response, bedtime once a day. Also in syrup, there are options like Cremaffin plus 15 to 30 ml bedtime to maintain your stool soft."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had a retinal detachment surgery 7.5 months back with silicon oil. Four months back silicon oil was removed and at the same time cataract surgery was also done. This was my right eye. The vision in the eye is 6/9 with glasses in the operated eye and 6/6 in the other one. Since the first surgery 7.5 months back I am on Predforte eye drops. When I taper them off to 1, the eye starts getting red. My last eye exam was a month back and the retina specialist suggested to have one drop morning and evening for another 14 days. He said there is a subtle infection in the eye. However, when I stopped taking the drops after 15 days, the eye got red again and I restarted it and the redness was gone. I am worried about when I will be able to stop it. Can you please explain what may be the reason and how harmful it is to continue? The eye doctor (retina specialist) asked me to recheck after three months.","Doctor":"Hi. You might be suffering from inflammation, not infection. A steroid is usually given to control inflammation. The principle is to continue on the lowest possible dose of steroid which can keep inflammation in control. In the meantime, it is important to keep an eye on side effects of a steroid-like rise in intraocular pressure. You are on a low dose, you can continue but check with your surgeon periodically. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, For the past few days, I have had difficulty swallowing, a sore throat, and these white spots on the back of my throat that keep getting bigger. I was already tested for streptococcus which was negative and I am wondering what else it could be?","Doctor":"Hello. You seem to suffer from fungal sores and ulceration of oral cavity and oropharynx. I suggest you do a local application of Clotrimazole (Clotrin) gel over the affected area thrice daily after rinsing the mouth with Benzdymine oral rinses. In addition, Tylenol will help in relieving the pain and inflammation. Avoid spicy foods, citrus foods, extra warm foods, masalas, smoke, and alcohol until it gets better. Additionally, take Multivitamin supplements and especially Vitamin B12 supplements till you are better. You may require a course of Fluconazole tablet, which is taken once now and then one more tablet a week later."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I feel a pressure in one of my front teeth. It is not painful and does not hurt to eat. Just feel pressure. I remember biting something the other day and it felt a little like I had bitten it too hard. No visible change to any of my teeth and it is not painful. The pressure is inconsistent.","Doctor":"Hi. I had gone through your question and I can understand your concern. As per your history, it looks because of biting on hard substance, periodontal ligament has been damaged transiently, it is a thin membrane between teeth and bone. There is nothing to worry, it will selfheal within three to four days. Remember that do not keep touching it, this may be enjoyable but it can lead to periodontal tissue damage. Also, take soft foods and do not bite on hard fruits like apple or even hard meat too."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

The most probable problem out there would be a chronic GERD with LPR (chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease with laryngopharyngeal reflux). Let me explain what exactly is happening. Your stomach contains contents that are acidic in nature and is only meant for the stomach, if these content reflux or have a reverse entry into your food pipe (esophagus) or throat which is not meant to handle this acidic pH. This can lead to a chronic inflammation leading to chronic ulcers giving a feeling of something stuck on the throat or the bloaty feeling, repeated belching, or even bad odor in your breath. Yes, esophageal diverticula (outpouchings are a differential diagnosis and have to be checked with contrast barium swallow). The probability of having these outpouchings are less considering as you do not have vomiting or difficulty in swallowing. Please follow some instructions: 1. Maintain a strict diet schedule, and eat on time. 2. Avoid oily, spicy, and cold food items/ beverages. 3. Keep a minimum gap of two hours between your last meal and going to bed. 4.

Keep sipping on warm fluids as much as possible. 8. Avoid exposure to dust by wearing an n95 mask. You can consider the following treatment. Take tablet Pantoprazole with Domperidome combination once in the morning for 20 days, syrup Gelusil or Mucaine gel one teaspoon three times a day 20 minutes before food.

In my opinion, you can continue with the use of knee ROM brace with intermittent knee movements, crutch aided PWB movement for one more week and then crutch aided full weight bearing ambulation. Repeat X-ray after four weeks, and maybe 6 to 8 weeks post-surgery, the patient can be made to ambulate without any support depending upon initial reduction and subsequent healing.

And therefore, the blood and the fluid collects in the body including the lungs. When the fluid collects in the lungs, a person cannot breathe well. Angioplasty is quite a standard procedure for heart attack. It is an urgent procedure for acute heart attack meaning sudden heart attack or a planned procedure in an angina patient.

Considering your age, a likelihood of heart as a cause of pain is less. However, it cannot be ruled out thoroughly, as you have a risk factor of hyperlipidemia. I do not know about the smoking habit or your family history. The next thing is, you should undergo a treadmill test. If it is negative, then it reliably rules out the cardiac cause. For hyperlipidemia, you should be on aggressive lifestyle modification by taking low fat, oily and sweet diet. Do regular exercise every day and avoid drinking alcohol. Also, get your blood pressure checked once. It can be acidity and gastritis especially if you have upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on taking food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning.

Your history suggests that you have steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis.

Regarding frequency of steroid dosing, you can take it up to twice per year, in case of flare of your disease, but it will be better to avoid it if you have a better option (Azoran) because steroid has many long term adverse effects.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have no current medications. Over the past 2 or 3 years, my hearing in my left ear only has deteriorated significantly. I would say it is less than half as good as my right. I went to an ENT doctor, with an audiologist appointment. The audiologist said I had a moderate hearing loss in my left ear. I wish I had the results of the exam for you, but they are around 300 miles away at the moment. After that exam, the ENT doctor said it sounded it was unlikely but I may have a tumor, an acoustic neuroma I believe. He said I should get an MRI or a CAT scan, pretty sure MRI, that would make more sense right? Also, I told him that I have had significant tinnitus for a while and that if I tilt my head to my right side but not my left I get mild vertigo. It seems like I may have misunderstood him and it is likely that I have an acoustic neuroma, but I am curious if there are ways I can rule out other maladies. For instance, I think the hearing loss was significantly worse after I had significant ear pain during an airplane flight. I did not notice any fluid or blood drainage but was wondering if something like an eardrum perforation could have occurred, or just if there are other diagnoses I could test for without paying for an MRI for an acoustic neuroma. Or if there are other roads I could go down beside paying for an MRI for an acoustic neuroma. If it is likely I have an acoustic neuroma, I get an MRI, it confirms I have one, I have already ha ad significant hearing loss for at least a year, can anything even be done to improve my hearing?","Doctor":"Hello. To rule out acoustic neuroma we do need an MRI scan. Acoustic neuroma is a tumor that grows inner to the inner ear where there are a lot of nerves passing by. If the tumor grows and involves the nerves it can cause palsies of the nerves which may be irreversible. The hearing loss you have said does not let us conclude whether it is a conductive hearing loss or a neural. This is also important. If someone can click a picture and send to you it will be really helpful. In addition, I would like to know if you have any vertigo, nausea, a fullness of ear, facial weakness, ear discharge or an earache. It is advisable to get the MRI done without much delay. If the otolaryngologist has suspected acoustic neuroma then it is better to haste the process."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My issue or family issue is how to deal with my sister to get her out of the room and act normal again. I have been praying. I also went to a psychiatrist once but that one session is not enough to answer all my questions about my sister. She is 30 years old. She is not normal and it is breaking our hearts. She literally locks herself in the room the whole entire time, the few times she gets out (she times it while we are asleep) so I did not see her the first three days during my visit to my family. After that, I saw her when she got out to take food from the kitchen. I followed her and I greeted her and asked her to greet me back and give me hug, but she ran back to her room and locked herself. Other two times I followed her and touched her arm softly and I said \\"I need to tell you something dear\\", to try to grab her attention to talk solutions but she did what she has been always doing lately which is walking back fast to the room and locked herself. I could not have time in those moments to even give her the gift I got her and some magazines for her to see the outside world through because she does not have a TV in her room nor any technological gadgets nor a mobile or anything of that sort. Whenever she goes quickly to the kitchen she takes food back to her room and when she opens the room, she locks it back so no one enters her room but we could smell how bad it is because she has been isolating herself for the past seven months in this manner. I do not know what to do. It has been easy for many people, family, friends to tell us that she needs to see a doctor but we all know that. But how can we do that when she refuses to talk to us? One doctor my family went to, urged them to take her by force to the doctor but I refused thinking it is an extreme measure. She has had hallucinations and was on anti-depressants too.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. She is 30 and has isolated herself socially. She is not at all interacting with others. She is showing inappropriateness of emotions. You have mentioned that she once told you that she had hallucinations. What kind of hallucinations she had? I mean what were her complaints at that time. Did she complain that she is hearing some noise or hearing some conversations? She has a history of inappropriate laughter too. Did she ever show symptoms like someone is going to harm or kill her or family? Even she blamed some family member or friend that he or she might be conspiring against her? Does she accept food given to her by family members or she refuses and takes food by own? She is very guarded and is not at all interacting. Sometimes she showed positive symptoms like inappropriate laughter, hallucinations, etc., but the history is not clear. So based upon the information you provided if we make a provisional diagnosis then this goes towards two main possibilities. The first and most common possibility is some psychosis. This might be schizophrenia too. But as I have said the information to make the diagnosis is not adequate. Individuals remain guarded, socially withdrawn to a great extent in schizophrenia. The other possibility is some mood disturbance. She might be severely depressed and having associated psychotic symptoms. If legal issues permit then better to take opinion from a psychiatrist for her. If she does not agree to visit a psychiatrist then you and your family members can take an opinion. So antipsychotic drugs like Olanzapine, Risperidone, etc., can be given to her by mixing with food without her knowledge and she will become compliant to visit a psychiatrist after sometime. You should not delay her treatment and should consult a psychiatrist immediately."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Eight months bank a street dog scratched my hand. I was dumb and stupid enough then. I did not take any vaccines. Now I am very worried and highly panicked. If I take pre-exposure prophylaxis and rabies boosters now, will it save my life? Rabies symptoms have still not appeared in me but I fear that it will appear in future. Please guide me. I do not wanna die.","Doctor":"Hi. Well, rabies virus starts showing its signs in your body between a time frame of 1 to 3 months to one year (depends on type and location of exposure). Now, if you were scratched and there was no bleeding we consider it as category 2 dog bite. Initial symptoms of rabies can be fever with pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensation at the bite site and other signs related to the nervous system. If you do not have the above then relax and yeah next time you are bitten seek immediate medical help and get vaccinated. Well, do keep in mind the above things and do follow the animal behavior next time for any furiousness or abnormality in case of delay of vaccine from your side."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have semen in urine sometimes. While sitting or lying if I concentrate on my penis, I start having strokes. I cannot control in the flaccid position. While I do sit-ups there is a movement in the penis. It started from nightfall and my urge of not to masturbate. It is because of depression only and when I concentrate on something else it stops. If I have a good sleep, it stops. So is psychological problem frank? I am not sure if thinking is much of an issue. I had such erections problems earlier and it was only because of depression but I am not understanding other things. Do I need a doctor? I had a renal transplant nine months back and I was preventing masturbating from happening though I was getting excited many times.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. Lack of masturbation and lack of sex results in a spontaneous flow of semen via urine. This occurs in order to allow new sperm to form. This is a normal phenomenon and this does not cause any effects on health. This will not result in weakness of any kind. The secretion which you have during talking or excitation is nothing but precum. This is a lubricating fluid and this too is a normal thing."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 2-year-old put my mascara wand in his mouth. His teeth and all around his mouth were black.

Mascara contains iron oxide, carbon black along with a base of paraffin or mineral oil. As your child had taken it in his mouth and you already have cleaned it.

The question is what and where the blood is coming from (hemoptysis). For people with a prolonged cough, you can sometimes have a small tear in tissues which leads to a very small amount of blood. This is something that would happen after multiple days of severe coughing. This is a scenario in which an investigation in the source of cough is warranted to treat the underlying problem. If it is a large amount of blood or regular bleeding with coughs, this sounds like something that needs to be evaluated by a physician as soon as possible. There are not many normal reasons for there to be persistent bleeding. Possibilities include infection (TB), lung clots, or bleeding vessels of the esophagus, among others.

I suggest you take a high protein diet preferably if you are a non-vegetarian then take chicken, mutton, eggs daily. Also, try to eat small meals frequently. Take Ensure milk powder twice a day regularly. You must take a high-calorie diet more than 2500 kcal per day.

If there is blood, do not take it lightly and it may require sonography and other tests to find out the cause. If it is bleeding from a private part and if it is not related to urination, then give time for healing and do not have sex for at least four to six weeks.

I am 21 years old and have no history of any diseases and am not taking any medicines or prescriptions for anything. Some symptoms I have are oily skin, deep cystic acne that does not come to a head. I usually break out around my mouth, chin, shoulders, chest, and back. It gets worse around the menstrual cycle. I have irregular periods, they are usually late. I have been taking different natural approaches such as changing my diet and taking Vitamins to control my acne but nothing is working. I feel very depressed and hopeless at this point. I tried about everything to control my breakouts. Some things work at first then my acne comes back with a vengeance. I get cystic acne on my shoulders, middle of my back and lower back. And around my mouth, and when it is the time of the month, I get a big cystic pimple in the middle of my neck. I have searched homeopathic remedies and came across people like me that had successful treatment which made me decide to take this approach.

By medicines, your acne may start discharge and then do not get tensed. It is a process of healing. Along with medicines, avoid junk food (spicy, oily, fat rich), take proper sleep, do not think much.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Also, check for dehydration in the child by keeping a check on the weight of the child. If the weight of the child is dropping drastically it may indicate dehydration. You can continue pre-probiotic for another 2 to 3 days and if you want to be very sure that whether the baby is fine or not you can do CBC, CRP, SGPT and stool routine microscopy for the child."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am pregnant with my first child and I am 39 weeks and 3 days.

This is not crowning, this is the last phase of the second stage of labor when the head of the baby is on your perineum. The rate of contractions will occur once in 2 to 3 minutes and will last for around 30 to 45 seconds. I would advise you to go in, as you have already reached the date, pain has been there for all day (that is quite a lot of time) and you feel they are increasing, along with the pressure feel. Suppose you break out waters, the pain will be even more intense and you will not be able to move out easily.

I get constant pain in my penis and get the feeling of my bladder bursting which I try to relieve by urinating, but when I attempt to urinate, I have to apply a lot of pressure to relieve a minimum of only 30 ml or less of urine. Therefore I am forced to sit on the toilet and pass urine as it reduces the amount of pressure I have to put as compared to standing. While seated and urinating, the pressure I apply also results in me passing bits of stool chips. I have undergone a prostate test whose results are normal, as well as a urine culture test again resulting reports are normal. The report also mentions that the normal capacity of a bladder is about 400 ml whereas my bladder's capacity is only 70 ml stating that my bladder has shrunk. The frequency of my urination is about every 25 to 30 minutes. I get minimal relief from this pain by consuming buttermilk, water or antacid tablets. I have been prescribed to take Urimax 0.4 and Comfora (three capsules a day) for the past six months. On second opinion, I have been suggested to take Solitral 10D. I have also undergone a cystoscopy test and the results are as follows: 1. Pertinent Investigative Data: - Urine routine normal. - Urine culture negative. - Sr. Creatinine 0.8 - Sr. PSA 0.4 - USG suggestive of pre-void 102 cc. Post-void 10 cc. - Urine culture for Koch's negative. - IVP normal. - MCU suggestive of left VUR and a small capacity bladder. 2. Clinical History: Irritative lower urinary tract segment. 3. Gross: Received 4 grey white mucosal soft tissue bits measuring 0.6x0.6x0.2 cm, bladder biopsy. 4. Microscopic: Sections show partially ulcerated bladder mucosa with dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and an occasional lymphoid follicle. There are submucosal concretions noted with a giant cell reaction. No fungal elements seen. No granulomas seen. No epithelial atypia noted. Diagnosis: Follicular cystitis Request you to please shed light on the medication that I am taking and if there are any alternatives that I should look at. Also, I would like to know if I need to undergo any tests again.","Doctor":"Hi. You have a small capacity bladder with irritative and obstructive symptoms. You may require a uroflow to see if your prostate is obstructing or not. I assume that your IVP study is normal and urine AFB has been done on three consecutive days so that tuberculosis has been excluded. Next, you need a full dose of medicines to relax your bladder. Solitral has half the dose of Solifenacin. You also need to make a bladder volume diary. Your cystoscopy if done under anesthesia would have revealed your true bladder capacity. Meanwhile, a full dose of drugs, bladder training, and restricted fluid intake will help. If your prostate is obstructive, endoscopic surgery for prostate will help you to void easier. Take care. Feel free to follow up with a urologist online for further clarification -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 11 years, weight 33 kg, height 134 cm, father's height 165 cm, mother's height 155 cm. The increment in height in the last 2 years was 4 cm/year. Does he need growth hormone therapy? What are the investigations needed?","Doctor":"Hi. Your son's height falls just below the 10th percentile of height for age (WHO standard). Given that your height (parents' height) is in low to mid normal range compared to the average height of the population at large, your son's height is not lagging behind that far. His height gain in the previous two years is on the lower side. However, his main height gain will be in the forthcoming years when he enters puberty. So at this stage, growth hormone therapy is not warranted, unless a recent head injury or a recently developed pituitary gland tumor has put his growth and development at risk. If he does not have a headache, decreased field of vision or seizure disorder or take steroids for any other illness or have kidney or liver disorder, he can be just observed over the next three to six months. Maybe you can assess his nutrition intake, activity level and check his serum IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1), serum bilirubin, SGOT, SGPT, serum protein and albumin, hemoglobin, serum creatinine, free T4, TSH and inform me the reports (just to rule out any major disorder).

I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Except for the lipid profile, other parameters are fine. You should be started on tablet Rosuvastatin (Rosulip) 10 mg bedtime for eight weeks and repeat lipid profile after this time period. You should also have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily, and a high-calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly and BP should not be persistently more than 140/90 mmHg. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and five days a week. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol, if any. There should not be abdominal fat deposition or obesity.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

You are likely to have mixed vaginosis infection both bacterial and fungal which can easily cause cervicitis and is the likely reason you are bleeding since then.

Since stopping I have experienced indigestion. I am wondering how long it will take for the probiotic to be out of my system. Last week I started having some digestive issues. Mainly just pain and pressure in my upper abdomen. I did not experience any diarrhea. I thought I was slightly constipated and did take Miralax one night and eventually, the stool did return to normal. However last week I woke up with awful indigestion. Next day, I had lower stomach cramping the entire day. Later that night the pain was on my lower left side, I decided to go to the ER. There they did urine tests, and did press around my belly and back, and took vitals, everything was normal. I was given Maalox and felt better. The pain eventually went away. However, again last night I woke up with awful indigestion. I recently stopped taking Acidophilus because they were not helping. I am wondering if stopping is contributing to my issues.","Doctor":"Hi. I do not think your indigestion is because of Acidophilus. Also, these probiotics do not get into the system. It just stays in the GI tract. They do not get absorbed. They can stay for a longer period of time and are beneficial. I think all this indigestion-like feeling is dyspepsia, may be non-specific. Just avoid overeating, spicy, and oily food. You can use Nexum 40 mg tablets over the counter for 1 to 2 weeks, every day in the morning 20 minutes before breakfast.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

There are various reasons for the same like food debris in the mouth during sleep, use of some drugs like cholinergic drugs, malaligned teeth, improper lip closure due to forwardly placed upper teeth and suffering from the gastric problem, etc. I need to know the reason whether you are suffering from the above, if any, to suggest you the treatment or remedy. You can have an elaborated discussion with me online to mark out the causative reasons for excessive salivation and subsequent treatment.

Have lots of water and fiber-rich fruits to help regular bowel movements and avoid constipation. For the piles problem, I would advise you to take three doses of Nux Vomica 200 every three days.

I am mostly busy with work. My BP was 116/77. I was diagnosed with vitamin B12, D deficiency three months back. Now it has increased and my BP is 140/80 due to excess stress in work. Now I am going to morning walk daily but a feeling of beats in right chest is there. I think it is due to stress. How to get rid of it?","Doctor":"Hi. You hear your heart beats on the right side. You do X-ray of chest PA to see the heart position. You are suffering from stress and most of your symptoms are related to stress. I have gone through your reports and found it to be fine (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You should control your stress. Do breathing exercise for five minutes two times daily. Attend yoga class. All these will help you to control your stress. Make good friends with whom you can share your problem. Take a vacation from your work, go to hills or sea beach and enjoy with your family the quality times."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a family friend that recently was admitted to hospital for shortness of breath. She was advised that after several examinations that she has a form of cancer. The information that we were provided with was that they were unable to ascertain where or how severe the cancer was. Some confusion over whether it was thyroid or lung cancer and also its placement. The advice given was for her to undertake a bronchoscopy in order to do a biopsy of the lung. She had complications as a result of the bronchoscopy and was put in ICU for observation. That was last week, we have now been told that she will not recover and is too weak to breathe for herself and fight cancer. They have given her 48 hours. I really would like a second opinion because I feel we have not been told the full story. Would you recommend this procedure despite knowing that a patient was under stress with her breathing? Was there another way they could have gone about retrieving what they needed through a different procedure? I just want to quiet the nagging thoughts I have because I feel like this should have been a simple day proceedure.","Doctor":"Hi. Confirmation of any form of cancer is by biopsy only when the malignant cells are visualized under a microscope and reported to be positive. Rest of the radiological test like HRCT and MRI are highly sensitive but not specific. I am assuming that the cancer was either diagnosed by cytology or radiology in her case and they did a bronchoscopy to get the tissue they suspected of being malignant. Usually, broncoscopy is done under anesthesia and does not cause any complication. Probably the cancer had been more advanced in this case or the patient's physical condition was poor but anyhow there is no other way than broncocopic tissue examination to confirm the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, What is the best mouth guard used for teeth grinding? What is the cheapest way available to treat underbite?","Doctor":"Hi. Teeth grinding affects dental health. It is a cause of attrition. If stress is the cause for grinding the teeth, then do regular exercise, yoga, and meditation. Avoid drinks that contain caffeine. Avoid drinking alcohol and smoking, if you have the habit. Take a sufficient amount of water. The best night guard is fabricated by the dentist, after taking an impression. Your dentist fits the mouth guard to protect your teeth from grinding during sleep. There are many methods available for the correction of an underbite, which is cheap and best. Please see your dentist."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have one pupil dilating more than the other in dim light. I noticed it before few months. I suffered from some issues last year. I had vertigo, heart arrhythmia, and anxiety. I consulted the GP, and he told that the condition is nothing to worry. He did not consider it. I am concerned about these symptoms. Recently, I have started to take Sertraline for anxiety. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I have evaluated your eyes and pupils very patiently, and I agree with the findings of anisocoria. Now, there are many causes to have anisocoria such as some medications, nerve palsies, Horner's syndrome, and Addie's pupil. To confirm the diagnosis or the exact cause of anisocoria, we need to check pupillary reflexes, near reflex, accommodation reflex, eye movements, corneal sensations, and visual acuity. You may also need to do MRI of a brain to rule out any intracranial mass or an aneurysm. There is no single disease which explains all your symptoms of anisocoria, vertigo and heart disease like arrhythmia. I would recommend you to relax and get all the above mentioned clinical tests done such as pupillary reflexes (direct and consensual), near reflex, accommodation reflex, convergence reflex, eye movements, visual acuity, and corneal sensations. These are the clinical tests done routinely by an ophthalmologist, and these tests will give us an idea about the cause of anisocoria. Once when the diagnosis is made, we can plan for the treatment. But there is no single disease which explains all these three symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I sat on my testicle before two months, and I experienced an initial sharp pain for a few hours. I went to the ER and did a blood test, urine test and an ultrasound. Torsion, as well as infection, was ruled out. The exact incident occurred before few days. I did a urine test and another ultrasound. Torsion was ruled out once again. When the pain flared up again, I went to the doctor back. Again, I did an ultrasound, urine test, and blood test. Torsion and infection were ruled once again. The doctor pointed out a little bit of fluid around my testicle, and I had no pain. But, still, I have pain in my testicle. What was ruled out with these tests? From where does the pain arises?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This acute testicular pain with normal testis examination and ultrasound report look like simple orchialgia. Ruling out torsion is very important in young males presenting with testis pain. It shows that the testis is not twisted on its own. Pathologic pain has associated redness and swelling. From your report, I can say that you do not have torsion and epididymitis. Young males have simple orchialgia due to muscle tone. You need scrotal support. Take tablet Pregabalin 75 mg at bedtime."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 30-year-old male. I had cheek biting on the left side, and I removed my left upper wisdom tooth before three months. I have a white line and patch adjacent to the lower left wisdom tooth. I also have some white dots over the cheek. I had some sensitivity issue in the left lower wisdom tooth, and I consulted an endodontist. The sharpness of the cusp was reduced, and GIC filling was done for the mild decay. Now, I am eating only on the right side of the tooth. I have a fear of damaging the filling, and so I am eating food on the right side. Now, I do not have pain, but, occasional sensitivity issues. I am advised to have braces after two months. I have an impacted lower left first premolar to erupt. Should I need to conserve the left lower wisdom tooth or can I extract it? I am attaching the images and X-rays. Please give your advice.","Doctor":"Hi. If you have sensitivity on your wisdom tooth, you should re-evaluate the filling. However, if it is not severe and increasing in nature, please wait for sometime, and it can subside on its own. The presence of wisdom tooth will not interfere with the braces treatment. Usually, when the upper wisdom tooth of the same side is removed, it is advisable to remove the lower also, because without any opposing upper tooth, it is impossible to bite and it can cause supra eruption causing other problems. But it can be removed at the time if it causes trouble. It is not a mandatory procedure at this time."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I did a complete blood test, and everything was normal. I did a scanning of the lungs, and it was normal. I did EEG, ECG and again everything was perfect. But I have pressure on my head and face. I have a pain on my head. I do not know why I have this problem. I have difficulty during sleeping. Sometimes, I stay without sleeping for three days. Before two months, I got diagnosed with sinus infection. I took medicines for a month, and I was fine. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. Likely, the cause is chronic sinusitis. You have pressure in face, and head due to an accumulation of mucus in the sinuses due to infection or allergies. Please say whether you have frequent rhinitis or nose blocks associated with it. Also, in some patients, this pressure may increase after bending the head down or when changing the head position. Your inadequate sleep can also cause a headache and eye strain or eye ache. So, you need to have adequate sleep for at least six to seven hours daily. When having difficulty in a vision like blurring while seeing near or far objects, eye-straining on reading, also causes similar symptoms. To confirm it, you should get a facial X-ray done for sinus inflammation and consult an ENT specialist. You may need to take medicines for it. Take Solvin cold (Chlorpheniramine maleate with Paracetamol), Duonase nasal spray (Fluticasone with Azelastine hydrochloride) and Xylometazoline nasal spray to control inflammation and drainage. You can do steam inhalation three to four times a day to get relief from congestion."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have erection problems and dry orgasms sometimes due to neuropathy. I have diabetes for 15 years and on insulin. Recently, I have blood pressure and started taking medication for the same. Cholesterol is also high, but now under control. Do I have a problem with conceiving children?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. I saw your examination report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), and there are some factors that affect your fertility and some abnormalities. First, varicocele may affect your fertility, a dilated vein can be the cause of your oligoozospermia (dry orgasm). Second, semenogram at least 40% of spermatozoids must be motile (in your only 1%) and there are abnormalities in your mophology too, 30% must be normal, in your case, there are 0% with normal morphology. Diabetes may cause abnormalities in your morphology and motility of the semen. Because the characteristic of semen may vary over time and undergone normal biological variability, it is best to repeat the test at least once. If abnormalities persist you should have a urologic exam. I would recommend a urologic exam and consult a fertility specialist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have undergone cervical spine surgery before two years back. Post surgery constipation problem still got worsened. Presently, I am taking Baclofen 5 mg three times a day for the spasticity in legs.

If there is no improvement in two days, you can take two tablets for every 12 hours. This medication can be taken for now and on. Sometimes you may need more fiber to make bulks in the stools. Psyllium Plantago is a natural laxative, and it helps for maintaining an adequate amount of fiber. You can take one tablespoon in a glass of water every morning and then drink another glass of water. You should take at least 1.5 liters of pure water every day. You can add milk of magnesia 15 to 25 ml for every eight hours until the stool gets soft. It has to be taken when there is bad constipation once in a while (two to three days for every ten days)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had an extraction of a molar in the morning, and a bone graft was placed over it. My surgeon placed a collagen plug over it to make the graft to stay in place. Can I have a blood clot below it? I am afraid of getting a dry socket. Last time, I had a dry socket, when I had a wisdom tooth removal, and I am scared. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. First, remove your fear present in your mind. A bone graft present with membrane prevents dry socket formation, and it makes a better environment to have socket healing. Bone graft is not fully utilized in the socket, as it a foreign material. Some amount of graft is rejected in the body. It is a routine procedure of a defense mechanism. In your case, you cannot see blood clots in the socket, as it is covered with a membrane. You have to wait for at least three to five days. Do not try to see it again and again. It can cause a disturbance in the normal healing process. Follow proper oral hygiene and follow all the instructions given by the surgeon. Take medications on time."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother is 45 years old. She suffers from chikungunya. She got this problem due to cold. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Chikungunya is caused due to chikungunya virus, and it spreads through the mosquitoes. It is not caused due to cold. You can have better prevention by having a mosquito control. Mosquito control focusses on eliminating the standing water where mosquitoes lay eggs, and it develops as a larva. You can also have a mosquito control by using insecticides and insect repellants. Fever and joint pain are the main symptoms. It lasts for a week. NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), Naproxen can be taken, or you can take Paracetamol for fever and pain.

I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your B12 level can be high due to an intake of many supplements that contains B12 within it. Your eosinophil count can be considered very high. Usually, it is elevated in the case of allergic inflammation or hives like a problem. Chronic skin lesion like eczema or parasitic infestation can lead to such presentation. So consult a nearby physician for detailed evaluation.

But less than eight hours, the pack came out, and I started to have pain again. I was not given antibiotics or painkillers. What to do?","Doctor":"Hi. You have a dry socket in 6 and 7. It takes time to have good healing. In case of dry socket, socket dressing is an effective treatment. It helps to have fast healing, prevent sockets from having food debris, and it relieves pain.

I also am separated from batchmates.","Doctor":"Hi. You have cleared many exams before to reach till college, so it means you are not a person with low IQ. It does not matter how many times you have failed in the exam. Initially, everyone gets problems if they fail. It does not mean they have lost everything. Actually, you do not have a memory problem, the difficulty is you are not able to concentrate because of all these failures.  Failure is the first step to success. Do not get hopeless, it is normal. Stop imagining hi-fi life in the present. Forget what happened. Start with new confidence. Never lose confidence. Your friends will be yours besides all these passes and fail.

I just want to ask something since I cannot go out for check up. I am delayed for 11 days and yesterday I started to have spotting. It is unusual to me since I know if I have my period. I don't feel any cramps yesterday and even today. The flow is not heavy. I can feel dizziness sometimes however, the result of my PT was negative. Is there any possibility that I am pregnant? My husband and I are hoping to have a baby.","Doctor":"Welcome to icliniq.com. As the pregnancy test is negative it's less likely to be pregnancy.... however inview of false negatives with preg card, do a blood test called serum beta hcg to confirm it..... sometimes cycle can be delayed due to hormonal changes, stress, increase in wt, alteration in the diet pattern ,hypothyroidism etc.... .. if this irregularity continues in subsequent cycles ultrasound pelvis is required to look for the cause... (note - if it's not possible to get blood test done, due to lock down repeat the urine pregnancy test right in the morning (first morning urine) ).hope the suggestion is useful... regards n wishes for u to conceive soon. delayed cycle- hormonal serum beta hcg, TSH, usg pelvis( if irregularity continues) hormonal to review with beta hcg if any queries...."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have a thyroid problem. How can I reduce my weight?","Doctor":"Hi. The best way to reduce weight is vigorous exercise. Go for morning or evening walk (30) minutes. If possible go in the morning and evening also. Do jogging, skipping, swimming if possible as it is a wholesome exercise. You can also do aerobics with music (45 minutes), including warm-up, stretching and cool down phase. Have a balanced diet with no fat content in food. Avoid junk foods, alcohol, and smoking. Have more green vegetables and salads in lunch. Avoid dairy products, avoid sweets and sugars. Increase fibre content like legumes. Take medications if prescribed. Have sugar free with tea or coffee."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 32 years old and suffering from forceful urination and urine direction is towards the left side. I do have itching, burning feeling in urethra, anus, and penis. I have been prescribed Afzoo, Kcit and Cranpac D. That does not seem to be working. I think my symptoms match with urethritis. Additionally, I have been facing this issue since the day. While I was urinating in the morning, I felt some sudden nerve movement.","Doctor":"Hi. Your symptoms suggest either prostatitis or urethritis. We also need to rule out stricture of the urethra. Please share your urine and ultrasound reports. Also get a uroflow test done. A urine culture should be sent if not done till now. What is the duration of symptoms? What is the frequency of urination? How is your flow? Is there any urgency or straining while passing urine? Is there any abdominal or back pain? Let me know all the above. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I went to the ER for shortness of breath. I suffer from panic disorder and hypochondria. My doctor did an EKG and released me and told me it was benign. I saw my QTc was 470. Is this correct? She told me there was a benign ST elevation. I am so nervous. Please help me. Is this EKG normal? Do I have a prolonged QT?","Doctor":"Hello. No, it is not a long QT (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Manually, QTc fine. There are S waves in lateral leads suggestive of some conduction delay and early stages of RBBB (right bundle branch block), which can also be seen normally in some individuals and more common in athletes. So, at present, there are minor changes in ECG which are fine to have and does not suggest any particular abnormalities. However, you may need echo if clinically indicated like having consistent shortness of breath on exertion rather than panic attack, or any other symptoms suggestive of heart disease. So, overall should be considered as benign."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a question regarding the Schwarz appliance. I have been wearing it for a couple of weeks now, and I have noticed that, on expanding the upper palate, the palate has come down and it became less shallow. Why is it so? Is it a good thing to have the palate coming down? How should be the palate usually, when you are not wearing the retainer? Shallow or more flat? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. As a part of our body, palate comes in many shapes and sizes. It may be deeper, more shallow, flatter and it may include a torus palatinus. This appliance, which, you are using now, modifies your palate and it helps to erase some orthodontic problems. As long as the age is concerned, when the body growth ends, the palate gains a standard size, and this application can make it flatter than it is used to be. You can consult your orthodontist and check it whether everything is fine."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been dealing with sinus issues pretty much all fall and winter. Three weeks ago I finally decided to head to the doctor and was prescribed a Z-pak for my sinus infection (main symptoms were congestion, ear pressure, and lethargy, tiredness). After the Z-pak I was feeling much, much better. Essentially back to normal physically. Now, around two weeks post-antibiotic treatment, I am dealing with some small lingering symptoms, increased mucus in the morning, ear pressure in the mornings and evenings, and a nose blow or two of light yellow snot (this was thicker before antibiotics). My question is whether it is worth going back to the doctor to get another round of antibiotics to finish it off or is this something my body will slowly get rid of in some time? I certainly do not want to take another unnecessary course of antibiotics. However, I do want to get rid of the symptoms. I am currently using Flonase in the morning.","Doctor":"Hello. You do not need to go back to the doctor for antibiotics. If you were to come to me at this point, I will examine you and make sure the disease process has reduced. And if everything goes well, I will prescribe you some mucus lightening agents with anti-allergic and continue the spray. Mucus lightening agents are Ambroxol or N-acetylcysteine. Ambroxol 30 mg can be taken twice daily for 3 to 4 days or you may take 75 mg (Ambroxol sustained release) once daily for 3 to 4 days and thereafter continue either of these regimens till you have phlegm. Anti-allergic is Deslor (Desloratadine 5 mg) taken once daily or Levocetirizine 5 or Cetirizine 10. Add Singulair 10 mg once daily with these. These two you may have to take till winters resolve. Continue Flonase spray as prescribed. Can try some nasal douching once or twice daily to help alleviate the symptoms. Saline douching can be done. Nasowash is a premixed sachet with saline powder which you gotta mix in water and douche the nose."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Behind my bottom right molar, there is an open sore, and it feels like something is tearing out. It is swollen over my molar too. There is a white discoloration around the sore, and back of my throat hurts on the same side. It hurts badly. I have difficulty in swallowing and in eating foods. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You have not mentioned the duration of your problem. It can be due to third molar impaction. When a wisdom tooth comes out from the oral cavity, sometimes it makes a problem. But if you have a difficulty with swallowing, then you should go to a local medical emergency. You can have a localized infection. A dental X-ray can help you. It can be a pericoronitis or due to a third molar impaction. You can take antibiotics. You can remove the impacted tooth after seeing the X-ray. The affected area should be clean. Follow proper oral hygiene and do not touch the affected area. Take a soft diet and do not take hot food. Do not apply force or pressure on the affected area."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a small bubble-like growth in the back of the throat near tonsils. It flares up with irritation during coughing, grunting, and when I do exercise in the early morning. I snore at the night time, and I have heartburn. I consulted a doctor, and I was prescribed with Prilosec. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Please send a picture of your throat."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I guess my husband has seen my left eye goes inward a lot and I can also notice it now. What could this be? I am worried about it.","Doctor":"Hi From your description, I can say that you are suffering from esotropia (an inward deviation of eyes). And from the fact that your husband had to notice it, tells me that you do not have any other problems like double vision. So you may be suffering from accommodative esotropia. If in case you are having double vision, the cause for this most probably is a nerve palsy. At your age, there could be two main causes of accommodative esotropia. Have you recently had a fever or have any sleep deprivation or are you dieting? Such stresses and similar issues can cause the mechanisms which keep your eyes straight to not work to their fullest extent. This is the commonest cause that we see. Have got any blurred vision or pain on your eyebrows? If so, you may need glasses to correct your esotropia. A simple way to find out if you need glasses is to do a pinhole test. Take a piece of paper, poke a small hole through it with a pen tip and try to see letter or objects that are around 6 m or 20 feet away through the hole. If you are able to see things clearly through the hole than without it, it means you may need glasses. Wearing glasses of appropriate power helps to correct the problem in a majority of patients. There are no home remedies for this condition that are known to give good relief from symptoms, although reducing near work, getting adequate sleep and relaxation techniques may work. A visit to your optometrist, especially if you have symptoms of pain along your eyebrow or see better through a pinhole is advisable. If you do have double vision, seeing an ophthalmologist might be suitable."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 36-year-old male. I was a daily drinker of hard alcohol for the past four years. I am in depression and anxiety. I consulted a doctor. The doctor gave me Zoloft and Propranolol. Before few days, I have removed a large ganglion cyst from my right wrist. I made a step to stop the habit of drinking alcohol. I started to have sweating from my head profusely and consistently. I had it for two weeks. Now, the sweating from my head has got subsided, and it moved to my legs. I tested for STD and HIV. It came negative. Why do I have sweating like this? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your problem, and I can understand your concern. Yes, these symptoms are due to alcohol withdrawal. As you have stopped drinking alcohol, you can have these symptoms along with other symptoms such as tremor, palpitations, anxiety, and other severe withdrawal symptoms such as seizure and delirium. Withdrawal symptoms usually decrease in intensity by one to two weeks. You can take Thiamine and Benzodiazepine. Benzodiazepine help in reducing these symptoms and promote good sleep. Thiamine is vitamin which is usually deficit in an alcoholic. As you have abstinent around two weeks, you need only a low dose of Benzodiazepine. It will provide adequate sleep and also cause a decrease in sweat. Take tablet Trazodone. It also helps in sleep. You can consult a doctor for a prescription."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have done a root canal before few years. But it fell off, and nothing has been there for a few years. This morning, when I woke up, I saw a black pointy substance sticking out on my gum. What is it?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). On looking your tooth and after going through your complaint, there is a retained root piece. It is left behind there. There is nothing to worry. You need to extract it soon from your dentist. Root canal treatment generally fails when the tooth is not capped. Since it has fallen on its own, the top portion of the tooth has come off leaving the root stump. In some instances, you can see it after a long time due to gum recession."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, Almost 40 days back I saw bright red drops of blood coming out when I was passing the stool, I saw blood(bright red/red) in my stool for next two days and then the problem went away but I became conscious.  Since past week I'd noticed very small amount of blood in my stool.But last night I saw my stool covered in bright red/red blood. I am also constantly seeing mucus/jelly type substance in my stool. One other thing I am worried about is I often see grey/dark grey liquid thing on my stool I am not sure its blood.  I do feel fatigued, but I am not feeling any kind of pain anywhere in my body. Even when passing the stool I dont feel any kind of pain. But my urge to poop has increased lately.  My age is 23 and weight is around 77 kg my height is 6 ft.","Doctor":"Hello dear, hope you are fine. The presentation you described is likely to be a hemorrhoids (biles), that causing blood in the stool. The fatigue you described maybe due to loss of blood, that caused anemia. I recommend that to confirm the diagnosis, to be examined by a surgeon, so to make sure it's only hemorrhoid, and no other masses there causing your symptoms. I also recommend to have blood test, CBC , so to check your hemoglobin. once diagnosis is confirmed, we will discuss the management (which mostly include having high fiber diet and oral laxatives)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

With your descriptions and given picture, it seems you have a hypertrophic scar (raised scar due to excess collagen deposits). If you will not treat them, it will remain as such, but rarely can it subside too. It is a reaction pattern of the body to injury.

I have bleeding after sex for a few years. It does not happen every time. I consulted a doctor, and I got tested for STI. The results came negative. The doctor did a physical examination and told me that everything is fine. I also had constipation for a week. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Having bleeding after sex is not normal. The reasons are multiple. It can be due to STD (sexually transmitted diseases), PID (pelvic inflammatory disease), cyst near the vaginal opening, and trauma due to vigorous sex. Since you have negative results for STD, then there is nothing to worry. I would suggest you use lubricants to have proper lubrication. Dryness of vagina or rough sex can also cause bleeding after sex. If you are allergic to lubricants, then it is better to wait for a proper stimulation with the right use of foreplay before having intercourse."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My gums are itchy after eating. I used mouthwash. After using it, I usually rinse my mouth with water. I started to have a burning sensation in my gums after using mouthwash. But still, my gums are itchy.","Doctor":"Hi. You have gingivitis. You have itching sensation after having meals is because of the periodontal pocket presenting with a gap between the teeth and gums. Please mention about the mouthwash used whether it is Chlorhexidine or H2O2 (Hydrogen peroxide). If you use H2O2, it should not be used more than 5 % concentration. Sometimes, mouthwash can cause a chemical burn.

It could be due to some medicines like Iron supplements or NSAID analgesic or antiplatelet drugs, etc. If you are taking any of these drugs, stop them.

I was told today that it is because my sinuses are so low and they suggested I get a sinus lift, bone graft, and implant. I have terrible dental anxiety (my blood pressure goes up just thinking of going to the dentist) that I really do not want to go through all this if I do not have to. I did some research and it sounds much more involved than I think I can handle, not to mention the cost involved. I am 51 and not really worried about having an implant put in because of the cost as well. What I want to know is what would happen if I do not get the sinus lift? Will it eventually calm down or will it get worse? Before I agree to this procedure, I really want to know all my options. I understand that dentists believe that implants are the best but this is an involved procedure that costs a lot of money and downtime that I really cannot afford.","Doctor":"Hi. Well, if the sinus is low, then sinus lift procedure is a must to place an implant. Without sinus lift, an implant cannot be placed. It is a surgical procedure that can be very effectively done by an oral surgeon or a trained implantologist, so you need not be so worried about it. Can you please tell what do you have just irritation in the extraction area or there are associated symptoms like pain on the cheek around the nose or nasal congestion, etc.?

Do you have any advice on home remedies and medication to help her get rid of the pain?","Doctor":"Hi. Growing pain are a common cause of leg pain in children. These pains are muscle aches that can occur in thighs, behind the knees, or the calves. Other possible causes of leg pain that may be more serious can include juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), lupus, Lyme's disease, and leukemia. If the pain is prolonged, fever, severe pain, rashes, sluggish or inactive then it is to worry about. But not in your daughter's case. Here some tips which surely will help to treat the pain. Treatment of growing pains depends on how much pain your child has. The following things may ease discomfort and help your child feel better. 1. Massaging the legs. 2. Streching the leg muscles, though it is difficult for younger kids, need to do it slowly. 3. Placing a warm cloth or heating pad on the sore leg.

I have had chronic sinus infections. Currently, I am taking Doxycycline 100 mg, twice a day for three weeks, for an upper respiratory infection. I am now on my second week of antibiotics.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Overall, it is fine with some abnormalities. Firstly, your potassium is high which is likely a false positive report due to hemolysis of RBC. So, nothing to worry about it. However, better to get reconfirmed. Next is your, SGOT and SGPT, which indicates liver injury and the most probable reason for such mild elevation is fatty liver, for which you need to have a healthy lifestyle, low fat and oily, calorie diet and weight loss if you are overweight. Also, ultrasound of liver is advisable to confirm fatty liver. Also, it is better to obtain hepatitis viral profile (hepatitis B and C test) to rule out the possibility of hepatitis. Next is your WBC in urine which are borderlinely elevated suggests a possibility of UTI. Although it is not significantly elevated. Also, Doxycycline will work over it. So, you may just repeat urine routine examination if you develop any symptoms of UTI like burning, increased frequency, etc. Mild ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) elevation may be due to upper respiratory infection. Rest of your blood parameters are fine and figures in red are not necessarily abnormal. In the CT scan, cysts are associated with sinusitis and can be observed. Also, lung nodules and ovarian cyst are also commonly found and need no specific treatment other than observation. Also, while obtaining an ultrasound of the liver, it should also include ovaries to characterize those cyst better. So, overall, findings in CT are benign and does not appear worrisome. However, once get examined by a local doctor for complete evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 14 years old. I have pain in my canine tooth due to a cavity.

So for one month, you must not eat too hot or too cold foods. Please mention about the treatment taken for the tooth. If you have filled the tooth, then there is no need to worry. It subsides with time. Kindly fill your teeth soon. If it is not filled, then you can have continuous pain in the tooth.

Although we did have anal at times and I cannot be 100 % sure that the condom was there. I have also had a parasitic infection which affects my scalp for a couple of years.

I have had occasional IV therapy and a few injections. I have never shown any symptoms. I am also anemic.","Doctor":"Hi. For condoms to be effective, it has to be a latex condom used consistently and correctively and a newer condom for each sexual act. There should not be any break or it should not have slipped off during the act. If all the steps had been followed, then only it is said that 98 to 99 % effective in the prevention of STI and HIV. Unfortunately, condoms are not used properly resulting in failure rates. The tests which you underwent for HIV are highly sensitive and specific. There is no chance of mimicking any other infection.

On the first day, I was given 20 units, and on the next day, I was given 40 units. Will it cause any harm to my pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi. Corparin (Enoxaparin) has low molecular weight. It blocks the formation of blood coagulation proteins, and it prevents the formation of blood clots. So the blood flow to the baby will be good. There will not be any rejection of the baby tissue by your body. Thus it reduces the chances of abortion. It is especially useful if you have SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) or APLA syndrome (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome) or history of having repeated abortion or history of having an abortion after seeing the baby's heartbeat in a previous pregnancy. The effective dose of the drug is 1 mg by kilogram body weight, once a day. It is given subcutaneously. Usually, we can take 40 mg per day. Duration of action of this medicine is 24 hours if it is a prophylactic dose. If it is a therapeutic dose, it is given twice a day (if you had a history of thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis). A single change of dosage will not make any significant difference. Try to have a right dose of 40 mg per day from the next dose. Do not worry about the previous dose as you cannot change it. Just do everything right from the next dose. You and your baby will be fine."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 23 years old female. I have PCOS. I was a heavy coffee drinker before knowing this condition. But I have controlled it. I am taking black coffee once a week. Is it fine to have a coffee when having PCOS?","Doctor":"Hi. Coffee is a substance that increases the insulin resistance immediately after consumption. In PCOD, the insulin resistance is high. But having one cup per day will not be very harmful. Usually, PCOD (polycystic ovarian syndrome) is associated with overweight and with a family history of diabetes. You seem to have a lean type of PCOD. Try to have a controlled diet, high protein diet, low cholesterol, fat, and sugar. Avoid eating junk food. Do regular exercise. You may not be gaining weight, but your blood cholesterol may be the culprit. For medical management, take tablet Metformin SR 1000 mg once at night daily. It is used for treating diabetes, but it will reduce insulin resistance. Have a birth control pill like Dronis 30 or Doris or Tarana or Yasmin (contains Drospirenone) cyclically for three to six months. Have the tablets for 21 days and have a break of seven days. Start a new one from the eighth day. Your periods will become regular, and a hormonal balance can be attained."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

From your history, I have noted that your mother was diagnosed with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and was on insulin since one month. Now on review, yesterday it was found that it is under control with the present dose of insulin. Coming to your concern, insulin will not cause fever, whatever dose you are taking.

It hurts me a lot, and I have sensitivity in the tooth. The cold air coming from outside kills me. My head and right ear are also aching for the past couple of days. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have mild inflammation in the gums. Your front teeth are not organized in the arch. Please send a front view of your anterior teeth. You need a clinical examination followed by a dental X-ray for estimating the bone level and the grade of tooth mobility. There is a possibility to save your tooth. You need oral prophylaxis, and you can have a flap surgery for grafting (after estimation if there is a bone loss). Avoid doing hard brushing. Follow these oral hygiene instructions. Maintain your oral hygiene by cleaning your teeth and tongue properly. Brush your teeth two times a day with a soft toothbrush. You can rinse your mouth with warm water mixed with a pinch of salt, or you can use a good antiseptic mouthwash. These instructions help you to maintain oral hygiene.

I have never taken B12 supplements. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Do not be scared. Repeat the tests soon. A raised B12 can happen due to laboratory error. Even after that, if you have SGOT (aspartate transaminase) above SGPT (alanine transaminase), you should do a USG (ultrasound) abdomen. A raised SGOT above SGPT of about 2:1 ratio suggests an alcoholic liver disease. I do not know about your drinking habits. A chronically elevated SGOT above SGPT can also occur due to nonhepatic causes like hypothyroidism and in some myopathies (muscle illness). You should get your tests repeated along with serum TSH levels, complete blood count and kidney function tests. Serum B12 is metabolized in the liver, and its excess is excreted through kidneys."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 26 years old female. I have an abscess in my tooth for over a year now.

How long will it take to spread throughout the body?","Doctor":"Hi. There is a less chance to have the infection spreading to the whole body. But, sometimes, it happens when the swelling gets increased and when the fever becomes uncontrollable for two to three days. There is a chance to have a cystic lesion due to the chronic infection. You can treat it either by doing a root canal or get it removed as soon as possible. During the meantime, take Augmentin 625 (Amoxycillin with Clavulanic acid) twice daily for five days. It will eradicate your infection at this stage, and it prevents further spread."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 19 years old. The area surrounding my urethra is enlarged.

We went to the hospital immediately. They gave two tablets to my father. After a couple of hours, he was better. So, we came back home. Please tell me medicine or home remedy to overcome these problems.","Doctor":"Hi. From your history, it seems that your father has angina pectoris. Angina pectoris is not a heart attack, but it is a chest pain that occurs while exerting such as walking at a high pace, climbing stairs, during emotional stress and relieved by rest or taking tablet Nitroglycerine under the tongue. If this pain occurs more and more frequently or with less exertion or at rest, then there is something to be worried.

I am 15 years old. My height is 5'6 and I weigh about 200 pounds. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Abnormal uterine bleeding is the most common side effect of Depo-Provera therapy, especially in the early months of use. It is a problem whenever bleeding continues for more than 14 days, is heavy, or symptoms such as pelvic pain accompany it. Bleeding irregularities that typically occur may include breakthrough bleeding (you are having this), spotting between periods, prolonged periods lighter or heavier periods than normal, lack of period (usually after one year). Some women with 8-10 days of bleeding over two weeks are administered tablet Ethinyl estradiol for 10 days and bleeding generally stops in five days. Other physicians prescribe an estrogen patch. If estrogen is contraindicated, patients are given 800 mg of Ibuprofen three times a day for five days. In all cases of heavy bleeding apparently related to Depo-Provera use, other causes (e.g., cervical malignancy, uterine fibroids, sexually transmitted diseases) should be ruled out before treatment. Depo-Provera acceptors can anticipate irregular bleeding as long as for one year and learn to accept it. If not too severe, this is the most effective management strategy. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant?

It is less likely to be a viral infection as the temperature is quite high. It may be a viral bug, and it can be worsened after the administration of the steroid. Do not give steroid without a prescription to the child. Do a respiratory PCR, and it helps to find the exact cause of the same.

I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from shortness of breath, chest tightness without any cough, and cold. Shortness of breath, chest tightness can result from some conditions which are mentioned below. Anxiety is a common condition associated with chest tightness, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, sweating, nausea, etc. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) occurs when stomach acid travels back up from the stomach to the esophagus and associated with chest tightness, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, etc. Muscle strain typically occurs from intense activities like reaching or lifting when twisting related with the same clinical features. Costochondritis is the inflammation of the cartilage in the rib and associated with the same type of features. Even PUD (peptic ulcer disease), valvular heart diseases, pulmonary HTN (hypertension), esophageal rupture, pericarditis, hiatus hernia, etc can cause chest tightness with shortness of breath. Treatment depends on the causes. So you should undergo ETT (exercise tolerance testing), echo, endoscopy of upper GIT (gastrointestinal tract), barium swallow test, CBC (complete blood count), etc for detection of underlying causes which are responsible for your sufferings. You should also undergo FEV1 (forced expiratory volume), ABG (arterial blood gas) analysis, spirometry for pulmonary function test, reversibility test, etc for the diagnosis of bronchial asthma as your pulmonologist has diagnosed earlier according to your prescription.

You can take tablet Rantac before breakfast and dinner. If the crack is present in a front tooth or back tooth, consider going to the dentist to examine the condition. If it is present in a front tooth, you can treat it by bonding and root canal treatment can also be done. A crown can be placed over it for esthetic purpose. You can go for an implant also. If it is present in a back tooth, you can do a root canal treatment, and it can be managed by placing a crown over it. If the crack is too difficult to be handled by root canal treatment, then it can be extracted."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have difficulty in taking a deep breath. I feel uncomfortable. My uric acid and cholesterol levels are at a higher range than normal. What can I do to normalize my breathing?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have an LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol of 161 mg/dL. You can manage it by taking tablet Atorvastatin or tablet Rosuvastatin 20 mg at night for a month and see for improvement. Also, have a walk for half an hour a day. It helps you. You can have difficulty in having deep breathing due to thickened pleura. You can take a painkiller for a week. Please consider taking these drugs after consulting your local physician."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I fell sick seriously before 13 years. I have lost my weight after that. It was due to sunstroke, and I am facing digestive issues after having it. I have a heaviness in my chest. I consulted a doctor and checked it. There was no infection. I find difficult to gain weight after having digestive problems. Please suggest me a permanent cure.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. You are thinking in the right way. Indigestion may affect weight gain. Your lifestyle, food habits and lack of physical activity may cause indigestion, and it leads to acidity. Take the following ayurvedic medicines and follow these instructions. Take Chitrakadi Vati (Chitraka with Vida Lavana) two tablets and chew it before food. Take Avipattikar Churna (Trikatu with Haritaki) three grams with Kamadugha Rasa (Amrutha satwa with Svarna Gairika) one tablet twice a day after meals. Take Drakshasava 15 ml (Draksha with Lavanga) twice a day with an equal amount of water half an hour after meals. Take these medicines regularly for one month. Avoid eating spicy and fried junk foods. Avoid smoking and drinking if you have these habits. Do regular kapalbhati, Mandukasana, and pranayamas like anuloma vilom and Nadi shodan. Do these things and provide your valuable feedback after fifteen days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Is it safe or risk to my healing process, if I smoke marijuana following a root canal treatment?","Doctor":"Hi. It is not safe to smoke marijuana after a root canal treatment. It can increase the pain in the root canal treated tooth. It delays the healing process, and it causes pain. If there is a pain, you can consider taking medications prescribed by your dentist. Stop smoking marijuana, and it is not good for your oral health now. Frequent smoking of marijuana causes dry mouth, and you are at high risk of developing gum disease. Avoid smoking marijuana, and it is good for your health."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I gave birth to my child before four weeks. I am providing breastfeeding to my child from her birth. My breastfeeding was fine before three days. But now, my milk supply has got dropped. My baby seems to have a loss of weight, and she is not peeing often. Yesterday, she pooped a light green colored poop. She is not sucking as long as she was before. But she sleeps up to two to three hours. I am well hydrated, eating well and resting well. I am not taking medication. What is the cause of having a reduction in milk production in me? I am worried. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Start giving top feeds to the child for some time and take some days off from breastfeeding. Weight loss and a reduced urine output of the child is because of low milk intake. Low milk production may occur due to many reasons, the most common one being stress. So take rest for some time and start giving top feeds to the baby. It will provide benefits to both of you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

It started 4 months ago, one morning I woke up and blow up my nose with yellow/greenish mucus and blood. I was having it only in the morning. I didnt had any other symptoms except feeling tired. I took advil sinus and used seawater nasal spray. It lasted couple weeks. After I only had a bit mucus dripping my throat when I woke up, but generally felt well, until couple months after I started to hurt and feel pressure in my inner right eye. I went to walk in clinic and got prescribed Amoxicillin/Potassium Clav for 7 days. My eye got better, but after I stopped antibiotics, after couple days I started to feel unwell again, so I contacted another doctor online and he prescribed me another antibiotics Clarithromycin 500 mg for 10 days. After I finished them, again the same. One day past and I didnt felt well. I was feeling tired, pain in my nose, my ears, even dizzy, my body temperature was higher than regular 37.2. So I contacted a nurse online and she told me that probably antibiotics doesnt work, because I had viral infection and told me to avoid diary, take vitamin C, D and probiotics( I was taking them and with antibiotics). It past two weeks generally I feel better, but still have stuffy nose in the morning with a bit yellow mucus, hurt my nose, or feel pressure in it. But I started to worry, because I started to have headaches on top of my head sometimes going to the back part and sometimes tingling feeling in the left side of my head, also I feel my heart rate is higher, specially in the morning. I already thinking maybe I am having anxiety, when I read what can happen if you dont treat sinus infection. I am using corticosteroid nasal spray, seawater spray, neti pot. Should I contact again doctor online and ask for more antibiotics? I guess with all this Coronavirus, I cant get referral to ENT specialist .Do you have any advice how I should treat it?","Doctor":"Hi, Looks like your having a chronic allergic problem out there. Now there are certain things which have to be understood in detail. 1. Allergic rhinitis is an immune complex issue which is innately present and starts showing symptoms at one particular age. It basically is a hyper responsiveness to something which is foreign and has accidentally entered into you nose causing cascade of chemical events leading to nasal congestion, watery nasal discharge, sneezing, itching in eye and nose, fullness in the ear and often leads to sinusitis causing heaviness in the area of your face involving the frontal and maxillary regions besides your nose. 2. Antibiotics has a limited role here unless it's an infection that we are are treating 3. You have to wear a n95 mask and not allow the triggering factor to enter into your nose in the first place (trigerring factors range from dust, pollens, animal fur, fumes, strong odours etc and the list is endless), allowing the triggering problem to keep entering your nose is just going to prolong the problem through life and no medication will ever be effective 4. Nasal steroid sprays have definelty a role to play, I usually suggest a combination of a topical steroid such as fluticasone propionate along with a antihistamine such as azelastine hydrochloride 2 puffs in each nostril 2 times a day 12 hrs apart for 3 months straight 5. Certain antiallergics containing fexofenadien 120mg one tab two times a day 12hrs apart for 20 days is effective. Antibiotics like clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day if taken have to used for 2 long months to be extremely effective(I give clarithromycin for both its antibiotic and immunomodulatory activity, later of which is more important) 6. Salt water gargles 8 to 10 times a day for 10 days, sipping on warm water, steam inhalations avoiding cold, spicy and oily junk food goes a long way, smoking and alcohol to be completely avoided as it slows down the mucociliary activity and leads to secretions inisde your nose causing a severe sinusitis and its related problems. Hope this advice helps"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have pain in the last tooth of the upper jaw. Please suggest me some medication to get relief.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your tooth structure is fine. But third molars are always susceptible to infection. So do not worry and pain will get reduced soon. Report to a nearby dental hospital for radiograph after three days. Thus, if there is any caries, it can be detected and addressed accordingly. Take these medications for pain for three days. Take tablet Ordent (Ofloxacin 200 mg with Ornidazole 500 mg) twice daily for three days. Use Hexidine mouthwash once daily and rinse for 15 seconds in the mornings for 15 days. Take tablet Ketorolac 10 mg as needed.

I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have raised TSH levels. But it is not significant enough to necessitate treatment. You can repeat your thyroid function test after three months again to make sure that it has not risen further. Regarding your hair fall, it depends on the thyroid function also. You can take tablet Zinc gluconate 100 mg once daily for two months for your hair fall. You can use Minoxidil 2 % hairspray for your scalp for four months. Use it with care and avoid having contact with your face. Try to avoid having pollution effects on your scalp."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was given with Polyethylene glycol for 40 days before undergoing endoscopy and colonoscopy procedures.

Is it normal to notice it? Could it be a sound of normal blood flow near the ears?","Doctor":"Hi. Hair cells are hearing cells inside the inner ears provided with cilia, and when vibrated, it stimulates auditory impulses. Yes, these cells have a unique sound, and it will not be audible to us. It needs a high technology device to pick it. Tinnitus has a lot of causes. First, you need to perform tympanometry and pure tone audiometry.

Do I have to give vaccination to my baby?","Doctor":"Hi. A cat has scratched your child, and it has not caused any barrier disruption or wound or bleeding. But still, it is advisable to clean the area with running water and soap. Apply some antiseptic in the area. Rabies is generally transmitted by animal saliva when it comes in contact with disrupted skin barrier and wound formed by the bite. In your case, you are safe from rabies, and rabies vaccine is not required. The scratch caused by a cat generally causes cat scratch disease. It causes scratching of the skin barrier and makes a wound. This causes infection with some bacteria like streptococci. You should wash the area properly and apply antiseptic. If there is a wound, you must give antibiotics. A tetanus vaccine is required when your child is not adequately immunized till date."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My baby is six months old female.

During that time, my condom was out and went inside of her without our knowledge. I did an ejaculation, and so she took one I-Pill on the evening. Now, we are worried about unwanted pregnancy. She says that her breasts have become big and her nipples are giving pain. Is this a symptom of pregnancy? Will that one I-Pill works? Can she take one more I-Pill now? Please advise us.","Doctor":"Hi. If she has taken I-pill (Levonorgestrel) in a proper dose within 48 to 72 hours of unprotected sex, without any vomiting, then it will work, and she will have bleeding within one to two weeks. Please mention about the menstrual history. It would be better, and I can guide you further. If it was not a fertile period of her cycle, then the chance to have pregnancy is less. You can check serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) if she does not get withdrawal bleed in three to four days. Due to externally induced hormones, she can have engorged breast. Externally induced hormone interferes with the periods to prevent conception by stopping fertilization, ovulation or implantation. I-pill is beneficial in the first 48 to 72 hours of post unprotected penetrative sex. It is already a week.

You seem to be very sensitive and anxious to it. But usually it is seen that with each subsequent episode of administration of general anaesthesia these effects tend to decrease in severity. So if last time you had vomiting postanaesthesia this time it will be less severe in terms of no. Of episodes etc. This will reduce your discomfort. Also if you may have prexisting GERD or gastroduodenal ulcer , gastritis. These may also cause nausea vomiting postoperative. So I would advice discuss issues with your anaesthesiologist and surgeon. Nausea, vomiting can be taken care of by medicines like proton pump inhibitors, H2antihistaminics, antiemetics which will be give by your physician in recommended doses. Some pre-op anxiolytic medicines on night before surgery will help you reduce anxiety.

What can I do? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. There is sudden hair loss in patches, and it is known as alopecia or spot baldness. It can occur due to autoimmune issues, psychological stress or fungal infection. It can revert. According to Ayurveda, leech therapy may help you to have regrowth of hair.

Your symptoms are related to anxiety or peripheral neuropathy. I have reviewed all your tests, (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are perfectly normal. You have vitamin B12 level in a higher range, and it is not a problem. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing nerve conduction studies to investigate for neuropathy. I would also recommend checking magnesium plasma levels. If all these test results are normal, you can consider anxiety as a possible cause of your symptoms. In such a case, I would recommend adding Pregabalin or Gabapentin to your current therapy.

It was my first pregnancy after trying to conceive for ten years. As a part of my miscarriage treatment, I was supplied with Misoprostol pills (200 mg each). I never ingested it as my miscarriage passed naturally. Last week, my period was late for a couple of days. Pregnancy symptoms were not seen and thought that I just had delayed menses. Before two days, I took a full dose of Misoprostol to induce menstruation. I bled for eight hours with a medium to heavy flow with some minor clots. After this, the bleeding got stopped, and I thought about pregnancy. I checked it, and the test result came positive. I read that Misoprostol can cause congenital disabilities and I am extremely distressed. Can I have damage to the fetus? It is five weeks and one day from my last period. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, for delayed periods, you should not take Misoprostol. If you have delayed menses, you should confirm pregnancy first and then you can choose other Progesterone-like tablets to induce menses. Secondly, it is true that Misoprostol can cause congenital disabilities if taken in early pregnancy. But not in all case. Now, do sonography to see whether the pregnancy is good or not. If there is no pregnancy, it can be expelled out. As you had a lot of clots, it can be expelled out. There are more chances for you to have an abortion. In case, if the pregnancy is safe, a decision should be made for continuing pregnancy. It depends on you and your husband. But if there is any genetic damage present in the baby, it can cause irreversible damage to the baby. It may be or may not be there. There is no other practical way available to declare that the child is 100 % healthy. If you both plan to continue, you have to be prepared for a healthy as well as for an unhealthy baby. Chances are 50 to 50. As you do not have a child, and as your age is increasing, it is a tough situation to decide to have a child. It is in your hands to decide the future and the preparation to handle anything. You do not know whether you will become pregnant or not next time. So think all the possibilities. Consider your situation, financial status, mental preparation, and eagerness for a child. Think and decide."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been struggling with chronic prostatitis or CPPS for the past five months. A big issue I have been having is the post-ejaculation muscle spasms or nerve irritation. I am currently in physical therapy to work out the muscle tension or spasms and hoping that helps with the nerve irritation. Unfortunately, a new and frightening issue has emerged, which is what my question to you here is related to. A month back, I masturbated to ejaculation. The ejaculation was very painful, specifically in the perineum area. After that, from the next day to the month end, I had no erection whatsoever at any point. The whole pelvic or penis area felt kind of just dead or numb. It is very unusual for me to go that long without ejaculating and especially without so much as an erection. When I woke up the next day, I had an extremely weak erection and it was a little bit painful. It was at this time I noticed a bend curve to the left near the top. This was extremely alarming and scary for me to see. I decided to masturbate that night. The whole time the penis was very numb and had very little sensation. It was erect, but there was no pleasurable sensation, and the curve to the left was still very alarming (pictures are attached). When I ejaculated (first time in two weeks), the ejaculate fluid had some trouble coming out. It made it out, but it kind of just leaked out (as opposed to shooting out) and there was absolutely no pleasure or sensation with it. It was less sensational than urinating. I still had a feeling. I could feel something was happening but it was very dead or numb feeling. Another piece just to throw in here, whenever I get aroused, but do not get an erection (so pretty much always), I have a very uncomfortable tingling in what feels like my perineum (although it is a radiating type of tingling, so it is possible it is coming from somewhere else in the same area). This tingling is relieved if or when an erection occurs. So my point is that I am very concerned about this leftward bend near the top of the penis. I have never had this before. I have read about Peyronie's disease. It looks to me from a visual standpoint that that could be it. However, I have to say that I am having a difficult time feeling or identifying any plaques or bumps or anything of that nature. The only thing of interest, which I believe you can see in the pictures, is that there is a big visible vein in pretty much the exact spot where the curve occurs. So my question is that, based on everything I have told you, what could this be? Could it be Peyronie's disease? Could it not be that, but rather a blood flow issue (vein in the exact spot of the curve). A nerve irritation issue? A muscle dysfunction issue? Again I am certainly not a doctor, but my intuition is telling me it is a blood flow issue. At the same time, the curve looks significant to me, so I do not know if poor blood flow could cause a curve of this nature? One more thing I almost forgot. I have been on Alfuzosin ER 10 mg tablets once per day every day for the past three months. I have also been taking Methocarbamol 500 mg post masturbation to help with muscle spasms and nerve pain. Could any of those have caused this? I did some research and came across an alpha-blocker called Flomax that can cause symptoms that mimic Peyronie'sdisease but could not find any specific evidence on Alfuzosin. If Alfuzosin could have caused this, what would the outlook be? If this is Peyronie's disease, what is the outlook on that? What should I feel to confirm Peyronie's? What can I do to help this? Of course, I will be seeing a urologist as soon as possible, but with my insurance and urologist availability, it could be up to a week before my next appointment.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and the images that you have sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There is definitely a curvature that is appreciated on the images, but I cannot confirm whether it is Peyronie's disease without actually examining you myself. It is however among the few possibilities that can cause your present condition. I would like to know a few more details about the last time you masturbated. Did you find any sudden loss of erection or swelling of the penis after ejaculation? Did you feel a popping sensation in your penis at that time? Immediately after did you have any partial erections, and were these erections painful?  The usual cause of this type of problem is a tiny injury to the layers covering the penis which give it stiffness. This could also explain why you did not have erections for sometime immediately after. The important thing is to rule out Peyronie's disease which can be progressive, the others are not. If it is just a curvature, without Peyronie's, it is necessary to check whether you are able to have normal erections, from the images it does appear that your erections are normal (needs to be confirmed during an examination). If it does not interfere with penetration, then usually we do not intervene unless the patient specifically requests for cosmetic purposes. So, to summarize, it is not likely to be Peyronie's, but I would definitely want to rule out with an examination and maybe an ultrasound if necessary. Such a slight curvature would usually not require any further treatment unless it interferes with penetrative intercourse."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

I went through your case, what I found is that you must follow some basic stretching exercises with warm up and cool down phase to avoid tightening of muscles. Do warm-up exercise like static jogging, jumping with hands wide apart. Along with warm-up, 10 minutes of stretching exercises like twisting and turning exercises, with standing and long sitting also. Lie down flat on the mat, bend your knees and bring your bend knees towards your body. Follow the same position with legs extended. Put a towel behind the legs and holding the towel with hands pull the towel towards your body. This will stretch both spine and hams also. Do cat and camel exercises. Come to your quadruped position, inhale and try to put your spine down and head up, then exhale and try to pull up the spineaking a curve with head down. Repeat this 10 to 15 times. It can be done before and after workout sessions. Apply hot pack if possible to decrease the soreness twice daily. Go for a physiotherapy session which should include mobilization of spine and manipulation with TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), 15 minutes 80 hertz."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 36 years old, and my partner is 55 years old. We have been in an exclusive relationship for over three years. Throughout the entire relationship, I never had sexual contact with anyone other than him. He got a rash before two months. The GP diagnosed it as shingles. But after seeing the blood reports, he was diagnosed with syphilis. After reading about this condition, I have understood that the stage two symptoms appear after 10 to 90 days of contracting. My partner is persistent that he has not slept with anyone except me. I also understand that syphilis can remain dominant for some time. If he has stage two symptoms, does it mean that he would have contracted it before three months of diagnosis? Is it possible for him to have it before we were together?","Doctor":"Hi. The median incubation period (interval between contracting infection and clinical manifestations) of primary syphilis is 21 days (ranges from 10 to 90 days), and it rarely exceeds six weeks. Once the primary sore appears, it persists for four to six weeks, and then it heals. Usually, six to eight weeks after healing of primary sore, secondary syphilis becomes clinically apparent. Patient experiences skin rash at this stage. The timeline for the development of rash follows this way. When contracting an infection from a sexual partner, it takes 10 to 90 days for development. In median 21 days, primary sores appear on the genital parts. It persists for four to six weeks, and then it heals. After having healing of primary sore after six to eight weeks, a rash of secondary syphilis appears. Usually, it takes two to eight weeks to heal. So generally, it is unlikely to have the rash appearing after many years of contracting the disease from a sexual partner."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I went to the allergist a week back and he said my nasal passages were swollen up.

The steroid nasal spray you are using has local steroid which helps in reducing the swelling. This spray you will have to use for around six weeks. Secondly, to treat nose block you may use local decongestant nose drops for five days. If you have excessive sneezing you should use antihistamines also. If your problem is chronic that is from a long time I would advise you to get CT scan of paranasal sinuses done to rule out sinusitis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My fasting sugar is 180 and postprandial is 165. I am diabetic and take one tablet Janumet before breakfast and another after dinner. Why is this abnormal? Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. The blood sugar levels are still raised as your dosage must be insufficient. I would like to advise you to tell me the dosage of tablet Janumet that you are taking along with tablet Gluconorm. According to your fasting and postprandial blood sugar, I would then be able to adjust a proper medication and dosage for you. If you have any issues following up with me, you can meet your nearest physician or your family doctor, who can do it for you. Also, you should know that exercising and diet restrictions have an important role in maintaining your blood sugars and you should follow them religiously. There are two reasons to develop diabetes. One, because of pancreas not secreting enough insulin and two, our body tissues becoming non-responsive to the circulating insulin, because of a sedentary exercise less high-calorie diet that we follow for years together. That is why exercise is seen to improve insulin action in many patients and has helped us to keep the dosage to a bare minimum. Since you are overweight, I feel you should concentrate on losing weight by doing regular exercise and following a strict diabetic diet. It may help you to get off the medications or at least not let your present situation progress. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, After I had sex with sex-worker, I put my penis inside underwear before removing the condom. Her vaginal fluids would have spread in my underwear.

The answer to your question is simple. How long do you live in water? The same is applicable to HIV virus too. How long HIV virus survive in outside environment? Here the answer is a minimum of eight seconds and a maximum of 30 seconds owing to environmental temperature. So, in your condition, even if she is infected, having a virus in vaginal fluid and then on your underwear, the virus is not able to survive in the outside environment and again virus has no capabilities to breach skin and pass into the body.

You seem to have developed pleurisy or pleuritic chest pain following an acute asthma attack. I would recommend first of all a chest X-ray to rule out any pleural effusion as well as any pneumonia. If your chest X-ray remains clear then you would need treatment with a short course steroid like Prednisone along with a bronchodilator like Levosalbutamol and Budesonide.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Fibroids undergo degeneration during pregnancy.

A balanced diet with protein, carbohydrates, etc., in balanced proportion, must be taken. Walking briskly for three km is the best exercise, five days in a week.

If your periods are regular, then there is more chance of pregnancy when you have sex in the middle of the cycle. But when your periods are irregular then it is very difficult to predict ovulation time. But it is in the middle of the cycle only if ovulation is happening. Because you may have menses without ovulation, so you may have to take treatment for conceiving if you have irregular periods. But as your age is just 19 years, so try for at least a year. And if no pregnancy, then go for treatment. Every weekend is not the proper plan if you are planning for pregnancy. There is less chance of pregnancy than a normal couple.

Inability to postpone urine? Leakage of urine? Anxiety? Increased thirst? Increased appetite? Frequent consumption of caffeine, tea, nicotine? If yes, it may be an overactive bladder. It also happens in urinary tract Infection and needs to be ruled out by CUE (clinical urine test) that is by giving a urine sample for microscopy. Rule out diabetes by checking blood sugars. Only after ruling out other causes, you can be assured it is due to overactive bladder. You can do the following. Bladder training exercise, capping down the consumption of fluids particularly before you go to bed, complete evacuation of the bladder, decrease tea, coffee, and boozing."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Please help me out. I am 25 years old, weigh 85 kg, and height is 5'4\\". I have PCOD and every time I have irregular periods. Last month for religious festival took Regestrone for five days. I got my period within two days after that. Might be withdrawal bleeding. I do not know but it was very heavy. I missed my period this month may be due to PCOD. My ovulation time was between 27th to 1st. My problem now is for my uncertainty. I got intimate with my partner on ovulation day. It was not intercourse. He did not cum as well. But his pre-semen just contacted my clitoris and opening of my vagina, later, he masturbated me. I am worried if the pre-semen which touched at opening entered my vagina due to masturbation. He did not insert or cum. It was just the pre-semen which contacted my clitoris and vaginal opening. Now I am literally tensed. Does it cause conception? Will this situation of mine lead to conception? Please help me. Do I need to take contraceptive Ipill? Can I take Regestrone for five days starting yesterday? I have already taken one. Does Regestrone act as a contraceptive? If I take Ipill will I get my period? Do I need to get a pregnancy test after a week or so? By using Regestrone can I get periods by eliminating conception?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly relax. Your next menses naturally should have been expected only by the same date as the previous one after taking Regesterone, as your dates have changed now). So now you are 14 days late for your scheduled menses. Also, ideally you should get an ultrasound pelvis done to check for state of ovulation in the ovaries, as to whether you have already ovulated or ovulation is still pending secondary to PCOD (USG would be gold standard), but if we still consider that you may have ovulated late and hence no menses, considering that pre-cum got rubbed inside vagina during fingering in your case, this can logically lead to pregnancy. But chances of conception are minimal but still exists. The best would be to opt for an emergency contraceptive pill like an Ipill within 72 hours of intercourse to avoid unplanned pregnancy if at all chances occur considering even pre-cum contains live sperms. Post Ipill intake, you can expect a withdrawal bleed in next 3 to 5 days and once the bleeding occurs, endometrium shall be shed and you would be pregnancy safe. If no bleeding, then the next best step shall be to get a serum beta hCG test done after seven days post last intercourse to rule out any pregnancy. (This is a blood test and most sensitive for pregnancy). If the hCG levels are less than 3 mIU, then you can rest assured that you are not pregnant and then can wait for the withdrawal bleed naturally."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 32 years old, overweight (105 kg, height 5'7\\"). For the past week or so, I feel like I am not able to pass stool entirely. I always feel pressure like I want to pass stool, but when I sit on the pot, I cannot. It is not like I cannot pass stool. Usually, I feel there could be more. Additionally, when I burp I feel a little uncomfortable in the stomach and there was a very very slight pain on the left side of the stomach. Not everytime that I burped, but sometimes. There is a lot of gas and I keep burping. I took Zantac and Unienzyme, as well as a liquid laxative Cremaffin. Also took Digene for 3 to 4 days. Things are better and now when I burp I do not feel pain, most of the times, maybe once or twice a day. Also, the constant pressure that I have felt has decreased. I have looked after each stool and I never noticed any blood or anything like that in the shit. I have also not lost any weight off late and if anything, perhaps have gained a kilo in the last 2 to 3 weeks. However, even though things have slowly improved, I am not fully normal. Additionally, I am one big hypochondriac and this digestive issue is now starting to drive me nuts. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. Worrying about your GI tract will create stress which increases your cortisol levels and create further problems with your sugars, sleep, bowel movements in the future, so try not to worry. I advise you do not take any over the counter laxatives, especially if your bowels are returning to normal. You can also create further problems by taking all those things. I want you to increase your water intake to 6 to 8 glasses a day and do some type of exercising at least 3 to 4 times a week. This is the best way to make your bowels regular. This is why after surgery, doctors make sure patients are passing gas and getting up and walking. Lack of physical activity, diet, lack of water intake. If not improved with lifestyle changes, H.pylori, TSH, CMP, CBC can be done. Constipation. Increase physical activity 3 to 4 times a week, increase water intake 6 to 8 glasses a day. Increase fiber intake, salads, green leafy vegetables, fruits. Avoid mint, caffeine, over the counter laxatives and stool softeners."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have stuck a q tip in my ear because it was itching and I think I may have burst my eardrum.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He said it was a miscarriage, in the picture one can clearly see both foetus and sac. The morning after we went for a scan with NHS booked weeks ago. In the picture from scan at 11:30 AM there are no foetus nor sack, as confirmed in their paper.

I fear my fiancee took abortion pills right at the end of the seventh week. Please tell me what you think.","Doctor":"Hello. If you have seen scan and fetus, it would be there. Heartbeat if clearly seen then it would be more then five weeks actually. Anything could be possible as it was early pregnancy. If severe cramps and fetus had a tendency for miscarriage (like a fetus with congenital abnormalities aborts easily in very early pregnancy) could have had a miscarriage. It is possible that with cramps she had experienced was the product of conception coming out but it would be with spotting before along with cramps. With abortion medications also, she could abort and two doses with an interval of eight hours could give results. But in both the cases her mental, emotional, and physical condition are the main guidance for the event actually. If she has diabetes with high sugar levels, positive thrombophilia screen, thyroid abnormalities, and/or antithyroid drugs and few other medical issues with or without treatment continuation could lead to miscarriage naturally as well. You can check serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test level) to check and confirm the first scan you saw if you want.

The risk of abortion is none to minimal in normal pregnancy whereas intermediate and high in heterozygous and homozygous mutation respectively. In your case, as you have twice pregnancy failure, I have two recommendations. Try to do APLA test (antiphospholipid antibody workup) which is just the extension of thrombophilia work up. During future pregnancy, usually in your case, we need to give some medications which can maintain your blood flow, and it can prevent the micro clot formation in the placental blood vessels, and hence the chances of abortion will get decreased. These drugs are needed to be prescribed by your hematologist (low molecular weight Heparin and Warfarin).

But some women do not have problems in pregnancy throughout the weeks even at 2.5 cm length. On ultrasound, we need to have a full bladder (means control of urination) to measure the exact length of the cervix. I presume that you were on a full bladder during the scan and also in the light of your preterm history, you must be having a shorter cervix. But there are other USG findings such as ballooning of lower segment of a uterus and open OS to take an emergency procedure of cerclage.

I can see a lot of new moles on my face, chest, back, and neck. Two to three of them are slightly asymmetrical too. All the moles are less than 5 mm. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read the query and seen the pictures attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). These moles look normal. If there is any sudden change in size, shape, pigmentation, or any bleeding, then a dermoscopic examination or biopsy can be done by your local dermatologist. Avoid going out in sunlight, as it reduces the occurrence of moles over the covered areas. Apply sunscreen over the exposed areas twice daily and regularly."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Recently, I did an ECG. The doctor examined me and told me that I have a mild blockage. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There is sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 55 to 60 beats per minute, with a right bundle branch block along with left axis deviation. There are no significant ST-T abnormalities seen. It can also due to age or hypertension-related change. It needs evaluation and echo (echocardiogram) to rule out the possibility of coronary artery disease. So, you should undergo echo, and if it is normal, then stress test like stress thallium or CT coronary angiography can be done to rule out the possibility of structural heart disease. Also, do a thyroid profile."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was diagnosed with MS last month. I had severe dizziness before three months, and I got bed bound. The next day, my head became heavy, and I was unable to move it off from the pillow. I had an unsteady feeling on my foot. I was able to sit, and I got pulled back with a sensation on my head. I have enclosed my latest MRI report. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your MRI report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It indicates a new exacerbation of MS (also called relapse). As there are new plaques on your MRI which are enhanced by Gadolinium, I would recommend hospitalization and short-term treatment with a high dose of intravenous steroids. It is also essential to have a modifying therapy (Interferon, Copaxone, Fingolimod) to stop the progression of the disease and to prevent further relapse. Regarding your actual clinical condition, you should be patient, and this is a temporary condition. I am sure that your situation will improve in the next few weeks (this is the normal evolution of the disease). There is no reason to get panic for the moment. You should be optimistic, as your humor has a strong implication on your clinical situation too. In the meantime, I would also recommend trying Dimenhydrinate or Meclizine to improve vertigo and the dizziness. Physiotherapy performed by a specialist also helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 27-year-old female, and I have mild, cystic acne for the past five years. Yesterday, I got prescribed with Accutane 20 mg per day, and my weight is 50 kilograms. If everything is fine, I will be taking it for the next ten months. I know that taking Isotretinoin can cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension and I also take Tetracycline. I have heard that both should not be taken at the same time. I have been taking 100 mg Tetracycline for the past one week (seven days). I took my last pill yesterday evening. How long is the wash-out period of Tetracycline is? If I take 100 mg Tetracycline per day for seven days, when can I start taking Isotretinoin? Taking after 24-hour is enough?","Doctor":"Hi. There should be a time gap of seven days between stopping tetracycline and starting Isotretinoin. Monitor your fasting lipid profile and liver function test. While on Isotretinoin, you should not conceive. There should be a gap of six months after stopping Isotretinoin."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My lipase and amylase are above normal with a level of 100 U/L and 192 U/L. Can you suggest some supplements to restore them?","Doctor":"Hi. Increased lipase and amylase level indicates a sign of other complication, and it needs to be diagnosed. Your BMI (body mass index) is 27.8 (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You need to reduce your weight through exercise and by following a healthy diet. However, your symptoms can also be caused due to pancreatitis, kidney dysfunction, gallbladder infection, or gallbladder stone. You have to do some test to rule out these complications. You have to do CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel), CBC, and CT scan of the abdomen or ultrasound of pancreas and gallbladder. Also, drinking alcohol can cause hyperlipasemia. You have not mentioned about other symptoms. But if you have nausea, that stops you from eating, diarrhea, pain, fever or abnormal sweating, then you need to see a doctor soon."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother is 88 years old. She had undergone a surgery for the fractured femur thigh bone. Now, she is experiencing high involuntary urination for the past two days. She is on bed rest now, and any movement in the body or legs results in urine discharge. Currently, she is taking Thyronorm 75 mcg, Glycomet SR 500, Atorfit 10 mg, Ecospirin, and Calcirol. Her sugar levels are normal, and her BP is 140 by 70 mmHg. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). She has temporary urinary problems which are reasonably common at her age following any major surgery with immobilization. I would like to know whether she passes urine usually and whether she has any burning sensation during urination. It is essential to make sure that whether she has a urinary tract infection or any retention of urine in the bladder. If these are absent, then she will get better soon with time, when she starts to ambulate and when she gets back to her routine activities. In the meantime, she can be managed with diapers or a urinary catheter if the problem is very severe."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 28 years old male. I tested my blood triglyceride and cholesterol. I have a triglyceride of 3.07 mmol/L and cholesterol of 4.33 mmol/L. I am worried about my high triglyceride level. Currently, I am taking Atenolol 25 mg in the morning. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. Your triglyceride level is at a higher level than the upper normal value. Several causes increase the blood triglyceride levels. Foods rich in fats such as dairy products, and meat can increase triglyceride. Other exogenous substances may also affect the level. Beta blockers such as Atenolol can also raise the blood lipid profile (triglycerides). An increase in blood triglyceride level is approached appropriately by modifying the diet profile by reducing fatty-rich components and increasing the intake of plenty of fibers, such as vegetables, and fruits. Having a physically active lifestyle every day and avoiding risk factors like close smoking contacts and excessive alcohol consumption are very helpful. If there is no improvement, then medications can help. Take Ciprofibrate 100 mg in capsules, one capsule daily. You should consult your doctor soon."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is five years old, and he was suffering from fever, headache and body pain. He also had some rashes on his face and in some parts of the hands and legs. His fever was ranging from 101 to 102.5 degrees. After a couple of days, on medication, his temperature became normal between 97.5 to 99.5, degrees and he is fresh now. His platelet count went down to 160000 from 280000 in two days. His lymphocyte count is high, and neutrophils counts are low. He did not have stools for the past two days, but he passed out stools three times in normal consistency and one time with a loose stool this morning. He is feeling fresh now. We have done NS1 test for Dengue before two days, and it came out negative. Does he require any particular attention to control platelet count or is it normal? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. The report suggests some form of viral infection (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have ruled out dengue. He has platelets of 160000 platelets per microliter of blood, and it is in a normal range. There is no medicine available to increase platelet count. I advise you repeat CBC (complete blood count) after two to three days to see the platelet count. I am pretty sure that the platelet count will get increased."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a little bit of itching on the foreskin. I had sex with my partner, and I used a condom. After the first ejaculation, I used the second condom. I started to have pain in the penis after the first ejaculation. But still, I went for the second one. After several strokes, when I was not able to ejaculate, I ended up. After removing the condom, I saw red dots on my urethral opening and glans. It was paining a lot. The next day, the dots were no more. But my foreskin had pain. Now, after three days, after sex, my foreskin is dry, and some part of the skin is peeling off. I am unable to take the foreskin back. While retaking it, it pains a lot. My urethral opening is always dry. There is no problem on my penis shaft, and my foreskin is dry. My partner is not having a problem. What can I do? Is this a serious problem? Please suggest me a solution.","Doctor":"Hi. You have developed an allergy to latex. You have developed redness and pain while using a condom. This is probably a hypersensitive reaction to the condom. As you have dryness, and if there is a pain, I advise you visit a dermatologist for an opinion. The problem is not severe, and this will become fine within a few days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old female. My main concern is dysuria that started the previous night. I also had a history of kidney infection when I was young so I am extra cautious about UTIs. I have had a relatively little intake of water this week. How can I treat this without going to the hospital for a urinalysis? Can you prescribe me something?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from dysuria. Dysuria is painful or difficulty in micturition. It can be resulted from urinary tract infection (UTI), STD (sexually transmitted disease), Kidney stone, ovarian cyst, interstitial cystitis, vaginal infection, bladder cystitis, pyelonephritis, urethritis, etc. Treatment depends on causes.so we should undergo some investigations like urine routine, urine R/M/E, USG (ultrasound) of W/A, serum creatinine, urine for C/S to find out exact causes for your dysuria, and then treat them accordingly. As an example, if causes are cystitis, pyelonephritis, or urethritis then they have resulted from bacterial indecision. So anti-bacterial medication should be needed. Take plenty of water and do not hold urine. Take cranberry juice and citrus foods. You can take Cefixime 400 mg (twice daily for 14 days) and abstinence from sexual intercourse during antibiotics."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

According to the doctor's suggestion, she did POP for a month followed by arthroscopy. She is following the exercise under the supervision of a physiotherapist post arthroscopy. She can find recovery, but it is very little and slow. A slight improvement is seen while bending the legs. But it is not complete. Straight legs are not recognized while walking. How long it takes to have a complete recovery? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Usually, it takes three months to have complete recovery after arthroscopy with good physiotherapy done regularly. Physiotherapy includes quadriceps strengthening, hamstring stretching, and strengthening, full weight-bearing walking with a hinged knee brace, and knee bending for three weeks. The treating surgeon decides the frequency of doing exercise. Ideally, you should be able to bend the knee for about 90 to 100 degrees in three weeks post surgery."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 24 years old male. I have a habit of masturbation for about nine years. Now, it became a habit in me. I have started doing it compulsively for about five to six years. I masturbate as frequently as thrice a day every day. Now, my head is programmed to wank at any time when I am alone. I feel exhausted, and I want to stop the habit or to minimize the frequency of doing it. How can I do it? Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern and masturbation is a safe habit. It does not result in weakness or physical fatigue. But excessive masturbation results in significant loss of time that is spent on sports or in studies. This progressively results in poor health and poor performance in academics. There is no need to stop it completely, but you should reduce the frequency. There is no medicine available to help you. You have to reduce the frequency gradually. First of all, stop watching or reading porn materials. Try to masturbate by fantasies, and it helps to reduce the severity. When you stop watching porn entirely, you can reduce the frequency to two and then to one. Try to keep yourself busy and take part in outdoor sports. Keeping yourself busy will help to reduce your habit."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 60 years old male. Before a year, I got a stroke. After recovering from it, my left side ear, hand, and leg are not functioning well. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. After a stroke, usually, recovery is maximum in initial three to six months. After that, you can have a slight improvement up to one to one and a half years. Some residual weakness usually persists. You need to do regular physiotherapy. Few patients develop spasticity, and it needs to be taken care by proper medicines or physiotherapy. I suggest you consult a neurologist in person for appropriate examination with all your previous reports."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been diagnosed with acute hepatitis B, and I was taking Tenohep and Entehep medicines for the past two months. Last week, I ate chicken prepared with feni (traditional wine) and got diarrhea. I have loose stools and gastritis for three days now. I used to get this often because of my food habits, and so I took an Eldoper to reduce the problem. Can I use this along with the drugs mentioned above? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, both of the above drugs are not used simultaneously for hepatitis. It is wrong, and only one of them is used at a time. Secondly, acute hepatitis B infection goes away by itself by 80 %, and there is no need for treatment. If it is symptomatic, then treatment is required. If it does not gets cured, and if the viral load is high in chronic hepatitis B, then one of these medications can be used. Loperamide can be taken for diarrhea. If you have diarrhea along with an infection, then Loperamide will not be helpful. I would advice taking more water. Do CBC (complete blood count), creatinine, and liver function test if diarrhea does not stop in two days. You might need an antibiotic also."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 19 years old and a virgin. My opening of the vagina is completely white with some tiny lifted or pointy spots around it. I am noticing it for the past couple of years. I do not have any other problem like itching, bleeding or smell. So I have never consulted a doctor for this problem, and now, I start to have a feeling that it is abnormal or severe. It is found with white skin and looks like dry skin. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Please send a picture of it. As you are still virgin, you can have an intact hymen (small skin tag at the entrance of the vagina). White dry appearance occurs due to candidiasis with vaginal secretions. It gives you the presentation as you explained. Check your hemoglobin. Even low hemoglobin level along with candidiasis also gives the appearance you told. You can also have a local infectious lesion, skin tag, and wart. A local examination can confirm it. In the case of candidiasis, you can use Canesten (antifungal cream) with the help of an applicator. You can use it at bedtime. If you have any other lesion or pelvic infection, you should do a swab or skin scraping and check it in the laboratory. Do CBC (complete blood count) to exclude anemia. Collect the results and discuss it with your local gynecologist or here. In case of a wart, it has to be removed with care. Due to the absence of sex, you do not know the secretions observed in sexually active lady during, before and after sex. So vaginal dryness could be obvious. Wart or skin tag like lesion occurs when there is an infection with human papillomavirus. Differentiating them on examination is necessary. I hope you have understood the suspected causes of this issue. It will become better after a local physical examination and treatment. Use lubricants when you become active. Have strict hygiene. Use soft, cotton and comfortable undergarments."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My grandmother is 83 years old and has been suffering from a mild form of glaucoma for three years now.

Overall it was going good but yesterday I have experienced visual hallucinations for the first time. I will see my doctor in half a month only. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for taking help from a psychiatrist. Visual hallucinations are due to organic brain lesion (epilepsy) or any substance abuse (alcohol or recreational drug). If it is just once in while then it is not problematic but if it is an increase in the frequency and disturbing your functional life than it needs to be addressed. It is not due to Mirtazapine. Sometimes, it may happen when you are going to sleep or when you wake up from sleep. It is due to mental illness. Just keep a record of your hallucinations details like duration, time of the episode, frequency, etc. All those details will help your psychiatrist during follow up visit for evaluation. At present, you do not need to worry."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a hip arthroscopy three weeks ago and today, my feet are very cold with no other symptoms. No symptoms prior to today.

A possible deep vein thrombosis could cause these symptoms. Do you see any change in the color (pale or bluish) in your legs? Can you feel the pulse on the dorsal part of your foot whenever touching? I recommend trying to move your legs, and wear warm socks. If your situation worsens, and you experience pain, inability to walk, swelling or changes in the color of your legs skin, I recommend going to the ER for a physical exam and a Doppler ultrasound of the leg vessels. I remain at your disposal for any further questions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am planning to marry my own cousin (my mother's own brother's child).

It would be better if you would send me the background of your question. Any specific family history like thyroid, diabetes or any congenital anomalies, thalassemia, sickle cell disease or any other family history, then it needs precautions and even investigations. The severity of diseases also matters. Either it is dominant or recessive in both sides blood relations as dominant will give dangerous effects as compared to recessive. Check blood group as well as if you are Rhesus negative and he is positive, then there could be a risk of development of autoantibodies and hemolysis. So check the above family history that matches his and yours can affect your offspring strongly if any."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am an athlete (sprinter).

But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I suspect this happens when I fall asleep on the sofa in an awkward position and when I woke up, my throat has a little pain but it did not persist but but it started to ache on the left rib part. I feel the pain towards my shoulder. It is almost about two days since I am suffering from this ache. I got breathing difficulty especially when I am lying in bed. But while standing or sitting, I just felt mild difficulty in breathing. Maybe there is an artery that has been damaged or had been under the bone. I am 24 years old.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from difficulty in breathing due to aching of the left rib part that radiates toward shoulder which may occur when you fall asleep on sofa in an awkward position. You think your ribs may hurt from sleeping wrong and aching of the rib may radiate towards its intercostal muscle. You may feel a sharp pain after intercostal muscle strain or sprain due to sleeping in the wrong position. The pain will become worse when you stretch, breathe in deeply, cough, or sneeze. The area of the strain between your ribs may be painful to touch. Again this pain can radiate to shoulders or sometimes side sleeping can cause damage to the rotator cuff and create a lot of pressure in this group of tendons and eventually produce pain. You can take Tramadol as a painkiller, Domperidone, Lansoprazole, and Diazepam as a muscle relaxant with a sleeping pill."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 21 years old male.

My doctor suggests me an injection therapy. But I am willing to have some tablets. Please say your kind opinion.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As per the laboratory report, you have a deficiency of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin required for the normal functioning of the body organs especially the nervous system. You have a hemoglobin of 16 g/dL. In B12 deficiency, you can usually see anemia (low hemoglobin). Vitamin B12 is replaced either by oral supplements or through B12 injection. Injections will help you to replenish quickly, and oral supplements take a long time. If you have any symptoms due to B12 deficiency, it is better to have an injection or oral supplements. You should take oral supplements regularly and for a long time for at least a year. Finding the reasons for B12 deficiency is essential. Your doctor can tell you the reason through proper history and examination."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 52 years old. I have a less desire for having sexual intercourse. I consulted a psychiatrist friend and talked to him about this problem. I felt too shy to speak in detail. He told me to take Nano Leo Total. I found some improvement. I got my blood tested for testosterone which was 313 ng/dL before taking medicine. Now, I have already taken it for about 60 days, and I was told to take it for 90 days. Sometimes, when I talk hot with my partner, I have a feel to go into action. Sometimes, the erection occurs, but it does not last for a long time. On repeating, it picks up again. But the frequency of the desire is very less. Sometimes, I do not like to have sex for months together. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Your testosterone levels are in normal range, but still, they are at low normal levels. You are a hypertensive too and also taking antidepressants. Both these, along with age are contributing to reduced libido in your case. First of all, there is no need to feel ashamed to talk about sex. You can speak to the psychiatrist and consult him properly. If there is no improvement on taking Nano Leo (Elemental zinc with Tribulus Terrestris), then you can think of taking PDE5 inhibitors (Phosphodiesterase) like Sildenafil or Tadalafil. Both are good drugs, and they are safe to use. Tadalafil has a long duration of action, and it will provide a good erection."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been experiencing severe pain in the back of my head and neck region with dizziness since six months now. I went to physiotherapy and took some muscle relaxants but with no effective relief. With anxiety tablets like Amitriptyline, it felt better for a few days but again it came back when I quit taking that medication. At nights, I feel burning and tingling sensation in the legs. I am suffering from an anxiety disorder since a long time around 10 years now and took several medicines in different times like Amitriptyline, Duloxetine, Pregabalin, etc. for different time lengths whenever I feel very anxious but never in medication more than a month. I did a blood test and an X-ray and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the cervical spine and all are normal as per the doctor. But in the MRI, there seems to be a minor left-sided disc bulge with nerve root compression at C5-C6 with no radiculopathy symptoms and the orthopedic doctor suggested to take a muscle relaxant and simple exercises to cure it. He ruled out that my back and head pain can be created due to this. I also recently consulted a neurologist because I started feeling nausea and blurred vision and loss of focus. He prescribed me Nuhenz and Symbal tablets. With two days of medications, I felt better with the head pain but I still have dizziness and nausea. My questions are:  Are my health symptoms pointing to severe anxiety and is there a way to test the anxiety level? Are the problem of burning legs and back and head pain related to severe anxiety?   Can severe anxiety be cured completely without any medication?   Should I see a psychiatrist and be on a long-term medication given the fact that I am extremely worried about my health issues and all this started to hamper my daily life now?  I can provide all the test reports if required.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the clinical description and attached reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). My answer to your questions is that we do not have anything to gauge your anxiety with some instrument but it can be detected with a complete history and physical examination. At this level, there is indirect evidence to suggest that your symptoms are largely due to anxiety than anything else. This is evidenced by a good response to almost all anxiety medications in short duration. It is often stated that any symptom related to any system of the body can be explained on the basis of anxiety. The criteria in favor of anxiety are the absence of anything else to explain the system and same is true in regard to your back pain and other symptoms as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is quite clear and it cannot be the cause of your symptoms. Yes, it can be treated without medication with the use of cognitive behavior therapy provided you have access to the clinical psychologist in your city. However, I like to make it clear that CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) is not for everybody and psychological mindedness is a pre-requisite to have a useful CBT. I think you need proper assessment for evaluation of the severity of your anxiety disorder. Then, it will be worth to discuss the need for medication. In fact, your psychiatrist will be glad to discuss these important details which will be useful for long-term care.

It is mostly under control, but I get very nervous at the doctor. I have had a BP reading as high as 167/105. My doctor says its just because I was nervous. Is this true? I am not overweight, I exercise regularly, I am not hypertensive, I eat healthily, I am only 18 and neither of my parents has high BP. So, was it that high because of anxiety? Could a heart problem cause it to be that high?","Doctor":"Hello. You may have high BP just for once. It may be due to anxiety. Persons with anxiety and depression may have high BP. You should do BP monitoring for one week. Check your BP twice a day for one week and note it down. Or at least once a month for four to six months. If you still have persistent high BP then go for hypertension management. And if you have an anxiety disorder, then treat it as early as you can. It will surely help lower your BP.

I have tried a couple of times, but I get a bit too anxious and failed. I could not get a completely erect penis. One time I did not get any erection at all. I am sure I do not have an erectile disorder because I get a completely erect penis during masturbation. Any suggestions on how to overcome this anxiety? I am 30 years old and weigh 69 kilograms, and my height is five feet 6 inches.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I like to inform you that one can handle performance anxiety with the use of the right psychotherapeutic approach. In my own experience, around 70-80 % of individuals report dramatic improvement in erections once the psychotherapy is started leading to decrease in performance anxiety. Below here I am delineating few of the strategies which will help you in the problem. Firstly get rid of thoughts that you may be sexually inadequate or your doubts that you may not be able to perform properly. This is because performance anxiety, feelings of sexual inadequacy, self-doubts, guilt, past negative sexual experiences, poor communication/understanding with the partner, etc., can all affect sexual functioning and performance. Removing such ideas will eliminate the majority of causes for your poor sexual performance. Removing the person's doubts and fears, and improving his self-confidence levels will help in improving sexual performance. Remember that sex is not just a physical act but also a psychological process involving the expression of emotions, intimacy, and love. So, just involve yourself in those feelings and stop focusing on your \\"performance\\" alone. Once you do that, then I assure you that your sexual performance will automatically improve. Most importantly, performance anxiety soon becomes a \\"vicious cycle\\" that is, anxiety leads to poor performance, and poor performance then leads to further anxiety, and this keeps on increasing. One more problem responsible for performance anxiety is inadequate sexual arousal. When the person is not properly aroused, the blood flow to the penis is not maximal, and so, after a few strokes, the erection weakens, and ejaculation occurs. The way to tackle this is not to rush into intercourse quickly but wait till you get fully aroused. So, increase and spice-up your foreplay. Make sure that you initiate penetration only after both of you are fully turned on. Good foreplay not only arouses you but also sparks off the mood in your partner. So, when she is also aroused and involved, then things keep flowing smoothly and effortlessly, and you do not have to be constantly anxious if you satisfy your partner or not. Distract yourself stop \\"monitoring\\" your sexual performance. Try putting on some romantic music or mild lighting while you make love. Think about the things that turn you on. Taking your mind off of your sexual performance can remove the worries that are stopping you from getting fully aroused. Wish you all the best for your sexual health. I hope this helps you. If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.

He says this is only because of my anxiety disorder. It has been as high as 168/110 before. He did a physical and CBC, thyroid, glucose, and kidney function test and they all came back normal. Does this rule out secondary hypertension?","Doctor":"Hi. Hypertension at your age is not usual and if it is present, a few things need to be evaluated thoroughly, especially your kidneys and your adrenal glands. A renal function test will not be helpful in this case. An MRI or ultrasound of the kidneys would be required to rule out a possibility of adult polycystic kidney disease. Also, I would like to know if either of your parents has hypertension or autosomal dominant adult polycystic kidneys. I suggest 24 hour urinary free catecholamines and metanephrines for a probable tumor of the adrenal gland. Please note that I am not saying that you have either of these but at your age hypertension with anxiety disorder may present with these conditions. So, it is important to rule them out. Also, do you have headaches? That could help identify the problem. Let me know so I can help. 1. MRI or ultrasound of kidneys. 2. 24-hour urinary catecholamines and metanephrines.

Yesterday was the first day I went to a psychiatrist. He told me that I have a generalized anxiety disorder, and he prescribed me Effexor, and he said that it is a beta-blocker. He said that there are no side effects or addiction to this drug, and I should take it for about a year. But from what I read online afterward, I read severe side effects, such as constipation, liver damage, etc. and also severe problems when you try to stop it, like brain zaps, losing conscience, etc. Can you give me a second opinion on this drug? I am going to call the doctor that prescribed as well, but I would like to have another opinion. I have a lot of anxiety to the point where my hands-feet-armpits are almost throughout the day sweating. When I am calm, I am not sweating and I do not have hyperthyroidism problems. Six months ago I had a panic attack where I thought I was going to die and it lasted for about three to four minutes. I have tried Minitran.","Doctor":"Hi. Effexor (Venlafaxine) is SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) class of drug that is used to treat depression, anxiety disorder, and panic attacks. This drug is helpful in managing your problem but as you mentioned it has few side effects but usually go away with time and when you try to stop it, you need to slowly taper its dose and then stop. If you stop it suddenly without tapering the doses it causes the discontinuation symptoms as mentioned by you. A similar drug called Desvenlafaxine or drug from SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) class like Paroxetine or Escitalopram are also good alternatives for you. So discuss side effects of these and then decide which drug suits you better, as the efficacy of these drugs is almost equal but side effects are different, so based on side effects profile you need to choose your drug.

If it is not performed correctly, it can lead to more inflammatory acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. I would suggest you visit a dermatologist because comedones do not resolve with topical medications and face masks.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off.

None of the medications used by your relative is directly related to low levels of total T3 and T4. His current thyroid status is known as a euthyroid sick syndrome. Thyroid supplement should be prescribed only after repeated assessments of thyroid levels. This is because errors are very common even in reputed laboratories.

I want to improve my sexual activity a lot. How can I do it? I am happy, and I am not in a depression. I feel very normal. But I am workaholic, and I work very hard for a long time. Does it have an impact on my sexual activity? Please suggest me.","Doctor":"Hi. A busy life will not have an impact on sexual life, though it adds to fatigue, at the same time, workaholic maturity increases with confidence. Consider taking either Sildenafil or Tadalafil. Tadalafil is long-acting, and it is best suited. You can keep taking the drug on SOS (save our soul) basis about one hour before sex. This will make erection harder, and it will increase the time too. Take 10 mg on alternate days and also take another tablet on the day of sexual intercourse. It helps to maintain an erection. Apart from medicines, you can think of taking supplements. Nano Leo has L-arginine. But I advise you take L-arginine in a dose of 1500 mg. Tantex Forte and Confido are herbal drugs. You can start taking these drugs one tablet each twice a day for two months. These are safe to use, and it does not cause serious side effects. Keep your blood pressure and blood sugar levels in normal range. Altered blood sugar levels and hypertension are the two main culprits for having a poor erection.

He also has a CAD and got a heart attack last year. Sometimes, he also has loose motion and vomiting. What can I do now? Should I have to give him ORS or not? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You have mentioned the age of your father. If your father has an age of 65 years with a weight of 60 kilograms, the creatinine clearance will be around 23 mg/dL, and it puts your father in stage 4 CKD. I do not know the exact age and the nature of treatment used for him. Please mention about the treatment taken. Please say whether he takes renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) or not. If he is not taking it, ORS (oral rehydration solution) can cause harm. In a patient with CKD (chronic kidney disease), who is not under renal replacement therapy, should not take ORS or any other fluid intake as it can lead to volume overload. As he has a history of CAD, it will also cause harm to his health. The symptoms of loose motion and vomiting occur due to many causes. One of them can be infections. Also, certain medications can also be responsible for these symptoms. In general, ORS is safe for patients of any age. It is not right to use ORS for your father because of his poor kidney function and due to reduced urine production. In this condition, his body will retain excess fluid, and it causes more harm than benefit."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have noticed some worrying symptoms lately. I am a 24-year-old male with no other known condition. I have noticed that the back of my neck feels very stiff and rigid when I sit at my desk with my head bent forward to read or look at the monitor, to the point that I feel the need have to stand or lie down to alleviate the feeling of discomfort. I have noticed that the rigidity disappears when I stand, walk or lie down. I have been feeling stiff since I have started studying again some days ago. I have spent the last two months without doing much (no physical activity or studying/working) due to the lockdown. I also have widespread twitching in my thighs, calves and feet (both legs), on my back, on my chest, on my shoulders, in my arms, in my hands and in my tongue. I have felt twitching almost everywhere for a couple of years now. I also noticed that I am unable to put the heel of my left foot down when I stand or walk. I have had this issue for years and I was told it was due to tight calf muscles, although it feels more accentuated now. I would greatly appreciate any input you can give.","Doctor":"Hi.  Neck pain seems to be due to strain in the neck muscles when you remained in one position for long duration, I would suggest you to take simple steps to avoid this, take rest for 2 minutes in every 15 to 20 minutes and move your neck side wise and rotate it to right and left. In that way strain in neck muscles can be avoided. additionally in between isometric neck excercise can be done. Avoid Using thick pillows. If this does not work we can start some remedies. Now regarding twitching. Do you have weakness anywhere in the body? Did you lose your muscles mass anywhere in the body? Do you have any sensory issues? Do you take any stimulants such as excessive coffee or something else, if yes how much? Do you feel often cramping of muscles? Regarding foot problem. Is it always or sometimes? Can you walk on forefoot? Can you walk on heels? (just try walking) Is it like foot drop? lastly why antihistaminic medicines?

I get cramp so bad that if I do not sort of move around I feel as if I am going to throw up or pass out. I am honestly sick of having to live with this, especially at my age. It is preventing me from doing so much every month and I cannot deal anymore.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? I understand what you are going through. Till the age of 19 to 21, the hormonal balance between the brain and ovaries is not proper. So, the bleeding will be altered, not on a proper date and maybe more than normal. When the blood more than normal has to pass out through the narrow cervical canal, it is very painful, almost like the pain of delivering a baby. Those cramps are due to the blood clot or the fleshy masses at the cervix and your uterus is trying to push it out. Once the mass is out, the pain immediately relieves. Do not worry, we can solve this. To improve your health, have lots of fruits, vegetables, water, juices, high protein food. Have Iron supplements tablets and multivitamins. This will help you to tide over the loss of blood so far. Have blood tested Hb % (rule out anemia), bleeding time, clotting time, platelet count (rule out any bleeding tendency). I hope you do not have any bleeding gums or too much blood from small wounds or nose. If all this is normal, just have cyclically hormone pills or birth control pills or contraceptive pills (chemical name: Ethinyl estradiol + Levonorgestrel or Desogestrel or Gestodene or Drospirenone) like Novelon or Ovral-G, etc. This is not for contraception, it will prevent the hormone imbalance, so the inner lining of the uterus will never be too thick. So, bleeding will never be heavy. So, no pain. Once bleeding is controlled, your pain will disappear and your daily routine will not be disturbed. Do not get stressed out or lose hope, every problem has a solution, you will do absolutely fine."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got my tooth pulled six days ago and it still hurts really bad. There was something in my gums that is no longer there and now it is a big hole. What to do? Do I need to worry or it is just the process of healing?","Doctor":"Hi. Your extraction socket has lost the blood clot that is responding for healing and it has led to dry socket formation. Due to this, there is a pain. You should consult your dentist and get evaluated. He can clean the extraction socket with antiseptic solution and place medicated dressing like Zinc oxide eugenol that has pain relieving and healing action. The dressing should be changed every alternate day till healing is considerable. Along with it a course of antibiotics and painkillers will help.

I have anxiety, and my head feels very burdened. Sometimes, I feel dizzy, and sometimes, I have white spots coming from my eyes. I have anxiety even for simple tasks. When someone shouts at me, my head bursts out. I started to have anxiety from my puberty. I took Minoxidil topical solution before two years and discontinued it. Why do I have this problem of hair fall and anxiety? How can I check my levels of anxiety? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. M-shaped baldness occurs due to hormone dihydrotestosterone which is a metabolite of testosterone. In some people, there is a peripheral conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. It is more common in some persons, and it is usually genetically determined. This particular hormone is responsible for baldness. Regarding anxiety, it can be due to some hormonal imbalance like thyroid, or it can be due to genetics and heredity. To manage it, you can do yoga, meditation, deep breathing exercise and you can follow sleep hygiene. There is a need to assess the level of anxiety in detail. I would advise you consult a psychiatrist soon."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I work in night shift. What can I take to be alive and energetic at night during work? I feel sleepy, and I am slow during my work. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Since you are working in the night, you might be losing out the necessary sleep. So you are unable to focus entirely during work. It is essential for an adult human being to get seven to eight hours of quality sleep every day. Once you finish your job in the morning, try to have a hearty breakfast and then close the windows of your room with a dark curtain that blocks the entry of light. Request your family to keep the house quiet and try to sleep at a stretch for at least six to seven hours. It will help you unwind and relax. During the weekends, try to avoid staying out for long periods. Try to catch up the lost sleep. Some foods that help in inducing sleep are dairy products, bananas, and almonds. To keep you awake and energetic during work, avoid eating heavy meals before and during work. Eat small meals at frequent intervals. Green tea, dark chocolate, and fruits may help you to stay awake when you feel drowsy. Please remember that the best time to sleep is the night time. Keep looking for better work opportunities, and sometime in future, you can move on to a job that lets you sleep well at night."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have a small ulcer in the stomach, RUT test is also positive because of H.Pylori bacterial infection and vitamin D is below 10. I am using antibiotics from 10 days but chest pain was not controlled. I have taken ECG also, it is normal. Please suggest me how to reduce pain in my chest.","Doctor":"Hello. An elaborate description of your chest pain would have helped much, but as you reported your ECG is fine. I do not think it is related to any cardiac cause. If the chest pain develops after some physical activity you must get yourself a TMT (treadmill test) done to rule out angina. As you told that you have got an upper GI endoscopy with rapid urease test done and an ulcer was found on UGIE. You must be on triple drug H.Pylori eradication therapy the duration of which is about 10 to 14 days. So do not worry, first finish off your HP kit. Your gastroenterologist will call you for a review endoscopy after four weeks to look out for ulcer healing. before that stop PPI (proton pump inhibitor) for at least seven days. and get a stool antigen for H.Pylori done or any other test to confirm eradication of H.Pylori. You can try the following lifestyle modifications. (Although they are of benefit in GERD only). Keep a few pillows while sleeping, to elevate your head end. Sleep on left-lateral position. Try reducing weight if you are overweight. Do regular exercise for about 30 to 45 minutes per day for at least five days a week. The following are of unproven benefit: Eat small evening meals, and avoid sleeping just after a heavy meal. Do not eat heavy late night. Reduce your tea or coffee intake. If it is pain due to GERD it will be reduced by the above measures. An ulcer pain, usually responds to the PPI therapy. Give some time for treatment to respond."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 22 years old, female. I moved to a new city, for my job purpose, and I do not have any interest in this city.

Join some activity or thing you like when you are free, like Zumba, dance class, or gym and ways of looking after yourself. Doing deep breathing exercises, at least three times a day will help you calm, also going for a jog or walk in the mornings preferably.

Mesenteric lymph node enlargement can be seen in children without a cause, and it is called as primary mesenteric lymphadenitis. In secondary causes, infections like tuberculosis or enteric fever or viral fever can also cause it. Blood in the stool can also occur due to infectious colitis or ileitis or intussusception.

Take tablet Primolut N 10 mg (Norethisterone) twice daily for six days and then wait for bleeding for one to two weeks. If you have any abnormal hair growth, with weight gain and irregular periods, then do a blood test on the second day of the periods.

Hope you had the tests for pregnancy recently, as you have missed periods for two months. If they are recent and surely negative, then this pain is the tendency for impending periods. For a young lady of your age, BMI of 17 is very low. For your height of 158 cms, expected weight is 58 to 62 kg. A minimum weight is required for regular periods. When you have weight, fat in the body, it is a store for a time of possible emergency or fasting, etc. Now your body is running short of energy source, so it is not spending it on periods, which is like a drain out of energy.  To have periods now, have any of the oral birth control pills or contraceptive pills or 21 pills packet of tablet Novelon or Ovral-G or Dear 21 or Intimacy plus 3 or Duoluton-L one tablet twice a day for 10 days (throw away the 21st pill), no matter what the cause is (except pregnancy) you will have periods within 7 to 10 days. You can keep having the same pills cyclically for 3 to 6 months to have regular cycles and take that time to improve your health. I do not advise you to have binge eating and put on weight. Have lots of fruits, vegetables, high protein diet like egg white, milk, meat (not red meat), sprouts, protein drinks, so on.

Calcified granulomas usually do not cause pain. Although looking at your old CT chest and current USG (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I would want to investigate more for tuberculosis (as a separate issue, not as a current cause of pain). Coming back to pain, it sounds like it may be musculoskeletal in origin or acid peptic disease. Particularly if the pain is more on moving, it may point towards musculoskeletal in origin. I would also suggest an EKG to be sure we are not missing anything cardiac. With discussion with your doctors, you can discuss regarding acid suppression therapy along with some muscle relaxant for few days if it helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, On the my bottom my two front teeth the gums have came up over them but not covered. But the gum is higher up than it is in any other teeth in my mouth. What caused this? Can I fix this in home itself?","Doctor":"Hi. That condition of your gum is called localized gingivitis. It occurs because of the deposition of calculus and plaque on your teeth and inside the gums margins, which causes inflammation of gums that enlarged in size. The first treatment is ideally you should visit a dentist and get the scaling, cleaning, and polishing done. Once your teeth and gums get cleaned, after you will have to maintain your hygiene, then after a few days it will become totally fine. Right now at home you can do proper brushing and flossing and do warm saline i.e. warm water and salt rinses daily, it will heal slowly, but scaling is genuinely required.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

She took tablet Mifegest 400 mg, and there was bleeding for 20 hours. Some clotted and blackish blood came out. Now, the bleeding has stopped. Is the condition fine or not?","Doctor":"Hi. Please say more details about her. It is like induced abortion. In some patients, after taking medicine, it comes out in one go and then bleeding stops. In others, it comes gradually in episodes, and it might need further intervention. She can have a transvaginal scan to know whether the process is complete or whether there is any product remaining in the vagina. If the bleeding continues, the products will come out soon. If the bleeding is stopped, then the products can remain there. She might need a further medical and surgical intervention. The scan describes the need for the plan (attachment removed to protect the patient identity). In a case of retained products, she can have an infection or sepsis. So it is better to start taking oral antibiotics prophylactically to avoid having an infection. Take tablet Augmentin 625 mg (Amoxycillin with Clavulanic acid) for every 12 hours for five days, and she can have a transvaginal scan to check for any retained products. In case of severe bleeding or cramps, she needs to report emergency care soon."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My penis is too sensitive. When I am going to do masturbation or sex, I am unable to control my ejaculation for more than two minutes. What can I do to solve the problem?","Doctor":"Hi. The problem, you are facing now, is called as premature ejaculation. Try to indulge more in foreplay with your partner rather than moving quickly towards the act. Please say whether you have erectile dysfunction along with this problem. Masters and Johnson start and stop technique can help you. You have to let your partner stimulate you and the minute when you feel you are going to ejaculate, ask her to put her hand over your penis and stop the ejaculation. Keep doing this every day, and gradually, you will notice an increase in ejaculation time. If these techniques do not help you, you can consider taking tablet Dapoxetine."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was on Escitalopram for the past 14 years till date and with Lorel also before five years back but later the psychiatrist stopped.

I have an erectile dysfunction for which I am consuming homeopathic medicines and this has helped me a lot. But, now also I am not able to ejaculate inside her vagina. I feel like removing out the penis. Please help me out.","Doctor":"Hello. Taking Escitalopram or Lorazepam without a regular supervision of a psychiatrist for long periods of time is not advisable. This affects the health badly. Nexito is Escitalopram only and this could be the reason for your poor orgasm or delayed ejaculation. If your libido has reduced and you are not able to ejaculate then there is a need for re-evaluation. Drugs like Bupropion can be added to the prescription which will help in remission of symptoms and this will not affect the sexual life too. Instead of Lorazepam, drugs like Clonazepam or Etizolam can be used.

I do not know the person whom I had sex and do not know whether she has HIV or not. Am I at risk of getting HIV infection from vaginal sex with two condoms?

Protected sexual activity shows a reduced chance to have HIV. The rates of transmission stand at 1 in 10000 sexual activity. So, you have a less probability of acquiring the infection. It is always better to get tested for your contact which clears your most doubts.

For moderate to severe grade acne, both oral medication and topical treatment are effective. Topical treatment of acne comprises topical antibacterials like Clindamycin, topical Benzoyl peroxide and topical Retinoids. Oral therapy includes oral antibiotics like Doxycycline, Minocycline, Azithromycin, and Oral Retinoids such as Isotretinoin. Acne scars improve a lot with chemical peeling.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

So, please tell me what is this.","Doctor":"Hi. It is likely a spondylosis both cervical and lumbar. It is a spine problem where you get pain and other symptoms due to compression of nerves between spine. So it will cause symptoms along the course of nerves. It is probably due to prolonged sitting. Do you have any history of trauma to your spine, does this pain increase on neck movement, is it associated with tingling, numbness, needles and pins sensation, if yes then it further supports the diagnosis. You will need MRI of the whole spine as X-rays are not informative. Repeat X-ray will not be helpful. The X-ray will show only if the problem is severe. The treatment for this is physiotherapy to release the nerve compression, traction, cervical collar. Till the time you can have tablet Neurobion forte once a day which is a nerve vitamin and diclofenac gel for local application.

You do not have a cyst formation associated with the impacted tooth according to the images. In some cases, by orthodontic treatment, the tooth can be exposed, and they are brought to a normal position. In some cases, after extraction of the retained baby tooth, the impacted tooth can come into favorable position. So the orthodontist can place braces on it to bring it into position.

I have reviewed your health query and want to add that it is all relative situation meaning that every patient has a different scenario. Some patients have no issues with cholesterol but some have a family history of raised cholesterol levels. Patients may also have a family history of heart and blood vessel disease. If we control the physical factors, it reduces the risk of heart diseases and blockage issues. Yes, exercise, as you mentioned, is very helpful in keeping the things in balance. Your query about medicines to control the disease depends on what medications are we talking about. There may be a bunch of classes of medications in heart disease. Taking medications is mandatory in your case. If it does not lower the percentage of blockage, it will definitely be helpful in blocking any further derangement. Your cardiologist can discuss the issue better as he is having detailed medical history upfront. Cholesterol can be maintained in normal limits and your cardiac health can be kept in check. Blood pressure medications also help in some patients who have the basic issue of high blood pressure. If someone has the blood vessel disease we can give medications to relieve the spasm of vessels and dilate the blood vessels. Sometimes we raise the blood flow to heart muscles and in this way the blockage to heart vessels is relieved."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have cut my finger open on a bottle cap two days ago.

The doctor performed ileostomy, after that, I took radiotherapy and chemotherapy Pholfox 6. After that, I was declared free from cancer on the basis of PET scan report.

I am facing so many trouble in my daily routine and now body weight is 48 to 49 kg. I had all treatment from renowned hospitals and doctors. My GI surgeon again advised me for closure operation since 18 months and assured me to operate in a different way to get success, but some other medical expert asked me to wait for 2 to 3 years for recovery and maintain stamina. Kindly advice me about risk in stoma closure operation. The problem that would be faced after operation (due to a narrow route of the rectum). Are my all procedures were in the right direction? and reasons behind continuos failure of closure operation. Is there any abnormality that would occur after the operation if a large part of the intestine is unused since a long time. Any further advice please.","Doctor":"Hi. Your treatment started and went on as per the standard guidelines. Your complications arose because of the stricture (narrowing) at the site of joining your intestine after removing cancer. (There can be many reasons for that, follow up if you are interested). Due to this blockage (most likely) your stoma closure failed repeatedly. Now also first of all sigmoidoscopy and/or fresh distal cologram (your last one was done last year) should be done (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Undergoing repeated surgeries does increase the risk of failure of surgery and other complications greatly. If a large part of the intestine is unused for a long time, it is not a problem and the intestine usually adapts well in around nine months to a year's time. 18 months is more than sufficient time to re-operate safely.

The first molar of the lower jaw of both the left and right side are having cavities. Go for X-ray for both the tooth. In the X-ray, the dentist can see where infection (caries) has reached (to the pulp or not). If caries has reached the pulp, you have to go for pedodontic root canal treatment (pulpectomy).

Coughing has got nothing to do with vaccination. It is normal in children below the age of 6 months to cough or sneeze occasionally. Frankly speaking, it does not require treatment as long as the child is able to feed without any difficulty.

Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It may cause nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, breast tenderness, headache. Taking them after meals can help reduce the intensity of these side effects and use of antiemetic drugs (for example Domperidone) to prevent nausea and vomiting. Your gynecologist may help you with that. They may also cause a delay in the regular next periods or cause an early next period or spotting.

Can you tell me a complete guide on how should I proceed? What tests should I do? After I have done them, can I post it here for a thorough examination from your doctors, so that they can tell me whether I am HGH deficient? I want to test that because I have hypothyroidism and I am taking Levothyroxine and my levels are now normal. They were not normal two years ago and I had severe symptoms of hypothyroidism (severe fatigue, severe muscle cramps, lethargy, brain focus problems, pretty much all of the symptoms of hypothyroidism). Moreover, I made tests back then and I saw that my somatoprin levels were a lot below the normal. My reasons for this testing is that I think that this hypothyroidism really has stunted my growth, and pretty much everything in my development. From 16 to 19 years, I have not treated my hypothyroidism and I just lagged behind in development compared to my peers. Now I just want to see if I can do anything. Maybe if I have HGH deficiency, I still could manage to grow a little with HGH replacement or something. My age is 21, I also have beta thalassemia minor. I do not have any other medical issues.","Doctor":"Hi. You need to check IGF1 level (insulin-like growth factor 1), liver function and kidney function tests and hemoglobin level.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

First, you have to rule out the organic or structural cause of enuresis, like urinary tract infections, obstruction, polyuria, diabetes, and any medicine. Second, if the organic cause is ruled out then you have to review the toilet training of your child, and medicine such as Desmopressin or Reboxetine are alternative.

Recently, I got a new pair of progressive lenses. I am finding that my right eye cannot focus properly and it is always blurry. First, I thought that the prescription was wrong. But after making many attempts with my new lens, I was able to notice that my old progressive lens had an incorrect pupillary distance by 2 mm on my right eye. I wore that glasses for three years, and I was unaware. I am worried whether wearing glasses with PD by 2 mm so long have caused any adjustments in my right eye? Why is my eye blurry? I was wondering why my new lenses were not focussing correctly as they were present with a correct PD. Is it possible to retrain my eye to focus accurately? Can I start wearing a single vision lens which can help me for a while?","Doctor":"Hi. By going through your query, I can understand that you are suffering from intolerance to progressive lenses. It can be due to an increase in near vision with age. It is not due to incorrect PD (pupillary distance). If you work on a computer, intermediate vision glasses can provide you more comfort rather than progressive. Intermediate vision glasses gives the support of vision when they are used for indoor work and reading. For distant vision, you may choose to remove your glasses. In case, if both of your eyes are not working together (binocular vision defects), a change in IPD (interpupillary distance) may develop. In that case, few tests for binocular vision can help. Also, some types of cataract or glaucoma in early stage produces glass intolerance, and it leads to a frequent change of glasses in an older age group. A slit lamp examination and dilated fundus examination are advised to rule out the causes of glass intolerance."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have heard that edging helps to maintain sexual excitement for an extended period.

You should always clean off the last set of aligners and keep them somewhere safe when you move on to your next set. These can be used to maintain your progress if you break or lose your current set. If the crack has not split the tray, and if the tray is holding together pretty well, then you can continue wearing the tray. Be careful while putting the aligner on and off, as the crack can get worse when removing your aligners. Use a flat edge stick to pop off the aligners and reduce bending while taking them off. When putting them back, press evenly and firmly to avoid adding additional stress to the aligners. If the split is bad, and if the aligner cannot hold its shape, stop wearing the aligner. You will not get any benefits from wearing the tray. Go back to the previous tray to maintain your progress until you have a replacement aligner."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

There are several different types of Insulin. The correct type for your mother can be decided by her treating doctor based on various factors like age, weight, her daily routine, previous medical history, etc. Please talk to your doctor and see if Insulin is an option for her.

I can understand your concern. CMV (cytomegalovirus) IgG and IgM suggests that you have cytomegalovirus infection and it can spread to the baby. 90 % of infections are asymptomatic. But 5 to 15 % may have hearing loss, mental retardation, and microcephaly. These are the tests which should be done in the baby. They are spin enhanced culture and virus isolation in tissue culture. It is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosis. Other tests such as urine, saliva, CMV antigen test, CT (computed tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), hearing test, ophthalmological evaluation, CBC (complete blood count), and LFT (liver function test) should also be done. The child should be examined soon by the neonatologist. Infection can spread by breastfeeding.

As the uric acid is high at 10 mg/dL, it is likely a cause of arthritis. Febuxostat that you are using now should be used every day even when you are not having pain. This medication is used to treat acute gout, and it prevents recurrent attacks. Check your uric acid level if you are taking Feburic 40 mg. Increase the dose to 80 mg and recheck uric acid in four weeks. Uric acid should be less than 6 mg/dL. Avoid drinking alcohol, and you can add proteins to the diet such as chicken, beef, mutton, or fish. But not in excess and it should not be taken every day. Do these blood tests such as CBC (complete blood count), ANA (antinuclear antibodies), rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibodies, and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) to rule out other possible diseases."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My T hormone is 157 dl and prolactin is 22. My sperm is 28 million and normal morphology. The scan showed normal testis size but grade l varicocele both sides but I have erection dysfunction and no sensation in my penis.","Doctor":"Hi. Your serum testosterone levels are on the lower side. But the semen analysis is good. So do not take hormone replacement now. If you take testosterone supplementation, chances of decreased sperm count are there. Grade one varicocele does not require treatment unless it causes changes in semen analysis or scrotal pain. You need a workup for your erectile dysfunction. See your urologist."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 15 weeks pregnant. Is it right to go swimming in a pool now?","Doctor":"Hi. If you know swimming before pregnancy, then you can do it in pregnancy also. Have few precautionary steps. If you do not have a risk of threatened miscarriage, low lying placenta or other complications, then there is a need to avoid overexertion in pregnancy when you go swimming. Try to warm up and cool down yourself gradually. Do not do overexertion. If you feel tired, come out of the pool immediately. If you are not feeling well, then it is better to avoid swimming. Do not swim in deep waters. Try to have someone with you while going swimming. Try to avoid swimming in late pregnancy and if you have any abnormal symptoms like breathlessness, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 40-year-old male with abnormally high testosterone. All other lab tests came back negative. What should be my next step? I also have malaise, muscle aches, anxiety, and abdominal pain.","Doctor":"Hi.

Please send the testosterone report."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD. For more information consult an ayurveda specialist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had sex for the first time.Â After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 20 years old, male, 72 kg, 6 feet, suffering from excess salivation from a month. I took Glycopyrrolate 1 mg. Please give your advice on this drug or suggest a better drug.","Doctor":"Hi. Excessive salivation may be caused by certain conditions that need to be ruled out to solve it definitely. You may be suffering from acid reflux, sinusitis, or other upper respiratory tract infections which may give you hypersalivation. If you feel anything else except this concern, see your family doctor for an objective examination. If you have stomach pain or heartburn take Omeprazole to reduce acid producing. Continue Glycopyrrolate for some days if hypersalivation really disturbs you but if no improvement comes, see your doctor. Take care and best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a diagnosis of scarring of tympanum before 30 years. Recently, I was diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. Could the residuals of this scarring have any influence on my hearing now?","Doctor":"Hi. Scarring of the tympanic membrane (myringosclerosis) rarely causes symptoms. Tympanosclerosis can extend to the middle ear and produce hearing loss. With your clinical history, it suggests presbycusis (an age-related degenerative disorder of inner ear). You need to visit an ENT specialist for proper examination and audiometry."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 24 years old. My husband is 48. He has two children from his last partner. 18 years old and 20 years old. We have been trying to get pregnant for nearly 12 months now. I was on the Depo injection which I only had twice and I never had it when it was due which was three years back. So do you think I need to seek advice or investigating from doctors? Or is there anything else I can do? I have been tracking ovulation for 10 months and I am ovulating every month. None of us are on any medication. I am taking folic acid regularly. He was a bit of a binge drinker around two times a week but has not done that for over 12 months.","Doctor":"Hi. You can safely try for another two months before going for investigations. Chance of pregnancy when you try for 12 months is around 85 %. For the information you gave, there does not appear any factor which can prevent pregnancy. There is no need to monitor ovulation, as it increases stress and reduces the chance of pregnancy. When your cycles are regular, ovulation is considered to happen regularly unless proved otherwise."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I recently had malaria and the symptoms I first got was back pain. It stopped for a while. I was given Dynapar and Lonart to keep me stable. That was a few days ago and I have been getting this strong back pain that also hurt the chest. At times, it hurts when I breathe.","Doctor":"Hi. Every infective pathology after getting resolved creates a post-infectious syndrome. In your case, it is a post-malaria syndrome. You can take painkillers for it. Take tablet Combiflam once or twice a day. Secondly, if it persists long or it is still worrying you, you can have a USG (whole abdomen) done to look for spleen size that sometimes may cause dull-aching pain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a health and exercise question.

Not all at once, alternating between arms and legs. I wanted to know if it was fine for a starting workout. I also had 151 grams of protein so far today and one gallon of water to drink. Is this fine for a starting plan?","Doctor":"Hi. Having polymyositis, you should start with a fewer resistance exercise and more of stretching exercises to improve flexibility. Yes, the exercise plan you made is fine for a good start. But maintain the muscle length through stretching exercises before initiation of the workout. Protein content increased by 250 gms per day and one gallon of water. Drink enough water before the workout. Take equal amount of rest in between the sessions. It helps the recovery of muscle soreness. It can include aerobic exercises. Count your heart beats to increase the time period."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is 76 years old.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of infection and inflammation anywhere in the body. It takes at least six hours for CRP to raise in the blood, once the infection starts and it continues to raise up to 24 hours at least. Though there are no signs of infection clinically, that is, the child is well symptomatically, it is still possible that CRP raises.

You may be suffering from conjunctivitis or some other eye infection or it might be some allergy which is common. You should wash your eyes with warm water mixed with a pinch of salt (similar to one prepared for gargling, but with lesser salt). Do this every two to three hours for three to four times in 12 hours. If redness is reduced, then most probably you have conjunctivitis. In any case, you should consult an ophthalmologist personally for a checkup, as redness and warmth may mean a lot of things and can be diagnosed better with a thorough examination.

But I have done a bit of research, since this has been going on for a week now, and I am quite sure it does not have anything to do with my irregular period. Something is wrong. It keeps hurting and earlier today, I could not walk properly due to the intense pain. Also, I tried to stop myself from peeing all day, because the pain gets more intense as I pee. Please help me. I am scared of telling my mom about this. Also, I kind of tried masturbating before. Using various objects for pleasure. I think it may have caused this. I am also really scared of consulting a doctor in real life, for I am pretty embarrassed and I do not know what kind of person they will think I am. I regret everything. I regret not stopping. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. You are too small to have a regular cycle. In this early age you are at the beginning of the development of menstrual and reproductive developmental cycle, so can have very irregular and anovulatory cycles. Premenstrual or menstrual syndrome could be more severe. For that, you can have medications even hormonal support as well in the next step if unable to benefit from painkillers or Ibuprofen. Using various objects for pleasure has given you an infection and for that, you need precautions and treatment. Vaginal secretions cannot be sent now as you are menstruating. Have strict hygiene. Wear soft comfortable cotton undergarments. Sitz bath and sit in warm water. Have tablet Doxycycline 100 mg 12 hourly, tablet Metronidazole 400 mg eight hourly for seven days and tablet Postan 500 mg eight hourly as per needed for the pain.

Fever has not reduced with Paracetamol syrup, so we treated with the help of Voltran suppository. When we give suppository, the temperature will reduce then it again raises after 6 or 7 hours. What can we do?","Doctor":"Hi. This mostly looks like a viral fever. Viral fever usually subsides in up to five days. Also, the X-ray picture is suggestive of mild bronchitis. For a cough and cold, you can give syrup Asthakind (Bromhexine, Menthol) and syrup Sinarest (Paracetamol, Chlorpheniramine maleate) instead of Tripofed (Triprolidine).

Tingling sensation in any part is due to nerve irritation supplying the area. In case of hand, it can be due to cervical spondylosis or due to CTS (carpal tunnel syndrome). However, none is serious and can be managed easily. So, no need to worry. You should check your vitamin D level and B12 level.

And I am also taking ginger, lemon, honey, and apple cider vineger solution two teaspoons daily and giloy daily. I am observing that my BP is fluctuating. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. BP (blood pressure) and pulse are not constant parameters and are ever-changing. So it is entirely normal for them to show variations. We just have to watch that they are not crossing their limits. For systolic BP, 110 to 140 and for diastolic BP 60 to 90 is fine. And the resting pulse rate between 50 to 90 is appropriate for you. So, readings anywhere in between are fine. Also, BP fluctuations nowadays are more commonly seen due to the use of electronic BP apparatus, which are over-sensitive and cause variations. If you are using an electronic BP apparatus, then you should take three readings at a time with arm resting on the table and completely relaxed. And two matching readings are approximate BP of yours. However, if most of the BP readings are above or below this range then needs dose change, so let me know the details of your readings. You should make a chart of it by taking readings frequently, say three times a day (and each time three readings to know the average) for a week period. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

On the 24th, I got an implant (rod) in my arm to prevent unwanted pregnancy. 10 days after getting that done, I had bleeding for roughly three months non-stop. So, I started taking the pill for a while but the bleeding did not stop. Roughly two weeks ago, I got the rod taken out of my arm and got the Depo needle injected in. The bleeding stopped for three days and then again I have been bleeding for a week and a bit now. It started off really light and now mediumly heavy. It is really uncomfortable to wear sanitary napkins 24/7. It is making me depressed. Is there any way to stop the vaginal bleeding?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand that you are a candidate in whom implanon (birth control implant) did not suit well. It is good that you got it removed. You switched over to depot injection almost immediately. Ideally, you should have given a gap of a month and should have been placed on antifibrinolytics for the control of bleeding. Nevertheless, now that the depot shot is in, some irregularity in periods is expected for two months or so.   This present bleeding can be reduced and stopped by antifibrinolytics like tablet Tranexamic acid 500 mg thrice a day for five days. You may choose to start them as early as possible. They do not have any side effects. But will help you stop the bleeding."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I sprained my thumb last week. I still have some pain but grip, strength and movement are increasing. Can I skip a doctor visit? At first, my thumb was swollen and redness was present. I could not bend it at all. After using R.I.C.E, the swelling has decreased to near normal and it is much more flexible. There is still some pain on the index finger side of the joint when pressed, but grip strength is returning. I am now able to straighten the thumb without difficulty but I cannot fully close the thumb on itself. What should be my next course of action - more rest, work on stretching it out or consulting a specialist?","Doctor":"Hi. Your description of pain, the presence of swelling and redness and its site of maximum tenderness makes me worry about what is called the \\"gamekeepers thumb\\". This is the injury of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the thumb. If that is the injury then you should ideally have yourself examined by a doctor to assess the degree of the injury of the ligament. Because a complete tear will require surgery. But from your description, the chances are remote as you have regained movements and the pain is also settling. The main issue with the UCL injury is lack of or weakness in the pinch grip between the thumb and the index finger which can be quite troublesome for people who do heavy work with their hands.

Ask your doctor to get anemia workup done, get vitamin D, and calcium levels. Sjogren syndrome itself is a cause of fatigue, and get ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (c-reactive protein) done to check for disease activity.

Please suggest a permanent solution for dryness.","Doctor":"Hi. The dry eye needs evaluation for identifying the cause of dryness. It can occur due to lifestyle changes related to excessive use of digital devices. It may also happen due to a drop in tear production which can be measured by Schirmer's test. It can also occur due to excessive evaporation of tears due to deficiency of the lipid layer, and it may be evaluated on slit lamp examination of the opening of your meibomian glands. I would recommend you see an ophthalmologist. If the cause is treated, the dryness reduces soon."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 36-year-old male who has suffered from OCD for the majority of my life. My psychiatrist has changed Celexa to 40 mg, and I am taking this dose for two months now. I have a feeling of mania, anxiety and I am unable to deal with it. I also feel impulsive, and sometimes I feel great, and I can accomplish a lot. I also have a feeling like I have been traveling in a roller coaster for a few months. It happened to me several times in my life. Do I need to seek another psychiatrist's opinion? I also take Xanax 0.5 mg whenever required.","Doctor":"Hi. Please mention about your OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) symptoms. Please say about the type of obsessions and compulsions you have. You can take tablet Prozac (Fluoxetine) 20 mg for a week and gradually increase it to 40 mg. Prozac helps for OCD as well as for impulsivity. Along with it, take tablet Olanzapine 10 mg. It helps for the current mood stability you are experiencing now. Also, consider going to therapy such as exposure and response prevention. It also helps for OCD."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 37 years old. Last year, when I was working, I had a restless feeling in my heart. So I left my work on that day and went back home. My pain got increased, and I immediately reached the hospital. After an hour, I got admitted to CCU, and I was there for five days. I had a blockage in one valve. I underwent angiography and PCI. Now, I am taking Plavix 75 mg, Ascard 150 mg, Concor 5 mg, and Treatan 8 mg. Now, I am getting improved, and I am taking diet food. But I still have restlessness in my chest, and when I move, my legs and hands hang up. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You had coronary heart disease at a young age, and PCI (percutaneous intervention) was done immediately. Now you have to be very careful in this regard because those with a coronary artery disease have a further risk. First of all, reduce your risk factors. Avoid smoking, or any other addiction if you have. Reduce taking salt in your diet, avoid taking fast food and junk food. Remain active, and do an exercise of moderate intensity. Check your fasting lipid profile and do renal function test soon with electrolytes. Never miss your medicines. Do echocardiography and have a follow-up. After all, that, consult a good cardiologist so that you may be guided accordingly to reduce future risk. Coming to your complaint of having chest discomfort, I advise you do an ECG. If it is normal, then ETT (exercise tolerance test) is done in which you have to walk on a graded ramp and simultaneously your ECG and BP is recorded. If your symptoms are due to heart, then you will have ECG changes."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have itchy and watery eyes. I cannot look at an object for a long time as tears come out from my eyes. I always blink and stay calm. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You are suffering from a condition called a dry eye. I advise you follow these precautions. Reduce the screen time which in turn increases the blink frequency. It gives you some relief. If still, it persists, you can use artificial tear supplements which are preservative free. If there is no improvement, you can use tear supplements in gel form so that the drug retains in an eye for some time. Reduce the temperature of the eye by applying a wet cloth on your eyes before sleeping as it reduces irritation and dry eye. It is important to grade the severity of the dry eye before prescribing any medications as the treatment varies with severity. Please give some information about your condition and a picture of your eye. Please explain whether you have continuous symptoms or you have it during a particular time. Please say whether you experience any seasonal variations of the symptoms. Please tell whether you use glasses and if you use, suggest the power of the glasses. Please say whether you have any swellings on the inner side of the nose adjacent to the eye. Please tell whether you have any difficulty in seeing the light, any discharge from your eyes and whether you develop any swelling in the lids."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 18 years old.

Treatment of choice in this condition is radical radiotherapy using IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy) and IGRT (image-guided radiation therapy) technique with concurrent weekly cisplatin chemotherapy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have noticed two problems in me. I have these problems for three months. I have disturbed sleep on several days and erectile issues (sustaining erection during intercourse). I am a hypothyroid patient for two years (I take thyroxine Sodium 100 mcg). I have high myopia (-10 power in both eyes) and severe dry eyes (Schirmer score of 2 mm in each eye). I take Restasis, Systane ultra and Eyemist eye gel for the dryness. I have tight schedules throughout the day. I consulted a psychiatrist last month. The doctor told me that the issues are due to anxiety and she advised me to take Vilano 20 mg in the afternoon, and Clomipramine 10 mg at night time. I have attached the prescription. After five days of taking medicines, I felt my mood to be better. But I faced several side effects with dry mouth, chest spasms, total erectile dysfunction, and a sore throat. I consulted an ENT specialist for a sore throat, and he advised me to stop the anxiety medicines as throat issues can also occur due to the medication. I quitted it, and I faced several withdrawal symptoms on the next day. I was getting brain zaps while going to sleep (electric currents running through my brain) and I was unable to sleep for two days. Hence, I consulted a neurologist. He suggested me Lonazep 0.5 mg, Sove 5 mg and advised me to do a psychological assessment. Based on the evaluation, he informed me to continue taking Lonazep 0.5 mg, Sove 5 mg for 60 days and also advised me to do cognitive therapy, relaxation therapy, and yoga. I have the following questions. Am I following the right direction? I think taking Lonazep 0.5 mg and Sove 5 mg will not be an easy one to stop. Can I have withdrawal symptoms after taking it? Is it right to take anxiety medicines? I still have brain zaps, and I always take alcohol for once a week. Will I have any impact due to the medication? If yes, please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. You are not following the right direction regarding medicines. There are two types of treatment such as primary medicine like SSRI (e.g., Vilazodone) and supportive medicines like Sove and Benzodiazepines like Lonazep. We can take an example. If you have malaria or dengue, you will have a fever and Paracetamol is taken. But it will not cover the whole illness to cure it, and so we will take specific medicine for malaria such as Quinine. Yes, Benzodiazepines have withdrawal symptoms when quitted suddenly. It is better to take proper medication. The side effects such as dryness of mouth and dryness of eyes, you had were due to Clonil. Vilazodone does not show such side effects so you can start retaking it. There are other options also, but we can try taking Vilazodone first. The worsening of anxiety does not occur due to medicines. It is a natural course of illness which got unmasked when you quit the medication. Taking alcohol occasionally is fine. But in anxiety and depression, usually, people perceive that alcohol can cure the problem, and they can make them relax. But there is a need to understand that it may lead to alcohol addiction, worsening of anxiety and depression. Gradually taper off and stop taking Lonazep (Clonazepam) and Sove (Zolpidem) and build the dose of Vilano in future."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am really worried as I am a 15-year-old girl and have been on the Microgynon 30 pills for a month now. I had unprotected sex a week ago for the first time but my boyfriend did not ejaculate inside of me. For the past two days, I have been really ill. I feel sick but I am not actually sick, I have headaches and I also have discharge (been suffering from this for a while now). I also cannot eat anything as I am not hungry. Is there any chance I could be pregnant or is it just a fever? I am really nervous (I have never missed a pill and have taken it every single day at the same time).","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? If you have been on Microgynon 30 regularly and have a well-protected sex without any tear or spill, then there is no chance of pregnancy. Also when you are very sure that he did not ejaculate into you. Even though he did not ejaculate into you, his seminal secretions may have come in contact with your vagina, so also any infections lodged in his penis. You being so young, your vaginal and cervical cell lining will be very friable. They are very sensitive to tear and any infection. This can cause vaginal infection. Vaginal infection, which is transmitted during sex (so partner is the source), so both have to be treated at a time or else you will get infected next time of sex. You may have white or yellow or grayish discharge with or without itching, foul smell, pain at beginning of sex due to dryness (as the lubrication will be reduced) and late towards the end, when fully erect penis touches the innermost vagina (due to inflammation of the structures around the uterus) pain radiating to the back or thighs. Associated to infection bowel movement is affected, also features of gastritis. Bleeding of periods will be thicker, darker, clots or fleshy masses like, may smell bad, more days with spotting after the periods too. When you have an infection inside the uterus, the blood flow increases as inner lining is inflamed and the blood mixed with the inner lining of uterus forms a thick, doughy or fleshy mass. As the healing of the lining is not complete, it keeps spotting or you have blood stained discharge. May have associated gastritis features like belching, constipation or loose stools, pain in lower abdomen, as the muscles and ligaments around uterus, are being irritated by the infection. You may not have all the features, but they may appear over time. Pain is throbbing even before periods and last after periods are over too. Usually, infection is mixed and not just due to yeast fungus, there will be a family of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, all of which cannot be detected on culture. When one is treated and cleared, other will grow and if not fully treated, it will regrow. Before treatment, confirm that you are not pregnant by having a home urine pregnancy test. You and your partner can have tablet Fluconazole 150 mg stat (only one tablet, no repetition), after lunch, tablet Azithromycin 1 gm stat (only one tablet, no repetition) one hour before food. Tablet Secnidazole forte two tablets stat (no repetition) after dinner. All these on same day by both of you. Later, you have capsule Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for one week. Vaginal wash with V Wash or similar cleanser twice a day and vaginal pessary. Capsule Clingen forte or Candid-CL or Cansoft CL once at night for five nights.  Your partner can have a local application of any antibiotic and antifungal cream. Candid B or Candiderma or Lobate GM on penis twice a day after wash for seven days. Do not have sex till the infection is fully gone. Do treat it as delay may send the infection inwards and may affect both you and partner's future fertility."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have back pain on the left side and cannot move on that side. The pain was between my belly and back, but now it is only on my back at the end of the spinal cord. While sitting, standing, or even sleeping, I can feel the pain in this area and it lasts for one week. I am currently taking Ibubrufen.","Doctor":"Hi. You are very young to actually have persistent back pains. There are many causes of pain in the lower back region. It can be due to faulty posture, related to weak muscles, issues with disc, narrowing of spinal canal, or any bony instability besides many others. So accurate diagnosis is the key to proper management of the condition. You will have to elaborate on your problem of back pain which means the duration of pain and mode of onset. I would also like to ask you if it is associated with any leg pain or any other neurological symptoms like numbness, paraesthesias (electrical shock like abnormal sensations) or any weakness in limbs? Please also tell me about any associated symptoms like fever, weight loss, etc. What medications you generally take for your existing problem? If you have localized back pain with no other symptoms like radiating leg pain, neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, paresthesias, etc, then you can start with following recommendations for an initial period of two to three weeks. 1. Maintain proper posture of your back while working and sleeping. 2. If pain is more then you can take a short course of anti-inflammatory medication like tab Etoricoxib or Paracetamol or one which suits you. 3. Physical therapy initially under the supervision of a trained physiotherapist and then to continue at home. 4. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake if levels are low in the body. 5. Ice packs can be applied if your pain is acute, then hot fomentation can be done at home. 6. Analgesic spray for local application can be used and is easily available. 7. Avoid lifting heavyweight or acute forward bending in the mornings, etc. We will observe you for the next two to three weeks on how you respond to this conservative management protocol. If you are not feeling better, then we will have to get some investigations like, dynamic x-rays of lower back and few blood tests for evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I had unprotected sex on the 19th but, I am on birth control. It is not like my normal period and not as light as I would think spotting would be. It started about four to five days after the unprotected sex. Is there any explanation for this or is it just the birth control messing with my system?","Doctor":"Hi. This is what is typically called breakthrough bleeding (BTB). This is seen in cases of usage of birth control pills with high estrogen content of 30 micrograms of estradiol. The event is not related to unprotected sex as you had intercourse in your safe period, as you said you have two more weeks for periods. So, this bleeding started at the time of ovulation when estrogen is in excess and progesterone is limited. The thickened proliferative endometrium (uterine lining) starts breaking and causes spotting till the progesterone part of the pills become active and secretory phase ensues. My advice would be to be placed on low dose oral contraceptive pills for birth control rather than high dose pills. Then this breakthrough bleeding which is a common side effect of high dose pills can be avoided.

I am getting irregular periods for every two months. My doctor suggested Dronis 20 mg tablet for 24 days. My weight is 37 and I did an ultrasound, the report shows PCOD. I am having mild acne on my face. Can I use Dronis 20 mg? Does it have any side-effects such as in future infertility?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Let me give you a few facts on PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease). PCOD (polycystic ovaries) is a congenital condition. I mean it is a genetically programmed, you get it from your parents. When you suddenly put on weight, this cholesterol is converted into estrogen hormone (if I may simulate, have you seen obese men developing breast and in young obese girls, who develop periods at a younger age, they all have high levels of estrogen hormone or female hormone). In your body too when fat, which is a store for tomorrow, is more than normal, this is converted to the hormone which tips the balance between FSH (from the brain) and the ovarian hormone. FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) as the name suggests stimulates follicle from the ovary, but once the follicle is big enough to ovulate, the FSH is suppressed by the same estrogen hormone from the ovary. But when the same estrogen hormone is coming from fat, the brain is confused and follicle growth stops early at a smaller follicle size and will not rupture. In the next scan, you will see all these follicles as polycystic ovaries. This is usually associated with obesity, irregular cycles, no periods for few months and later heavy periods with clots and fleshy masses, or spotting on and off, thyroid abnormality and prolactin problem indirectly. You develop that extra-pad of fat around the mid-segment of the body, especially waist, thighs and breast, no fat beyond elbow and knees. Excessive body hair growth, hair fall, a dark shade over lower half of face, acne, oily face skin, the black skin over the back of the neck, inner thighs and under the surface of the breast. May have a family history of diabetes, especially the father or his family. This will not allow ovulation to occur at a time and so you cannot get pregnant, till treated. It also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. But this has a solution. Your weight has to be Weight (in kg) equal to the height (in cm) - 100. Once you reduce weight to normal range, you will not need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant and pregnancy will be healthy. To reduce weight, no fasting, no junk food, fast foods or red meat, reduce snacks between meals. Have low calories food, high proteins, regular exercise (especially for the waist and hip area), aerobics, yoga, brisk walking, (swing your hands well), try to reduce 2 to 4 kg per month. Do not hurry on weight reduction, it will be difficult to maintain. As soon as you reduce at least 5 kg, you will see changes. Even if you are in the normal weight range, try this schedule, it will help. Your scan shows ovaries less than 10 cc (attachment removed to protect patient identity), so it does not meet the criteria of PCOD. Maybe you recently have put on some weight. Dronis (Drospirenone with Ethinylestradiol) will correct your hormonal imbalance and has no side effects. Your acne will disappear. But staying healthy with a regular workout every day is complete treatment."},{"Patient":"I have had pityriasis rosea (PR) for about a week and I am currently 7 weeks pregnant.

It is a very short history for too many events and drugs you have taken and a very short time period. Second, you have not mentioned your detailed medical, drug, menstrual, gynecological, and obstetric history. First of all, you had a miscarriage (surgical) and bled only for two weeks and only in the third week took tablets to induce periods. After a miscarriage and two weeks bleeding, how and why stress on normal periods immediately as body and hormonal cycle need time to develop and to start all over. After that post unprotected intercourse, you took another hormone as an emergency contraceptive that can have further side effects on your body. My suggestion now is to use no more hormones as already lots of natural and induced hormonal events took place and body has had enough to bear lots of inductions. So, now just wait to have a natural cycle to start itself as these emergency contraceptives only can delay, irregulate cycles and can show mood variations, spotting, etc. Have healthy nutritious diet as dieting can also delay period.

Deficiency of these vitamins can lead to symptoms similar to yours. Remember that vitamin B12 is tested on an empty stomach with 12 hours fasting. If you have had a wound that is red or is not healing, meet your diabetologist without delay. Keep moving your feet and toes as an exercise to regulate blood flow. If there is a podiatry clinic near you, it might help to visit once."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am inquiring about bumps on my legs (specifically shins) that itch so bad and are always there. Sometimes more than others but always there. It looks like the skin is red and raised around my hair follicle. Is there an over-the-counter cream or moisturizer or soap, etc., that I could use to prevent irritation? Could it be something else entirely? Unfortunately, I am just not one of those people that can live with hairy legs. What to do?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case. Yes, these are folliculitis (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and occur when small hair is growing especially when hair removing is not done in a proper direction. When you have a lesion, then mix Fucidin and Hydrocortisone creams in equal amount and apply on red lesions. For prevention, keep your leg well moisturized by applying any oil or lotion and apply only in one direction. Do not rub."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best. For further queries consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My friend aged 30 had two drops of phenol mistaking for milk. He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife is 10 weeks pregnant. Due to lockdown, we are not able to go to the doctor. She feels body pain and started spitting a lot from the fourth week. She also vomits a lot. Please tell me what should I do and also suggest health supplements for her.","Doctor":"Hello. Nausea and vomitings are pretty much common during the first three to four months of pregnancy which happens due to sudden hormonal changes. The body pains she feels is also due to the same reason. I am assuming she must be taking Folic acid supplements already after she got to know she was pregnant, or once the scan was done. If not please start them immediately. After 14th week she can stop Folic acid and switch to iron supplements once nausea and vomitings subside. I will be mentioning the tests that she needs to take up as she is already 10 weeks pregnant. There will be an important scan in the coming weeks, that is, between 11 to13 weeks, which is called NT scan (Nuchal scan) and also a blood test called double marker test which is for the screening of Down's syndrome in the fetus, along with other chromosomal abnormalities called Trisomy 13 and 18. Please do not miss these tests. You can get back to me if you got any further queries. Pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. NT scan (11-13 weeks). Dual marker test (11-13 weeks). Tablet Folvite 5 mg daily, Doxinate plus (Doxylamine, Pyridoxine and Folic acid) two tablets at bedtime for 15 days (it reduces nausea and morning sickness). Tablet Emset SOS 8 mg before food, if vomiting is uncontrolled. Syrup Gelusil two teaspoons thrice daily 15 minutes before food for one week. Small meals at frequent intervals. Avoid spicy foods. Drink more water and fluids to avoid getting dehydrated. Avoid sexual intercourse untill 14 weeks to prevent the risk of miscarriages."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, It all started with tailbone and sit bones pain. After one month, left buttock and upper thigh started to pain, severity increased and was difficult to walk. I was advised Nucoxia for a week but even after that severity was the same, then I had MRI scan and was diagnosed left psoas abscess (infection process most probably Koch's). It was 1 to 1.5 month since the pain started and until this was diagnosed. I am taking AKT four tablets since one month. In this period pain increased a little, shifted to right leg also and now seems to be decreasing. Now I can walk almost normally but when I sit, tail bone and sit bones still pain. Along with this, the doctor said I have ankylosing spondylitis as well for which I am taking ayurvedic medicine. After 1.5 months I have been told to repeat MRI to check the progress. My questions are that how long does it take for the pain to fully reduce once AKT 4 has been started? (It is one month over for me). In MRI, it was mentioned infection process most probably Koch's, why is it most probably and not with 100 % confirmation? Which food needs to be taken for building immunity?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have Potts spine which is similar to tuberculosis of the spine. see it takes almost six weeks for AKT (Ethambutol and Isoniazid) to work. It is a slow process. What you need to know is that with medicines your systemic symptoms should improve like weight loss, loss of appetite and any fever if you have. If these symptoms are improving, then your medications are working. Another thing is to get your ESR done. If it has a decreasing trend then that is fine. No need to get an MRI done. There is no role of food. Just have a balanced diet."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have disordered tooth alignment. What can be done to correct them?","Doctor":"Hi.

I do not sleep until I masturbate. How to avoid it?","Doctor":"Hello. Sexual desire is controlled by hormones. During puberty, early and late teens, an enormous amount of sex hormone start producing which causes these excessive desires. Masturbation is a healthy and normal practice. If you do it once a day then it is absolutely normal. But yes, indulging too much into it causes waste of time and create a hindrance to your academic life and career. Keep yourself busy in other productive things. Do not be alone. Try to be in the company of friends. Set a goal work towards it sincerely."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have red wounds growing on my thighs. I used a Candid B cream over it. It gets reduced, and it starts in another place. Please give me a solution.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have developed tinea cruris. It is a fungal infection of the groin area. Stop applying Candid B (Beclomethasone and Clotrimazole). Although it is an antifungal, it also contains a steroid, and this delays your healing. You can use topical Clotrimazole cream local application twice daily and take tablet Fluconazole 150 mg once a day for four weeks after consulting your GP or nearby dermatologist. Use Kz 2 % soap (Ketoconazole) for bathing."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 18 years old. I have jaw discomfort and a misaligned bite.

I have a gum tissue behind my molar, and I am unable to close my left side of my mouth completely. Please give me a solution.","Doctor":"Hi. Check your temporomandibular joint X-ray first. It sounds like a TMJ problem called a lockjaw. Depending upon the degree of damage, you require treatment. The most common solution is wearing a splint every day to prevent a rough sliding of joints. Since you are 18 years old, it is not mandatory to remove all the wisdom tooth. But if these cause the joint discomfort, then it is better to do an extraction of all the wisdom tooth. I advise you visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon and the doctor will give an accurate treatment plan."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 25 years old male.

You are right, most of the sebaceous nevus are hairless. But nevus which reaches the hair-bearing areas of the scalp also extends to involve follicles.

However, I used to do an excessive workout for one and a half hour and now, have stopped going to the gym. I feel I have knee pain and no health issues earlier.","Doctor":"Hello. No, it is not leukemia. Mild elevation of WBC is seen in infection, may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, or sometimes this is normal for some individuals. So, there is no indication of leukemia in this report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). In leukemia, the count is much higher say, 40 to 50 thousand.

Causes of vomiting are extensive. It can also happen due to gastritis. If you are having hyperacidity and indigestion, then you can have frequent vomiting. I suggest you take PPI (proton pump inhibitor) with Domperidone combination like Nexpro-RD capsule (Domperidone with Esomeprazole) in the morning in empty stomach. When your symptoms get reduced, you can do an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to know the cause for vomiting. Avoid having an empty stomach for a prolonged period and avoid taking water immediately after taking food during lunch and dinner."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 35 years old.

I have seen an endocrinologist and had an ultrasound. All was good with thyroid. I also was checked for Sjogren syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. I do not have them. I discovered a lumpish mass in my neck, under the right jaw. Endocrinologist touched the lump and commented it may be something wrong with the salivary gland. I noticed that the color inside of my cheeks and roof of my mouth changed to yellowish, and my palate was whitish. I do not have any soreness, just a bit of feeling that soft palate and tongue are a bit swollen. I have seen a few GPs about that, they all said I am fine. Only one GP said it can be laryngitis and the lump is swollen lymph node so they prescribed me antibiotics. I did not have any reaction. Then, they gave me Erythromycin 400 mg four times a day for two weeks. I noticed lump got a bit smaller but that was it, the color in my mouth did not get back to its pale pinkish normal color. I also had an ultrasound of soft tissue, they said I do not have lymphadenitis and did not say anything about salivary gland. Yesterday, I noticed at the end of the day blood vessels under my tongue got swollen and looked blackish. I thought maybe it is because of my blood thinner. In the morning it looked normal, but today the same happened. I am four months pregnant at the moment and doctors do not want to give me any referrals to specialists. I was asking about a referral to ENT, but they said all procedures are going to be invasive and you do not want to have any problems with your baby. I have a feeling that something is compressing my windpipe and at night, I wake up coughing as I am not able to breathe. I have also got some tickling in my throat so have to cough often and my voice is hoarse and gets tired quickly. My main concern is if it is something serious and will those problems harm the baby in any way?","Doctor":"Hello. We are happy to help you. I understand your situation and the worries the problem might be causing to you, that too when you are pregnant.  With the symptoms you have described, and with the doctor's repeated reassurances to you, I feel there may not be any super significant physical finding that they might have missed. That being said, there is nothing wrong in getting a proper specialist referral from the GP. I do not understand why the GP is reluctant to do that. If you were to come to me, I will do a nasal endoscopy in OPD (office) and do a flexible fiberoptics laryngoscopy also in the office. These two require no special medication except for decongestion of the nose and local spray into throat and passing of endoscopes. These will rule out sinusitis, DNS (deviated nasal septum), nasal disease and also laryngeal problems, say growth, vocal cord changes, movement of vocal cords, pyriform fossae, etc.  I do not anticipate anything in these areas, but these two tests will conclusively rule out any issue there. Maximum what I expect is some allergy and allergic post nasal drip. This will get alright with some nasal sprays which will not get absorbed into the bloodstream and will not cause any issue to the baby. Looking at the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), regarding the undersurface, it Is normal to have that color. The veins underneath look so. The color of the palate and posterior pharyngeal wall do appear mild pale and bluish. We need to rule out anemia in you and also allergy. Allergy and nasal discharge and post nasal drip can cause these discolorations. Reflux can also be spotted in laryngoscopy, however, the Ranitidine should solve the matter nevertheless.  What I want to know is the exact duration and chronology of all your problems. How many weeks pregnant are you? Has hemoglobin been checked? Are your scans normal? Why the Aspirin and blood thinner? Can you show me the relevant prescription? Any past history of sinus disease or nose block or post nasal drip or allergy? Sneezing, running nose, reduced sense of smell, itching, watering of eyes, etc.? Do revert back to me with relevant details. You should feel better soon. Do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

It is an intestinal infection marked by diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever. However, it is not necessary that all symptoms are there in a single patient. Depending on the cause, viral gastroenteritis symptoms may appear within one to three days after you are infected and can range from mild to severe. Symptoms usually last just a day or two, but occasionally they may persist as long as 10 days. Treatment includes drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhea. Water is best, but you could also try fruit juice and soup. Take Paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains. Get plenty of rest. If you feel like eating, try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta, and bread. Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets electrolyte solution to maintain depleted electrolyte levels in serum. Take anti-vomiting medication (such as Zofran 4 mg twice) and antidiarrhoeal medication (such as Loperamide up to 16 mg a day). It is better to take three days antibiotic and anti-protozoal course.

Can she postpone her period by eight days as we have some rituals to perform during our wedding? What will be the impact if she uses contraceptive pills in case of birth control? Will she face any problem during pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi. I read through your query and understood your concern. She can take Progesterone tablets (Medroxyprogesterone 10 mg twice daily) to postpone her period. These tablets may increase the requirement of antidiabetic medicines (tablets/insulin). So, she needs to monitor her blood sugar level (at least two to three times during the period she is taking tablets) to make sure that sugar control is fine. Contraceptive pills used nowadays are low dose pills and have little or no impact on diabetes. Even if sugar levels increase, it can be treated by increasing the dose of antidiabetic medicines. So, she can use low dose contraceptive pills. Just consult your physician before starting those pills to make sure that the medicines do not interact with each other. During pregnancy, if her sugar control is fine from three months before pregnancy, during pregnancy and till delivery of the baby, there will practically be no problem to the mother and baby. If sugar control is not good, there may be many problems about which there is no need to worry right now.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

How long will it take after quitting smoking, for the blood to be free from nicotine? Is blood viscosity reversible by simply cutting down nicotine?","Doctor":"Hi. Looking at the query, my opinion is as follows: The effect of nicotine is dependent upon the amount and years of cigarettes smoked and can vary from two days to two months. On an average, usually within a month of withdrawal of nicotine, the blood viscosity starts reducing. Yes, it is reversible as nicotine affects the platelets, red blood cells, the endothelium, and the clotting factors to increase blood viscosity. Once withdrawn, red blood cells will take a longer time, while the other usually recover as early as a month. During withdrawal, due to a reduction in blood viscosity, you might have dizziness periods as the blood pressure will also reduce. Give at leastthree more weeks to notice the improvement in blood viscosity. Nicotine patches havea low dosage of nicotine. You can use it to avoid cigarette in the initial periods, if necessary.

In your case, swelling is large and it was not initially at the time of the bite and increased thereafter. This indicates an infection.

It has caries, and there is an inflamed tissue present around it. In the case of partially erupting upper tooth, you can also feel pain in the ears. You have to visit a dentist without fear because dental procedures are never fatal. The doctor will use local anesthesia so you will not feel pain during treatment procedures. You can do either root canal treatment or extraction of the tooth. Both the procedure is always done under local anesthesia as it involves multiple appointments.

You can try local anesthetic cream when a needle is to be inserted so that pain associated with needle prick is not felt.

In this, a systematic desensitization is done and maladaptive emotion and thought are challenged and corrected."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 20 years old. I had a sudden onset of AIHA. At first, I had no response to steroid therapy, and after a week, I came back to normal. I want to know about the relapse with AIHA.","Doctor":"Hi. Approximately 80 % of patients respond to corticosteroids at a dose equivalent to Prednisolone 60 to 100 mg per day and nearly two-thirds achieve complete remission (CR). The initial response takes several weeks. But an absence of a response for 21 days is considered as a steroid failure. In responding patients, an incremental taper can begin, for example, when the Hb (hemoglobin) is more than 100 g/dL or after a maximum of three weeks, we can reduce the dose to 20 to 30 mg over four to six weeks, and then by 5 mg every month. In a series of 33 primary AIHA (autoimmune hemolytic anemia) cases, relapse was more common if the steroids were tapered to 10 mg in less than two months and when stopped in less than six months. Approximately 20 % of patients remain in remission after steroids are discontinued. Although a further 40 % can maintain an acceptable Hb by keeping Prednisolone at 15 to 20 mg, due to the long-term side effects of steroids, and a second-line therapy is considered."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Is a CMIA Abbott fourth generation negative test 100 % reliable at 13 weeks?

HIV infection has a window period of 1 to 3 months during which the test results can be a false negative. According to WHO, all results are considered conclusive at 12 weeks after the last exposure. Hence, your test is definitive if done at 13th week. As per the protocol, if infected, either the antigen or antibody would reach detectable levels by 12 weeks.

I still have symptoms of fatigue, increased saliva highly, throat pain. I am very worried. Please tell if my tests are conclusive. I read about people seroconverting late and I am worried. Also, one another person whose status I do not know also had daily dizziness, diarrhea, mouth ulcers and leg pain like me. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. First, HIV symptoms are non-specific and are common to most infection and are referred to as flu-like symptoms. HIV infection symptoms in the acute phase often go undetected and are self-healed without any active intervention due to an intact immune system. These symptoms are only effective if they occur 2 to 5 years after exposure due to a crippled immune system. So far, in your condition, these occurring infections are stress related due to over activity of hormones (vagal stimulation) causing diarrhoea, running nose, sore throat. Mouth ulcers are moreover due to vit B complex deficiencies, dizziness can be due to a simple ear problem. So, do not worry about being infected, once the fourth generation is negetive after 28 days, then nothing to worry.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father had ureteric stent removal before one month. He had fever 101 F, pus cell 100 or more than that since month fever comes every week. Urine culture and sensitivity done. All antibiotics resistant except Nitrofurantoin. Fever episode is not subsiding in spite of taking antipyretics. What to do?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen all reports sent by you (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As per reports, he is still having a urine infection. What is his present creatinine? Since how long is he taking Nitrofurantoin? His DTPA shows only left kidney is functioning. The plan would be to finish this course of antibiotics properly for 14 days. If fever is not under control, then we need to give him injection according to urine sensitivity report. Do repeat urine culture and sensitivity after three days of finishing antibiotics course to check infection is gone or not. In some reports, it is given that his right kidney is small and stone in right kidney. This may be the source of persistent infection in spite of antibiotics. If fever is not under control at all after taking all antibiotics, then it is better to remove the right kidney as there is no function. Anyhow and it is likely source of persistent infection."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have severe redness in my face. I also have a burning sensation in my face. What is it? Is it curable?","Doctor":"Hi. You are suffering from rosacea. It occurs due to solar damage, and it leads to vasomotor instability causing erythema on the face, and a tendency to flush easily. Identify the triggering factors and avoid it. The common triggering factors are hot or cold temperatures, wind, hot drinks, caffeine, exercise, spicy food, alcohol, emotions, and topical products. For red areas, you can apply Brimonidine gel twice daily after consulting your GP (general practitioner) or dermatologist. Use broad-spectrum physical sunscreen like Sun cross soft gel (Zinc oxide with Alkyl benzoate) with SPF (sun protection factor) 50 daily. Use it all over the face in the morning. You have to repeat it once in four hours."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 19 years old, and I am not sexually active. I have pain in the breast on both sides. It got started before few days, and my left breast has got changed in texture close to my nipple. It is too sore. The breast pain is not constant. It happens when I wake up, when I run or when I press them. I have not got my periods this month. It is not abnormal. I got a heavy period last month, and I have pain in my lower abdomen for a few months. It is always sudden and sharp. It is not constant. I do not know the reason for having this problem. I had vitamin D deficiency before few years. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. There are many possible causes for having breast pain. Hormonal fluctuations related to menstruation or pregnancy are often responsible for breast tenderness. Having some degree of swelling and tenderness just before a period is reasonable. The common causes of breast pain are menstruation and pregnancy. Breast pain is common during the first trimester. Breast pain also occurs when having a pregnancy at a young age, and when having puberty in both girls and boys. The other reasons can be breastfeeding, fibrocystic breast changes, and mastitis in which a blocked and infected milk duct have some redness. It is usually associated with breastfeeding and during premenstrual syndrome. Please say whether you had any discharge from your nipples, like blood or pus. Please tell if you had any breast infection with localized redness, pus or fever. Please say whether you had any new lump associated with pain. You have to wear a well-fitting brassiere for support, especially if your breasts are large. You can have lower abdominal pain due to some reasons ranging from caliculi to appendicitis. Vitamin D deficiency does not cause these symptoms. You can apply ointment over the breast if you have any superficial infection."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, What are the physical findings seen in breast cancer? Please explain about the pathophysiology observed in breast cancer.","Doctor":"Hi. These are the physical findings found in breast cancer. There can be a painless lump or a change in breast size, skin changes, nipple inversion, nipple abnormalities or discharge, and axillary lump. The pathophysiology shows damage to DNA, and genetic changes lead to breast cancer. It is also linked to other factors such as estrogen exposure, smoking, age and family history. Some individuals inherit defects in BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and P53 (tumor protein). People having a family history of ovarian or breast cancer can have an increased risk of getting breast cancer."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have nausea every time and every day after eating. I cannot eat my food. I drink only water. I am feeling tired always. My stomach hurts me so much. Why do I have a feeling of nausea after eating? Why do I throw up after eating?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your BMI (body mass index) is in borderline. It is normal. I can understand your concern regarding vomiting. It can occur due to various reasons. Gastritis can also be a reason for having nausea and vomiting. Take food at regular intervals and avoid skipping breakfast, lunch or dinner. Follow a diet schedule. Avoid eating oily, fried and spicy foods. Take plenty of oral fluids. You may also need to take antacid and antiemetic if it is required."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, What are the natural ways followed to remove tan from forehead and neck?","Doctor":"Hi. Use aloe vera gel two times a day.

Try all these things regularly, and you will have good results soon."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I do not know how to explain my state. Since many years, I feel like vomiting when I see or smell dirty things. I cannot just sit with a drunken person. I cannot even resist when someone is vomiting or coughing or just clearing their throat. To get rid of this vomiting feeling, I started eating too much of mint flavored chewing gum. By too much, I mean nearly one every day or three in a week or so. Also, these days due to the unpleasant weather, I feel very uneasy all the time. I cannot eat properly because I am afraid that I might vomit. I am actually a very reserved person. Earlier, I used to live with my parents and so the three of us were living in one house. But, just 15 days back, my aunt passed away and so their family also joined us in the same house. I do not know why, but I am feeling very uneasy to adjust to this environment. One of my aunt's children is having the habit of spitting every time and that is the reason I am running away from him every time and if I am sitting with them, I always carry a mint. Can you please tell me the reason for this state of mine? Earlier this week, I had to go out of station for some office work but I stopped by with the fear of vomiting. I think I am oversensitive to things. Otherwise, I am a very friendly, happy person. I want to be happy always and want to see things in my own way. After a year or two, I will be getting married. So, I do not want to ruin any of my relationships with these habits. Please advise what I need to do to get rid of this problem.","Doctor":"Hi. Your statement of 'I feel like vomiting when I see or smell dirty things and I cannot just sit with a drunk person' are commonly found in normal individuals and does not signify any mental or psychological disorder. But, your statement that you canceled your official trip because of this issue signifies that you have attached too much significance to a trivial problem. At this moment, it seems that your thought process is dominated by ideas of vomiting and you are not able to get rid of this. It is also possible that you are aware that these are not rational ideas, but whenever you try to resist, you get rebound anxiety or increased anxiety or more vomiting feeling. If you are wasting more than one hour a day on these ideas and that is impairing you in your occupational, academic or social life, this can be due to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In this disorder, people are very particular in regard to cleanliness and not able to stand slight dirt and have a tendency to wash their hands multiple times. I assure you that this is quite treatable and a lot can be done to improve your thought process. This disorder can be treated with medication or behavior therapy or a combination of both depending on the severity and response to a particular kind of therapy. At this moment, I suggest you consult a psychologist counsellor online. --->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 27 years old. I have a problem in clearing my tummy for two days.

Avoid intake of turnip, onion, cabbage, and cauliflower. These are gas-forming foods. Drink more water. Avoid having a sedentary lifestyle. You should stop the habit of smoking and try to avoid having stress. Take more green leafy vegetables and fruits. Avoid taking excess fatty foods. If there is no improvement, then a fiber supplement like Aristozyme (Pepsin and Diastase) can be taken.

She is currently on Letrozole and Ibrance for the last five months. Initially there was bone pain near pelvic, and so did the ultrasound, in that it came minimal ascites, following that we did CA 125 @ 104 and CEA @ 47 five months back, followed by CT and PET CT scan and biopsy (the biopsy was done from bone and not from omental which came positive for breast cancer origin and negative for colon and intestine CA. In both, there were two observations. Non-FDG avid bone and generalized haziness. What is non-FDG avid that is described in PET scan? What is a generalized haziness, omental metastasis from breast cancer? What can be the cause? Before two months, we repeated CA 125 which came 33 from 104 at initial diagnosis 2 CEA @ 29, 47 at the initial diagnoses.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern regarding the new findings on CT PET Scan of your mother. She is having multiple bony metastases proven radiologically and pathologically. The generalized mesenteric and omental haziness with raised tumor markers Ca 125 / CEA, these findings raises suspicion of peritoneal involvement. But, there is no clear nodule or mass found in the abdominal cavity. So she needs a close follow-up and further investigations.  She has proven bone metastasis as confirmed pathologically and radiologically (CT scan) with out uptake of FDG. Non FDG avid means her some bone metastasis have not taken up FDG. Usually, tumor and the metastatic site takes up FDG But here bone metastasis has been confirmed already by CT scan and biopsy. At this stage, I would suggest you discuss with your oncologist for a possible laparoscopic evaluation of the abdomen (peritonuem, omentum, and mesentery). It will show any visible suspected lesion in the abdomen and biopsies can be taken from any suspicious lesions or she can be put on close follow up and a PET CT and tumor markers can be repeated after two months. They should also drain the abdominal fluid and send it for analysis (cytology for malignant cells). Also, she may need transvaginal ultrasound that is very sensitive to detect any ovarian tumor. Because ovary is one of the common causes of peritoneal and omental involvement. She may also need to do an MRI whole spine as there are multiple vertebrae (spine) metastasis. There is a risk of spinal cord compression and MRI can detect it early. Did she have a previous surgery of the uterus or ovaries or any abdominal surgery?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, In my endoscopy, I have antral gastritis for four months (severe indigestion, constipation, loss of appetite). I take 20 mg Rabeprazole daily but symptoms do not go away. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Now, let us move to your treatment.  See as the name suggests, acid reflux should be treated in two phases. Control production of acid for which you are on Delixant and Ranitidine. To prevent the acid formed inside the stomach to reflux back into the esophagus. This part of treatment is not covered by your doctor. I would suggest you add Levosulpiride. It is a prokinetic drug and is very effective in controlling reflux of acid back into the esophagus. A better way is to take it with Rabeprazole. Trials have shown that it is very effective when combined with Rabeprazole. So, you can switch over to Rabeprazole from Delixant.  Sucralfate is used to treat and prevent ulcers. Sucralfate works by forming a coating over the ulcer. This protects the ulcer from the acid of the stomach, allowing it to heal. Sucralfate is best taken with water on an empty stomach one hour before meals and at bedtime. It should be taken daily by you and would help in healing ulcers. General precautions are to follow a bland diet (low acid levels, low in fat, not spicy). Eat frequent, small meals, lose weight. Avoid the use of alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. Do not eat food less than two hours before bedtime. Raise the head of the bed before sleeping. Avoid clearing of the throat."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

She started taking it 13 days later and finished after three days. The day before yesterday, she got her periods. But she did not have blood clots and flow is very slow. Is there any chance of pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? As she has PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), her ovulation date cannot be predicted. So there is always a chance of pregnancy. But as she had bleeding after having tablet Regestrone, pregnancy is not possible. Bleeding after having hormones will be thicker and lesser than normal, that is expected. Once the bleeding occurs, the inner lining of the uterus has fully been shed, so there is no chance of a possible pregnancy to get implanted on the post bleeding, thinned out uterine inner lining. So I do not see any chance of her being pregnant. But if you are still not satisfied or want a further confirmation, have her blood serum beta hCG tested.

If these requirements are fulfilled, then there is no need to worry, and you can wait for bleeding. If you do not observe bleeding even after three weeks, then it is better to have hormonal induction after doing a pregnancy test (beta hCG).

You are right in saying that you are suffering fromparanoia but to me, it seems it is secondary to this fearfulness.

Most of the individuals respond slowly to the prescribed treatment. At the same time, I would like to inform you that you are not responsible for these symptoms. They just can happen to anybody.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

It is normal to have these findings now because a few kids have it. Normal growth cycle follows these ways. The first one is thelarche. In this, there is a development of the breast. The second one is pubarche. In this, there is a development of pubic hair. Then the next one is menarche. In this one, there is an onset of menses. In between thelarche and pubarche, there is a growth spurt. So all these occur gradually. It is normal for your child to have this development.

But the rise in PSA is bothersome if it rises more than 0.75 ng/mL per year. For a young patient like you, even this rise in rate needs to be assessed.

I have been to the dentist and he told me that my teeth were fine. Brought tongue scrapers to no avail. Switched off the alcohol mouth wash. At a time in my life, I was brushing my teeth 6 or more times a day. To this day, I still brush my teeth four times a day spending at least 15 minutes in cleaning my mouth.

I am all out of options.Â I need some advice on what to do and some sort of diagnosis or at least a point in the right direction.","Doctor":"Hi. Foul smell is formed by bacteria. So, it is seen in conditions where they are residing for a long time. Normally our nose and throat have commensals and they get washed away by our normal secretions of the nose and throat. Bad smell in nose is seen in conditions like, atrophic rhinitis and pharyngeal web or diverticulum. Atrophic rhinitis, in which it smells bad. After some time, the patient does not get bad smell and only the people around get it. It is a nasal disease and can be diagnosed by examining nose. Pharyngeal web or diverticulum is a condition in which a small pouch is formed from pharynx, away from normal tract. So, whatever you eat, a part of it does not go to the stomach below and escapes into the pouch. It stays there for some time and automatically comes back in pharynx and goes stomach. In this condition, due to retention of food bad smell is produced.

However, it reduced to a large extent now. We had our room painted a day before yesterday. Could it be due to paint allergy? Will the allergy symptoms show up immediately or will take a day's time? My 2-year-old has never had a cold till now. I am just worried if she has ingested any foreign body as she has the habit of mouthing whatever she picks up. Would foreign body stuck in throat cause sneezing and runny nose? I am a paranoid mother and have subjected her to two unwanted X-rays to rule out battery ingestion so I do not want to go through another X-ray. I want to know what would be the symptoms of any foreign body like metal or plastic when stuck in the throat. She was having corn yesterday. If she had inhaled a corn granule through her nose would it pass beyond and would she be acting normally? Since today morning, she sneezed only thrice. If at all it was common cold can it get better in a day? How would I know if it was a foreign body ingestion or allergy or a viral? What would be the symptoms for each one?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the query you posted. According to the history you have given, it is an allergy because of the paint smell. That is the reason he is getting sneezing and running nose. As you think, it is not because of some foreign body in the nose or in the throat. If the foreign body is in the throat, symptoms will be like a continuous cough, breathlessness. If the foreign body is in the nose, they will have a bad smell from nose and bleeding can happen with mucus secretions. So no need of any X-ray or investigations for the child. Differentiating between allergy and viral infection, you have to do some blood test and always viral infection will be associated with fever. So nothing major to worry.

As your partner has used a condom for sex, then there is less chance to get pregnant. As you are taking Krimson 35 (Cyproterone with Ethinylestradiol) regularly, so there is no chance to get pregnant. Take tablets regularly. Some tests can diagnose pregnancy early such as radioimmunoassay. The best and better way is to wait for periods. If you miss your periods, you can do a urine pregnancy test. If the result is positive, then you can be pregnant. If there is a negative result, then there can be a delay in periods.

These things do not prevent me from seeing. I see even from afar but I see well when there is no much light because I cannot stand light well when I am watching something. I have read somewhere that they are called floaters and can cause blindness. I have started to see just one dot and now I see some more not too many but irritating. It has been years.

You have correctly described your floaters. Only thing is that it is perfectly normal as they are part of aging and will only increase with time. They develop as the vitreous jelly inside our eyes liquifies with time. So they move when your eye moves. They do not cause blindness on their own. They are a matter of concern only when there is a sudden shower of floaters associated with flashes. In that case, you will need an examination of your retina after full dilation of your pupil to rule out any break in your retina which if not lasered on time may proceed to retinal detachment.

Excessive use of different kinds of shampoos, conditioners and washing hairs using hard water result in hair fall. Reduced blood supply to the hair roots makes the hair weak, and it leads to hair fall. You should follow some precautions to prevent hair fall. Apply Bhringaraja oil to the hair at night. Massage the hair for five to ten minutes and wash them with water the next morning. Shampoo your hair weekly twice or thrice using protein shampoo. Do these things and provide your valuable feedback."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For the past three weeks, I have been feeling a strange sensation which seems to be a form of vertigo. When walking, it feels as if the ground is bouncing or rocking (as if on a boat). I seem to not have this sensation right away after waking. However, after an hour or so, it comes back. I have also experienced what may be migraine aura symptoms (seeing black spots occasionally) which is sometimes also accompanied by a headache or head pressure or fullness. This bouncing or rocking sensation is really starting to worry me. I am not sure if it is due to an inner ear issue or neurological. I have started taking Meclizine and Ibuprofen which do not seem to help entirely. If possible, please advise on some potential causes, I would greatly appreciate it.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to an inner ear disorder. Anyway as your symptoms are not improved by Meclizine, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist and performing a brain MRI study. It is also important checking thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a question regarding Cocaine use. I have never used it before and did a few lines on a bachelor party. I clearly was not thinking and impregnated my wife within 24 to 48 hours of use. How concerning is this? I also had multiple drinks of alcohol.","Doctor":"Hi. The sperms ejaculated are formed 3 to 5 days before the actual sex process. If you have never used them before and used it only a few hours before sex then there should be no problem of malformations in the baby. Neither is alcohol. I must emphasize though that as you might already know, cocaine use is significantly detrimental for your own health and must be avoided."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from an awkward spot on my lower lip. It is like a basic symptom of lip cancer. Please give your valuable suggestion.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case. There are many causes and clinical presentation of lip cancer. You should provide a complete history of the lesion for how long it has been there and also send picture as well. Or please see dermatologist personally."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have irregular periods and continuous bleeding in the genital area. So I am using sanitary pad always. And also have some kind of pain in the stomach.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. Please tell me, when did you attain menarche? Have your periods been irregular always? If yes, tell me your cycle length. Are you married? Any children? Are you taking any other medications? When were your last periods? When was this ultrasound done? According to scan reports your endometrium is thick (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You need to understand diagnostic as well as therapeutic curratage. Until then take tablet Pause MF (Tranexamic acid) three times daily for five days, and tablet Meprate 10 mg (Medroxyprogesterone) thrice daily for seven days followed by twice daily for the next week and followed by once daily for the next one week and stop. If your cycles are always irregular following the above treatment start Diane 35 for three months. Also, take Iron, Folic acid supplements to prevent anemia due to excessive blood loss. Please answer the above mentioned questions to suggest if anything extra is needed other than the mentioned treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best. For further queries consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My friend aged 30 had two drops of phenol mistaking for milk. He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD. For more information consult an ayurveda specialist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had sex for the first time.Â After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am experiencing the above every day. Do I have pink eye?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It appears as conjunctivitis, and it is of two types. They are bacterial and viral. A slit lamp examination is required to differentiate them. As these symptoms are present for a few hours, then it can be bacterial conjunctivitis. I advise you take eye drops such as Gatflox (Gatifloxacin) one drop four times a day and eye drops HPMC (Hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose) one drop four times a day."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I know my partner for ten years. I am living with my partner for a year. We have not done sex. But now, we may have sex once a month. He does not have a feel like me. It makes me feel depressed. I tried to talk to him about this, and I wanted to make him understand. But it feels like he is not ready to get fixed. I do not know what to do at this point. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Planning to have sex on a regular basis with your partner is perfectly a regular thing, and there is nothing to feel ashamed. But sexual appetite between two peoples may vary. You may feel which is less can be a sufficient one for your partner. So the key is communication. Hammering him about sex every day will not help you. Make an effort to spend time with him by doing activities, and gradually you can approach about this. You can take a short trip and explore. Be sensitive if he is facing issues at work or with his family and if he is preoccupied with it. If nothing works, please see a counselor."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mouth is always filled with saliva within two minutes. I have this problem for three years. What can I do now? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Excessive saliva production or hypersalivation can occur due to two reasons. It occurs due to an increased saliva production and due to reduced swallowing of saliva. Saliva overproduction can occur due to many causes like oral and throat infections, oral ulcers, acid reflux, excess starch consumption, due to a side effect of medication like Clonazepam, Pilocarpine, Ketamine, a toxin exposure, and serotonin syndrome. Decreased swallowing can occur due to throat pain caused by the infection, tonsillitis, and nerve damage. You should consult an oral physician and get evaluated. A thorough checkup will help in confirming the cause and treatment of the cause will solve the problem. As of now, you can use mouthwash frequently and brushing the teeth has a drying effect in the mouth."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My NT scan showed me a range of 1.4 mm and my double marker showed me a risk of 1:20300. But my age risk showed a result of 1:176. Which one has to be considered and what it signifies regarding the risk for trisomy 21?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the query (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Many factors count for calculating risk. They are age, serum markers, family history, and nuchal translucency. An age-related risk is more after 35 years of age. As you are 38 years old, so the risk is calculated as 1:176. But, individually it cannot define the whole risk as it involves other factors also. Nuchal translucency less than 2.9 mm is considered normal, and you have a range of 1.4 mm, so the factor does not show a risk for an anomaly. Serum markers show a least negligible risk like 1 in 20300. So this factor is also not under threat. You have not mentioned about your family history as it will also play a role in calculating the all over risk. So the combined risk is decidedly less. Have a usual anomaly scan at 20 weeks to check for any anomaly. Around 22 weeks, try to have a cardiac outflow tract."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother has a swelling inside her lips. It is not painful, and it is not getting healed. She consulted a doctor. The doctor told that the swelling had occurred due to an allergic reaction. Is it cancer? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Every swelling is not cancer. It can be a fibroma. It occurs due to trauma or biting lips. The second one is a mucocele. It is a swelling of sebaceous glands. It also occurs due to injury or biting. Both are non-cancerous. Please send a picture of it. So that, I can guide you further. Please say whether your mother has a habit of nail-biting. The management depends on the size and nature of the swelling. It may need some drugs or excision. You can consult a dentist and an oral medicine specialist soon for treating it. Please mention about her habits, drug history, and the presence of any sharp tooth in her mouth."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been hearing a wind like rhythmic noise in my right ear. It also makes my ears feel full. When breathing forcefully it might go away for some time but it comes back again.","Doctor":"Hello. A ringing sound or wind-like sound in the ear lasting for more than five minutes is called tinnitus. If less than five minutes, it is not significant. This particular sound you are describing can be caused due to dysfunctional eustachian tube, i.e. the tube connecting the ear and the nose. Usually, it is more in quiet environments and more noticeable when you are attempting to fall asleep. Crowded and noisy places serve as a distraction and do not let you notice the sound. Medicines do work, but it takes at least a month for them to act, that too the sound does not vanish until two to three months have gone by. I understand the trouble it is causing you. So what is to be done? 1. Keep a table fan for white noise when you are trying to fall asleep. 2. Try and distract yourself when you hear the sound. 3. Get a hearing test done. You can use an audiometry app and send me the result. 4. Follow the prescription. Saline nasal drops and steam inhalation three times a day for seven days. Fluticasone nasal spray two times a day for seven days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My lower back pains extremely bad when I stretch backward or forward.

I was recommended TFN-34 but last two months they have not helped. Any alternative to TFN-34 and how to increase energy levels? Also, my prakruti is Kapha-Pitta and in the afternoon I get a severe headache but to increase in pitta dosha, my lunch is generally veggies, pulses with minimal raw salad. I do not consume ghee. So, please help me with diet part to reduce pitta dosha. I have no acidity symptoms.","Doctor":"Hi. You continue both these drugs. I think the Thyronorm dose could be increased slightly after discussing with your clinician, which will reduce your lethargy. You also consume more cumin, turmeric, coriander, small onion, cardamom, in food. They can balance pitha. You buy Eclipta alba, dry it and store it. Daily you should add bringaraj 5 gm, jeera 5 gm in 150 ml of milk or water, boil for 20 minutes, then filter and drink. This needs to be done morning and night regularly. Prepare freshly every time. This will help in regulating the thyroid hormonal feedback system, give adequate energy and also balances three doshas (vaatha, pitha and kabha). Also apply bringaraj hair oil daily on hair, half an hour before bath. This also helps in balancing piththam and kapha."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother was admitted to hospital nine months back with a catheter-related UTI. She was also hypothermic. Tests revealed that the UTI had become urinary sepsis. She was given IV antibiotics for this. Her legs were swollen with edema, as was her lower abdomen, but her chest was clear. She had three chest X-rays taken while she was in the hospital. I have attached these radiographs for your analysis. She developed sudden hypoxemia (SpO2 dropped to 70) and was given supplemental oxygen to saturate her blood. A stethoscope detected bilateral crepitations in her lungs. She had no cough, no tachycardia and no fever (she remained hypothermic throughout her stay in the hospital). Her leg edema remained during her time in hospital. The comments that accompanied her radiographs consisted of just a few ambiguous words. They included question marks and failed to make definitive diagnoses. This is why I am sending the radiographs to you. I need to know specifically what was happening in her lungs.","Doctor":"Hi. The chest X-ray done shows mildly increased bilateral lung markings and a mildly enlarged cardiac shadow (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There are no serious concerns about this X-ray. In the chest X-ray done a few days later, there is a generalised haziness in the left lung in addition to the prominent lung markings and the mildly enlarged cardiac shadow. Depending on the clinical signs, the possibilities can be a unilateral pneumonia or pulmonary edema. However, in literature, pulmonary edema is usually unilateral on the right side and without cardiac enlargement. In the chest X-ray done four days later, there are randomly distributed peri hilar opacities in the bilateral lungs and on seeing carefully there are air bronchograms and this is likely a picture of disseminated pneumonia. The other possibility being a diffuse pulmonary edema."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is 68 years old and has undergone ileal conduit surgery ten years back.

Due to elderly age and recurrent problem and anesthesia risk, we can manage it conservatively trying to avoid complications. It will be a safe position.

What are the risks of pregnancy in women over 40?","Doctor":"Hello. Pregnancy at the age of 48 years definitely come with certain risks like an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities due to the defective ovum being released. Also there may be a difficulty in the conception itself. VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) delivery has to take into a lot of factors into consideration like the cause for previous LSCS (lower segment cesarean section), the gestational age at which you had cesarean, the present baby weight, and if there is a spontaneous onset of labor or not and many other factors.

Your treating urologist will determine it after a thorough clinical examination. It should not be tried by yourself, as the foreskin can become stuck behind the head of the penis. It is a hazardous situation. The safest and the most straightforward approach is to get a circumcision done, which is only minor surgery, and it will solve your problem permanently."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 27 years old. I have got allergies on my inner thighs. I used all the medicines. But there is no relief. Recently, I went for sonography and found with multiple cysts in the ovary. Due to allergy, the skin of inner thighs got darker, and I have reddish marks with itching on my face. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. With your descriptions, it seems that you have developed tinea cruris. It requires a minimum of two to three months to have a complete cure. I would suggest you take tablet Itraconazole 100 mg once daily and use 2 % Miconazole gel local application twice daily for one month and use Kz 2 % soap (Ketoconazole) for bathing after consulting your GP or nearby dermatologist. Revert me after a month."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have severe pain in the lower back region. I have this problem for a few days. The pain is present only on the lower back just above the hips. I feel stiffness and pain in the lower back in the mornings. I have the pain radiating towards my upper spine when I squeeze the upper back muscles. After a few hours, my pain goes away and comes back again after a night sleep. I always do weightlifting at home. Please suggest a remedy.","Doctor":"Hi. You have a muscle spasm. Evaluate your sleeping conditions and ensure that you are sleeping on a supportive mattress that is not over seven years old. When sleeping on your back, place small support under the lower back and knees. You can use a small pillow or rolled towel. When resting on the side, keep a medium size pillow between your knees to keep your pelvis straight. Try sleeping on a heating pad. Do light lower back stretches every morning and every night in every direction."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 46 years old. I am diabetic, and I have a high blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL. I also have a hernia problem. Currently, I am taking allopathic medicines, Glimepiride and Metformin. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. If your blood sugar level is above 200 mg/dL, you may need a change in the dosage of your medication. You might need to increase the dosage of the existing medication, or you may require a new medication. You have not mentioned the exact dosage of Metformin and Glimepiride that you are currently taking. The medication and the dosage are decided by the doctor based on various factors like age, weight, previous medical history, duration of diabetes, other medical conditions, other medications and the condition of your vital organs. It may not be ideal to give you a prescription without doing a clinical examination and evaluation of laboratory parameters. Hence I suggest you meet your diabetologist for proper clinical assessment. For the hernia issue, it is essential to understand the stage of the disease. It helps to determine whether it needs conservative treatment or whether there is a need for surgery. It can be decided only by a qualified surgeon after a detailed clinical examination, and it involves various steps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 24-year-old woman suffering from hemorrhoids. I have a feeling that my anus is reducing in size. My doctor has advised me to do a surgery for removing it. But my hemoglobin levels are low. So my doctor recommended me to increase the hemoglobin levels. I am taking iron supplements to improve my hemoglobin levels. I am very depressed. I have a fear that a delay in surgery can worsen my condition. Please suggest some remedies to prevent the shrinkage of the anus.","Doctor":"Hi. You have to remove piles through surgery as it is increasing in size. Anal shrinkage is not a complication of piles. Because of the enlargement seen in piles, the anal area looks shrank. You can take a stool softener for piles like Cremaffin syrup (Liquid paraffin with Magnesium hydroxide). Avoid taking excess spicy foods. Drink more water. If the pain is severe, then an oral anti-inflammatory drug can be taken. Topical Lignocaine jelly can be applied if there is severe pain. You can use anal water sitz bath in lukewarm water for piles."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from sinus problem since birth.

She visited an obstetrician and gynecologist last month. She is celibate for about six years. But now, we are living together for seven months, and we are trying to have a more physical relationship. On my first attempt, she had pain during initial penetration. During my second attempt, she allowed for penetration up to four inches, and she was very comfortable to have further penetration. During the next attempt, she started to have pain even beyond one inch of penetration. Can I know whether inserting finger during lubrication make intercourse uncomfortable during initial penetration?","Doctor":"Hi. At 55 years of age, it is vital to know whether she has reached menopause or still she gets her menses. Even perimenopausal status itself can cause atrophic vaginitis. It results in vaginal dryness and mucous atrophy. The second reason can be PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). It can also initiate a deep pain during penetration. Due to prolonged abstinence, the vagina muscles can be tight, and it can also cause vaginismus. All these features are needed to be evaluated and ruled out before proceeding further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My stomach gets upset when I drink milk, orange juice, or even yogurt which is normally good for an upset stomach.

Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand you must be very upset about your condition. So you see the diets you are kind of allergic to are containing milk protein. Yes, there are some diets that contain no milk, but the diet that predispose you to have stomch upset will disturb your stomach as often as one has allergies to almost every diets the person takes. So, I suggest you to cut down your dairy intake. It occurs due to the deficiency of an enzyme called lactase which usually digests the milk. Or you can purchase a commercially available drug containing lactase enzyme. Tablet Lactaid 9000 FU just every time before having a milk-based diet. If you want to discuss more I am here to help. Follow up in one week."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Usually, 95 % of respiratory infections are viral. At this point, you can take medicines for cold for five to seven days. They should include an anti-inflammatory drug (such as Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen), an antihistamine (such as Diphenhydramine) and decongestant (such as Pseudoephedrine). If you have a fever for more than five days, then you should do a checkup. Take a good rest and eat well.

In my first pregnancy, I did not have any complications until my delivery date. Regarding my cervical length or cervix softness, no other issues. My delivery type was C-section first time. Now I am five months pregnant and my doctor did PV and told that I m having a soft cervix and advised me to take bed rest till the eighth month and suggested me to take Hydroxyprogesterone (maintenance 500 mg) for every 15 days till the eighth month and told to take tablet Optogest 200 mg daily twice. I climb about 30 steps in the morning and evening. So is it advisable to work for at least six hours for one more month and then take rest for remaining three months (that is for seventh, eighth and ninth months)?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? I do not see any reason for rest. What your doctor is worried is about cervical insufficiency or incompetence. This condition can be diagnosed only by seeing a cervical length of less than 2.5 cm with funneling of the internal OS (internal orifice) or by a history of previous painless delivery. I do not see any of these in your history. In present pregnancy too, I do not see any risk factors. Every pregnant uterus will have a soft cervix. This does not mean that it has incompetence. Your cervical length has always been more than 3 cm. You can follow the advice of having those medications. They keep the uterus silent and will prevent any sudden progress of pain. You can definitely work, avoid too much physical stress and avoid any infections like urinary infection (avoid filthy public toilets, have a lot of water and do not hold back urine for long), respiratory infection (keep away from people with fever, cold), gastrointestinal infections (avoid unhygienic food) at 28 weeks. Have a glucose challenge test to rule out pregnancy induced diabetes. Better not to use Progestins for too long. They can cause mild growth restrictions. You can definitely have a routine regular life. After all, pregnancy is not a disease. All the best."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My age is 26 and I had unprotected oral sex.

CMIA antibodies on 70th day. Now, we will get the result of p24 on 86th day. All my reports are negative. But, I have rashes and recently got a cold. Are my tests results conclusive? I feel each and every symptom to be related to HIV.","Doctor":"Hi. HIV can never be diagnosed based on clinical symptoms. Moreover, symptoms of HIV include a generalized lymphadenopathy, weight loss of more than 10 % in short duration, long term diarrhea more than one month, etc. You have done CMIA test after 70 days that detect both antigen and antibody. It gives conclusive result after six weeks. So you may need not worry.

Rabies transferred from ingested infected saliva is not seen. The disease which you can get by contaminated rat urine is leptospirosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My main problem is alopecia. I had it from 2015 with several patches on the head and now they are gone, but the problem is my eyelashes are gone and never grew back. I used castor oil, garlic, and now Revitalash and other things. Two years ago a rheumatologist prescribed me Dolquine and I did not have patches but my eyelashes still fell. I have lots of problems like hypothyroidism and Hashimoto and currently on Euthyrox 100. My doctor told me it has nothing to do with alopecia because it is normal now (good T3, T4, and TSH, etc.). I newley knew that I have PCO (normal result in echo but my glucose is lowered after 1 hour of glucose 75 mg intake and my insulin was 60, plus androstenedione 3.5). And I have hyper prolactinemia for six years on its own did an IRM and no tumor and currently taking Dostinex. With all these problems I smoke water pipe (shisha, nargile) three times a day.","Doctor":"Hi. Your concern is genuine and you are so brave and facing all challenges very bravely. You did not mention your prolactin and thyroid hormone levels. Loss of hair can be autoimmune as you were treated for it as well and due to Hashimoto as well. If there is no skin issue involved in the loss of hair (you should consult a dermatologist for it) it may be due to your autoimmune disease. Hashimoto is autoimmune as well. What you can do is that you decrease the TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) target to a lower level with increasing Levothyroxine and then see if it has a better effect. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a female and I have pelvic inflammation and I went to see a doctor. I was given Tramacet, Azithromycin, and Ciprobay for treatment. It has been four weeks after the treatment and I do not have any abdominal pain. I had been seeing the doctor before. Can the absence of the abdominal pain mean that I have healed? And can my fiance get sick from the inflammation if we have sex without a condom?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? No pain or discharge or itching means the infection has subsided, but a point you have to understand is that you got this infection only after you had sex. So your fiance is the source of the infection. So he too should have the same course of antibiotics. Treatment is never complete without both partners being treated. So he will not get inflammation, he will infect you again and your old symptoms will reappear. So I would advise you to give him same medications and avoid sex till he finishes the medicines and two weeks further so that the infection heals. Let him masturbate 1 to 2 times before you have sex, so all the dead infections too will be thrown out."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I think I suffer from liver and a gastric problem for the past two years. Food is not digested properly. Lower abdomen left side some burning sensation, swelling, and pain were there. Sometimes, I feel the hardness in the lower left abdomen. Bilirubin total is high and bilirubin direct and indirect are also high.","Doctor":"Hello. Your liver tests are normal. The small increase in indirect billirubin alone (as the one you have) most commonly corresponds to Gilbert syndrome, which is totally harmless. This syndrome is hereditary but has no serious consequences. Mild jaundice may appear under conditions of exertion, stress, fasting (as the one you need for the laboratory tests), and infections.  About your gastric problem, what do you mean by food is not digested properly? Do you mean you have rests of food in your stool? Do you mean you have bloating, nausea, vomiting? Chronic pain in the left abdomen especially after eating and with changes in your stool may be colitis or irritable bowel syndrome. For this, you may take over-the-counter medicines that contain Pinaverium bromide or/and Cinitapride. This should be taken every 12 hours for two weeks. This medication is to cease the swelling and irritation in this problem.  About your thyroid tests. You have subclinical hypothyroidism (which is you have increased thyroid stimulating hormone and normal thyroid hormones). If you have other symptoms like intolerance to cold weather, increase in weight without another reason, constipation, then you may need thyroid replacing hormones. If you do not have these symptoms you may repeat this laboratory test in 4 to 6 months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would like to ask if the nose bleeding is normal?

Or something serious is going on? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. The one episode of nose bleed can be neglected. But if repeated nose bleeding occurs than it should be evaluated in detail. For that, his blood pressure should be checked and coagulation profile should be checked. You are giving a positive family history of nose bleed so further work up in form of PT (prothrombin time), APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) test, CBC (complete blood count) and BT (bleeding time) testing are needed to rule out any coagulation problem, if present. Nose trauma is a common cause for nose bleeding. But excess bleed should be evaluated further. During bleeding episode, the nose should be pinched with index finger and thumb."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had pain recently in a tooth that has a hole in it for several months and the pain has been horrible and a couple of days back, I woke up with swollen cheek on the side of my bad tooth and pain is also there.

As per your history, it seems to me that you are having acute apical periodontitis with related buccal space infection. You need antibiotics for at least five days, so have non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. In case you want me to prescribe proper dosage, upload your picture of the swollen face so that I know the severity, and also your weight and height too. Or, you can visit a dentist physically but do not avoid it as the space infection can be dangerous too."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My brother just turned 26 years old three days back and he is a smoker from last seven years.

After puking he was cleaning his mouth and in the process, he was collecting phlegm and spitting. He noticed something red in the spit one time. He is not sure if it was blood or vomit since it was not bright red. He spat 3 to 4 times after that but nothing came out. It has been a week since then and no such incident has occurred after that. There is no other complaint. He is not breathless. Appetite is excellent. Stamina is very good. No weight loss. He has had his last X-ray a year back during job recruitment. Now my query is that he has said he is not going to smoke again but is not going to meet the doctor for the red thing. I am really worried about the chances of lung cancer.","Doctor":"Hello. It is unlikely to be lung cancer. Firstly, the lung cancer is unlikely at this age group and frequently develop after 45 to 50 years. Next thing, blood should have been present consistently and other symptoms would have been present. Most of the times such occasional bleeding is due to mucosal bleeding in mouth or GIT.

For the past 12 days my mother has been experiencing pain in the throat area, feels like something is stuck, vomiting mucous, weakness, body aches, white tongue, difficulty swallowing, and vomiting feeling while talking and eating. She vomits about twice a day. She consulted an ENT and internal medicine doctor. ENT dismissed her after nothing found in throat using a camera but the internal medicine doctor did some investigations. Results showed UTI (epithelial cells 20-25/HPF and pus cells 30-35) and TSH (13.5) raised as well as Candida Albicans growth from a throat swab. She has had this issue every few months and normally clears up on its own, but this time it is very severe and not going away. Current medication: Cefotil (Cefuroxime 500 mg and Clavulanic acid 125 mg), Gelora gel for oral thrush (Miconazole BP 2%), Motigut for vomiting 10mg), Thyroxine (50 mcg currently but internal medicine doctor asked to increase the dose to 1.5 tablets due to high TSH). Urine culture was done and it was normal. My query is, whether this is a bad infection, not bacterial but growth of esophageal candidiasis can be treated by antifungal therapy Fluconazole? No improvements are seen with many antibiotics. Oral thrush candida was found on initial appointments and also candida in throat swab. Is there any harm in trying a course of Fluconazole? She had a history of fungal infections in the throat which normally clear up on its own. This time it seems much more serious. If it is fine, what dosage would you recommend and for what period?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, your mother is suffering from 1. Hypothyroidism. 2. Oral candidiasis. 3. UTI (urinary tract infection). 4. Dysphagia. Oral candidiasis or oral thrush if not improved within five days after starting local antifungals then you may start oral antifungal medication. You may use tablet AF (Fluconazole) 150 mg once a day for one week. But in case of old age, people may feel nausea or vomiting for this drug then you can give iv Fluconazole (Forcan 100 ml) once a day for five days. In old age, vitamin B12 deficiency is also common, so it may present like glossitis with pharyngitis. Take vitamin B12 injection weekly once. You can give Neurobion injection also. Use Candid B mouth paint for local application. Use tablet Levosulfuride 25 mg twice a day for nausea and vomiting. At the same time check for serum electrolytes levels which may be altered in old age lead to vomiting. You may give probiotics like capsule Gut ok or Sporulac sachets to increase the immunity levels and also prevent gut growth of fungus. Remaining medications you continue the same. Response to the treatment may take four to five days. Diabetic patients are more prone to oral candidiasis so check for blood sugar."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I went to the dentist this morning for an extraction on a bottom molar on my left side. After being completely numbed he started the extraction and I had excruciating pain. He numbed me more but no matter how much he numbed, it hurt so bad. He eventually said he would refer me to a dental surgeon so I could be sedated. He was extremely nice about it the entire time but I could tell he just thought I was anxious and misinterpreting the pressure as pain. I was extremely nervous and anxious so I understand but I have had a tooth pulled before and I know the pressure, but this was an intense pain even though I was numbed. He said the dental surgeon would give me an IV that would relax me and make the procedure easier for me. I am worried that being sedated will not stop the pain. He said because I had a bad infection in the tooth that it could be causing the pain so he prescribed me some antibiotics to get rid of the infection. My questions are is this normal to have such terrible pain even while completely numb and will being sedated even help with this pain?","Doctor":"Hi. It is the best question I have got in my practice and the most frequent query is how and why. This is due to two reasons. Infected tooth with much inflammation or patient's anxious nature. So to tackle such cases it is better to prescribe antibiotics for five days then extract even if patient complaints, again it is better to give him or her tablet of Alprazolam before extraction one or two days to relieve anxiety. Moreover, before blocking the nerve, we can also give an injection of Dexamethasone which reduces inflammation."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My partner is pregnant with twins of 22 weeks. She has kell antigens in her blood received from a transfusion when my first son is born. I did a blood test last week, and I also have a kell group present in my blood. Do my babies are safe? What can be done to help them? Are there any permanent effects that would inhibit them from having a healthy life? I am scared after knowing it. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Kell blood group is a minor blood group system. ABO and Rh are called major blood group system. Kell antigen can be antigenic and can create a problem during a blood transfusion or else it may not create any problem. So there is no need for having a specific treatment. Whenever your child requires a blood transfusion, the blood bank should find the right blood suitable for your child as per cross match report. Please mention the blood group of your partner and first child. If the mother is Rh negative and the child is Rh positive, then there is a chance to have a hemolytic disease of a newborn, and it requires anti D."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had fingered (inserted my finger) my fiancee in the shower (hot water). I touched my penis twice but I did wash it too with bathing soap. There may be precum which I may have touched. But I washed it once as I said. It is her 14th day from the first day of her period. Is there any risk of her getting pregnant? Kindly suggest, do I need to panic?","Doctor":"Hello. There is no need to panic as the chances of pregnancy are minimal as you have already cleaned your penis with soap and water. Pre-cum sperms once they come in contact with the soap, they get denatured due to chemical reaction. However, as she is in her fertile period and to allay the chances and be safe, she can opt for an emergency contraceptive pill like an Ipill within next 72 hours to avoid any chances of pregnancy. She would get a withdrawal bleed in the next 4 to 5 days which shall indicate that she is pregnancy safe."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am getting red rashes on my skin when I apply some pressure or when I scratch my skin. They disappear after a few minutes. I consulted a dermatologist, and I am following these medicines. I am taking Allegra 120 mg and Rantac 150 mg. My doctor told me to continue the medication for a while. Do I need to take these medications for a few months? Can I have any side effect after using these medicines for a long duration? What is the reason for having hives? Are these harmful? What is the permanent remedy?","Doctor":"Hi. You have urticaria or hives. These medicines are safe, and they can be continued for a while if the problem persists. Hives can happen in response to a food allergen or food preservative, medications, infections, and alcohol. A large number of urticarias are idiopathic. There is no known cause for having it. Urticaria is mainly symptomatic, and it is treated with oral antihistamines."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My factor V Leiden showed a positive outcome before three months. I got Depo birth control shot before three months. I have heavy bleeding and blood clots now. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. You have factor V Leiden showing a positive result. So you are at high risk for developing blood clots in various organs of the body especially in the lungs and leg as pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. If you have major clots occurring in the future, then blood thinner and anticoagulant like Rivaroxaban can be used. There is no treatment available for the eradication of factor V mutation.

Can they regenerate in certain conditions? I got scaling of teeth done recently and developed gaps. I am wondering whether the gingiva can grow into this space.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. No, you are not right in this case, gingival tissue regenerates as do others except the nerve fibers, if an injury takes place. Dental scaling is good for the heath of gums and should be employed after every six months. If you have a gingival recession, that cannot be because of oral prophylaxis (scaling). So do not worry. The attachment will happen within days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a problem to defecate completely. It takes me more than 20 minutes to defecate completely. I also take more than two minutes to pass urine completely. I am very healthy. I consulted a doctor, and I have done various tests and examinations such as defecogram, balloon expulsion test, rectal manometry, and colonoscopy. The doctor told that I have pelvic floor dyssynergia-type 1. I underwent biofeedback sessions to get relaxed and to correct my way of passing stools. Even after that also, I am unable to clear my bladder. I am still taking the same amount of time. I do not have a habit of smoking and drinking alcohol. I have used all the laxatives and medicines given by the doctor. But they did not help me. I usually have a walk for 20 kilometers a day. At that time, I had some relief. But as soon as when I stopped it, I have developed the same problem. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. It is a complex problem. Exercises like kegel exercise and medication can help. Urinary issues also occur due to constipation and dyssynergia. Use Docusate sodium 200 mg twice daily. It is a good stool softener, and you can use it for a long time."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am very sensitive to wood smoke. The particle smaller than PM 2.5 or smallest ultrafine particles in wood smoke can behave like gases and can pass through the lungs and reaches the bloodstream directly. I have an increase in blood viscosity level after experiencing the smoke. I can feel it in my arteries. I have three stents placed for my LAD. What can I do to clean and detox my blood?","Doctor":"Hi. Our lung alveolar macrophage will do the job of clearing particles through the phagocytosis process. But when the load is over, or daily exposure is there, then phagocytosis can become defective. There is no specific drug needed for detoxification. You can practice the following steps for detoxification. Take more green leafy vegetables and fruits. Take more Vitamin C rich foods. Drink lots of water. Taking warm water is useful. Take one teaspoon of turmeric powder with milk daily. There is no need for taking medication for this problem."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been suffering from tooth problem for the last 6 or 7 years. The first few years I was feeling pain, I visited some dentist near me, they gave me medicines for relieving pain.

Kindly tell me what is that ball and what should I do now?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. It looks you are having repeated sinus drainage, it is a localized infection because of that infectious tooth. I would have provided you a better possible diagnosis and treatment plan if you would have uploaded a picture. You can take Ofloxacin 200 mg twice daily and Metronidazole 400 mg thrice daily for five days. Your problem will be solved.

He is going through a very bad pain.","Doctor":"Hi. The report you have attached was taken eight months back (attachment removed to protect patient identity). So, now there might be more growth and spread of the tumor. Ideally, surgery and radiotherapy can be preferred. If more pain is there, the oncologist will give morphine (strictly under supervision), that can control the pain. Turmeric tablet is good to continue, two tablets morning, two in the afternoon and two in the night. In addition, I can suggest few Siddha medications to you as follows. Vallaarai tablet two in the morning, two in the afternoon and two in the night. It is the Centella asiatica herb. Capsule Rasaganthi mezhugu one morning, one afternoon and one night after food.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Every child is different and has a different temperament. If your niece milestones are normal, she can have a proper eye to eye contact while talking, she can make friends, and she will not have restrictive and repetitive behavior. She has a behavior issue. She does not have the behavior whatever I mentioned, and we need to assess her in detail. Prenatal, natal and her childhood history is required. When she shows such tantrums, try to handle her with authority and do not show aggression and plea in front of her. Give rewards for good behavior and appreciate her when she is doing good things.

What is this?","Doctor":"Hello. You need to go to your dentist and get an X-ray done to find out whether the tooth needs to be removed. Wisdom tooth always causes such problems due to lack of space causing infection due to food debris accumulating at the pockets of the gums there. Use warm salt water gargle twice a day for a week or two. You may need antibiotics too. If it started recently, then you can wait for two weeks or so to see if it erupts normally and comes to the correct position.

See it can have many reasons like genetic cause, nutritional deficit, and some underlying disease. You should ask your physician about thyroid function test and perform it after discussing it. Because severe hair fall can be due to thyroid dysfunction sometimes. Besides that add curry leaves, raisins, figs, and almonds in your diet. Take one glass of lukewarm milk in the evening daily. Add half a teaspoon of turmeric powder and a pinch of black pepper in it. Protect your hairs from excessive sunlight, dust, etc. Wash your hairs with mild herbal shampoo.

I must compliment you for the excellent spreadsheet of your laboratory results. Regarding your CBC, we look at all three lines, Hb, WBC, and platelet count. A little variation individual to individual basis and with age is common. I can see that you are pretty young. At this moment I can see that Hb 13.1, WBC is 3.71, and platelet count is 165. I agree with few past reports of variation on platelet count and others cells in your case which happens to all of us (attachment removed to protect patient identity). To me, it is still not clear why you required two units of blood transfusion in the past. However, at this moment there is nothing major concern which I can point out at this moment. In future, if you go anemic, then please get your iron profile, vitamin B12 level, and folic acid level checked (not now).  Fasting sugar of 109 is known as pre-diabetes, but that needs recheck which your primary can easily do.

I have gone through your query, your doctor had suggested you take Levofloxacin before any other medication as the absorption will be better. Usually, we instruct patients to wait for an hour at least so that the drug can be absorbed.

I think your upper tooth has a rough surface that may be the issue causing this or even it may be because of food if you are chewing only from that side. You need to take foods with much Vitamin A and B complex, fruits and carrot. Even you can take supplements like that of Vitamin A. No it is not something that can be the cause of concern.

Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It is present all over the body. I got these allergies suddenly. I do not remember the cause. I applied a topical analgesic containing Benzyl alcohol with Pramoxine hydrochloride and taken Claritin for allergies. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Please explain about the exact site of involvement of allergies."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have done blood work and urinalysis. Everything came back normal except with slightly elevated cortisol of 25 ug/dl in the morning and elevated DHEA-S of 480 micrograms per deciliter also in the morning. My urine has some microscopic blood in it. I get my periods two times a month. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The normal upper limit of DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) for your age is 400 micrograms per deciliter of blood. Your level is 480 micrograms per deciliter of blood which is a mild elevation. The normal upper limit of cortisol in the morning sample is 20 ug/dl, and you have 25 ug/dl which is a slight elevation. This minor elevation does not have any significance, and it needs to be followed up with repeated tests after three to four months. I need to know whether you are taking any medicines because some medicines can alter the DHEA levels or cortisol levels. Please mention about the other symptoms like excessive hair growth on the face or body, change in voice, any shrinkage in breast size or anything else."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have episodes of bad sinuses every year. Last year, I had hay fever with an extreme blocked nose. I went to my GP, and he gave me sinus injection. I got better after treating it. The doctor prescribed Allerway 5, and Spersallerg eye drops for me. This year, my condition seems to be poor. My sinus has become bad. I use endless nasal sprays and allergy tablets. But there is no relief. I went to GP again, and he gave me an injection. This time, injection has not helped me. I have ear pain, head pain, clogged nose, with itchy eyes and itchy throat. When I lie down to sleep, the pain gets worse, and I have throbbing pain in the head. I have nonstop sneezing for 30 minutes in the mornings. I have also taken two courses of antibiotics. But there is no relief. In the mornings, when I sneeze, the mucous seems to be yellow with some blood present in it. Later, the mucus becomes clear again. I cannot sleep at night because of the throbbing head pain. I will try to change directions, and I will add more pillows to sleep. But nothing has helped me.","Doctor":"Hi. You are suffering from an acute attack of bacterial infection along with allergic rhinitis. You can take the following medications. Use Avamyse nasal spray (Fluticasone furoate nasal spray) once daily for a month. Take Claritin (Loratadine) tablet once daily during the winter season. Take tablet Targo 750 (Levofloxacin) once daily for ten days. Try to do self-nasal saline or water wash. The last treatment for allergic rhinitis is immunotherapy. You can redo CT scan for the nose and sinus after finishing Avamsye."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have hair loss. How can I stop it?","Doctor":"Hello. You can start with Wiesbaden 30 five pills in the morning, noon, evening, and night, Arnica hair oil (massage thrice in a week), Arnica shampoo, along with medicines. Have healthy food which has protein and calcium. Fenugreek is also good for hair. Have proper sound sleep. Mix coconut oil, castor oil, sesame oil. Do hair massage with it. Warm oil is good. Give follow up after one week to set the duration of treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 28 years old. My height is 5.8 feet, and my weight is 83 kilograms. I have belly fat, big thighs, and hips. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. With your height and weight, I have calculated your body mass index. You have a BMI of 26.8 which means that you are overweight. The first thing to do in your case is to assess your diet and activity. Please explain about the count of calories taken by you every day. You should be consuming 1600 to 1700 kcal per day. Try to do exercise for 30 minutes for at least five days a week. It can be any activity like walking, jogging, swimming to dancing. If you do these exercise for one to two months, and if there is no loss of weight, then it is necessary to see the thyroid hormone levels. An imbalance in hormones is usually present with other symptoms such as intolerance to cold weather, constipation, skin dryness and a lot of hair loss."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 28 years old. My weight is 89 kilograms, and my height is 177 cm. I suffer from severe back pain. When I was at a soccer camp at the age of 14, I used to have a very stiff back. Now, I have severe pain in my back, and I am unable to stand and walk. I did an MRI, and the report showed a bulging disc in L5 to S1, with a slight tear. I proceeded with physiotherapy to solve my back pain. My physiotherapist noted the cause in me. He told me that my core is weak, along with my glutes and hamstrings. I am taking physiotherapy treatment for two years now. Before two days, I started to have a bad episode of back pain. I had back pain preceded by a gym work out. I might have overdone it with hamstring lifts, and I may have tried it too heavy. I did an MRI yesterday, and the report showed that there is no protrusion, but L5 to S1 showed a degeneration. My orthopedic doctor told me that the pain does not emerge from the disc because it does not pinch any nerves. But I have intense pain in my back with stiffness and dullness in my left calf and foot. I am trying to take ozone-laser injection therapy. What can I do now?","Doctor":"Hi. I agree with your doctor on the fact that the disc protrusion and degeneration does not cause pain in this region. In my opinion, the back pain could be related to a twisted or strained back muscle during the physical activity that you have performed. Ozone laser injection therapy can help against inflammation. It can lead to some benefits for the bulging disc, but I doubt whether it will improve the pain that you are feeling now. I suggest you take a muscle relaxant (Flexeril) and use a topical ointment with painkillers coupled with oral Ibuprofen for the pain. Local warm packs can help. A good back massage can also help to reduce the muscle spasms. Avoid doing physical activity that causes strain. Try to have a rest for a few days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am allergic to dust. I have a doubt that I have a seasonal allergic rhinitis and I have been using anti-histamine and still it is not working for me. My anti-histamine is Telfast 180 mg.

Can you give me some advice and medication what to use?","Doctor":"Hello. I suggest you investigate with AEC (absolute eosinophil count) testing so that further comment can be given. If AEC is much high, Hetrazan can be prescribed. For allergy inflammation, Fexofenadine plus Montelukast combination can be prescribed. Moreover, for rhinitis, Azelestin or Fluticasone nasal spray can be prescribed to use for 3 to 5 days. Steam inhalation done three times a day with lukewarm water will be beneficial. I would like to suggest you consult an otorhinolaryngologist for detailed evaluation as rhinitis is there for one month."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.Patient.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.Doctor.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],Y={key:0},j={key:1};function W(a,e,l,u,n,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"ð¤ AI effective tips collection ð§ ")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[p,n.searchQuery]])]),t("div",F,[(o(!0),i(b,null,w(s.filteredPoems,(r,y)=>(o(),v(m,{key:y,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...r))},[n.isLoading?(o(),i("span",j,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",Y,"See more"))],8,q)):I("",!0)])}const z=c(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-ed7c4569"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/51.md","filePath":"guide/51.md"}'),E={name:"guide/51.md"},L=Object.assign(E,{setup(a){return(e,l)=>(o(),i("div",null,[k(z)]))}});export{O as __pageData,L as default};
