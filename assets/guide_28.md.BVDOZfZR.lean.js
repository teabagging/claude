A couple months ago I had a painful lump in my left armpit, which was also discolored basically like a normal bruise, it was kind of pink but also purple/blue like a bruise would be. At first I chalked it up to needing a new razor, I figured it was an ingrown hair. But after a couple days the pain was really severe, even when I was just sitting there not doing anything the pain would be pretty uncomforatble, and the lump was pretty big. I was going to make a dr. appointment, but after a few days the pain went away completely, and the swelling went down but the lump did not go away. Last week I started feeling the same pain in the same armpit, only a couple inches closer to the top of my breast. To be honest, I wasn't sure if the discomfort was from a new bra I had purchased that had an underwire, which I'm not used to, because the pain  went away more quickly than it had before, and the only other thing that happened was it seemed like it made my entire armpit kind of hard. Like, when I touch my right armpit it feels relatively firm, but squishy (I'm 200 lbs!), but when I touch my left armpit the whole thing feels denser. The actual lump is relatively small, but it is hard. If I had to guess, I'd say it's probably the size of a pea or a marble. In addition, I'm not sure if this could be related or not, but I've been having dizzy spells, or vertigo I'm not entirely sure what the difference is. At first I experienced the dizziness before a meal, so I figured it was from being hungry (even though that's never happened before.. and I've had an eating disorder in the past, bulimia, so i figure my body's no stranger to being a little hungry!). But yesterday was the third instance of dizziness, and it occurred 15-20 minutes after I ate dinner, so there goes the hungry theory! Can you help me?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning.

You are too young to have it or even to think about it! Since it's a sore lump, it seems to be like an infective/reactive lymph node. This can be treated with antibiotics alone.

The lump that you have seems to be a corn, which is hardening of the skin, particularly at areas of pressure. It can be treated by medicated ointments or plasters that will remove the dead skin overlying the thickening, and help in removing the corn more easily.Do not attempt to cut or shave away corns at home.

However, below the ear it could be a Parotid gland swelling or a Submandibular gland swelling. Anyway, a biopsy will be able to clearly outline the nature of the swelling. So, dont worry and get the test done. You could also go for an FNAC before a biopsy which is a less invasive test than a biopsy. A small needle is put into the swelling and some cells are aspirated which are then seen under a microscope to come to a diagnosis. But, a biopsy is definitely more conclusive. It is a decision that you should make in consultation with your Doctor.

Please tell me this isn't anything to worry about!!!  It seems like we just finished going through this horrific diagnosis and I feel we are starting over at day one.","Doctor":"Welcome to Health care magic.1.The lesion in the armpit / axillary region , non painful lump after the treatment for the carcinoma tongue - most possible cause could be lymph nodal enlargement.2.Lymph nodal enlargement is seen after any infection / inflammation / malignant causes and any systemic diseases - treat them if you are aware of any thing.3.At this moment i would suggest a contrast enhanced computer tomography to see the postoperative site to confirm there is no recurrence.4.An ultrasound to confirm the lump in the axillary region, its source and nature of the lesion solid / cystic, FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology - to evaluate the kind of cells.5.At this point i would recommend to folio the steps - and a regular followup.

I've just arranged a doctors appointment for Monday as it feels that it's getting worse. IIt's sore to the touch and feels quite warm and swollen.

I'm 35, relatively healthy and I don't smoke or use drugs. I drink socially, but not heavily/frequently.My question is whether I should keep to the doctors appointment in a few days or whether I should seek more urgent medical help. It aches to walk but isn't excrutiatingly painful. I'd say that the lump has got bigger in the last few days but doesn't  seem to have spread elsewhere and hasn't grown rapidly.I'm happy to wait until Monday but would also like to know what to do in the meantime?

When she was 11, she had to have three cysts aspirated. The Doctor has referred my Daughters case as urgent and we have an appoinment in one week. I am worried sick as this time the lump feels different, hard and fixed with no pain, plus she has a swollen armpit.  When she had the cysts before they were far bigger and they did not feel as hard and they were not fixed, they also caused her alot of pain.The lump is in the same breast but in the upper right part of the breast. I know the doctor is thinking breast cancer by the look on his face and the fact he was lost for words. Please can you tell me in your honest opinion what you think? Or if this lump is benign...what else could it be? if this is a Cyst, why are the symptoms so different?  Many thanks for your time","Doctor":"Hi.Noted the history of Aspirated Cysts, now pea sized lump in right breast and swollen armpits.Cancer is least likely almost not heard of at the age of 17 years. The lump in the breast can be cyst which has re-appeared  and got fixed due to previous aspiration tract. This is not frankly infected hence appears hard and does not hurt. Simple ultrasonography and guided FNAC will give the diagnosis.The swollen armpit can be due to lymph nodes secondary to the breast lesion or have been a part of hidradenitis common in this age of 17 years.

They are not right on the surface, I have to press down a little bit to feel them. Is this something to be worried about? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,No, this is not anything to be worried about. The stretch marks are a result of damage occurring to the deeper layers of your skin as you rapidly gain weight during pregnancy. After pregnancy the layers of skin will heal but there will be some scarring of these deeper layers. This will be felt as lumpiness. Now that you are pregnant again, the changes to your skin will start again and it will feel the previous scarring. About 8 in 10 women develop stretch marks and there is no totally effective cure for them unfortunately. I hope this has helped you.

Anxiety, caffeine intake and straining physical activity may trigger this clinical situation. Anyway, I would recommend first performing some tests in order to investigate for possible metabolic disorders, which can trigger high blood pressure values: - complete blood count, PCR, ERS for inflammation - thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid gland dysfunction - cortisol and aldosterone plasma levels for adrenal gland dysfunction- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance - kidney and liver function tests- fasting glucose - a Doppler ultrasound of the renal arteries - a chest X ray study. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause of high blood pressure values. In such case, Yoga and meditation would help. If these high blood pressure values persist during the day, starting anti-hypertensive therapy may be needed. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. From the duration of the lumps, it seems that they are benign lesions which could be more of a cosmetic importance due to their unwanted presence in these locations (say lipoma for example).

Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Although it needs to be examined physically before opining on the lesion, with the history, it seems that your shin has been hurt somewhere might be without your knowledge, or an event which you do not remember now. This possibly resulted in a hematoma formation(collection of blood in a closed space) which gave rise to your present symptoms. This should get absorbed in due course. However, it would need some specialist opinion in case of any super added infection resulting in an abscess formation.As the duration is already of 4 weeks, I would rather suggest you to get it examined by a general surgeon for further management. Till then, you could go for an anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

I sometimes would get tiny swollen glands on the side of my neck which would go away. So I'm a little shocked to have woken up to a decent sized lump. Of course my main worry is cancer or tumor.. But it wouldn't pop up overnight ? So my question is what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello this is Dr.Subhadeep.thanks for the opportunity to help you.the swelling you have described at the tip of the neck which has come overnight can be an abscess cavity due to some boil or fur uncle or even it can be due to enlarged sub mental group of lymph nodes due to some infection.as you told that u r a smoker so this can also happen during chronic throat infections as chronic cough or chronic bronchitis.the things which you should have elaborated are:1.are you presently suffering from any current throat infection2.is the lump painful and associated with fever?3.can u send me a photo of the lump.that will be invaluable.?4.how is your oral cavity and oral hygiene.any gum infection,tongue ulcer,ulcers over the palate?5.any tonsillitis or throat infection currently?first take a course of antibiotics and anti inflammatory and analgesic course for 7 days as given below.1.tab Moxikind-cv 625mg1-1-1x7days2.tab rantack 150mg 1-0-1x5days3.tab zerodol-sp 1-1-1x5 days4.tab chymoral forte 1-1-1x7days.if the abscess localized a simple incision and drainage is enough. if the lump regresses or disappears then it means that it was due to some throat infection.if the lump still persists then you should do a CBC withE.S.R, Mantoux test, x-Ray neck and x-ray chest,USG neck and most importantly FNAC or even an excision biopsy may be confirmed.if FNAC or Biopsy suggests T.B then ATT has to be started.if the diagnosis is non specific lymphadenitis or sotherwise.necessery treatment can be given.let me know if the consultation was beneficialregardsDr.Subhadeep"},{"Patient":"About 4 months ago I went to the foot doctor with a sprained ankle.

But you can feel it more when I flew.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From your history, it seems that you have got an olecranon bursitis, a benign condition which occurs due to repeated friction on the olecranon bursa normally placed in the elbow just above the olecranon bone. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to avoid pressure on the elbow repeatedly to avoid accumulation of more fluid in the normally present olecranon bursa. In case of need, some patients might have to change their profession if need be to achieve this. Apart from this, I might advise you for a RA factor test and a serum uric acid test to rule out Rheumatoid Arthritis and high uric acid levels in the blood. On the management part, I would treat any abnormality detected on the blood tests, and would give an anti inflammatory and an antibiotic drug if need be to control the inflammation and infection if present. In case of no relief, I would suggest you to visit a general surgeon/orthopaedic surgeon in your area, who after a physical examination, might go for an FNAC, or an excisional biopsy both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Even though it needs a physical examination to arrive at a diagnosis of a lump, from your history it seems that possibly you got a cellulitis (inflammed soft tissue) in the area along with the possibility of developing an abscess if not taken care of. Therefore, I would suggest you to please take an appointment with a general surgeon in your area, and get it clinically assessed by him for an appropriate treatment. Till that you could go for an anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Thank you in advance for your help.","Doctor":"Hello , Though healthy diet is always a priority and should be adhered too at all times . The symptoms of breathlessness , pain are not explained by diet alone . Considering its 7 years since the valve replacement, it's strongly suggested to check it's status by doing a comprehensive 2d echo cardiogram and look for valve function whether there is any reason stenosis , degeneration, any leak which could very well explain the symptoms. Losing weight rather helps , as now the heart has to supply to less body surface area of body so again this is not explained by weight loss alone .

Welcome to HCM.Yes, your concern is very true.This can be a dermoid cyst or lipoma or sebaceous cyst or osteoid osteoma, all of which are benign lumps.Dermoid is usually in midline.Lipoma is typically soft in consistency.Osteoma is a benign bone tumor typically very hard in consistency & almost immobile.In my clinic, many such patients come to whom I advise FNAC-fine needle aspiration cytology, if in doubt clinically.Treatment is usually excision biopsy i.e. lump is removed under local anaesthesia & sent for histopathological examination.Only concern is when it is growing rapidly in size, it can be malignant, in which case you should consult your doctor as early as possible.Hope this helps.Wish you speedy recovery.Thanks.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have a large lump on my inner thigh.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Considering the duration of your symptoms, it seems less likely to be a skin cancer.

So if it is deficient in a person then he or she will be less prone to develop occlusive diseases of the venous system like DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS, PULMONARY VENO OCCLUSIVE DISEASE (causing pulmonary hypertension), HEAPTIC VENO OCCLUSIVE DISEASE.Good Luck"},{"Patient":"Good Evening Doc, I have a question concerning a lump in my wife s head, she has had it since she was young and now that she gotten older it has bothered her.....

And is blood normal instead of clear fluid?","Doctor":"Hi,The pain and swelling in your wrist in the area of surgery is likely to be bruising from the procedure at this early stage. The procedure you had will not have removed the ganglion, it will have aspirated the contents of the cyst. I am surprised it was blood as ganglions do not usually contain blood. In order to more reliably treat a ganglion I would suggest surgical removal. Therefore, if your symptoms do not improve in two days, a visit to your doctor would be appropriate for further assessment.

Do need to recheck your heart and pacemaker status (EKG, echocardiogram, Holter monitoring). Next, should rule out stomach hyperacidity problems (gastritis, acid reflux) as they are similar to symptoms you are currently experiencing. Upper endoscopy is also recommended. Another explanation is neuromuscular issues as you experience numbness after working around home. Can check it out by neurologist. EMG studies are also recommended. For the moment I can only suggest you to take magnesium supplement to ease the muscle spasms. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Lately I've been getting really bad migraines, trouble sleeping, and dizziness.  About 16 hours ago I realized I got this lump or bump on my inner upper thigh.

Since then my mother was informed that I would possibly have aggression problems, depression, and headaches.  My question is, would this lump be related to my accident many years ago?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.It is possible that this lump is related to the surgery you have had many years ago. It might be a femoral hernia. However it should be movable and get smaller when lying down.More possible is that this is something not related to the accident.

The lumps is bluish, painful to touch and movements, garden work :: All this suggest this to be a small hematoma in a confined space- so is painful.It is expected to resolve on its own, provided you give a rest to the part, do not fiddle with it.

This will resolve but take more time, so nothing to worry about.More important is to see that the TM joints are normal. Get checked by opening the mouth widely and close. If there is no problem in front of the ears , you are lucky, as these type of injuries cause trauma to the joints.

All these swellings are small boils/ abscess and will settle well with a small course of an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory medicines like Ibuprofen.

You have not made a mention on the size of the mass, mobility, consistency. If the lesion is small, mobile, soft, then you need not bother much as it is just a benign lesion. Keep a watch on the lesion, if you feel there is a sudden increase in the size or if it gets fixed to the underlying tissue or there is bloody discharge from nipple or retraction of nipple, then you need to consult  a doctor to evaluate the nature of lesion. Most of the lesions of breast which are cancerous or precancerous are picked on a ultrasound or mammogram.

Lipoma will be mobile, not tender at all, will not enlarge of reduce on any movement or coughing.The epigastric hernia if small has the fat tissue inside as a content and may behave the same way as explained for lipoma.

This oozing produces collection i.e. blood clot (hematoma) as you correctly predicted.Also, tissue oedema & inflammation causes an appreciatable lump.Need not worry.In my clinic, I prescribe chymoral forte, enzymes that reduce tissue oedema.Even without any medication, it resolves, just that it takes a little more time.Hope this information is useful to you.Thanks.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Although a personal physical examination of the lump would be helpful in reaching a nearby diagnosis, most probably with a history of trauma, it could be an organised hematoma on the left side of your back. To confirm the diagnosis, if I were your doctor, I would go for an FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) followed possibly by an excision biopsy depending on the report of the FNAC.  Considering the duration of more than 4 years, clinically it might be a benign lesion not to worry about. However, for cosmetic reasons it might be required to be taken out.Therefore, I would advise you to consult a general surgeon and get your self assessed for the same.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

In India, tuberculosis is one of the commonest cause of supraclavicular lymphadenitis and is usually mutliple forming together a small mass. As your node is present in two months and is not reducing, a fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) can be done first. X-ray could have been done if there were other symptoms related to the respiratory system. FNAC is an out door procedure, where they put a needle (normal injection size) into the lesion to remove cells and help in diagnosis.FNAC, if not diagnostic, you can then go for biopsy. The feel of rubbery lymphnode or an enlarged lymphnode for a longer time without any infection does not feel good. Get an FNAC done, it should help you. Removal can be done at a later date, if necessary. Hope I have answered your query.

Please help me my name is maria","Doctor":"hello Maria,Its a boil, if it contains clear water. But when it gets infected, it gets filled with neutrophils also i.e. forms pus. Then, you call it abscess.Usually an abscess needs to be drained if it does not rupture. As it increases in size, the pain severity increases and slowly ruptures itself. You are having a good antibiotic cover and you can continue it for five days and it should rupture by itself. If it does not, an OPD procedure will be done maybe within ten minutes and after that you will require regular dressings until you heal completely.If the pain becomes severe, you can take painkillers like Diclofenac or aceclofenac. Keep the area clean and avoid touching it and simultaneously touching other areas. It could spread to other areas by touching as it is a bacterial infection.

For this reason, I would recommend performing an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring and a polysomnogram in order to investigate for the above-mentioned causes. In the meantime, I would recommend trying a PPI (omeprazole, pantoprazole, etc) before sleeping and see if it helps prevent these episodes. In such a case, you should consider possible gastro-esophageal reflux as a possible cause underlying your complaints. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I mean the gap between the slipped beat varys.. Should i  be worried about this? What are the possible problems this can cause for my baby?","Doctor":"Hi,In this case it is very important that the baby has structurally normal heart. usually in such cases echocardiography of fetus is done to rule out structural abnormality that may cause some arrhythmias. The grade of seriousness depends on the type of arrhythmia and if there is a structural problem. If there is no structural heart problem, the arrhythmia may be benign and have no consequences.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hello, my name is Tyler and im 16, 5-10 and weigh 160 pounds, I have concerns about my genital area, for the past few weeks I've noticed a bump right below my genital area in the gutch area just one and its now the size of mole if that gives you an actual image and I've tried popping it but nvr seems to break skin for it to pop should I be concerned?

If the lump grows more and more the scar of surgery will also be more. Since it is hard like a bone chances of a lymph node or some other problem is more.

This will kill all the skin bacteria and may avoid further infection.A course of antibiotic to start with and continue with doxycyclin daily.Wait and watch for 3 weeks. y this time most of the disease is under control.In case of failures a small surgery may be needed to remove the disease bearing skin . This is a staged surgery and needs a few seating."},{"Patient":"I have a lymph node under my arm for over two years now... The swelling goes up and down but it never fully disappears. I had a ct scan, multiple blood tests, an ultrasound, chest x ray and a core needle biopsy which got tissue from two different lymph nodes in my arm pit.. the results can back inconclusive because the sample was so small.. although my doctor believes I've ruled out lymphoma. Although I'm scared they missed something, because if it was an infection which I was negative for all of them, shouldnt the lymph node unswell?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history.Yes, very true. The lymph nodes should have been totally resolved by this time. The nature of the lymph node indicates the need of another - second opinion and a repeat FNAC to be done under ultrasonography guidance. This is where the Doctors fail. The FNAC has to be done under  the ultrasonography guidance so that the exact tissue can be gotten and processed. This will give us conclusive diagnosis . Very true that the diagnosis of a sinister Lymphoma should be done or ruled out. I hope the simple tests of antibiotic results must have been done already ."},{"Patient":"I am a 26 year old, active female. I weigh 135 pounds.

It's been there for several years, it gets sore and difficult to swallow food at times. I can move the hyoid back and forth. I can feel it grind but the pain subsides afterwards.

They tested my thyroid and TSH levels, and all came back normal. Chem profile 2 and CBC also have come back normal. No X-Rays or anything else has been done to determine what it is.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.It seems to me that you developed a hematoma (collection of blood) around your knee which has now organised. If the swelling has become hard and warm, possibly this has become inflamed and needs to be shown to an orthopedic surgeon at the earliest, who after a personal physical examination might advise you for an MRI of the injured knee joint of yours to reach to a nearest diagnosis. Further management would depend on the clinical findings, and investigation reports. Till that you could go for an anti inflammatory drug with a proton pump inhibitor.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Good evening.

One is the size of a large pea and the other about double the first in size.  They are both hard and fixed but, he does not complain about them being sore when I touch them.  He is 23 lbs and maybe 31 inches tall (not completely sure on height) he eats fairly healthy and is active.  He does complain almost every day of a sore tummy.  And the only thing that I can think of that is out of the ordinary is a couple weeks ago we went camping and he got bit by an insect that left a nice sized welt.  Maybe he is fighting something from that?  Would like to know if lumps like that are normal in young children.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Most likely the lumps you have described are enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Of course in young children normal lymph nodes could be palpable. But these are usually mobile,firm, and not hard and fixed. Any inflammation due to the insect bite could be responsible in the enlargement of regional draining lymph nodes and again they will be mobile, and tender to touch. His tummy problem might be an independent entity and might not be related to these.If I were your doctor, I would go for a thorough clinical examination of your child with special reference to the head and neck region including mouth, ear, and nose. If nothing is conclusive, I might consider a short course of emperical broad spectrum antibiotic for him. If no relief, and the swelling persists or increases, then I would not hesitate to advise for a FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) of the lumps to arrive at a tentative diagnosis for further management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of child's problem.
