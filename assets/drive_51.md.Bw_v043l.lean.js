Similar two statements hold for the sum of distances of any point from the parallel lines B C and A D in relation to their distance |A B|.

From the above considerations, it follows that in each of these angles, we are looking for precisely those points whose sum of distances from both sides of the angle is equal to the value frac{1}{12} o.

The sought points X of the angle A A_{1} A_{2} therefore indeed form the segment A_{1} A_{2}.Answer: The sought set is the union of eight segments that form the boundary of the octagon A_{1} A_{2} B_{2} B_{1} C_{1} C_{2} D_{2} D_{1}.Note.

Let P be the set of prime numbers under investigation, and first show that 2 notin P. The number 2 is the only prime number that is not odd. If 2 in P, the sum of all primes in P (an odd number of them) would be even, and the sum of an even number of them would be odd, so the arithmetic mean could not be the odd number 27. Therefore, 2 notin P.Since the number 27 is not a prime number, the set P is not a singleton, and for its largest element p^{*}, it holds that p^{*} > 27. Now, we will use this obvious fact: The arithmetic mean A of a set of real numbers decreases whenever we add a number smaller than A to the set or remove a number larger than A from the set. Therefore, let's add all the missing prime numbers p, 2 < p < 27 to the set P and remove all prime numbers p, 27 < p < p^{*} (if any exist).

Indeed, three non-concurrent lines and two never parallel lines form a triangle. Now, any line that crosses a triangle divides it into two polygons, at least one of which is a triangle. Therefore, starting from three of the given lines and \\"adding\\" the other 2014 one by one, we are assured of the existence of such a triangular region in the final configuration. The three vertices of such a triangle must be of different colors, which implies that m geq 3.To conclude, we will construct an appropriate three-coloring. We start by noting that, since there are only a finite number of intersection points, we can choose an orthogonal coordinate system in which these points have distinct x-coordinates. We then number the points M_{1}, M_{2}, ldots, M_{k} according to increasing x-coordinates (where k=frac{2017 times 2016}{2}). For any i, the point M_{i} has at most four neighbors, and if it belongs to a segment joining two of its neighbors, only one of these two neighbors has an x-coordinate less than that of M_{i}. This ensures that, for any i leq k, among the neighbors of M_{i}, at most two have indices less than i. We can then color the M_{i} in the order of the numbering according to the following procedure: we color M_{1} green and M_{2} red. And, for any i such that 2 leq i leq k-1, if we assume that the points M_{1}, M_{2}, ldots, M_{i} have been colored either green, red, or blue so that no two adjacent points are (yet) the same color, then, according to the previous remark, at most two neighbors of M_{i+1} have already been colored, leaving one color free for M_{i+1}."},{"problem":"In the cuboid ABCD-A1B1C1D1, where AB=3, AD=4, and AA1=5, point P is a moving point on the surface A1B1C1D1.

Understanding the Polynomial Properties:   - ( f(x) ) is a polynomial of degree less than 187.   - For any integer ( n ), ( f(n) ) is an integer.2. Lagrange Interpolation:   - We can use Lagrange interpolation to express ( f(x) ) in terms of its values at specific points.   - The Lagrange interpolation formula for ( f(x) ) given its values at ( x = 1, 2, ldots, 187 ) is:     [     f(x) = sum_{k=1}^{187} f(k) prod_{substack{1 le i le 187  i ne k}} frac{x - i}{k - i}     ]   - To find ( f(0) ), we set ( x = 0 ):     [     f(0) = sum_{k=1}^{187} f(k) prod_{substack{1 le i le 187  i ne k}} frac{-i}{k - i}     ]3. Parity Consideration:   - We need to determine the parity (even or odd) of ( f(0) ).   - The parity of ( f(0) ) depends on the parity of the coefficients in the Lagrange interpolation formula.4. Simplifying the Product:   - The product term ( prod_{substack{1 le i le 187  i ne k}} frac{-i}{k - i} ) can be simplified modulo 2.   - Notice that ( prod_{substack{1 le i le 187  i ne k}} (-i) ) is a product of 186 terms, each of which is an integer from 1 to 187.5. Parity of Binomial Coefficients:   - The key observation is that the parity of ( f(0) ) is determined by the parity of the binomial coefficients in the Lagrange interpolation formula.   - Specifically, we need to consider the binomial coefficients modulo 2.6. Using Lucas' Theorem:   - Lucas' theorem helps us determine the parity of binomial coefficients modulo 2.   - According to Lucas' theorem, the binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{k} ) modulo 2 is determined by the binary representations of ( n ) and ( k ).7. Evaluating the Parity:   - We need to evaluate the parity of ( f(k) ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 187 ).   - By evaluating ( f(k) ) for all ( k ) in the set ( {1, 2, ldots, 187} ), we can determine the parity of ( f(0) ).8. Conclusion:   - Since the degree of ( f(x) ) is less than 187, evaluating ( f(x) ) at 187 distinct points is sufficient to determine the polynomial completely.   - Therefore, the smallest positive integer ( N ) such that Alice always knows for sure the parity of ( f(0) ) is ( boxed{187} )."},{"problem":"During a physical examination, the heights (in meters) of 5 students were 1.72, 1.78, 1.80, 1.69, 1.76.

Rewriting the Condition:   The condition ( |a_i - a_{i-1}| = i^2 ) implies that ( a_i - a_{i-1} = epsilon_i cdot i^2 ) where ( epsilon_i = pm 1 ). Therefore, we need to find ( epsilon_i ) such that:   [   a_n - a_0 = sum_{i=1}^n epsilon_i cdot i^2   ]   This simplifies to:   [   c - b = sum_{i=1}^n epsilon_i cdot i^2   ]3.

Factoring the Equation:   We rewrite the equation as:   [   (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) = p(xy + p)   ]   By the Four Number Lemma, there exist positive integers ( a, b, c, d ) such that:   [   ab = x + y, quad cd = x^2 - xy + y^2, quad ac = p, quad bd = xy + p   ]   Since ( p ) is a prime, we have two cases: ( a = p, c = 1 ) or ( a = 1, c = p ).5. Case 1: ( a = p ) and ( c = 1 ):   - We get:     [     x + y = pb, quad x^2 - xy + y^2 = d, quad xy + p = bd     ]   - By AM-GM inequality, ( x^2 + y^2 geq 2xy ), so ( d geq xy ). Using the third equation, we get ( p geq (b-1)xy ). Therefore:     [     x + y geq b(b-1)xy     ]     This is impossible if ( b > 1 ) (since there are no solutions when ( x = y = 1 )). Thus, ( b = 1 ), so ( p = x + y ). Dividing both sides of the equation by ( x + y ), we get:     [     x^2 - xy + y^2 = xy + p implies p = (x - y)^2     ]     This is absurd since no prime is a perfect square. Therefore, this case has no solutions.6. Case 2: ( a = 1 ) and ( c = p ):   - We get:     [     x + y = b, quad x^2 - xy + y^2 = pd, quad xy + p = bd     ]7. Claim: ( d = 3 ):   - Suppose ( d neq 3 ). Notice that:     [     (x + y)^2 - 3xy = x^2 - xy + y^2     ]     So:     [     b^2 - 3(bd - p) = pd implies b^2 - 3bd = pd - 3p     ]     Thus, ( b mid pd - 3p = p(d - 3) ). If ( p mid b ), then taking the third equation modulo ( p ) gives ( p mid xy ), which we know is not true. Thus, ( gcd(b, p) = 1 ), so ( b mid d - 3 ).   - If ( d < 3 ), then ( b = 2 ). This case leads to no solutions, so assume ( d > 3 ). We have ( d - 3 geq b ), so ( d > b = x + y ).   - Now we have:     [     d = frac{xy + p}{x + y} leq frac{xy + pd}{x + y} = frac{x^2 + y^2}{x + y} leq x + y = b     ]     This is absurd since ( d > b ). Therefore, ( d = 3 ).8. Final Calculation:   - Now, we have:     [     x^2 - xy + y^2 = b^2 - 3(3b - p) = b^2 - 9b + 3p     ]     Since this is equal to ( 3p ), we get:     [     b^2 - 9b = 0 implies b = x + y = 9     ]   - Since ( gcd(x, y) = 1 ), we must have ( {x, y} = {1, 8}, {2, 7}, {4, 5} ), which gives the desired solution set.The final answer is (boxed{(x, y, p) = (8, 1, 19), (1, 8, 19), (7, 2, 13), (2, 7, 13), (5, 4, 7), (4, 5, 7)})."},{"problem":"z= frac {5i}{1-2i} (where i is the imaginary unit), then z isA: 2-iB: 2+iC: -2-iD: -2+i","solution":"To solve, z= frac {5i}{1-2i}= frac {5i(1+2i)}{(1-2i)(1+2i)}=i-2.

To find the base a, we use the point (8,3):[log_a 8 = 3 implies a^3 = 8 implies a = 2]Therefore, the function is f(x) = log_2 x. The domain of a logarithmic function is all positive real numbers, so the domain of f(x) is (0, +infty).# Part 2: Finding the Range of Values for xGiven f(1-x) > f(1+x) and knowing that f(x) = log_2 x is an increasing function on its domain (0, +infty), we can translate the inequality into a system of inequalities:1. 1-x > 0 implies x  0 implies x > -13. 1-x > 1+x implies -x > x implies -1 > 2x implies x  f(1+x), then 1-x must be less than 1+x due to the properties of logarithmic functions, which is always true.

For n=2^{k}, for all natural k.Solution. 1) Let first n=2^{k}, for some natural k. A winning strategy for Petya is as follows: if after Vasya's move the chip is on a position with number m=2^{a}(2 b+1), then Petya names the number m=2^{a}. After this, Vasya will move the chip either to the position with number m=2^{a+1}(b+1), or to the position with number m=2^{a+1} b (modulo left.n=2^{k}right). In any case, the highest power of two dividing the position number, where the chip will be after Vasya's next move, increases by at least 1. Therefore, after no more than k moves, the position number of the chip will be divisible by n=2^{k}, which is only possible for the position with number 0, and Petya will win.2) Now let n=2^{k} cdot p, k geq 0, where p=2 b+1>1 is the largest odd divisor of n. Note that positions with numbers divisible by p are bad for Vasya; if he places the chip on one of them first, Petya, using a strategy similar to the one described in point 1), naming the number m=2^{a} cdot p each time, will win. Therefore, Vasya must first place the chip on any position with number x not divisible by p. Suppose Petya then names any natural number s from the range from 1 to n-1. One of the numbers x-s and x+s does not divide by p, otherwise their sum, equal to 2 x, would divide by p, and thus x would divide by p, which contradicts his choice. Therefore, on each move, Vasya can place the chip on a position whose number does not divide by p, and it will never end up on the position with number 0. Thus, for n that are not powers of two, Petya cannot win.Grading criteria. (cdot) A winning strategy for Petya in the case n=2^{k} is provided: 3 points.

We can solve for y as follows: y = frac{4 - x}{2} = 2 - frac{x}{2}. We substitute y into the expression that we need to minimize: 2^x + 4^y = 2^x + 4^{2 - frac{x}{2}} = 2^x + left(2^2right)^{2 - frac{x}{2}} = 2^x + 2^{4 - x}. Now let's analyze the function f(x) = 2^x + 2^{4 - x} for x in mathbb{R}. This function is symmetric with respect to the line x = 2 since substituting x = 2 + h and x = 2 - h gives us the same function value. That symmetry implies that the function's minimum occurs at x = 2 because the exponential function grows rapidly for values greater than 2 and decays rapidly for values less than 2.We can prove this formally by finding the derivative of the function and showing that the critical point is a minimum. The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is: f'(x) = ln(2) cdot 2^x - ln(2) cdot 2^{4 - x}. Setting f'(x) = 0 gives: ln(2) cdot 2^x - ln(2) cdot 2^{4 - x} = 0,  2^x = 2^{4 - x}, This equation holds if x = 2. Since the exponential function is strictly increasing, we have only one critical point, so by the first derivative test, we know the function f(x) has a minimum at x = 2.Substituting x = 2 into our original problem: 2^2 + 4^{2 - frac{2}{2}} = 4 + 2^{4 - 2} = 4 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8.

Identify the problem and given example:   We need to find all prime numbers ( p ) such that there exists an integer ( n ) for which there are no integers ( x ) and ( y ) satisfying ( x^3 + y^3 equiv n pmod{p} ). For example, for ( p = 7 ), we can set ( n = pm 3 ) since ( x^3, y^3 equiv 0, pm 1 pmod{7} ), thus ( x^3 + y^3 equiv 0, pm 1, pm 2 pmod{7} ) only.2. Consider primes of the form ( 3k + 1 ):   Suppose ( p > 7 ) is a prime of the form ( 3k + 1 ). In this case, there are ( k + 1 ) distinct cubic residues modulo ( p ).3. Use Davenport's theorem:   According to Davenport's theorem, at least ( (k + 1) + (k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 1 ) numbers can be written as the sum of two cubes modulo ( p ).4. Count the numbers that can be written as the sum of two cubes:   Since there are ( k + 1 ) cubic residues, and each residue can be multiplied by any non-zero element ( t ) in ( mathbb{Z}_p ), there are at least ( k ) numbers that cannot be written as the sum of two cubes.5. Equality in Davenport's theorem:   Since ( p = 3k + 1 ), we have ( 2k + 1 + k = 3k + 1 = p ). This means that the equality in Davenport's theorem holds, implying that all cubic residues are of the form ( xt ) for some fixed ( t neq 0 ) and ( a leq x leq a + k ).6. Multiplicative property of cubes:   Cubes are multiplicative, so for ( a leq x, x' leq a + k ), we have ( a leq xx't leq a + k ). For ( xt = -1 ), we have ( a leq -y leq a + k ) for all ( a leq y leq a + k ), implying ( a = -frac{k}{2} ).7. Range of ( t ):   For ( x = 1 ), we have ( -frac{k}{2} leq t leq frac{k}{2} ). Since ( p > 7 ), we have ( -frac{k}{2} leq 2 leq frac{k}{2} ).8. Contradiction:   Now take ( x = 2 ) and move ( x' ) from ( 1 ) to ( frac{k}{2} ). At some point, ( xx't ) will not be in ( [-frac{k}{2}, frac{k}{2}] ), leading to a contradiction.Therefore, the only prime ( p ) for which there exists an integer ( n ) such that there are no integers ( x ) and ( y ) with ( x^3 + y^3 equiv n pmod{p} ) is ( p = 7 ).The final answer is ( boxed{7} )."},{"problem":"The rationalization factor of sqrt{a}-sqrt{b} can be ( ).A: sqrt{a}-sqrt{b}B: sqrt{a}+sqrt{b}C: sqrt{a+b}D: sqrt{a-b}","solution":"To rationalize the expression sqrt{a}-sqrt{b}, we look for a factor that, when multiplied with sqrt{a}-sqrt{b}, results in a rational expression.

These are the portions of the real line where the argument of the logarithm is positive, thus belonging to the domain of f.However, we must look at the behavior of the function within these intervals to determine where it is decreasing. Recall that the function f(x) = log_{frac{1}{2}}g(x) will be decreasing in an interval where g(x) is increasing, because the base frac{1}{2} is between 0 and 1.

Factoring 1986:   The prime factorization of 1986 is:   [   1986 = 2 times 3 times 331   ]   We need to find pairs ((a-1, b-1)) such that their product is 1986 and (0 < b < a < 1986).5. Possible Pairs:   The pairs ((a-1, b-1)) that satisfy the conditions are:   [   (331, 6), (662, 3), (993, 2)   ]6. Checking Each Pair:   - For ((a-1, b-1) = (331, 6)):     [     a = 331 + 1 = 332, quad b = 6 + 1 = 7     ]     Check if 1985 and 663 can be obtained:     - (1985) cannot be obtained as (1985 = 332k + 7m) has no non-negative integer solutions.     - (663) cannot be obtained as (663 = 332k + 7m) has no non-negative integer solutions.   - For ((a-1, b-1) = (662, 3)):     [     a = 662 + 1 = 663, quad b = 3 + 1 = 4     ]     This pair is invalid because 663 cannot be obtained as the final score.   - For ((a-1, b-1) = (993, 2)):     [     a = 993 + 1 = 994, quad b = 2 + 1 = 3     ]     This pair is invalid because 663 cannot be obtained as the final score.7.

After some trial and error, we can find a partition that meets the conditions of the problem, as shown in part a) of the figure.

Any number from 1 to 10 can appear. 11 cannot, because a rectangle of 22 squares cannot be cut from an 8 times 8 square. Any number larger than 11 cannot appear either, because then the sum of the other six different natural numbers could be at most 32-12=20, but 1+2+ldots+6=21.At least one of the numbers 8, 9, 10 must appear, because the sum of the first 7 natural numbers is only 28. The numbers 8 and 10, or 9 and 10, cannot appear together, because the sum of the other five different terms would have to be 14 or 13, which is not possible because 1+2+3+4+5=15. Depending on which of the numbers 8, 9, 10 appear, we have four possible cases:a) Only the 8 appears: 1+2+ldots+8=36, and we need to remove one of these to get a sum of 32. This can only be achieved by removing the 4. The resulting sequence is: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7,8.b) Only the 9 appears: Similarly, by removing the 5, we get the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9.c) Only the 10 appears: By removing the 6, we get the sequence 1,2,3,4,5,7,10.d) Both 8 and 9 appear. We need to remove two numbers from 1,2, ldots, 8,9 to reduce the sum by 45-32=13, but we must keep the 8 and 9. This can only be achieved by removing the 6 and 7, resulting in the sequence: 1,2,3,4,5,8,9.Thus, at most the four sequences listed above can correspond to the value p=7.

Then, based on the fact that the desired line is perpendicular to line CP, we can find the slope of the desired line as -dfrac{1}{{k}_{CP}} =1, which gives the equation of the desired line as (y+1=1cdot(x-2)), that is x-y-3=0,  Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"Find the length of the chord intercepted by the line x - sqrt{3}y - 4 = 0 and the circle x^2 + y^2 - 6x = 0.","solution":"The center of the circle x^2 + y^2 - 6x = 0 is (3, 0), and its radius r = 3.The distance d between the center (3, 0) and the line x - sqrt{3}y - 4 = 0 is given by:d = frac{|3 - sqrt{3}(0) - 4|}{sqrt{1 + (sqrt{3})^2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{1 + 3}} = frac{1}{2}Since the distance d < r, the line intersects the circle, and the length of the chord (L) can be found using the formula:L = 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2} = 2sqrt{3^2 - left(frac{1}{2}right)^2} = boxed{sqrt{35}}This problem tests your understanding of the relationship between a line and a circle.

Step 1: Parallel VectorsSince overrightarrow{c} is the projection of overrightarrow{a} on overrightarrow{b}, this implies that overrightarrow{b} is parallel to overrightarrow{c}. Therefore, we can express overrightarrow{b} as a scalar multiple of overrightarrow{c}:overrightarrow{b} = lambda overrightarrow{c}Given overrightarrow{c} = (2, 4), this leads to:overrightarrow{b} = lambda(2, 4) = (2lambda, 4lambda) Step 2: Difference of VectorsTo find the minimum value of |overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}|, we first calculate the vector difference:overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b} = (4, 3) - (2lambda, 4lambda) = (4 - 2lambda, 3 - 4lambda) Step 3: Magnitude of the Difference VectorNext, we find the square of the magnitude of overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}:|overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}|^2 = (4 - 2lambda)^2 + (3 - 4lambda)^2Simplifying, we get:= 4(2 - lambda)^2 + 9 + 16lambda^2 - 24lambda= 4(4 - 4lambda + lambda^2) + 9 + 16lambda^2 - 24lambda= 16 - 16lambda + 4lambda^2 + 9 + 16lambda^2 - 24lambda= 20lambda^2 - 40lambda + 25= 20(lambda^2 - 2lambda + 1) + 5= 20(lambda - 1)^2 + 5 Step 4: Finding the Minimum ValueThe expression 20(lambda - 1)^2 + 5 reaches its minimum when lambda - 1 = 0, i.e., lambda = 1.

In a right-angled triangle, the radius of the inscribed circle is equal to the length of the segment from the right-angle vertex to the point of tangency of the inscribed circle, which can be expressed using the semiperimeter s and the differences of the sides. In this case, the radius of the inscribed circle is s-c=12-10=2 mathrm{~cm}.We will prove that the radius r of the circumscribed circle, the radius varrho of the inscribed circle, and the side a uniquely determine the triangle. The side a already determines the angle alpha opposite to it in the circumscribed circle (Figure 2).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_fcc81336250b5bcacdb3g-2.jpg?height=469&width=564&top_left_y=443&top_left_x=759)Figure 2The angle at the center O of the inscribed circle, which is the intersection of the angle bisectors of beta and gamma, is 180^{circ}-frac{beta}{2}-frac{gamma}{2}=180^{circ}-frac{beta}{2}-frac{gamma}{2}-frac{alpha}{2}+frac{alpha}{2}=180^{circ}-90^{circ}+frac{alpha}{2}=90^{circ}+frac{alpha}{2}. Knowing alpha, we can construct the circle with a 90^{circ}+frac{alpha}{2} visual angle over the side a, on which the point O lies. The distance of the point O from the side is the given varrho, so the parallel line at a distance varrho from the side intersects the visual angle circle at two points. The angle bisectors can be drawn knowing the point O, and the sides of the triangle can be drawn with twice the angles.Since the parallel line can intersect the visual angle circle at two points, we can get two triangles. However, these two triangles are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of the side a, so they are congruent. Thus, we have indeed proven that a side, the radius of the inscribed circle, and the radius of the circumscribed circle uniquely determine a triangle.We have seen that when r=5 mathrm{~cm}, the value of varrho is 2 for the triangle with sides 6, 8, and 10 cm, thus proving that the triangle in question is right-angled.We have already calculated the sides.

Prove that with unlimited continuation of such movement, the point will move infinitely close to the contour of a uniquely determined limiting triangle. Construct this triangle and calculate the ratio of its area to the area of the original triangle A B C.","solution":"13. Let's try to construct a triangle (A_0 B_0 C_0) inside triangle (ABC) such that point (A_0) lies on the midpoint of ([A C_0]), point (B_0) on the midpoint of ([B A_0]), and point (C_0) on the midpoint of ([C B_0]). Suppose the required triangle is already constructed (see Fig. 41), and let (X = (A C) cap (A_0 B)), (Y = (A B) cap (B_0 C)), (Z = (B C) cap (C_0 A)). Applying Menelaus' theorem (see problem 16 from § 2) to triangle (A C C_0) and the transversal (X A_0 B_0), we get: ((A C X)(C C_0 B_0)(C_0 A A_0) = 1), i.e., (frac{overrightarrow{X A}}{overrightarrow{X C}} cdot frac{overrightarrow{B_0 C}}{overrightarrow{B_0 C_0}} cdot frac{overrightarrow{A_0 C_0}}{overrightarrow{A_0 A}} = 1). But (frac{overrightarrow{B_0 C}}{overrightarrow{B_0 C_0}} = 2), (frac{overrightarrow{A_0 C_0}}{overrightarrow{A_0 A}} = 1), so (frac{overrightarrow{X A}}{overrightarrow{X C}} = frac{1}{2}). Therefore, for point (X), we have: (2|X A| = |X C|) (analogously for points (Y) and (Z)); from this, the construction of triangle (A_0 B_0 C_0) follows.Now, take an arbitrary point (M) that moves towards point (A), turns halfway (at point (A_1)) and moves towards point (B), turns halfway (at point (B_1)) and moves towards point (C), turns halfway (at point (C_1)) and turns back towards point (A), and so on. By the property of the median of a triangle,[overrightarrow{A_1 A_0} = frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{M C_0}, quad overrightarrow{B_1 B_0} = frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{A_1 A_0} = frac{1}{4} overrightarrow{M C_0}, quad overrightarrow{C_1 C_0} = frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{B_1 B_0} = frac{1}{8} overrightarrow{M C_0}]and so on, i.e., the point moves closer and closer to the contour of triangle (A_0 B_0 C_0).Let the area of triangle (A_0 B_0 C_0) be (S_0), and the area of triangle (ABC) be (S). We have: ((S_{A A_0 B_0} = S_0 = S_{A B_0 B}) Rightarrow (S_{A A_0 B} = 2 S_0)). Similarly, (S_{B B_0 C} = 2 S_0) and (S_{C C_0 A} = 2 S_0).

Base Case:   - For ( n = 1 ):     Since ( f: mathbb{N} to mathbb{N} ), ( f(1) ) must be a natural number.      Using the multiplicative property ( f(mn) = f(m)f(n) ), we set ( m = n = 1 ):     [     f(1 cdot 1) = f(1)f(1) implies f(1) = f(1)^2     ]     This implies ( f(1) = 1 ) because the only natural number ( x ) such that ( x = x^2 ) is 1.2. Inductive Step:   - Assume ( f(k) = k ) for all ( k leq n ). We need to show that ( f(n+1) = n+1 ).   - Case 1: ( n+1 ) is a prime number.     - Since ( n+1 ) is prime, it cannot be factored into smaller natural numbers greater than 1. Therefore, we cannot directly use the multiplicative property. However, we know:       [       f(n) < f(n+1)       ]       By the inductive hypothesis, ( f(n) = n ). Thus:       [       n < f(n+1)       ]       Since ( f(n+1) ) must be a natural number greater than ( n ) and ( f ) is strictly increasing, the smallest possible value for ( f(n+1) ) is ( n+1 ). Hence:       [       f(n+1) = n+1       ]   - Case 2: ( n+1 ) is a composite number.     - Suppose ( n+1 = ab ) where ( a, b > 1 ). By the inductive hypothesis, ( f(a) = a ) and ( f(b) = b ). Using the multiplicative property:       [       f(n+1) = f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = ab = n+1       ]Since both cases confirm that ( f(n+1) = n+1 ), by induction, we have ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ f(n) = n } ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} )."},{"problem":"During the secondary school stage, it is the most important period for students' physical development.

After that, median moves to the third column and stays there until d_{i, 6}=0 (this may be no time at all, if d_{1,6}=d_{1,7}, but that will not affect the calculation). The contribution of those medians is D_{1,3}left(D_{1,7}-D_{1,6}right). Continuing this way we see that the medians in the second column contribute D_{1,2}left(D_{1,6}-D_{1,5}right) and ones in the first column D_{1,1}left(D_{1,5}-D_{1,4}right). A median then moves to the seventh column, but by that point its value has dropped, D_{i, 7}=D_{1,7}-10. The contribution of those medians is then left(D_{1,7}-10right)left(D_{1,4}-D_{1,3}right). Similarly for those in sixth and fifth columns we get left(D_{1,6}-10right)left(D_{1,3}-D_{1,2}right) and left(D_{1,5}-10right)left(D_{1,2}-D_{1,1}right). Finally the median moves to the fourth column again, staying there remaining D_{1,1} times, contributing left(D_{1,4}-10right) D_{1,1}. Overall, the sum of all medians is thusbegin{array}{r}D_{1,4}left(10-D_{1,7}right)+D_{1,3}left(D_{1,7}-D_{1,6}right)+D_{1,2}left(D_{1,6}-D_{1,5}right)+ D_{1,1}left(D_{1,5}-D_{1,4}right)+left(D_{1,7}-10right)left(D_{1,4}-D_{1,3}right)+left(D_{1,6}-10right)left(D_{1,3}-D_{1,2}right) +left(D_{1,5}-10right)left(D_{1,2}-D_{1,1}right)+left(D_{1,4}-10right) D_{1,1} .end{array}It is fairly easy to see that this expression is in fact equal to 0 (for example, by considering the linear and quadratic terms separately). This means that the sum of new medians M_{i} is zero, and the sum of the original m_{i} 's is 45 , as wanted,Solution 2: We will prove a stronger claim: for all a, the number of m_{i} 's equal to a equals the number of m_{i} 's equal to 9-a. (By a pairing argument, this implies that the average of the m_{i}^{prime} 's is 9 / 2.) Indeed, for 1 leq j leq 10 let M_{i, j} denote the j th smallest entry in row i of the table (so that m_{i}=M_{i, 4} ); we will show that for all a and j, the number of M_{i, j} 's equal to a equals the number of M_{i, 8-j} 's equal to 9-a.Henceforth, all row-indices are to be interpreted modulo 10 , and \\"between\\" is meant in the inclusive sense.It follows from the defining property of the table that for all i between 1 and 10 , all a between 0 and 9 , and all k between 0 and a, the number of k 's in row i equals the number of k+a 's in row i+a. Replacing a by 9-a, and summing over all k between 0 and a, we find that the number of entries between 0 and a in row i equals thenumber of entries between 9-a and 9 in row i+9-a. Hence for all j, the number of entries between 0 and a in row i is greater than or equal to j if and only if the number of entries between 9-a and 9 in row i+9-a is greater than or equal to j. But this means that the j smallest entries in row i are all between 0 and a if and only if the j largest entries in row i+9-a are all between 9-a and 9 . That is, M_{i, j} leq a if and only if M_{i+9-a, 8-j} geq 9-a. Replacing a by a-1, we see also that M_{i, j} leq a-1 if and only if M_{i+10-a, 8-j} geq 10-a. Combining the last two facts, we conclude that M_{i, j}=a if and only if M_{i+10-a, 8-j}=9-a. Summing over i (and noting that i+10-a varies over 0,1, ldots, 9 bmod 10 as i does), we see that the number of i 's with M_{i, j}=a equals the number of i 's with M_{i, 8-j}=9-a, as was claimed above."},{"problem":"15.

Notice that triangle{OMB} sim triangle{QOB} because both are right triangles, and angle{OBQ} cong angle{OBM}. By frac{MB}{BO}=frac{BO}{BQ}, MB = rleft(frac{r}{4.5}right) = frac{r^2}{4.5}. However, since O is the circumcenter of triangle ABC, OM is a perpendicular bisector by the definition of a circumcenter. Hence, frac{r^2}{4.5} = 2 implies r = 3.

Using Power of a Point on Q relative to circle O, we get that x(x+2r) = 0.5 cdot 4.5 = frac{9}{4}. Using Pythagorean Theorem on triangle QOB to get (x + r)^2 + r^2 = frac{81}{4}. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get that 2r^2 = 18 and therefore r = 3. Now, set cos{ABC} = y. Using law of cosines on ABC to find AC in terms of y and plugging that into the extended law of sines, we get frac{sqrt{4^2 + 5^2 - 2 cdot 4 cdot 5 x}}{sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2R = 6. Squaring both sides and cross multiplying, we get 36x^2 - 40x + 5 = 0. Now, we get x = frac{10 pm sqrt{55}}{18} using quadratic formula. If you drew a decent diagram, B is acute and therefore x = frac{10 + sqrt{55}}{18}(You can also try plugging in both in the end and seeing which gives a rational solution). Note that BP = 3frac{1}{sin{OPB}} = frac{3}{cos{angle ABC - angle QBO}}. Using the cosine addition formula and then plugging in what we know about QBO, we get that BP = frac{162}{2cos{B} + sqrt{5}sin{B}}. Now, the hard part is to find what sin{B} is. We therefore want frac{sqrt{324 - (10 + sqrt{55})^2}}{18} = frac{sqrt{169 - 20sqrt{55}}}{18}. For the numerator, by inspection (a + bsqrt{55})^2 will not work for integers a and b. The other case is if there is (asqrt{5} + bsqrt{11})^2. By inspection, 5sqrt{5} - 2sqrt{11} works. Therefore, plugging all this in yields the answer, frac{18}{5} rightarrow boxed{23}.

Given that 6 lines can form C_{0}^{2}=15 pairs of lines, and 15-3=7, we know that the number of mutually perpendicular lines does not exceed 7.(3) 7 pairs are impossible.If otherwise, there are 7 pairs of perpendicular lines, and since there are only 3 pairs of skew lines, at least 4 pairs of perpendicular lines must be coplanar, meaning all 4 faces of the tetrahedron must be right-angled triangles (yielding 4 pairs). Furthermore, the 3 pairs of skew lines must also be perpendicular. In this case, the projection of one vertex of the tetrahedron onto the opposite face must be the orthocenter of that triangle, and the orthocenter of a right-angled triangle is the right-angle vertex. Therefore, one lateral edge of the tetrahedron is perpendicular to the base, and the foot of the perpendicular is the vertex of the right-angled triangle (in Figure 11, V A perp plane A B C).

Therefore, on the left side of (1), the absolute value of each factor is at least 2, so for equality, |4 x|=|y|=1 is necessary, as well as the requirement that the signs of the two factors on the left side of (1) be the same.From this, two solutions arise: from 4 x=y=1, we get x=frac{1}{4} and y=1, and from 4 x=y=-1, we get x=-frac{1}{4} and y=-1. It can be seen that both pairs of numbers are solutions to the problem.II. solution.

We obtain solutions for y precisely when D(y)=0, that is,frac{y^{2}-1}{2left(y^{2}+1right)}=0which holds precisely when y= pm 1. If y=1, then according to (3),x^{2}-frac{x}{2}+frac{1}{16}=left(x-frac{1}{4}right)^{2}=0, quad x=frac{1}{4}while if y=-1,x^{2}+frac{x}{2}+frac{1}{16}=left(x+frac{1}{4}right)^{2}=0 quad x=-frac{1}{4}Thus, the equation has two solutions: the pairs left(frac{1}{4} ; 1right) and left(-frac{1}{4} ;-1right).Remarks. 1.

The two-variable polynomial (2) can also be factored into a sum of two squares in a different way; it is easily verified thatleft(16 x^{2}+1right)left(y^{2}+1right)-16 x y=(4 x y-1)^{2}+(4 x-y)^{2}From this form, we can also arrive at the solution, since the sum of the squares of two real numbers is zero precisely when both numbers are zero."},{"problem":"13 cdot 41 Given that there are 64 light bulbs on the signal panel, each controlled by 64 buttons.

Rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form:   [   x^2 sqrt{1+2y^2} + y^2 sqrt{1+2x^2} geq xy (x+y+sqrt{2})   ]2.

Compare with the right-hand side (RHS):   We need to show that:   [   x^2 + y^2 geq xy (x+y+sqrt{2})   ]   Using the AM-GM inequality again, we know:   [   x^2 + y^2 geq 2xy   ]   Therefore, it suffices to show that:   [   2xy geq xy (x+y+sqrt{2})   ]   Dividing both sides by (xy) (assuming (xy neq 0)), we get:   [   2 geq x + y + sqrt{2}   ]   This inequality does not hold for all real (x) and (y).

Since 1000 = ( 2^3 times 5^3 ), ( P ) must be divisible by both ( 2^3 ) and ( 5^3 ).3. For ( P ) to be divisible by ( 5^3 = 125 ), ( underline{A}underline{B}underline{C} ) must be divisible by 125. This is because ( underline{A}underline{B} ) and ( underline{A} ) are both less than 125 and cannot contribute to the ( 5^3 ) factor.4. The only 3-digit numbers divisible by 125 are 125, 250, 375, 500, 625, 750, and 875. However, since ( A, B, ) and ( C ) must be nonzero, we can eliminate 125, 250, 500, and 750.5. This leaves us with 375, 625, and 875.6. Next, we need ( P ) to be divisible by ( 2^3 = 8 ). This means ( underline{A}underline{B}underline{C} times underline{A}underline{B} times underline{A} ) must be divisible by 8.7. Since ( underline{A}underline{B}underline{C} ) is already divisible by 125, we need to check if ( underline{A} ) is divisible by 8.8. Among the remaining candidates, only 875 has ( A = 8 ), which is divisible by 8.9.

This is a deterministic relationship since knowing the value of the side length determines the area precisely, without any uncertainty.- Options B, C, and D, on the other hand, represent relationships that involve variability and uncertainty. The rice yield does not solely depend on the amount of fertilizer; it could also be influenced by other factors like weather conditions, quality of seeds, and farming techniques. Hence, this is a correlation rather than a function.  - Similarly, the occurrence rate of traffic accidents might be influenced by snowfall along with other factors such as road conditions, visibility, and traffic density. Thus, it's a correlational relationship.- The relationship between a person's height and weight is also correlational. While there might be a tendency for taller individuals to weigh more, there are many exceptions owing to factors such as body composition, genetics, and lifestyle.Therefore, only option A demonstrates a functional relationship, rather than a correlational one, and is the correct answer.[boxed{A}]"},{"problem":"Four.

To find the points where (sin x = cos x), we solve the equation:   [   sin x = cos x   ]   Dividing both sides by (cos x) (assuming (cos x neq 0)), we get:   [   tan x = 1   ]   The general solution to (tan x = 1) is:   [   x = frac{pi}{4} + npi quad text{for integer } n   ]4. We need to find the values of ( x ) in the interval ((-2pi, 2pi)). We list the values of ( x ) that satisfy ( x = frac{pi}{4} + npi ) within this interval:   [   begin{aligned}   &text{For } n = -3, quad x = frac{pi}{4} - 3pi = -frac{11pi}{4} quad (text{not in the interval})    &text{For } n = -2, quad x = frac{pi}{4} - 2pi = -frac{7pi}{4}    &text{For } n = -1, quad x = frac{pi}{4} - pi = -frac{3pi}{4}    &text{For } n = 0, quad x = frac{pi}{4}    &text{For } n = 1, quad x = frac{pi}{4} + pi = frac{5pi}{4}    &text{For } n = 2, quad x = frac{pi}{4} + 2pi = frac{9pi}{4} quad (text{not in the interval})   end{aligned}   ]5. Therefore, the points in the interval ((-2pi, 2pi)) where (sin x = cos x) are:   [   -frac{7pi}{4}, -frac{3pi}{4}, frac{pi}{4}, frac{5pi}{4}   ]6. At these points, the function ( f(x) ) switches between (sin x) and (cos x), causing ( f(x) ) to be non-differentiable. Thus, there are 4 points in the interval ((-2pi, 2pi)) where ( f(x) ) is not differentiable.The final answer is (boxed{4})"},{"problem":"Given the lines l_1: x- sqrt{3}y+1=0 and l_2: x+ty+1=0, if the angle between l_1 and l_2 is 60^circ, then t= ______.","solution":"The slope of line l_1 is frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, and the slope of line l_2 is -frac{1}{t}.Using the formula for the angle between two lines, we have tan 60^circ = left| frac{frac{sqrt{3}}{3} - (-frac{1}{t})}{1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{3} times (-frac{1}{t})} right| = sqrt{3}.Solving this equation, we find t=0 or t=sqrt{3}.Therefore, the answer is: t=0 or t=sqrt{3}.This problem mainly tests the application of the formula for the angle between two lines and is considered a medium difficulty question.boxed{t=0 text{ or } t=sqrt{3}}"},{"problem":"Given that f(x) is a function defined on the set of positive integers, for any k in the domain, if f(k) geq k^2 holds, then f(k+1) geq (k+1)^2 also holds.

This leads to the condition that the quadratic expression k{x}^{2}-4x+3 must be greater than or equal to 0 for all x in mathbb{R}.1. Condition for a Quadratic Equation to be Non-negative: For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c geq 0 to hold for all x in mathbb{R}, two conditions must be met:   - The leading coefficient a > 0 to ensure the parabola opens upwards.   - The discriminant b^2 - 4ac leq 0 to ensure the equation has at most one real root, meaning it does not cross the x-axis more than once.2. Applying Conditions to the Given Function:   - For f(x)=sqrt{k{x}^{2}-4x+3}, comparing it to the standard form ax^2 + bx + c, we have a = k, b = -4, and c = 3.   - The first condition, a = k > 0, ensures the parabola opens upwards.3.

Construct a potential solution:   Consider the set ( A ) formed by taking every fourth number starting from 1:   [   A = {1, 5, 9, 13, ldots, 2017}   ]   This set can be written as:   [   A = {4k + 1 mid k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 504}   ]   The number of elements in this set is:   [   |A| = 505   ]3. Verify the construction:   For any two elements ( 4a + 1 ) and ( 4b + 1 ) in ( A ), the difference is:   [   (4a + 1) - (4b + 1) = 4(a - b)   ]   Since ( a ) and ( b ) are integers, ( 4(a - b) ) is always a multiple of 4. The only prime number that is a multiple of 4 is 2, but 2 is not a multiple of 4. Therefore, the difference between any two elements in ( A ) is not a prime number.4. Consider the possibility of a larger set:   Assume ( |A| > 505 ). We will use the pigeonhole principle to show a contradiction.

The formula for the axis of symmetry is x = -frac{b}{2a} for a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. For our equation, b = -4a, so the axis of symmetry is:x = -frac{-4a}{2a} = frac{4a}{2a} = 2Given that a > 0, the parabola opens upwards. This means that the vertex of the parabola is the lowest point on the graph.Now, considering the distances from the axis of symmetry to the points A, B, C, and D, we have:- Distance from A to the axis of symmetry: 2 - (-2) = 4- Distance from D to the axis of symmetry: 5 - 2 = 3- Distance from B to the axis of symmetry: 2 - 0 = 2- Distance from C to the axis of symmetry: 3 - 2 = 1Since the parabola opens upwards and the vertex is the lowest point, the values of y increase as we move away from the vertex along the parabola.

This option is correct.  - Option D: If y_{3}y_{4} < 0, then y_{1}y_{2} < 0.

Therefore, Proposition B is true and does not meet the criteria for the false proposition.- Proposition C: An infinite non-repeating decimal is also called an irrational number, and sqrt{12} is an irrational number. This statement is true because an infinite non-repeating decimal cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, defining it as an irrational number.

Then, we will use the range of B and the properties of the sine function to determine the range of c-b.[Solution]Since C-B=frac{π}{2},C=B+frac{π}{2}, and A=π-B-C=frac{π}{2}-2B,therefore sin A = cos 2B, and sin C = cos B.As A=frac{π}{2}-2B>0, we have 0<B<frac{π}{4}.Applying the sine law, we get frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C},therefore b=frac{asin B}{sin A} = frac{sin B}{cos 2B}, and c=frac{asin C}{sin A} = frac{cos B}{cos 2B},therefore c-b = frac{cos B - sin B}{cos 2B} = frac{cos B - sin B}{cos^2 B - sin^2 B} = frac{1}{cos B + sin B} = frac{1}{sqrt{2} sin(B+frac{π}{4})},Given 0<B<frac{π}{4}, therefore frac{π}{4}<B+frac{π}{4}<frac{π}{2},therefore 1 < sqrt{2} sin(B+frac{π}{4}) < sqrt{2},therefore frac{sqrt{2}}{2} < frac{1}{sqrt{2} sin(B+frac{π}{4})} < 1.Therefore, the answer is boxed{(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, 1)}."},{"problem":"Let mathcal{F} be a family of subsets of {1,2,ldots, 2017} with the following property: if S_1 and S_2 are two elements of mathcal{F} with S_1subsetneq S_2, then |S_2setminus S_1| is odd. Compute the largest number of subsets mathcal{F} may contain.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given a family of subsets mathcal{F} of the set {1, 2, ldots, 2017} with the property that if S_1 and S_2 are two elements of mathcal{F} with S_1 subsetneq S_2, then |S_2 setminus S_1| is odd. We need to find the largest possible size of mathcal{F}.2. Key Insight:   The condition |S_2 setminus S_1| being odd implies that the difference in the sizes of S_1 and S_2 is odd. This means that if S_1 and S_2 are in mathcal{F} and S_1 subsetneq S_2, then |S_2| - |S_1| is odd.3. No Three Nested Subsets:   It is clear that there cannot exist A subsetneq B subsetneq C in mathcal{F} because if |B| - |A| and |C| - |B| are both odd, then |C| - |A| would be even, contradicting the given condition.4. Applying the LYM Inequality:   The LYM (Lubell-Yamamoto-Meshalkin) inequality states that for any antichain mathcal{A} in the Boolean lattice of subsets of an n-element set,   [   sum_{A in mathcal{A}} binom{n}{|A|}^{-1} le 1.   ]   However, in our case, we need to modify this to account for the given condition. We consider the sum:   [   sum_{S in mathcal{F}} binom{2017}{|S|}^{-1}.   ]   Given the condition on the sizes of the subsets, we can show that:   [   sum_{S in mathcal{F}} binom{2017}{|S|}^{-1} le 2.   ]5. Maximizing the Size of mathcal{F}:   To achieve equality, we need to consider subsets of sizes that differ by exactly one. The largest possible family mathcal{F} that satisfies the condition is one that contains all subsets of size 1008 and all subsets of size 1009. This is because:   [   sum_{|S| = 1008} binom{2017}{1008}^{-1} + sum_{|S| = 1009} binom{2017}{1009}^{-1} = 1 + 1 = 2.   ]6. Calculating the Size of mathcal{F}:   The number of 1008-subsets of {1, ldots, 2017} is binom{2017}{1008}, and the number of 1009-subsets is also binom{2017}{1008} (since binom{2017}{1008} = binom{2017}{1009} by symmetry of binomial coefficients). Therefore, the total number of subsets in mathcal{F} is:   [   |mathcal{F}| = binom{2017}{1008} + binom{2017}{1009} = 2 binom{2017}{1008}.   ]The final answer is boxed{2 binom{2017}{1008}}."},{"problem":"6.

However, since the slope of a line can be expressed as -frac{A}{B} when the line has an equation in the form Ax + By + C = 0 (where A and B are not both zero), the slope of our perpendicular line should be frac{1}{-2} or -frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the equation of the perpendicular line can be written as x - 2y + c = 0.

Therefore, it is impossible for Chernomor to receive 32 coins.a) We will show how to get 31 coins. For example, Chernomor divides the bogatyrs into two detachments: the first with 32 bogatyrs, and the second with only one. He can give the first detachment 63 coins (from which he will receive 31), and the remaining 177 coins to the single bogatyr in the second detachment.b) To receive 31 coins, Chernomor must divide the bogatyrs into two detachments and give each detachment 120 coins. In this case, from a detachment of N people, he should receive N-1 coins. This means that 121 must be divisible by N. However, 121 is only divisible by 1, 11, and 121, and it is impossible to sum two such numbers to 33. Therefore, it is impossible for Chernomor to receive 31 coins.However, it is possible to receive 30 coins. For example, form one detachment of 27 bogatyrs and two detachments of 3 bogatyrs each.

Basilio names one digit \\"1\\" or \\"2\\" (he knows no others), and Alyosha writes the named digit in any free cell of any banknote and shows the result to Basilio. When all cells are filled, Basilio takes as many banknotes with different numbers as possible (from several with the same number, he takes only one), and the rest go to Alyosha. What is the maximum number of banknotes Basilio can get, no matter how Alyosha acts?## SolutionBasilio can always get two banknotes: he knows the position where the last digit should be written and names it so that it differs from the digit in the same position on some other banknote. Then the numbers on these two banknotes will be different, and the cat will be able to take them.We will show how Alyosha can ensure that there are no more than two different numbers. She arranges the banknotes one above the other so that the cells for digits form a table.When the cat names a \\"1\\", Alyosha writes it in the leftmost column with a free cell (in any of the cells), and when the cat names a \\"2\\" - in the rightmost column.If a column starts to receive both ones and twos, then all other columns are already filled: on the left with ones, on the right with twos. Therefore, there will be at most one column where both ones and twos will be written.Thus, if the numbers differ, they will differ only by the digit in this column.

But if we increase the number of odd any further we must decrease the total number (replacing 54 by 71 is an increase of 17). If we replace 4 even numbers we cannot replace them by 3 odd numbers (71 + 73 + 75 - 54 - 52 - 50 - 48 = 15 > 6). So this is the best we can do. To get a total actually equal to 1987 just increase one of the odd numbers by 6, eg 75 instead of 69. That gives 4·35 + 3·27 = 221. The argument that 221 is optimal is perhaps not entirely convincing. So suppose we have m odd numbers and n even numbers. The total of the odd numbers cannot be less than the sum of the first m odd numbers which is m 2 and the sum of the even numbers cannot be less than the sum of the first n even numbers which is n(n+1). So we must show that if 4m + 3n >= 222, then m 2 + n(n+1) > 1987.

Points A and B are connected by two roads: one is 19 km long, and the other is 12 km long. At 12:00, a pedestrian left point A on the longer road and walked the first 11 km at a constant speed, and then, getting tired, walked the remaining distance to point B at an average speed 1.5 km/h slower. At 14:00, a second pedestrian left point A on the shorter road and walked the entire distance at an average speed 0.5 km/h faster than the first pedestrian initially. What was the average speed of the first pedestrian for the last 8 km of the journey, if it is known that he arrived at point B no earlier than the second pedestrian?Brief solution. If ( x ) is the required average speed of the first pedestrian (in km/h) on the second part of the journey, then ( x+1.5 ) is his speed on the first part, and ( (x+1.5)+0.5 = x+2 ) is the average speed of the second pedestrian. Then, by calculating the time each pedestrian spent on the journey, we obtain the required inequality. Since by the problem's condition ( x > 0 ), both sides of the inequality can be multiplied by the quantity ( x(x+1.5)(x+2) > 0 ), then we get ( 11x(x+2) + 8(x+1.5)(x+2) geqslant 12x(x+1.5) + 2x(x+1.5)(x+2) ), or, after transformations, ( (x-4)(x+1)(x+3) leqslant 0 ).

We start with the given inequality:   [   9(ab + bc + ca)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) geq (a + b + c)^4   ]   for (a, b, c in left[frac{1}{p}, pright]).2. Rewrite the inequality in an equivalent form:   [   frac{3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}{(a + b + c)^2} geq frac{(a + b + c)^2}{3(ab + bc + ca)}   ]   This can be simplified by subtracting 1 from both sides:   [   frac{3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}{(a + b + c)^2} - 1 geq frac{(a + b + c)^2}{3(ab + bc + ca)} - 1   ]   Further simplification gives:   [   frac{2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca)}{(a + b + c)^2} geq frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca}{3(ab + bc + ca)}   ]   Multiplying both sides by (3(ab + bc + ca)) and ((a + b + c)^2), we get:   [   4(ab + bc + ca) geq a^2 + b^2 + c^2   ]3. To find the largest (p), we test the boundary values. Let (c = p) and (a = b = frac{1}{p}):   [   4left(frac{1}{p^2} + 2right) geq frac{2}{p^2} + p^2   ]   Simplifying the left-hand side:   [   4left(frac{1}{p^2} + 2right) = frac{4}{p^2} + 8   ]   Thus, the inequality becomes:   [   frac{4}{p^2} + 8 geq frac{2}{p^2} + p^2   ]   Rearranging terms:   [   frac{4}{p^2} - frac{2}{p^2} + 8 - p^2 geq 0   ]   Simplifying further:   [   frac{2}{p^2} + 8 - p^2 geq 0   ]   Multiplying by (p^2) to clear the fraction:   [   2 + 8p^2 - p^4 geq 0   ]   Rearranging terms:   [   p^4 - 8p^2 - 2 leq 0   ]4. To solve the inequality (p^4 - 8p^2 - 2 leq 0), let (x = p^2). Then the inequality becomes:   [   x^2 - 8x - 2 leq 0   ]   Solving the quadratic equation (x^2 - 8x - 2 = 0) using the quadratic formula (x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}):   [   x = frac{8 pm sqrt{64 + 8}}{2} = frac{8 pm sqrt{72}}{2} = frac{8 pm 6sqrt{2}}{2} = 4 pm 3sqrt{2}   ]   Therefore, the roots are (x = 4 + 3sqrt{2}) and (x = 4 - 3sqrt{2}).5. Since (x = p^2) and (x) must be positive, we take the positive root:   [   p^2 leq 4 + 3sqrt{2}   ]   Thus:   [   p leq sqrt{4 + 3sqrt{2}}   ]6. We will show that (p = sqrt{4 + 3sqrt{2}}) satisfies the inequality. Let:   [   f(a, b, c) = 4(ab + bc + ca) - a^2 - b^2 - c^2   ]   and let:   [   t = sqrt{(a + b)(a + c)} - a   ]   Without loss of generality, assume (c) is the largest. It is easy to prove that (f(a, b, c) geq f(t, t, c)).7. Consider:   [   f(t, t, c) - f(tk, tk, frac{c}{k}) = 2t^2 - 2t^2k^2 - c^2 + frac{c^2}{k^2} = 2t^2(1 - k^2) + frac{c^2}{k^2}(1 - k^2) = left(2t^2 + frac{c^2}{k^2}right)(1 - k^2)   ]   For (k leq 1), the above inequality is (geq 0). This means if (c) is larger and (a, b) are smaller, the minimum is attained.8.

We will prove that to a 9-digit number a, less than 888 888, all digits of which are even, one can add a number not exceeding 111112 so that all its digits will again be even. If among the digits of the number a, except for the first one, there is a digit less than 8, then it can be increased by 2. Otherwise, the number has the form A 88888. Since A<8, one can add 111112 to it, and the result will be (A+2) 00000. If, however, a=888 888, then all larger 6-digit numbers contain an odd digit, so there cannot be a suitable number b among them.Example. It remains to check that the difference 111112 is possible. The reasoning from the estimation suggests that examples could be the numbers a=288888 and b=400 000.

Assume ( n ) is a large prime:   - Let ( n ) be a large prime number. Then ( d(n) = n ) because the largest prime divisor of a prime number is the number itself.   - Substituting ( n ) into the given equation, we get:     [ P(n + n) = P(2n) = n + d(P(n)) ]   - Since ( P(n) ) is a polynomial, for large ( n ), ( P(n) ) will be dominated by its leading term ( a_k n^k ). Therefore, ( d(P(n)) ) will be the largest prime divisor of ( a_k n^k ), which is at most ( a_k n ).2. Compare growth rates:   - The left-hand side ( P(2n) ) grows like ( a_k (2n)^k ).   - The right-hand side ( n + d(P(n)) ) grows at most like ( n + a_k n^k ).   - For the two sides to be equal for large ( n ), the growth rates must match, implying ( k = 1 ). Therefore, ( P(n) ) must be a linear polynomial:     [ P(n) = an + b ]   - Here, ( a ) is a positive integer (since the leading coefficient must be positive) and ( b ) is an integer.3. Substitute ( P(n) = an + b ) into the equation:   - The given equation becomes:     [ a(n + d(n)) + b = n + d(an + b) ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [ an + a d(n) + b = n + d(an + b) ]4. Analyze the equation for large primes:   - For large prime ( n ), ( d(n) = n ), so:     [ an + an + b = n + d(an + b) ]     [ 2an + b = n + d(an + b) ]   - Since ( d(an + b) le an + b ), we have:     [ 2an + b le n + an + b ]     [ an le n ]   - This implies ( a = 1 ).5. Simplify further:   - With ( a = 1 ), the polynomial becomes:     [ P(n) = n + b ]   - Substituting back into the equation, we get:     [ n + d(n) + b = n + d(n + b) ]     [ d(n) + b = d(n + b) ]6. Check possible values of ( b ):   - If ( b ge 2 ):     - Set ( n = b ), then:       [ d(b) + b = d(2b) ]       - Since ( d(2b) le b ), this implies ( d(b) le 0 ), which is a contradiction.   - If ( b = 1 ):     - Set ( n = 3 ), then:       [ d(3) + 1 = d(4) ]       - This is a contradiction since ( d(3) = 3 ) and ( d(4) = 2 ).   - If ( b = -1 ):     - Set ( n = 5 ), then:       [ d(5) - 1 = d(4) ]       - This is a contradiction since ( d(5) = 5 ) and ( d(4) = 2 ).   - If ( b le -2 ):     - Set ( n = 2|b| ), then:       [ d(2|b|) = d(|b|) - b ]       - The left-hand side is at most ( |b| ), implying ( d(|b|) le 0 ), which is a contradiction.7.

For a given k, to construct a Dyck path of length 2 n, it is necessary and sufficient to construct one of length 2 k, then go up, then construct a Dyck path of length 2(n-k-1) that does not touch the x-axis, and then go down one step (on the image, the dotted lines should be replaced by Dyck paths).

However, we will seek a more direct method to obtain C_{n}. Consider the function f as follows: consider a path that is not a Dyck path but ends at (2 n, 0). Let 2 k + 1 be the smallest abscissa where the path is below the x-axis. The function f associates with this path the path symmetric with respect to the x-axis between the abscissas 0 and 2 k + 1, followed by the same path translated 2 units upwards (as illustrated below for n=14 on a particular path).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_bca2b404556ff27bef16g-65.jpg?height=429&width=1514&top_left_y=2084&top_left_x=271)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_bca2b404556ff27bef16g-66.jpg?height=623&width=1516&top_left_y=171&top_left_x=264)We verify that this function is indeed a bijection between the paths ending at (2 n, 0) that are not Dyck paths and the paths ending at (2 n, 2), by constructing the inverse of f.

Initial Analysis:   We start by analyzing the expression ( x_i^2 - x_i x_j ). We can factor this as:   [   x_i^2 - x_i x_j = x_i (x_i - x_j)   ]   For this product to not be divisible by ( 1111 ), neither ( x_i ) nor ( x_i - x_j ) can be divisible by ( 1111 ).3.

We can factorize ( 1111 ) as:   [   1111 = 11 times 101   ]   Therefore, we need to consider the properties of the numbers modulo ( 11 ) and ( 101 ).4. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):   By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can consider the problem modulo ( 11 ) and ( 101 ) separately and then combine the results.5.

Given that f(-x) = f(x), we infer that f(x) is an even function. This property will help us understand the behavior of f(x) across the entire real number line.2. Next, we're told that frac{{f(x_{1}) - f(x_{2})}}{{x_{1} - x_{2}}} > 0 for x_{1}, x_{2} in [0, +infty). This indicates that f(x) is increasing in the interval (0, +infty). Since f(x) is even, it's also decreasing in (-infty, 0).3. For x in [frac{1}{2}, 1], we have x-2 in [-frac{3}{2}, -1]. Given that f(x) is decreasing in (-infty, 0), we conclude that f(x-2) geq f(1) for x in this range.4. The inequality f(ax+1) leq f(x-2), combined with the previous step, implies that f(ax+1) leq f(1). Since f(x) is increasing for positive x and decreasing for negative x, the condition f(ax+1) leq f(1) means that |ax+1| leq 1 must be satisfied for x in [frac{1}{2}, 1].5. The inequality -1 leq ax+1 leq 1 can be simplified further to determine the range of a. Splitting it, we get:   - From ax+1 leq 1, subtracting 1 from both sides gives ax leq 0.   - From -1 leq ax+1, subtracting 1 and then dividing by x (which is positive in our interval) yields -frac{2}{x} leq a.6. The condition -frac{2}{x} leq a leq 0 holds for x in [frac{1}{2}, 1]. The maximum value of -frac{2}{x} in this interval occurs at the lowest value of x, which is frac{1}{2}. Substituting this into the expression gives -frac{2}{frac{1}{2}} = -4, which incorrectly suggests a contradiction with the given solution. The correct approach is to recognize that the maximum constraint on a should indeed align with ensuring the conditions are satisfied for all x in the given domain, leading us to reevaluate this step. The correct interpretation should maintain consistency with the original solution statement:   - The correct evaluation should consider the behavior of -frac{2}{x} over the interval and its impact on the range of a. Given the error in the previous calculation, let's correctly state that for x in [frac{1}{2}, 1], the constraint -frac{2}{x} leq a effectively means we are looking for the broadest range of a that satisfies the inequality for the entire interval of x.7. When x=frac{1}{2}, -frac{2}{x} = -4, which does not directly restrict a in the context provided. The correct interpretation of the solution, focusing on the provided steps and conclusion, should consider the conditions for a based on f(ax+1) leq f(x-2) leading to -2 leq a leq 0 after correctly applying the function's properties and the given inequalities.So, after walking through and clarifying each step according to the original solution's logic and correcting the misinterpretation in step 6:- The range of the real number a that satisfies all the given conditions is [-2, 0].Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"Edward's formula for the stock market predicts correctly that the price of HMMT is directly proportional to a secret quantity  x and inversely proportional to  y, the number of hours he slept the night before.

But the number ((13p + r)^5 = frac{(13p + r)(13p + r) ldots (13p + r)}{5 text{ factors}}) gives the same remainder as the number (r^5) when divided by 13; therefore, it is sufficient to limit ourselves to the values (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ldots, 12). Further, if the number (n) is equal to (or gives a remainder of) (s) when divided by 13, and the number (n^2) gives a remainder of (t) when divided by 13, then the number (n^5 = n^2 cdot n^2 cdot n) gives the same remainder as the product (t cdot t cdot s) when divided by 13—this fact can simplify the creation of the required table for the values (n = 4, 5, 6). Finally, note that if the number (n^5) gives a remainder of (u) when divided by 13, then the number ((13 - n)^5 = underbrace{(13 - n)(13 - n) ldots (13 - n)}) gives the same remainder as the number ((-n)^5), i.e., the remainder -u, or (13 - u).Now we can create our table:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_b937612abb2773f7abffg-128.jpg?height=648&width=971&top_left_y=176&top_left_x=52)(The remainders corresponding to the values (n = 7, 8, ldots, 12) are written based on the fact that the numbers (n^5) and ((13 - n)^5) give \\"complementary\\" remainders (u) and (-u).) After the value (n = 12) in our table, the same remainders (0, 1, 6, -4, -3, 5, 2, -2, -5, 3, 4, -6, -1) will \\"periodically\\" repeat.Since the first table has a \\"period\\" of 4, and the second has a \\"period\\" of 13, the value (4 cdot 13 = 52) is the \\"period\\" of the combination of both tables: increasing (n) by 52 (or any multiple of 52) does not change the remainders of the division by 13 of both numbers (5^n) and (n^5). Further, we are only interested in those columns of the second table that correspond to remainders (pm 1) and (pm 5) (since in the first table, only the remainders (1, 5, -1, -5) alternate). But within the range from (n = 0) to (n = 51), the remainder 1 in the second table corresponds to the values (n = 1, 1 + 13 = 14), (1 + 2 cdot 13 = 27), and (1 + 3 cdot 13 = 40); of these four numbers, only 14 has the form (4x + 2), which in the first table corresponds to the remainder -1; thus, the number (n = 14) satisfies the required condition ((5^{14} + 14^5) is divisible by 13). Similarly, the remainder -1 in the second table within the same range corresponds to the values (n = 12, 12 + 13 = 25), (12 + 2 cdot 13 = 38), and (12 + 3 cdot 13 = 51); of these numbers, only 12 has the form (4y), which in the first table leads to the remainder 1. Similarly, the remainder 5 in the second table corresponds to the values (n = 5, 5 + 13 = 18), (5 + 2 cdot 13 = 31), and (5 + 3 cdot 13 = 44), and the remainder -5 to the values (n = 8, 8 + 13 = 21), (8 + 2 cdot 13 = 34), and (8 + 3 cdot 13 = 47); but of the first four numbers, only 31 has the form (4z + 3), ensuring a remainder of -5 from the division of (5^{31}) by 13, and of the last four numbers, only 21 has the form (4tau + 1), ensuring a remainder of 5 from the division of (5^{21}) by 13. Thus, within the range (0 leq n leq 52), the required condition is satisfied by the following four natural numbers: (n = 12, 14), 21, and 31; the entire set of natural numbers satisfying the condition of the problem consists of the following four \\"series\\" of numbers:[begin{gathered}n = 52m + 12, quad n = 52m + 14 text{ (i.e., } n = 26(2m) + 12 quad n = 26(2m + 1) - 12)end{gathered}][n = 52m + 21 quad text{and} quad n = 52m + 31 text{ (i.e., } n = 52m pm 21 text{);}]here (m = 0, 1, 2, ldots) (and in the formula (n = 52m - 21) we must have (m > 0)).Clearly, the smallest (n) that satisfies the conditions of the problem is (n = 12)."},{"problem":"Given the complex number z satisfies (1-i)z=i, the corresponding point of the complex number bar{z} in the complex plane is located in (　　)A: The first quadrantB: The second quadrantC: The third quadrantD: The fourth quadrant","solution":"We start by solving the complex equation (1-i)z=i.

In fact, it is required that the fourth powers of all prime numbers greater than 10 give the same remainder when divided by n. Indeed, if the fourth powers of some two numbers give different remainders, then one can take n-1 of the first number and one of the second, then the sum of the fourth powers of these numbers will not be divisible by n.We will prove that the fourth power of any prime number p, greater than 10, when divided by 3, 5, and 16, gives a remainder of 1, then it will also give a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 cdot 5 cdot 16=240. We will use the fact that p^{4}-1=left(p^{2}-1right)left(p^{2}+1right)=(p-1)(p+1)left(p^{2}+1right).Since p is not divisible by three, either p-1 or p+1 is divisible by 3.Consider the remainders of p when divided by 5. If the remainder is 1, then p-1 is divisible by 5; if the remainder is 4, then p+1 is divisible by 5; and if the remainder is 2 or 3, then p^{2}+1 is divisible by 5.Since p is odd, each of the factors p-1, p+1, and p^{2}+1 is even. Moreover, one of the numbers p-1 or p+1 is divisible by 4, so the product of these three factors is divisible by 16.It remains to show that if a number is greater than 240, it does not satisfy the condition. Note that the difference of the fourth powers of any prime numbers greater than 10 must be divisible by n.

If p is a prime divisor of s then p divides a ; p divides b and p divides a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}. Hence p divides c^{3} and so p divides c. This is a contradiction to operatorname{gcd}(a, b, c)=1.

Here, ( leftlfloor x rightrfloor ) denotes the floor function, which gives the largest integer less than or equal to ( x ).2. Analyzing the Summand:   Consider the term ( leftlfloor frac{n + 2^{k-1}}{2^k} rightrfloor ). For large ( k ), specifically when ( 2^k > n + 2^{k-1} ), the term ( frac{n + 2^{k-1}}{2^k} ) becomes less than 1, and thus its floor value is 0.

Let ( t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 ) be the times (in hours) that you spend on the essays, respectively. Since there are 4 hours and 5 minutes until class, and you want each essay to actually give you points, the ( t_i ) are multiples of ( frac{1}{2} ), and they sum to 4 (4 hours).2. The score for each essay is given by:   [   100 left( 1 - frac{1}{4^{t_i}} right)   ]   Therefore, the total score for all four essays is:   [   100 left( 1 - frac{1}{4^{t_1}} right) + 100 left( 1 - frac{1}{4^{t_2}} right) + 100 left( 1 - frac{1}{4^{t_3}} right) + 100 left( 1 - frac{1}{4^{t_4}} right)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   400 - 100 left( frac{1}{4^{t_1}} + frac{1}{4^{t_2}} + frac{1}{4^{t_3}} + frac{1}{4^{t_4}} right)   ]3.

For each of these sums, Ivan writes on the board the number of original integers which are less than that sum and divide it. We aim to find the maximum possible sum of the numbers written by Ivan.We claim that the maximum possible sum is ( frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{6} ). We will prove this by induction.1. Base Case: ( n = 2 )   - Let the two numbers be ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) with ( a_1 < a_2 ).   - The only pairwise sum is ( a_1 + a_2 ).   - Since ( a_1 < a_1 + a_2 ) and ( a_2 < a_1 + a_2 ), we need to check if ( a_1 ) or ( a_2 ) divides ( a_1 + a_2 ).   - Clearly, ( a_1 ) divides ( a_1 + a_2 ) but ( a_2 ) does not divide ( a_1 + a_2 ) because ( a_2 ) is greater than ( a_1 ).   - Therefore, the number written on the board is 1.   - The sum of the numbers written by Ivan is ( 1 ), which matches ( frac{(2-1)2(2+1)}{6} = 1 ).2. Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for ( n )   - Suppose the statement holds for ( n ) distinct positive integers.   - Let the numbers be ( a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_{n+1} ).   - By the inductive hypothesis, the sum of the numbers written on the board for the first ( n ) numbers is at most ( frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{6} ).3. Consider the quantities ( a_{n+1} + a_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n )   - For each ( i ), ( a_i ) divides at most ( n+1-i ) of these quantities.   - If ( a_i ) divides ( a_{n+1} + a_ell ) and ( a_{n+1} + a_m ) for ( ell, m leq i ), then ( a_i ) also divides ( a_ell - a_m ), which is a contradiction since ( a_ell - a_m < a_i ).4. Sum of the numbers written for ( a_{n+1} + a_i )   - For each ( a_{n+1} + a_i ), a number at most ( n+1-i ) is written on the board.   - This increases the total by at most ( sum_{i=1}^n (n+1-i) = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ).5. Total sum calculation   - The total sum is at most:     [     frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{6} + frac{n(n+1)}{2}     ]   - Simplifying this, we get:     [     frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{6} + frac{3n(n+1)}{6} = frac{(n-1)n(n+1) + 3n(n+1)}{6} = frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}     ]6.

Condition for angle APB = 90^{circ}:   - Since angle APB = 90^{circ}, point P must lie on the circle with diameter AB. Given |AB| = 10, the circle with diameter AB encompasses all such points P.3. Relation Between A, B, and Line x + y = m:   - Points A and B lie on the line x + y = m. For any point on the unit circle to satisfy angle APB = 90^{circ}, the farthest distance from the circle to the line must be less than or equal to half of |AB|, which is 5.4. Calculating the Maximum Distance:   - The distance from the origin (center of the unit circle) to the line x + y = m is given by frac{|m|}{sqrt{2}}.

This implies that the circle's center is C(3,-2) and its radius r=3.① Assume that the slope of line l is k (where k exists). Then, its equation is y-0=k(x-2) or kx-y-2k=0.Since the distance between line l and the circle's center C is 1, we can write the equation: frac{|3k-2k+2|}{sqrt{k^{2}+1}}=1. Solving for k, we get k=-frac{3}{4}.Therefore, the equation of line l is y=-frac{3}{4}(x-2) or 3x+4y-6=0.② If k does not exist, then the equation of line l is x=2.In summary, the equation of line l is 3x+4y-6=0 or x=2.(2) Using the chord's perpendicular bisector, we have d=sqrt{r^{2}-left(frac{AB}{2}right)^{2}}=sqrt{5}, which is also the distance between point P and the circle's center C (|CP|=sqrt{5}).Assume the equation of line l is y-0=k(x-2) or kx-y-2k=0. The distance d between the circle's center (3,-2) and line l is given by: d=frac{|3k+2-2k|}{sqrt{k^{2}+1}}=sqrt{5}.Solving for k, we obtain k=frac{1}{2}.

Therefore, ( k(n) leq n + 1 ).3. Now, assume for contradiction that ( k(n) leq n ).

Subtract the two expressions for ( m ):   [   0 = (b_0 - a_0) cdot 1 + (b_1 - a_1) cdot n + cdots + (b_c - a_c) cdot n^c + b_{c+1} cdot n^{c+1} + cdots + b_d cdot n^d   ]   Move all negative terms to the other side:   [   (a_0 - b_0) cdot 1 + (a_1 - b_1) cdot n + cdots + (a_c - b_c) cdot n^c = b_{c+1} cdot n^{c+1} + cdots + b_d cdot n^d   ]   Since each coefficient ( a_q - b_q ) is less than ( n ), each term ( (a_q - b_q) cdot n^q ) is less than ( n^{q+1} ). Therefore, the left-hand side (LHS) is less than ( n^{c+1} ), which is a contradiction because the right-hand side (RHS) is at least ( n^{c+1} ).6.

Separate the cube into two tetrahedra:   - A cube can be divided into two tetrahedra by considering the vertices of the cube. Each tetrahedron will have 4 vertices.   - Let's label the vertices of the cube as ( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H ). One possible way to separate the cube into two tetrahedra is by considering vertices ( A, B, C, D ) for the first tetrahedron and ( E, F, G, H ) for the second tetrahedron.2. Determine the possible movements for the flies:   - Each fly moves to a vertex in the same face but diagonally opposite to it. This means each fly will move to a vertex that is not adjacent to its current position.   - For each tetrahedron, the flies can either form two cycles of length 2 or one cycle of length 4.3. Calculate the number of ways for 2 cycles of length 2:   - For each tetrahedron, we need to choose 2 pairs of vertices out of 4 vertices. The number of ways to choose 2 pairs is given by:     [     frac{binom{4}{2}}{2} = frac{6}{2} = 3     ]   - This calculation accounts for the fact that the order of the pairs does not matter.4. Calculate the number of ways for 1 cycle of length 4:   - For a cycle of length 4, we need to consider the chirality (handedness) of the cycle. There are 2 possible cycles for each set of 4 vertices (one clockwise and one counterclockwise).   - The number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 edges that will not be traversed (and are opposite each other) is:     [     frac{binom{4}{2}}{2} = frac{6}{2} = 3     ]   - We multiply this by 2 to account for the chirality:     [     3 times 2 = 6     ]5.

Sum of ( p(n) ) from 0 to 999:   We can express the sum of ( p(n) ) from 0 to 999 as:   [   sum_{n=0}^{999} p(n)   ]   Using the property of concatenation, we can factor this sum:   [   sum_{n=0}^{999} p(n) = left( sum_{n=0}^{9} p(n) right)^3   ]5. Calculate ( sum_{n=0}^{9} p(n) ):   [   sum_{n=0}^{9} p(n) = p(0) + p(1) + p(2) + ldots + p(9) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 46   ]6. Sum of ( p(n) ) from 0 to 999:   [   sum_{n=0}^{999} p(n) = 46^3   ]7. Sum of ( p(n) ) from 1 to 999:   Since ( p(0) = 1 ), we need to subtract this from the total sum:   [   sum_{n=1}^{999} p(n) = 46^3 - 1   ]8. Factorize ( 46^3 - 1 ):   Using the difference of cubes formula:   [   46^3 - 1 = (46 - 1)(46^2 + 46 cdot 1 + 1^2) = 45 times (46^2 + 46 + 1)   ]9. Calculate the factors:   [   45 = 3^2 times 5   ]   [   46^2 + 46 + 1 = 2116 + 46 + 1 = 2163   ]   Factorize 2163:   [   2163 = 3 times 721   ]   Factorize 721:   [   721 = 7 times 103   ]   Therefore:   [   2163 = 3 times 7 times 103   ]10. Combine all factors:    [    46^3 - 1 = 45 times 2163 = 3^2 times 5 times 3 times 7 times 103 = 3^3 times 5 times 7 times 103    ]11.

The greatest prime divisor is ( 103 ).The final answer is ( boxed{103} )"},{"problem":"On the surface of a sphere with center O, a point A draws three chords AB, AC, and AD of equal length, and the angle between any two of them is 60°.

But which modulo N should we choose?- If there are p-th powers with p prime, try N=p^{2} p^{3}, etc.Indeed, if a is not divisible by p, by Euler's theorem, a^{p^{k-1}(p-1)} equiv 1 bmod p^{k}, so left(a^{p}right)^{p^{k-2}(p-1)} equiv 1 bmod p^{k}, which limits the number of values taken by a^{p} modulo p^{k}.- When a n-th power (with n a known integer) is involved, it can be useful to choose N as a prime number congruent to 1 modulo n.Indeed, in this case, a^{N-1} equiv 1 bmod N by Fermat's little theorem, so left(a^{n}right)^{frac{N-1}{n}} equiv 1 bmod N, which limits the number of values taken by a^{n} modulo N.- When a n-th power (where n is the unknown), say a^{n}, is involved, it can be useful to choose N=a^{k} (with k greater than the largest supposed solution).- When a n-th power (where n is the unknown), say a^{n}, is involved, it can be useful to choose N as a not too large divisor of a^{k}-1 for some integer k.Indeed, if we know that n is congruent to a fixed number modulo a certain m (or takes a limited number of values modulo m), it may be judicious to find N such that the order of a modulo N is m, or divides m, or is a multiple of m. In the first two cases, N divides a^{m}-1, and in the last case, N divides a^{k}-1 with k a multiple of N.Indeed, in the first two cases, a^{n} is then constant modulo N, and in the third case, a^{n} takes a limited number of values modulo N.It can also be useful to use the fact that if a^{k} equiv 1 bmod N and omega is the order of a modulo N, then a^{omega}-1 divides a^{k}-1.- For equations of the form a^{x}=b^{y}+c (with a, b, c known and x and y unknown) having a finite number of solutions, consider left(x_{0}, y_{0}right) the \\"largest\\", assuming x>x_{0}, y>y_{0}, we subtract it from the original equation to get a^{x_{0}}left(a^{x-x_{0}}-1right)=b^{y_{0}}left(b^{y-y_{0}}-1right).

We then find a nice prime divisor of b^{omega}-1 and continue step by step (we can also start from the fact that b^{y_{0}} divides a^{x-x_{0}}) until we reach a contradiction.

Identifying the Circle's Center and Radius:   - The circle C is given by the equation left(x-1right)^{2}+y^{2}=frac{4}{{25}}a_n^2.   - This means the center of the circle C is at left(1,0right) and its radius r is frac{2}{5}a_n.2. Distance from Line to Circle's Center Equals Radius:   - The line l is given as 3x+4y+a_{n-1}+a_{n+1}-3=0.   - The distance d from the center left(1,0right) to the line l can be calculated using the formula d=frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}, where (x_0,y_0) is the center of the circle and Ax+By+C=0 is the equation of the line.   - Substituting the values, we get d=frac{|3cdot1+4cdot0+a_{n-1}+a_{n+1}-3|}{sqrt{3^2+4^2}}.   - Simplifying, we find d=frac{|a_{n-1}+a_{n+1}|}{5}.   - Since the line is tangent to the circle, d=r, thus frac{|a_{n-1}+a_{n+1}|}{5}=frac{2}{5}a_n.   - This simplifies to a_{n-1}+a_{n+1}=2a_n.3.

Now we observe that 10^{n}=9 cdot A_{n}+1, so 10^{n} equiv 1 bmod A_{n}. This means that10^{10 n}+10^{9 n}+ldots+10^{n}+A_{n}-10 equiv 1+1+ldots+1+A_{n}-10=A_{n} bmod A_{n}Thus, the number on the left is a multiple of A_{n}, so we can obtain it from A_{n} with step 1. It has 10 extra ones (in positions 10 n, 9 n, etc., counting from the right, starting from the zeroth digit) and one 1 less (in the tens place). By applying step 2, we rewrite this to A_{n+9}. By repeating this step, we can obtain all A_{m} with m in the arithmetic sequence n+9 k, with 3 nmid n and k geq 0.Now consider the set of powers of two modulo 9. This is the repeating sequence 1,2,4,8,7,5,1, ldots In particular, every residue class not equal to 0,3,6 occurs infinitely often in this sequence. This means that there is a power of two greater than n with the same residue as n modulo 9. This power of two is thus in the arithmetic sequence: there are k and ell such that n+9 k=2^{ell}.Finally, we claim that we can make steps from A_{2 n} to A_{n}. For this, we look for a power of two whose digits can be grouped into two equal-sized groups (plus or minus 1 for an odd number of digits) with the same sum. We find this with 2^{13}=8192. With this, we come to the following steps from A_{2} to A_{1}:11 rightarrow 11 cdot 118=1298 rightarrow 8192=2^{13} rightarrow 10^{13} rightarrow 1If we group the ones of A_{2 n} into pairs with enough zeros in between and apply these steps simultaneously to each group, then this also gives a process from A_{2 n} to A_{n}. If we repeatedly apply this to A_{2^{ell}}, we eventually end up at A_{1}.Remark. Instead of A_{N}, we can also make the smaller number A_{S} with S the sum of the digits of N with a bit more work. Indeed, assume that the m^{text {th }} digit of N is greater than 1 (counting from the right, starting from the zeroth digit). Now choose k such that k n+m is greater than the number of digits of N with n=varphi(N). Then 10^{k n+m}-10^{m}+N is a multiple of N where the m^{text {th }} digit is one less, and we have one additional digit 1 with some zeros. By removing the zeros and repeating this step, we get a number that consists only of ones. Since we started with N not equiv 0 bmod 3, the number of ones is not divisible by 3."},{"problem":"13.
