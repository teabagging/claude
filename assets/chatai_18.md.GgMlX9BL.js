After breaking in to smaller pieces, the fragments also are sharp and can injure the urinary tract. This causes bruising along the walls of ureter. This can lead to bleeding and the blood comes out with urine. You may have such a process which has led to bleeding in urine.

They are more common in middle-aged women. Lipoma tumours can grow to be quite large.Angiomyolipoma is a benign kidney tumour made up of fat, blood vessels and smooth muscle tissue. Even though it’s benign, the tumour can spread into and destroy surrounding tissue. It can also cause sudden bleeding (hemorrhage) from the kidney into the abdomen. Bleeding is more likely with tumours that are larger than 4 cm (1-1/2 inches).It is important to know which tumor you have and the size.

The kidney is a well protected organ located in the retroperioneal region at the level of thoraco lumbar vertebrae T 12 to L 3. They have a capsule and surrounded by perirenal fat to protect from mild injury. It is best to get a ultrasound scan of abdomen to know if there is any pathological condition in or around the region of pain. Such a pain for 10 months is uncommon.

There are small optical high signalT2 lesions that may represent small cyst. There is a 9 mm cortical lesion arises from the anterior right kidney that is low signal on T2 and could represent a complex cyst or solid nodule. There is a proteinaceous or hemorrhagic cortical cyst arising from the posterior left kidney measuring 1.4 cm.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns.Renal atrophy with cortical thinning essentially means the shrinking of the kidney. The kidney is basically getting smaller because the cortical nephrons (on the outside of the kidney) is thinning out.Cortical thinning eventually leads to renal failure.You have also multiple small cysts in both the kidneys. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)usually gives rise to large kidney.The presence of two or more cysts in each kidney is associated with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 100%, respectively. To differentiate it from benign cysts,you may undergo mutational screening for ADPKD-1 and ADPKD-2.Treatment is conservative(medicinal) and eventual renal replacement therapy (dialysis ) as the need arises.Regards Dr. T.K.

This can happen due to two main causes.1. There is a stone in the lower end of left ureter (tube connecting kidney to bladder). When this happens there is obstruction to flow of urine and the kidney swells up. There is severe pain in lower abdomen.2. Another possibility is due to infection in the ureter or a recently stone which was initially stuck in the proximal ureter and has subsequently been washed out.

We have repeated ultrasounds on the kidney 3 different times with no significant changes.  They are sending me for a c-125 blood test to rule out cancer.  My question I guess is would these cysts cause the urinating problems and would you suggest having the cysts removed?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cysts in kidney as described by you almost never cause any problems relating to passing urine. The kidneys are located high up in the abdomen, one on each side and under no circumstance will cause any problem related to micturition. Though, large complex cysts can cause obstruction to the flow of urine from the kidney to the bladder and this should be evaluated. After reading your query I think you require a CT scan abdomen to see and evaluate the cysts completely. ca 125 is an indication to know if there is a possibility of any elevation of biochemical markers and the risk of a malignant cyst.If the cysts appear benign as per radiological classification on CT scan then best is to leave it alone.

This will cause free flow of blood to the heart. The heart pumping action will be enhanced and the heart will function more normally. With this more blood will reach the kidneys to function efficiently. The inherent damage to the kidney mechanism will not be normalized but the kidney will get a good supply of blood to work on.

You may need to do a urinalysis to check for blood and to rule out UTI. A ct STONOGRAM would be the best imaging choice for you since it can detect 90% of stones in the urinary tract. If the stones are small then you may be able to pass it out spontaneously with just fluid hydration (2Liters of water a day).

Simple Renal cortical cysts are benign conditions and doesn't warrant any treatment or intervention. The cyst of your father is very small and would not transform into a cancer 99% of the time. I would suggest having him drink 1.5-2 liters of water and avoid pain medications. If he has hypertension or diabetes then he should ensure they are well controlled to take care of his remaining kidney. FFUp with ultrasound to monitor the cyst is advised together with biannual urinalysis and serum creatinine determination.   I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for.

I have a 0.6 size kidney stone in right kidney. Nowadays I get burning sensation while urinating and have urge to pee every 5-10 minutes and when I go only drops come out. I took Citalka and now have to go for urination frequently.","Doctor":"HiThere is a possibility that your 0.6cm stone has come down into the ureter and then is on its way close to the bladder which will explain your symptoms. Please take plenty of oral fluids. Citalka could help but you also might need to take drugs called alpha-blockers to help the stone come out and obtain relief.

It burns when I urinate. My abdomen feels tender too. My hips and lower back feel tender as well.  I do have a history of kidney stones but I've never passed one that felt like this before.  Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There are many symptoms related to the location and size of kidney stones. If the stone is too large to pass easily, pain continues as the muscles in the wall of the tiny ureter try to squeeze the stone along into the bladder. One may feel the need to urinate more often or feel a burning sensation during urination. In a man, pain may move down to the tip of the penis. If the stone is close to the lower end of the ureter at the opening into the bladder, a person will frequently feel like they have not fully completed urination."},{"Patient":"My Husband is diagnosed with early stages of multiple myeloma and has stage 3 kidney disease.

The left kidney cyst is little bigger at 5.7 x 4.2 cm and can be followed up on repeat ultrasound scan after 6 months. The stones measuring 5 mm each in right kidney middle calyx and left kidney upper pole are not a concern if there is no obstruction to passage of urine and in the absence of symptoms like pain.

Could this have something to do with the cyst?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A renal cortical cyst is fluid filled area which is a benign harmless condition. A cyst of size 3 cm is small and not a concern. A larger cyst is to be reviewed on ultrasound after 6 months. It is important to know the size of the cyst before recommending you a higher imaging investigation.

You may donate it to any close friend or relative when such a person is matching with your HLA typing. Donating a kidney voluntarily to any one who needs it urgently without knowing the person and the illness they have is not correct. Donation of kidney is through a major surgery and requires hospitalisation and pre donation checks which need to be approved by ethical board appointed to oversee the donation process.

General recommendations include 3-month follow-up that comprises a physical examination, urinalysis, blood pressure measurement, and assessment of renal function.

You need to take tests specific to heart like ECG and echocardiography. If there is fluid around heart, pericardial effusion then there is possibility of hart related swelling.

However you need not worry because a 3 mm stone is small and does not necessarily cause any obstruction. The stone being in lower pole is one of the reasons for it not getting passed due to anti gravity. Since thee calyx at lower pole is inclined upwards, such a stone will usually not climb into the renal pelvis and get drained on its own. If it is stable since ten years then you need should not worry."},{"Patient":"I have done ultra sonic on my kidneys last days, the doctor found small lesion 4,3mm in cortex of my left kidney, he mentioned to me, no problem and advice me donot think about it it could be stone or angiomyolipoma, but i'm very warry is there any stone could be imbeded in the cortex?. if it angiolipoma what can i do. by the way, this lesion was detected befor with the same radius (4mm) since 18 month ago. what can you advice me please Sir?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Angiomyolipoma is a benign tumor commonly seen in kidneys. It is a bunch of vascular, smooth muscle and fat containing tissues. If it has not grown from 4 mm in 18 months then there is no reason to worry. Angiomyolipomas are often found incidentally when the kidneys are imaged for other reasons. Angiomyolipomas found incidentally usually require no therapy (when small), although follow-up is recommended to assess for growth.

I wondered about this a number of times, and I know that due to this behaviour I could not progress, improve in my career… because high level of job requires prompt action, thinking, decision taking. But I have understanding & listening problem, lack of grasping power etc. Moreover, due to the current kidney ailment, I am weak by body, so cannot run after taking a job that is involved hectic activities (PA/PS/AM)… currently I am doing the works of a clerk.

It will depend if he has a complete duplication meaning he has two ureters(tube that connects the kidney to the urinary bladder) all the way from the kidney to the bladder or incomplete duplication where the two tubes will fuse somewhere in the middle and would have one insertion to the bladder.When we have a duplicated kidney we call the collecting system in the upper pole of the kidney upper moiety while the lower pole is the lower moiety. Prominence of the lower moiety means that it is more dilated than the upper pole. This means there might be some form of obstruction happening and should be investigated by CT SCan or MRI.

It can be managed now,depending upon kidney biopsy result. if not  intervened , there is a risk of graft loss."},{"Patient":"3 weeks ago I had a confirmed stone 6mm in my distal ureter. I'm taking tamsulosin daily. Getting bits of pain in my kidneys, however for the past 48 hours I have been suffering from groin pain, genital pain and today severe pain in my clitoris on voiding. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi, No it is not normal. It is best for you to consult your doctor immediately as increasing pain suggests either movement of kidney stone or development of infection. You might need to undergo repeat scan and look for increasing size of stones or formation of newer stones."},{"Patient":"hello, my mother is 58 yrs old, she had a bypass 1mnth back,5 days earlier she had blood in her urine, urine culture report showed puss below the kidney, she is a diabetc.Dr has prescribed leaon500....need to know about this medicine and how is it taken.","Doctor":"Hi, Leaon ( levofoxacin) is and antibiotic commonly used for urinary infections.It is time tested and safe medication , most people tolerate the drug very well. It is to be taken once daily for 7 days. You need to give urine culture test prior to medication, in order to determine which antibiotic to most suitable for your mother's infection, and as culture test is reported after 2-3 days it is best to use LEAON till that peroid and change antibiotic after test is reported."},{"Patient":"What is an acceptable wait time for surgery removal of a 8mm kidney stone? There was a kidney infection, 7days antibiotics, and they put in a stint, why not just do IV antibiotics and get it out instead of placing a stint? They are waiting 21 days from the stint placement which has now led to a UTI, just need some clarity.","Doctor":"Hi,Placing a stent will help the ureter get passively dilated and this will make the stone removal process much easier and safer when the endoscope is passed later. This dilatation usually takes place gradually over two to three weeks.Removal of a stone in the presence of active infection is not usually recommended. You should be under the cover of good antibiotics till the stone is removed."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 48, 115kgs and generally in good heath, however 4 weeks ago my scrotum swelled up to the size of a softball (probably 15cm in diameter) and the skin became very thick (after flu like symptoms).

The size has decreased a little bit, mabey 30% less but the skin is still very thick.","Doctor":"HiWhat you have experienced is an Epididymis and Testes infection and the good news is that the pain comes down fairly soon, but the bad news is the swelling will persist for a fairly long time and the size may never reach normal even after the infection has completely subsided. The common source of this infection is the urinary tract and I suggest you make sure this does not happen again as it is likely to do by ruling our any urinary obstruction. Ensure your blood glucose levels ate normal and urine does not show any pus cells"},{"Patient":"hi i am a 33 yr old fem. and have a kidney infection caused by proteus and I am on my 5th day of anitibiotics (Cipro).

Ciprofloxacin is an excellent drug but has been known to cause profound weakness and might be the cause of your present condition. You can take a multivitamin preparation for whatever it is worth as well.I suggest you take plenty of fluids and eat well for the next couple of days till you complete your antibiotics course but if you are not comfortable, please stop the antibiotic and get yourself examined by a doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi, GP suspected that my dad might have kidney stone.

First your left kidney is obstructed and not functioning properly due to a kidney stone that is blocking the way. Treatment for this would be ESWL (shockwave therapy) to fragment the stone and remove the obstruction. This is a more urgent problem and you should consult your local Urologist so that there will be less kidney damage due to obstruction/blockage.The second kidney problem is the cortical cyst. Since your cysts shows atypical features with peripheral calcifications then you need a ct scan with IV contrast to grade your cortical cyst properly to determine the risk for malignancy or kidney cancer.

Colonization means that bacteria is in the bladder, catheter and urine bag but does not cause infection and does not warrant treatment while UTI would cause symptoms of urination like suprapubic pain, fever etc. If we always treat the bacteria in colonization then we end up developing multidrug resistant organisms and when the time comes where infection is present we do not have any antibiotics to use anymore.

If it is smaller than 4mm then your mother can pass out the stone spontaneously with intake of 2 liters of fluid everyday and alpha-blockers (e.g. tamsulosin alfusozin). Stones less than 4mm in size has a 80-90% chance of spontaneous passage. If the stones are bigger in size then options would include ESWL (shockwave therapy) to fragment kidney stones and Ureteroscopy (inserting a small scope in the opening of the urine to remove the stone).

She also has pain that has traveled from her left side , sometimes right side, sometimes her back, . Is it something really serious?","Doctor":"Hi,I am sorry to know about your daughter's condition.I need to know a little more about your daughter before I can guide you properly.How old is your daughter? What is her kidney function like (serum creatinine level)?Has a urine infection been ruled out (by checking urine microscopy)?Small kidney cysts are common after the age of 40 years. If they are simple , (meaning clear contents, no solid mass or septa within the cyst), they can be observed with regular ultrasonogram. If they have any internal contents, then a Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) of abdomen is necessary to further characterize these cysts.If your daughter's kidney cysts are simple, her urine microscopy and kidney function are normal, the you need not worry much about the cysts. If she is young, then she needs to be evaluated for one of the inheritable causes of kidney cysts.Reduced kidney function can cause vomiting and weakness. This needs the attention of a Nephrologist. If her kidney function is normal, she needs to be evaluated by a Gastroenterologist.I hope I have answered your query.

The procedure your husband could have undergone might have been either PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotomy - removing kidney stone through a small hole in the back) or RIRS (retrograde intra renal surgery - removing kidney stone through natural urinary passage with laser). In both surgeries blood in urine is common. PCNL is associated with more blood loss and pain than RIRS.Your treating Urologist will be closely monitoring your husband's progress using vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure, urine output), hemoglobin level and ultrasonogram to know the amount of blood loss. Even a drop of blood in a liter of urine can look reddish. There are drugs to reduce bleeding and control pain. If your husband's vital signs are within normal limits, there is no need to panic.

This can be a normal finding with full bladder. This needs to be checked again after you pass urine. If it does not settle after passing urine, another cause could be the large fibroid causing mild obstruction in both ureters (the tubes connecting kidneys with bladder). In this case, the ureters will also be swollen (called as hydroureteronephrosis).You need to check your kidney function using serum creatinine level. If it is confirmed that uterus is causing obstruction, your Gynecologist may advise a hysterectomy (removal of uterus).Please get back to me with your age, serum creatinine, and repeat ultrasonogram looking for the features I have explained.Wish you good health,Warm regards,Dr. Raguram G MS, MRCS, MCh (Uro), F.

After a non-contrast CT scan, I've been diagnosed with multiple non-obstructing renal calculi. In the right kidney, there are at least 5 calculi with the largest measuring 3mm. In the left kidney, there are also at least approximately 5 calculi with the largest measuring 5mm. No uretic calculus is detected and there is no hydroureter or hydronephrosis.I had a recent X-ray which did not show any kidney stones on the right side, which was why the urologist ordered the recent CT scan. I was on a waiting list to have ESWL. Do you think it will still be necessary?","Doctor":"Hi,   The treatment of kidney stone depends on your symptoms, size and location. Asymptomatic calculi, less than or equal to 5 mm can usually be managed by medical therapy (eg. potassium citrate syrup, febuxostat, thiazide etc).   ESWL is good for a single stone between size 5 to 10 mm. Since shockwaves have to pass through the kidney to break the stones, there is a limit to the number of shockwaves that a kidney can tolerate. Moreover, small stones are difficult to localize in fluoroscopy or ultrasound during ESWL. Thus, ESWL is a very poor choice for multiple small stones.    For multiple small stones, current treatment of choice is flexible ureteroscopy with laser. In this procedure, the surgeon can see inside the kidney and treat each and every stone with laser. Thus, clearance rates are very good. However, its availability is limited to a few centers.  In your case, if you do not have any symptoms, I advise you to start medical therapy after undergoing a 24 hour urine metabolic work up (Check urine volume, pH, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, uric acid, oxalate, citrate and magnesium) along with serum creatinine, calcium, uric acid and electrolytes. These tests will help to find out the reason for formation of kidney stones. Accordingly, individualized medical therapy can be advised to dissolve current stones and prevent future stones.  General measures to treat kidney stones are to keep urine output more than 2.5 liters per day, reduce salt intake less than 5 g/day and reduce animal protein intake.

The most common problem causing urinary retention in his age is enlarged prostate. This can be diagnosed using ultrasound of kidneys, bladder and prostate.   The whole body swelling is most probably due to poor kidney function (as suggested by increased blood urea). Enlarged prostate can itself cause kidney damage due to urinary obstruction leading to swelling in kidney  (hydronephrosis). This can also be diagnosed on ultrasound. However, there may be associated conditions like diabetes and hypertension which can also contribute to decreased kidney function. Thus, it is important to evaluate for these conditions, as well as to evaluate the cardiac and liver functions.   Once his general condition improves, prostate removal (TURP, Transurethral resection of prostate) can make him pass urine without catheter.

Please confirm me What I do?","Doctor":"Hi,The treatment of kidney stone disease depends on the size and location of stones. Small stones less than 5 mm in size, which are not causing any obstruction, can be managed conservatively with medicines to dissolve the stones.Stones  5 to 10 mm (maximum 15 mm) can be managed with lithotripsy. Stones 10 to 15 mm can be manged with flexible ureteroscopy and laser. Stones more than 15 mm in size should be removed using PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) which is a keyhole surgery through the back.If the stone is blocking ureter (the tube connecting kidney and bladder) and is 5 to 10 mm in size, it can be treated with medicines to expel the stone. Stones larger than 10 mm usually require endoscopic removal, although occasionally ever a larger stone can be made to pass with medicines.The main issue in a young person like your brother is to find out whether there is an underlying predisposition to form recurrent stones. This is usually evaluated after removal of stones. The removed stone is analysed to find out its chemical composition. You need to check his creatinine, electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, uric acid and PTH (parathyroid hormone) levels in blood. It is important to check 24 hour urine levels of various salts which either promote or oppose stone formation. These include urinary volume, creatinine, sodium, calcium, uric acid, phosphorus, oxalate, citrate and magnesium levels.Based on these reports we can suggest dietary modifications and specific medications to prevent further stone formation.Meanwhile ask him to drink lot of fluids to keep urine output more than 2 to 2.5 liters per day.Please get back to me with the details of ultrasound report. I can guide you further based on that.Wish your brother a speedy recovery,Warm regards,Dr. Raguram G      MS, MRCS, MCh (Urology), Fellow in Endourology"},{"Patient":"hi , i am naushad... i had ultra sound test today because of suspecting stones in kidney but there is no stones kidney , lever , bladder. then again doctor said cum after 2 weeks for kidney observation because i have urine store in left side . they want to check my ureter. i am having pain in left side back . few months ago i had a kidney scan and urine test everything normal. pls advise me why","Doctor":"Hi,You might be having a stone in left ureter (the tube connecting kidney to bladder).  This might have been the cause for your left sided back pain. Usually a stone in ureter is a little difficult to visualize in ultrasound, especially if it is in the middle part of ureter (since intestines block the view). However, there may be some swelling in the kidney (hydronephrosis), if there is a stone blocking the ureter. This can be picked up easily in ultrasound.The other tests for stone are urine analysis (to look for blood in urine), X-ray KUB (Kidney, Ureter and Bladder region) and if in doubt, a CT scan.Ureteric stones less than 10 mm size are treated with medical expulsive therapy, which include some drugs to dilate ureter and reduce local swelling so that stone can be passed.I would advise you to first confirm whether your pain is due to stone (based on the tests suggested) and then start appropriate treatment (medical expulsive therapy) under a Urologist. Pain relief can be achieved by routine pain killers, although it needs to be prescribed by a physician or Urologist.In the meanwhile, drink lot of fluids (3 to 4 liters per day) and take citrus fruits like lemon and orange.I am available to guide your further based on the above reports.Wish you a speedy recovery,Dr. Raguram G      MS, MRCS, MCh (Urology), Fellow in Endourology"},{"Patient":"I had a kidney stone earlier this month and required the basket procedure to remove it.

Please be assured that your condition is treatable once a proper diagnosis is made.Pelvicetasis means a dilatation or swelling in the part of kidney (renal pelvis) which connect the inner urine collecting parts of kidney to ureter (the tube connecting kidney to bladder). This can be due to any obstruction in the junction of renal pelvis and ureter (pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction) or reflux of urine (urine flows back from bladder to kidneys while passing urine). In some conditions, mild pelviectasis may be a normal finding also.Your CT scan will usually guide regarding the correct diagnosis. The other tests that may be required, include MCU (micturiting cystourethrogram) to check for reflux and DTPA scan (radionuclide scan) to check for obstruction. This decision regarding further tests will be made by your Urologist, based on the exact findings of CT scan.Please get your urine checked for any associated urine infection, which can increase the pain. If there is pyuria (increased number of pus cells in urine), you need to take antibiotics to control the infection, before proceeding for further tests. If the pain is severe, you can take one or two doses of over-the-counter mild pain killers which do not affect the kidney function (avoid NSAID group of drugs).

Kidney stones usually cause bleeding whenever they cause abrasion anywhere on the urinary tract. often times kidney stones harbor bacteria thereby causing urinary tract infection and may cause further bleeding in the urinary tract. The lining of the urinary tract becomes friable and prone to bleeding when infected by bacteria thereby causing more bleeding. For recurrent stones you should had a metabolic workup to determine the risk factors for your kidney stones to prevent further kidney stone formation. Treatment for stones would depend on the stone composition and stone size. I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for.

Yes adrenal mass that is more than 4cm has a higher risk for malignancy although you definitely need surgery to because your mass is hyper producing hormones.

Even if it is kidney, in few cases it may reach to end stage renal disease, in others it could be harmless. She may need a renal biopsy if suspected to have hematuria of renal origin.

Loss of consciousness can be because of kidney problem in lupus if it has reached last stage of end stage renal disease. This is called as uremic encephalopathy. Now, the other part of your question says she had trauma, in this regard we need to know the details of trauma. If its brain injury or injury with severe blood loss, it may cause unconsciousness.

Both the drugs you mentioned are relatively safer in kidney disease as compared with metformin and some other anti diabetic medications. Coming to the point, saxagliptin still needs dose reduction in kidney disease if GFR is below 50 but linagliptin is not a problem at all as it is not excreted via kidney.

This is called Primary Hypertension. It's not curable and needs to be treated to keep the BP under control.Then there are certain other causes of high BP called secondary causes. Many of these are curable. So it is very important for you to see your doctor and get yourself evaluated for these secondary causes of high BP. If a cause is found then it can be treated accordingly.

Two basic parameters are used to assess the kidney function - Urea and Creatinine (some use Blood Urea Nitrogen).

The age of you husband.2. What are his exact urea and creatinine levels, and what is the quantification of his proteinuria2. Whether he suffers from any comorbidities like Diabetes or hypertension (both can lead to kidney dysfunction).3. Whether he has any symptoms like fever, burning during urination or urinary frequency/urgency/retention.

Whether he has been on any drugs like NSAIDs (i.e pain killers) for a long time At this stage I would advise you to get a USG of Kidney/ureter/bladder done to check for any abnormalities like renal parenchymal disease.

The kidney perfusion is hampered in such situations, and the subject may develop a condition, which is known as Pre-renal failure or Acute Kidney Injury, in which there is a sudden, gross derangement of renal parameters (urea, creatinine) and decreased urinary output. However, such patients may be revived with generous intravenous fluid administration, at the right time, before irreversible renal damage occurs.Also, if a patient already has a diseased kidney due to some conditions like diabetes mellitus or hypertension, such a situation may cause an aggravation, also known as the Acute on Chronic renal failure.There is another type of infective diarrhea (due to E.coli) which may lead to the devlopment of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, which might also lead to failing kidneys.Old age and comorbidities, may aggravate any of the situations.Hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"yes, i amm just wondering about my husband s skin eruptions lesions with blood everytime it erupts, i understand he had a kidney trouble with protein, dont know if i am right..i advised him to go to a dermatologist but he is very stuboorn as he is scared to find out what it is..","Doctor":"Hello, welcome to healthcare magic forum,Looks like your husband is having some skin trouble, it may be either any bacterial or fungal infection requires dermatological check up, besides that why don't you once get a urine routine check up done.If kidney is creating trouble you will get a clue in urine examination report.Regards."},{"Patient":"Started with cramps and or aches - moving, sometimes back by kidneys, sometimes upper abdomen, sometimes lower by ovaries, and sometimes none at all over 4 days.

Her Dr is now recommending a biopsy be done. Should they do some other testing before this is done, as I have read that it is a bit risky. We are all new to this issue","Doctor":"Kidney biopsy is an invasive procedure in which a small amount of kidney tissue is retrieved with the help of a biopsy needle/biopsy gun and microscopical examination is done. This is done under local anesthesia. This is usually done when clinical examination, blood investigations (routine and specific) and imaging investigations are not enough to give a definitive diagnosis.A few investigations may be done before the procedure like Platelet, Prothrombin Time, APTT and bleeding time, which indicates the coagulation profile. Some nephrologists prefer the subject to be off medications like Aspirin and Warfarin. Post procedure, the subjects lie flat on their back for 4–6 hours to minimise the risk of bleeding. Vital parameters and urine are frequently monitored to ensure the patient is not suffering any bleeding complications.Complications are uncommon and may consist of minor bleeding from the biopsy site and in some cases there there may be haematuria (blood in urine). Pain at the biopsy site may occur, which may be relieved with anti-inflammatory agents like Paracetamol. Very rarely, severe complications like perinephric hematoma, Urinary retention (due to blood clot) and shock (due to sudden brisk bleeding) may occur.Your Nephrologist will give an overview about the procedure and the pre-procedure tests required, and the patient's NOK may have to sign a consent form for the procedure."},{"Patient":"Sir,My mother is suffering from kidney problem.her both kidney is damage.last week when we check the blood test her Creatinine level is 9.2 and blood urea is 200 and hemoglobine is around 6.please give some proper suggestion to reduce creatinine level.","Doctor":"Sir, thanks for the query.As the history that you have provided, your mother is suffering from Chronic renal failure (as per your history both kidney damaged).

Cysts in the kidney - by increasing age our kidney tissue became liquefied and form a fluid filed bag like thing within the kidney.

Hydronephrosis is fluid accumulation due to any urine out flow obstruction near by kidney. Before going to mri any implant history has to be known.

Probably your ureteric calculus was removed if in mid or lower part or pushed in if around PUJ and followed ESWL ( can't comment as you have not provided the detail of your operation)  hence not visualized in xray . In ESWL calculus are broken in small fragments so that it can pass through small passage (5mm) of ureter through urine and spent provide easy n broader passage preventing clogging of calculus . Fragmentation of calculus depends upon consistency , size , shape , hardness ....etc hence sometimes does not fragmented n requires multiple sitting .  Now as stent misplaced following (which can happen) surgery or probably ESWL Not  given to left side ( as B/L in  case ESWL should be given in different sitting) and Fragmentation of Rt renal calculus was complete  so they are still there (  and can be commented after detail of sx )  So in my opinion you need to have multiple sitting of ESWL to remove calculii or in your case PCNL would be treatment of choice .

You should know that during anxiety or physical activity the sympathetic nervous system is activated, causing increased circulating levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline, leading to palpitations and shortness of breath. Thyroid gland dysfunction can mimic all this clinical scenario too. Have you checked your thyroid hormone levels? Besides checking thyroid hormone levels, I would recommend performing an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to investigate for possible cardiac arrhythmia. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause of your complaints.

I am going to the toilet a lot even though may times I cannot pass any/much urine.  I do not appear to have any blood in my urine.","Doctor":"HelloThis type of chills and vomiting with severe back may be due to as.1 Urinary tract infection , diagnosis can be confirmed by urine examination in lab.2 Right renal colic may be the nest reason , but symptoms are not an indication of renal stone ,because in renal stone pain present with vomiting and blood in urine ( usually).Diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound of kidneys.3 As you mentioned that there is extreme thirst so all these symptoms may be due to renal failure but least chance due to short duration of history of illness.Any how consult a physician and get his consultation as physical examination is important.Good luck."},{"Patient":"I am a 41 year old male.

Don't know what that means or where it is.  The nurse was the one who called and didn't know how to answer my questions.  Since you can't see the results you may not be able to help either.  There sending me to a specialist.","Doctor":"Hi there, Thanks for your query. The answer given by your doctor is indeed vague. However, in the background of high blood pressure, the blockage is in the artery supplying the left kidney. The condition- called Renal Artery Stenosis- is an important (and the only TREATABLE cause) of high blood pressure. Removal of the narrowing either surgically, or insertion of a stent will cure hypertension and- following this surgical procedure- you will NOT require any anti-hypertensive drug(s)!! It is therefore strongly recommended that you undergo widening of the renal artery, so that hypertension gets cured permanently.

I got married and had a kid which has changed my routine needless to say I have gained back all the weight and more. Several months ago I decided to get back into the gym. I started by walking fast at an incline for 30-45 minutes 3- 4 times a week. During a few of these workouts I felt what I can only describe as a miss beat or double beat of the heart. I am just assuming that is what it is, it would only last for like 2-3 seconds and then it is gone. This has happened half a dozen times over the last year on the treadmill.

Could the kidney stones have caused this? He had been in the same e.r. the week before because of stones, they did blood work then and said nothing about elevated potassium levels.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking.No, I don\`t think the reason is the kidney stones.

He cancelled Eritel CH 40 and prescribed Selomax 50/5 in the morning. Then I was referredto Nephrology department. The Doctoro in Nephrology prescribed Dytor 10 in additioin to Selomax 50/5. I have been checking the creatinine level. It stays between 1.5 to 1.7 till date. Kindly advise the medicatioin is correct and whether the kidney function is normal. In October, 2013 Ultra Sound Scan of abdomen was also done, the result of which shows the kidneys as normal.","Doctor":"Dear sir/madam, long standing uncontrolled hypertension can lead to microvascular changes in blood vessels supplying kidney and damage the filtering structures of kidney leading to protein leakage and fluctuation in kidney functioning which in turn affects creatinine level. Ideally blood pressure should be adequately controlled. Salt should be restricted in diet. Drugs like eritel (ARB' S) help in reducing protenuria and prevent progression of renal dysfunction (failure). Diuretics (dytor) should be cautiously used along with monitoring creatinine. Yes dytor helps in reducing BP but in turn can worsen renal function. So monitor creatinine when on diuretics. Selomax is good drug also. Amlodipine in selomax also helps in controlling blood pressure and reduces proteinuria.

It has been well managed with atenolol, 25mg, diet and exercise.  Now, 15 years later, it has not been well managed with atenolol.  Still eating well and exercising, it shot uo to 160/110 (was consistently 120/80). We doubled the dose to 50 mg, no change.  My PCP ordered a stress test which i passed with a \\"nothing remarkable\\" comment from the physiologist in charge of the test. Since then, we have changed the meds to cozaar (sp?) and hydrochlorathizide which seems to help. I did go to a cardiologist for a consult and he basically told me to change to those meds and lose 10 pounds. Here's my concern.  Whenever I do anything \\"cardio\\" whether it be treadmill, elliptical machine or just walking up more than one flight of stairs, I get dizzy and my heart rate races.  Yesterday, I had a needle biopsy of my prostate and despite taking my meds religiously, my BP going in was 158/110.  After the procedure, it went up to 162/108...rested and it stayed at 160/110.  Rested longer, a half hour, and it finally came down to 155/100. My question is, I guess, what could have happened to cause my problems in the first place, since I was doing so well for so long? I believe that since I look so healthy, that I work out when I feel up to it, that my doctors aren't looking for \\"something else\\" that could be causing the light-headedness/dizzyness that occurs whenever I increase my heart rate with cardio exercise.

There is no need to worry too much about the health of your kidney. Any food which is healthy for your heart will be good for the kidney also. Just take care of the following things in your diet:1. Eat food rich in antioxidants. These include red pepper, red cabbage, red leaf lettuce, cauliflower, cherries, strawberries, cranberries, blue berries, plum, apple, red grapes, onion and garlic. Try to take as many colored food items as possible.2. In animal protein, try to take egg white and fish instead of meat.3. Use olive oil and vegetable oil instead of butter, lard and shortening.4. Make sure you take regular and adequate fluids. Prevent dehydration.5. Limit sodium intake (about 2.5 g/day).In addition to these aspects of diet, please note that hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia can worsen kidney function. You need to get checked for these diseases regularly and control them if you already have any one of them. Regular exercise is important to prevent and control these three problems.Regular medical check-up (as per your Urologist's advice) is important to diagnose and treat any precipitating factors early. Checking 24 hours urinary protein can show early damage to kidney. Proteinuria is a marker of kidney damage.

Occasionally large cysts can cause flank pain.Grade I prostatomegaly can also be considered a normal finding at your age. If you have any symptoms like poor urine flow, increased frequency of urination, urgency or getting up at night to pass urine, then it needs to be evaluated further. Insignificant post void residue means that there was no significant amount of urine in your bladder after you passed urine i.e. you are emptying the bladder completely. This is a good sign which implies that prostatomegaly is not causing much obstruction to your urine flow.I can guide you further once you mention the size of the cyst.If the cyst is small (e.g. less than 3 cm), then you need to be evaluated for spine and muscle related problems.Wish you a speedy recovery and good health,Dr. Raguram."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, Iam having the medical history of kidney stones (2009, 2010, 2012, 2014).

We usually do stone analysis on stones retrieved during procedures to determine what kind of stone and dietary restrictions.Generally smoking has never done any good and should be stopped for your general health. There are no studies to determine the effect of smoking on stone formation. Calcium and milk should be taken regularly and low calcium might lead to more stone formation since it will lead to decrease also in some stone inhibitors. Tea, coffee and chocolates should be restricted since it contains very high oxalate which is a stone promoter. I would suggest being in a low oxalate diet and the web is full of information on this.Best of Luck to your health.Regards,Dr Manuel See"},{"Patient":"I am 16 years old, have been sexually active with the same partener for almost 2 years and never had troubles till tonight when i went to pee and had bad pain and burning sensations throughout my urethra, it has never happened before and did not just slowly come on, it was sudden.

After a few painful episodes, the same calculus (6 mm) is now shown to be in the vesico-ureteric junction in USG KUB. She has had a urine infection, and currently on antibiotics . My question is does this type of calculus pass naturally, or should we go for surgical removal without any delay? Thanks","Doctor":"HelloThanks for writing to us with your health concern.In general, a calculus that is less than 10 mm is always given a trial for natural removal.The size of the calculus that your wife has ( 6 mm ) is quite small.Normally, this sized calculus will easily pass through into the urine and get excreted.Of course, the type of stones matter, with some stones being more resistant to treatment.In your case, the stone has already migrated downwards, from the kidney and is now at the VUJ ( vesico ureteric junction ).In all likelihood it would pass from there, through the ureters and hence outside through the bladder.The problem is that the passage and peristalsis of the calculus, however small, would lead to a great amount of pain and discomfort.There is no way to predict it, it might be painless also.Calculus removal surgical would be indicated in the following situations -1. Painful passage.2. Recurrent infections of the type you mention, which might scar her kidneys forever.Drink atleast 5 litres of fluids daily to facilitate stone removal.All the bestTake care."},{"Patient":"Past hx dx of MVP through ECG's, TEE & EKG's.  No meds taken.On Thurs,  I walked  up our driveway, which is about 10ft long & on a slight incline, my heart began to skip beats. It did this several times. Each episode lasting 2-3 seconds & SOB was experienced. I became lightheaded w/ each palpation. I sat down for 20 min. My b/p was 100/79 with a HR of 85. 30 min later, I was still having palpations, my b/p was 90/72 with HR of 90. 30 min later,  fingers began to tingle, & lips became pale.  My bp was 80/60 with 100bpm HR. I made my way to the ER.At the ER, SPO2 was 95, so 3L of O2 was given. I experienced another palpation, which set off alarms at the nurses station. It was a PVC that lasted 3-4 seconds. The nurse explained I experienced V-tach & I was admitted to the hospital. While there, I had continuous O2 for SOB & EKG's around the clock, as well as cardiac panels. My EKG's revealed inverted T-waves. I had a cardiac MRI which revealed no blockages. I also had a stress test. My resting HR was 72. Less than 1 minute after beginning the stress test, my HR soared to 135. 3 minutes into the test, I had a 3-4 second PVC. I endured the stress test for a total of 7 minutes, reaching my goal HR of 165bpm. I had to lay down after the test to get my HR to come back down. It stayed around 120bpm for 20 minutes. I then had another MRI, which revealed nothing new.ECG was done & the cardiologist said I don’t have MVP & I am to a tilt-table test for further information. I also had a thyroid test, which revealed a normal thyroid. Cardiac panels came back normal & imbalances were detected. I spent 3 days in the hospital, with absolutely no news or medications. My last night in the hospital, I experienced a hotflash with sweaty palms. My eyes became bloodshot & I experienced mild angina.

So heres my question    If I stop going to dialysis how long will I last","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Life expectancy of every patient differs with the ability of the body to compensate for the kidney failure. The important point is serum creatinine levels which should not rise too quickly and dialysis checks this. If your creatinine level is more than 5 then you have to go for regular dialysis."},{"Patient":"Two nights ago I woke up due to a very strong pain in my right side below my belly button and to the right of the pubic area.  During the course of the day this pain shifted to low down on my back on same side.  By the evening the pain had returned to the front but was severe enough for me to call 111 and ask their opinion.  Two options suggested, first to go in to see the out of hours doctor then or wait and see if got worse.  I chose the latter but by 4 a.m.  the pain was very bad.  I again rang 111 and was told to go to the local out of hours service tosee a Doctor. This I did and the GP examined me and said that I had blood in my urine so her diagnosis was renal colic and renal stones.  She also mentioned possible infection.  She rang Casualty and I was sent there.  During the morning I was given strong painkiller rectally which greatly helped.  CT scan of my kidneys was normal as was two subsequent urine tests.  The consultant told me that I had probably had a stone which I passed.  Yesterday evening at home the pain in my back had gone but I still had a niggly discomfort in my flank.  This morning the pain in my flank has returned and Iam unsure where to go from here.  I did a urine sample which on looking at it is slightly dark but I cannot see any blood in it.  I would be grateful for your advice as towhat I should do from here if anything.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.Your symptoms indicate kidney stones indeed. Lower right area is where ureter is located. So a stone in the ureter which has stuck there will give symptoms like yours. Please note that the stone which you have probably passed does not have to be the only one. Small stones can also be passing right now so you have less intense pain.Dark urine can be caused by low liquids intake. If there is no intense bleeding in the urinary tract, you wont be able to see any blood in your urine. Urine analysis can do that.I suggest you to follow this steps:- increase mineral water intake (even 3 liters/24 hours)- start cranberries supplementation- increase physical activity (like running or jumping) so the stones can get out - in case of pain, hot bath or Buscolisine can be helpfulIf this wont help, you should consult your doctor again, have urine analysis, blood work, abdominal ultrasound and consult urologist.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with kidney stones via a contrast CT.

He has congestion heart failure, one leg due to dibetis, sorissus of the liver non alcoholic, and he's on a kidney machine.  The doctor told us that his heart is to weak for the surgery to remove the gallstones, and his stomach hurts and he don't eat.  How long can a person live in that condition with galstones","Doctor":"Hi. This is a tough question to be honest with you. Life expectancy is obviously dependent on crucial factors like general health. With heart condition, diabetes, and liver problems, life expectancy is greatly reduced. So the answer to your question is that probably less than the average (men in US/UK live till they are 80 years or so). The more important question is if there is any danger of dying in the short term. Gallstones wont kill you, so the answer to that is no, it does not oppose a danger. The problem is that gallstones can cause an infection, in that case they put in a little tube and drain the infection out and most likely it would be ok.In this case I would say that having Diabetes and being on the dialysis machine does not mean that there are just a few months or even very few years to live, with good medical care one can live quite a while like this. The heart condition, however, is more unpredictable. Over all, no danger of dying in the short term.

Stones smaller than 5 mm can usually be managed conservatively (without surgery).Since you are having recurrent stone formation it is important to find out if you have any underlying condition which predisposes you for stone formation. These conditions can be checked by testing your blood for calcium, phosphorus, uric acid levels and 24 hour urine collection for creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, oxalate, citrate, sodium and magnesium. You may need specific therapies if you have any alteration in the blood or urine levels of these chemicals. Did you have your stone analyzed during the last surgery? The type of stone can guide us in using specific medications and taking particular diet to prevent further recurrence.The general precautions include:1. Drink lot of fluids - at least 2.5 to 3 liter. Keep urine colorless. Keep 24 hr urine volume more than 1.5 to 2 liter.2. Reduce sodium intake to 3. Reduce meat consumption to 6 ounces/day.In case you have a lot of small stones, please consult a Urologist who may plan for flexible ureteroscopy - to go inside the kidney, see each stone, break and remove them.I am ready to provide any clarification you need,Wish you good health and a stone-free life,Dr. Raguram."},{"Patient":"Yesterday, I slipped on some wooden steps, my feet went out from under me and I landed with full force on the edge of one step against my lower left back, at the level of the kidney.

Did your urine report show increased number of WBCs? If so, then you can take the same antibiotics which were prescribed last time. Fever is another symptom pointing towards UTI.Flank pain and blood in urine can be caused by non-infectious conditions also e.g. kidney or ureteric stones. Thus, in the absence of clear cut signs of UTI, the next step is decided after an ultrasonogram. However, we usually get ultrasonogram in the same day so that treatment is started immediately. If your urine did not show increased WBCs, but your pain is persistent, try getting ultrasonogram soon.I will be able to guide you better after ultrasonogram.

What should I have look for(symtoms). hindsite.","Doctor":"Hi,After going through your history, I can understand your concerns. Stage III chronic (lasting more than 3 months) kidney disease usually does not cause any symptom. Some diseases of kidney may produce flank pain, passage of blood in urine, swollen legs and hypertension early in the course of disease. When the kidneys lose some more function (stage 4 or 5), the following symptoms can occur: puffiness of face, swelling of legs, tiredness, dry skin, breathlessness, fullness in abdomen, easy bruisibility and loss of appetite. Please do not worry too much about this problem, since many patients do not progress to stage 4 or 5 if properly managed. However, regular monitoring of kidney function and following advice of your physician is important to prevent further worsening of kidney function. Do you have hypertension, diabetes or a history of long term intake of pain medications? The most important thing is to find out what caused your kidney problem and to treat the cause. Other things to take care are your bone health (calcium supplements), blood hemoglobin (iron supplements) and hydration (regular fluid intake after finding the daily fluid intake volume from your physician).I am ready to provide any further clarification you may need.

I am having a dull pain in my right mid back that will radiate to the front along with what feels like a tight hug (not painful but uncomfortable). I am also experiencing a fullness in the area right below my ribs but above my belly.","Doctor":"Hi,Kidney infection usually does not cause chest tightness. Usually kidney infection causes flank pain (pain in the area between lower ribs and hip bone). The other associated symptoms can be fever, nausea (vomiting sensation), vomiting, painful urination and foul smelling urine. Chest tightness, especially towards the center of chest, is usually due to heart problems. However, if it is confined to one side and involving only lower rib region, it can be caused by kidney problems. Please confirm the diagnosis by checking urine microscopy for WBCs and ultrasound to look at the kidneys. If these are normal and your pain is persistent, it is important to look for problems associated with heart, food pipe (esophagus) or stomach.I am ready to provide you further guidance.

Research has not shown that holding your urine will cause rupture of the bladder or bladder infections — but may result in overflow incontinence.2. The longer you hold your urine, the bladder can become a breeding ground for bacteria to grow, this bacteria can lead to infections, which can spread to kidneys and cause greater damage to the body.

We received very little information about either type of surgery - pros, cons, concerns.  I'm not even sure what to ask.  Can you direct me to more info.  How do I compare hospitals, doctors etc.  Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi,I can understand your concerns. The decision to remove partial vs whole of kidney depends on many factors like - size of mass, location of mass, function of both kidneys, fitness of patient and associated conditions like diabetes/hypertension which can affect the kidney function in the long run. Many of these factors are known before surgery from history, blood investigations and Computed Tomography (CT scan). The standard treatment for a mass less than 4 cm in size is partial removal. Partial removal can be safely performed up to 7 cm size (larger tumors can be removed based on location and function of opposite kidney). The idea behind partial removal is to preserve as much kidney function as possible since the remaining kidney in the same side will still continue to function. This is beneficial in the long run. However partial removal needs more expertise and is associated with a slightly more risk of complications.There are scoring systems like RENAL nephrometry (www.nephrometry.com), which can predict the complexity of mass and thus guide the Urologist in making the decision. Though all these can give an idea about the choice of procedure, the decision for borderline masses may need to be taken in operation room only. The minimally invasive surgery can be either robotic or laparoscopic. While robotic surgery is a costly procedure, it is relatively easy to perform when compared to laparoscopic surgery.I can guide you further if you can provide the CT scan report, other investigations (Hemoglobin, serum creatinine, Liver function) and details of any medical condition of your husband.Wish your husband a safe surgery,Dr. Raguram."},{"Patient":"My wife has been diagnosed with congenital hole in the heart at this old age of 65 years.

Norfloxacin acts in kidneys, bladder and prostate. However, the beneficial effect depends on whether that particular bacteria is sensitive (i.e. gets killed by the antibiotic) to norfloxacin. Since you have been having recurrent infections it is always better to start antibiotic according to urine culture and sensitivity. Since you are having improvement in your symptoms, norfloxacin is acting well. Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidus are good bacteria that will help in preventing recurrent UTI. They are safe to take with norfloxacin.Did you undergo a uroflowmetry (test to detect and obstruction in urine flow)? You may need to be evaluated and treated for any obstruction in urine flow due to prostate enlargement, since this can cause recurrent UTI.

(age creeping in)  but now lately I pee a lot and have dry mouth","Doctor":"Hi,Kidney stones usually do not cause any pain in thigh. Please find out from your treating physician, the exact cause of your pain. Taking steroid injections without a proper diagnosis can be harmful. Since you are passing more urine, you should check your blood sugar level to rule out diabetes. Please check if your doctor has prescribed any diuretic (drug to increase urine production) for your kidney stone. This can also make you pass a lot of urine and have dry mouth.The treatment of kidney stone depends on its size and your symptoms (like flank pain). Small stones less than 5 mm can be managed using medical therapy. Little larger stones can be managed by lithotripsy (breaking stone using shock waves) or flexible ureteroscopy (going inside the kidney through urine passage and breaking using laser). Stones larger than 1.5 to 2 cm are usually managed by removing them through a hole in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy, PCNL). Open surgeries for stones are obsolete now.General precautions for stones:1. Drink lot of fluids (keep urine clolorless & urine volume per 24 hr > 1.5 to 2 liters)2. Reduce salt intake3. Reduce intake of animal proteinsThese three things are universal for any kidney stone.If you are taking calcium supplements for bone health, try taking calcium citrate preparation since citrate prevent stone formation. Take calcium supplements along with meals and not in empty stomach. Milk and milk containing products must also be taken along with meals to prevent excessive calcium absorption which can promote stones. However, regular milk/calcium supplement is required.Other things you should follow are:- Increase fruit intake (except grapes)- Decrease coffee, tea, soft drinks, nuts and chocolatePotassium Magnesium citrate is available as tablets/syrup - this can reduce the size of stone or prevent stone formation in the long run. If you are arecurrent stone former, your Urologist will order urine test to check for abnormal levels of various salts which can promote or inhibit stone formation. Specific therapy can then be started accordingly.I am available for any more clarifications you need.Wish you good health.Dr. Raguram."},{"Patient":"I have an elevated PSA for the first time and follows taking allopurional to help control my uric acid levels.

My mother in law was admitted to the hospital on a Friday and by Saturday was moved to the CCU Unit and on Sunday had to have a ventilator. She has been diagnosed with a tumor in her left kidney. The doctors did not think that the tumor had anything to do with her becoming sepsis. The medications they were giving her to increase her blood pressure appears to have caused damage to her fingers on both hands and now it appears she will have to have them amputated. We were told that certain medications could cause this effect. They were telling us they had to give her pressures and that is what caused this. They explained that the pressures constrict the small vessels and that is what caused the damage. She was given 3 1/2 units of blood and I am not sure the amount of the platelets that were given. I believe the medication she was given was Levophed not sure I am correct on the spelling. She is 61 yrs old, weight of around 105 and about 5 1 has always been in relatively good health. I would like to know if this is a common side effect and does this happen often. Just concerned and upset that she is facing amputation.

I am also frightened that the specialit will tell me i must go on a low protien diet which will make it much more difficult for me to build muscle from workingout.I used to take protien powder for workingout but was told to stop by my doctor which i did before and during both urine tests so that it would not interfere with the results. I hope to one day beable to take my protein powder again but i am waiting until after i see my specialist so that i do not accidently damage my kidneys by taking it. How serious does my situation sound and do you thik i will ever beable to take my powder again or will i have to go on a low protien diet? Both the urine test from my physical and the 24 hour one showed protien in my urine and i have slightly foamy pee which i am told to believe is a sign of protien in your urine, but these are the only symptoms i have of anything being wrong with me. No one in my family has had kidney problems that i knw of and as i said before i am young and in very good shape. Thank you for any answers you can give to my questions.","Doctor":"Hi and thank you so much for this query. I am so sorry to hear about this high protein in urine. High protein in urine often signals kidney damage because the kidneys would normally not allow proteins to leak through depending on their sizes. In certain disease conditions, tiny proteins are over produced and they can pass even through normal kidneys. This means that it may signal a kidney damage or another disease condition in the body.I hope this addresses your query fully. Feel free to ask for clarifications and more information if need be. I wish you well. Thanks for utilizing our services, we very much appreciate it.Dr. Ditah, MD."},{"Patient":"Hi female with one kidney (left was removed before 6 yrs) i made US : post left nephrectomy status ..

I will try to say some thing on this issue.                   There are some tips to prevent the formation of the stones, depending upon the type of stone.                   First thing to prevent all sorts of stones is the drinking more water nearly 2 litres a day to prevent the saturation of the salts and hence the formation of the stones.                    1) Calcium Oxalate Stones can be prevented by-                  Reducing sodium by avoiding hot dogs,canned soups and vegetables,  processed frozen foods.                  Reducing animal protein, such as meat, eggs, and fish                  Getting enough calcium from food or taking calcium supplements with food.                  Aavoiding foods high in oxalate, such as spinach, rhubarb, nuts, and wheat bran.                 2) Calcium Phosphate Stones-                    Reducing sodium.                    Reducing animal protein.                    Getting enough calcium from food or taking calcium supplements. with food                3)Uric Acid Stones can be prevented by- Limiting animal protein.                     Lunche on meats.                   Fast food.                   Try these steps to prevent the kidney stones.                    I usually prescribe NEERI syrup, or cystone tablets for longer periods to prevent the formation of the kidney stones, or to desolve the formed stones.                    Wishing you good luck.

Still going on alternate day dialysis. He is also a BP, diabatic and heart patient, in the 2D echo report it showed that his heart pumping is 40%. Please suggest us and let us know that is there a chances of kidney recovery so that we can stop dialysis and start medication. Thanks advance... Regards, Abdul Hamed","Doctor":"Hi and thank you so much for trusting us with your health query.I am so sorry to hear about this kidney problem your father has. The indication of this dialysis does not really suggest that dialysis would soon be stopped. The reduction in creatinine level is thanks to the dialysis and not a recovery of the renal function. Patients with diabetes and hypertension most commonly go down with chronic renal failure which requires lifelong dialysis as oposed to acute that requires a short term dialysis. Because I lack the information concerning the exact diagnosis and indication for the dialysis, I will suggest you ask the nephrologist what the plan is. The definite way to get a patient with chronic kidney disease off dialysis is kidney transplant.I hope you find this helpful. Thank you so much for using our services and please feel free to for more information or clarifications if need be. I wish your father  the best of health.Dr. Ditah, MD."},{"Patient":"I recently had an ultrasound of my kidneys on December 23,2013 have not seen my docter yet but have a scheduled date in jan.2014.The findings were a 16mm cyst in the interpolar region .

Some people have mild pain; others have more severe pain. Some people have no symptoms, while for others, the first sign may be sudden cardiac arrest. However, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the likelihood you're having a heart attack.Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. The earliest warning may be recurrent chest pain (angina) that's triggered by exertion and relieved by rest. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart."},{"Patient":"Hi,I was in the ER 8 hours ago with severe pain from several kidney stones, one 5mm., that are about 15% of their way through.

I finally took myself off it nearly a year ago because I had lost nearly all of the swelling except that which appears towards the end of the day but is usually gone in the mornings when I wake up (probably from me being inclined for 6 to 8 hours ). My edema is probably the result of having bad airways to my lungs and simply not getting enough oxygen for my heart to pump properly, thus causing my kidneys to operate somewhat incorrectly.

Normally, urine contains many dissolved substances. At times, some materials may become concentrated in the urine and form solid crystals. These crystals can lead to the development of stones. Stones formed in the kidney are called kidney stones.

In your case stones are not so big and mild to moderate hydronephrosis is common among patients who have kidney stones. If your son kidney function is good yoour doctor may suggest conservative treatment. If stones resist to come in urine, they might suggest ESWL. But do remember this your urologist only can decide after complete examination of your son. Their is no need to be tensed by this and it is easily treatable condition.

I am Dr Thakker and shall be answering your question.I can very well understand your concerns about sugar levels in view of an impaired renal function.Diabetes is a metabolic disease wherein body's insulin secretion and or action are impaired. After 10 to 20 years of uncontrolled diabetes the kidney glomeruli get damaged. This eventually leads to renal failure . This condition is called as Diabetic Nephropathy. Many drugs used to treat diabetes are excreted by the kidneys, metformin being one among them. Hence these drugs are excluded once the kidney failure sets in.In your case the HbA1c is 6.7 which is a good news. A diabetic is expected to be well controlled when HbA1c is 6.5 and around. Your cholesterol levels are normal. This too is a good news for you.Your renal function is not normal as per the nurse. However I wish to know your serum creatinine levels and if you have proteinuria. You could ask your doctor for the detailed report. Metformin is contraindicated when serum creatinine is above 1.5 because of fear of lactic acidosis. Anti-inflammatory drugs are contraindicated in renal failure because they can aggravate the renal damage.I would like to reassure you that in such a situation we have some potent drugs to control your sugars. So do not worry much. You can be given sitagliptin, gliclazide as per creatinine clearance. If need be, regular insulin can be given in renal failure. I hope this helps you out. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to write back to me.Yours sincerely,Dr Thakker."},{"Patient":"my brtother had complcations after a heart surgery kidneys shut down they used a turbo lung resperator which caused the lungs to be very inflamed.They put him in a drug induced coma , stopped the drugs 5 days a go but he has not woke up??? why??? still can not breathe on own , and on diallies keeping vitals stable with meds.. any answers would be a great comfort ty Marie","Doctor":"Hi,Recovery following heart surgery can be complicated by many setbacks. Some degree of kidney impairment is relatively common after major surgery. Most drugs are passed out of the body through the kidneys so if the kidneys shut down, the drugs remain in the body for longer. This may be partly the cause of his prolonged coma. Another contributing cause may be related to neurological complications. There is a possibility he may have had a stroke and this will delay his recovery.I suggest you speak to his doctors are they will be able to explain the important details to you more fully.I hope your brother makes a speedy recovery.Regards,Dr K A Pottinger,MBChB  FRCA"},{"Patient":"My husband has RA and is on methotrexate injections along with a lot of other medications.

If stone is not found removed, will the stent be again placed after lithotripsy.","Doctor":"Hello there! Thank you for asking. DJ stents are basically put at the border of pelvis of kidney and ureter where the odds of stones are pretty likely. And these stents help the stones to pass if they are less than 5 mm. Above those they are hardly to pass and lithotripsy would be required and that lithotripsy would also be useless if the stone is in the lower third of the ureter as bone behind there (pelvis) absorbs the shock waves and thus vibration is not effective to breaak stone. so in nut shell. the scenario is incomplete with superadded infection so multiple directions to go for but the good news is it is safe and you will be relieved what ever the way is opted for you.

I went to the hospital where they checked me out and released me within the hour because the pain was bearable and they said it would be gone in about a week thinking is was just muscle spasms or bruised tissue but now almost 4 weeks later the pain is still there and focused to my right kidney mostly where it feels swollen and hard and is very painfull to touch. Theres no blood in my urine that I can notice, but I dont have an appetite, my skin is developing rashes at times, I cannot turn my back to the right without a sharp pain, and im just generally uncomfortable with that dull pain. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for posting your query,If I take from your description, then the situation requires reevaluation by a physician. I want to believe that by right kidney, you mean right flank as we can not be 100% sure that the pain is coming from the kidney but right sided flank pain could be as a result of injury to muscle tissues and organs beneath including kidney and spleen. If you are feeling hardness and pain around that area, then it is most unlikely due to internal organ damage but rather soft tissue damage (more peripherally). You could have injured the area without noticing during the accident, when was not noticed probably as a result of slow progress. For example, a soft tissue hematoma or hemorrhage due to damaged blood vessel could be developing gradually and only present as hard painful swelling some weeks later. The hematoma could even complicate to form an abscess depending if bacteria affected the area. The rashes could fairly not be related to this injury and if related then it might be likely due to the fact that the kidney is actually injured too. In any case, your situation obviously requires thorough medical evaluation and subsequently treatment.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I have been diagonosed with nephrotic syndrome on november 28 th 2013, and the doctor that saw me in the hospital wanted me to follow up with one in my home town and the one here is so busy traveling to town to town that i cant be seen till january 8th 2014 . i am getting weaker and weaker very sick to stomach constant direaha and loosing weight and cant find a doctor to see me ...can u get me one in the oklahoma city oklahoma area.....that will see me asap.......","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Health care magic forum.

It developed sometime in my last trimester of pregnancy but I didn t have Preeclampsia. I am not able to see a doctor due to no health insurance or money so I have not taken any medication to help lower my blood pressure. Occasionally, I would have heart palpitations (flutters) but they were faint and it happened once a week at the most or sometimes just once a month. I went in for a tooth extraction Tuesday Feb. 25th where I had to get 2 teeth removed but they were simple extractions. I was given Hydrocodone for pain and Ammoxicillin to prevent infection. Sometime Saturday March 1st, I felt the heart palpitations pick up and would feel them about 3 times every hour or so. I hadn t take the hydrocodone since Wednesday or Thursday the week of the extraction. But I was still taking the ammoxicillin. I had a friend come over that Saturday night and everything was fine when she was here. Sunday March 2nd, the heart palpitations seemed like they worsened so a friend of mine had given me a Xanax which seemed to have calmed them down and I was able to relax and sleep that night. A day or 2 after that, I started feeling weird and was getting lightheaded. It would come and go and I would also get heart palpitations a few times a day. Some were really hard and then some were really faint. I was told to stop taking the ammoxicillin by the dentist and see what happens after 24 hours. I stopped taking them around 1am Tuesday March 4th. Here and there I still get the heart flutters, but then I had people trying to tell me what to do which caused me to get angry and crying a lot so I know my blood pressure was through the roof at that point. I also had a little chest pressure. I had 1 or 2 heart flutters that night and I was feeling lightheaded. Then Wednesday March 5th, I was still feeling lightheaded but that would come and go. I didn t feel any chest pressure. It didn t stop me from eating or anything like that. But I started taking 2 teaspoons of Beetroot juice sometime that day because I was reading about it helping blood pressure. I also put cinnamon on my food, eating banana s and drinking nothing but water and vitamin water. It is Friday, March 7th, and sometimes I still feel the lightheadedness but not like it was. Sometimes when I drink, I begin to feel it while I am drinking or after I feel it. I also feel a little pressure on my chest and my heart pounding a little hard and fast. I even try singing and I start to feel the lightheadedness and chest pressure. It doesn t do that when I eat. I still get heart flutters but have only had 1 today and it was faint. I don t know if this may just be anxiety or something more serious. This didn t start happening until a few days after the tooth extraction which made me wonder if something may have caused it or if now my blood pressure is finally causing other problems which worries me because I do not have a lot of money or health insurance.

Which is turn causing back pressure to kidney resulting in enlarged kidney (Hydronephrosis).The goal of treatment for hydronephrosis is to restart the free flow of urine from the kidney and decrease the swelling and pressure that builds up and decreases kidney function.

In these cases i advise my patients to go for USG KUB to rule out any stone. Antibiotic will be of some help but will be not cure the pain and infection properly. Taking heavy doses of antibiotic without knowing the actual cause will be of no use and nose bleeding might be the side effect of it.

Now I am having all this flank pain/rt side pain extremely sharp at times, like a stabbing.  how can you acquire extra renal pelvis over a year I thought it was congenital?","Doctor":"Hi and thank you so much for this query.I am so sorry to hear about  this finding. Extra renal pelvis can only be gotten from embryogenesis. This has been there from the time the kidneys were formed. So it all happened when you were still in the womb. It all by itself presents no danger to health. That is most likely not the cause of your pain unless there is something like an infection, stone, obstruction, etc. This should not cause your doctors to stop thinking it is the cause of your symptoms. It is congenital and never acquired. Please, get a second opinion from another urologist/radiologist. The reading of your scans or ultrasounds must be problematic.I hope you find this helpful.

I need some advice on this...","Doctor":"hello dear, your brother is having a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease with probably single ventricular physiology and reduced pulmonary blood flow. This usually needs multiple surgeries and single ventricle repair in which the single functional ventricle is made systemic and the veinous flow is diverted directly to Pulmonary arteries.That's why he underwent BT shunt for optimising pulmonary blood flow. And then BDG as a first stage of Fontan's repair in which the SVC is connected to Pulmonary artery.Now usually this is followed by another surgery in which the IVC is also connected with the Pulmonary artery and this is generally done at the age of 10-12 years. But in your brother's case, this is not done. May be because the unbalancing of the ventricles was not that severe and one of the ventricles was able to handle at least half of the veinous flow. This is called as hemi-Fontan surgery.Please show your brother to a paediatric Cardiologist and get a detailed echo to see the functioning of BDG shunt and also the native ventricles and valves.

She had suffered from Acute Renal Failure about 4-5 years ago. She was on dialysis for a month & then recovered. She has also had a history of pitta (not aware of the medical term) - there is swelling like mosquito bite but bigger in size all over her body, followed by fever & complete inability to pass urine and then swelling all over her body. This happens mostly during the winters every year. She is also very sensitive to medicines, not all of them suit her. In case the medicine doesn t suit her, the first impact has always been on passing of urine. In such situations, our nephrologist normally recommends Dytor 40 & in case of infection, Cital syrup. Over the years, she has become very weak. She is barely able to stand & walk by herself. Q1 - Is there a was to prevent this situation? Q2 - From past 2-3 years, she has been constantly complaining of burning sensation. It started after the ARF. Initially the burning sensation was only limited to palms & soles. It has now gradually spread up to her thighs. She had undergone a fissure surgery 2 years ago. Since then the burning sensation is in her rectum too. She is also unable to pass stools for several days in a row, even if given laxatives. We have got this problem diagnosed from 3 surgeons, 4 physicians & our nephrologist. All of them thought that this was due to deficiency of vitamins in the body & accordingly prescribed medication. However, on getting blood & advanced blood tests done, we have found there to be no deficiency. The doctors now have asked us to not visit again (or visit once in six month) stating that it s psychological or it s not curable. We had also gone to a neurologist but his medicines had side effect on my mother & again she was hospitalized. Before hospitalization, he had asked us get some nerves test done but after the side effect episode, he said the problem is not curable as it s due to old age.

I am a 31 years old female with 2 kids (4 year & 1 year old)  With my first pregnancy my gynecologist had difficulty taking my blood presure due to the fact that he said my heart skip beats.  I went for a check up and they diognosed me with Barlow syndrome.  Everything went well and I started getting rapid heartrates ones every 3-4 months.  With my second pregnancy when I was about 7 months pregnant I started getting rapid heart beats once to twice a day, short breaths as well as feeling dizzy.  I went to the cadioligist and while they do a ECG and heat sonar my heart beat was 220 bpm.  I was diognosed with RVOT They admitted me to Cardio ICU and put my on beta blockers for the rest of my pregnancy.  2 months after my baby was born I had to go for a ablation.  Unfortunatly it was unsuccessfull as after 2 hours in theater and they pumped me full of adrenaline they could not find the impulse causing my condition.  It a year later and I can only recall having it 3 - 4 times.  However, last week I helped my husband moving a relatively heavy peace of furniture and about 5 -10 min later I felt my heart racing again.  I counted it and counted 210 bpm and I felt dizzy for quite a while.  I could see/feel my heart pounding.  Luckaly it did not last a long time.  3-4 Days later I went to my excersise clas and we did a lot of excersise using own body wait.  I started having dizzyness intervals that lasted about 30 seconds (did not bother me alot), but when I got home and started went to bed, I could feel my heart beat and it felled the if my heard was beating so hard the bed was \\"shaking\\", even my dog which was lying next to me looked at my chest all funny.  I was wondering.  Could it be due to me carrying heavy things causing my rapid heart beat?

Just really worrying","Doctor":"hello,thank you for ansking this question,your problem seem to be related with a kidney infection.Kidney infection (pyelonephritis) is a specific type of urinary tract infection that generally begins in your urethra or bladder and travels up into your kidneys.  Signs and symptoms of a kidney infection may include:    Fever    Back, side (flank) or groin pain    Abdominal pain    Frequent urination    Strong, persistent urge to urinate    Burning sensation or pain when urinating    Pus or blood in your urine (hematuria)    Antibiotics will usually clear the infection. An antibiotic is usually prescribed straightaway if a kidney infection is suspected, even before the result of the urine test is known. Some germs (bacteria) are resistant to some antibiotics. Therefore, sometimes a change of antibiotic may be needed if the urine test shows a bacterium which is resistant to the initial antibiotic. The course of antibiotics is for 7-14 days, depending on which one is used.    Painkillers such as paracetamol can ease pain and reduce a high temperature (fever). Stronger painkillers may be needed if the pain is more severe. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen are not usually recommended, as they may cause an increased risk of problems with the working of the kidney during a kidney infection.    Lots of fluid should be taken to prevent dehydration.I strongly suggest for a repeat to the urine test, and a culture of it.Kind regards"},{"Patient":"hi good morning, Doc, my i ask how can i reduce my total bilirubin, 1st i get met my medical annd i got 1.89 tb then after they told me to take silymarine (legalon) 140mg and phospolhiphides multivitamins (essentiale) for 1 week and 3 x day, then after a week they try it again but instead to make it lower it make higher and make it 2.29, i dont know what happen i dont eat meat anything with oil i only eat fish, may i ask what should i take and what should i avoid to eat i'll try to oatmeal and banana only for everyday to make it lower it is ok how about medicine should i take the silymarine lower mg instead of 140 mg  i just want to make it to 1.0 level,  thank you very much","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.Diet or silimarine wont rather help with elevated bilirubin level. You should rather be well diagnosed to find out what is the reason of such elevated bilirubin. There is many reasons of bilirubin problem including gallstones in bile ducts, pancreas cancer (this can be the first symptom), liver issues (viral infection, cirrhosis, tumors), blood hemolysis. I suggest you to do not wait any longer with it. You should have blood work, liver tests (AST,ALT,GGTP,AP), liver virus tests (HbS-Ag, Anti-HCV), abdominal CT.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"My dad is in a rehab center with a broken ankle.

Is the urine stream weak?This could be related to prostate pathology, an infection, diabetes, etc. In order to get clues and investigate to establish the cause, please let you father get consulted.

I told my wife that I was still sleepy, so i went back to sleep. I slept about an extra 2-3 hours, and when I woke up, I still felt pretty tired.

Forum.I would come up with these possibilities for this type of pain in abdomen on LEFT side , these  includes.1 Left renal stone , diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound of kidney.As all symptoms are suggestive of pain in the left side of kidney.2 Second possibility may be of peptic ulcer disease ( hyper acidity ) ,diagnosis can be confirmed by upper G I endoscopy.Try raising he head of your bed about 4 inches above with blocks.It might also help to avoid eating or drinking 2 hour before you lie down.To control stomach acid one should not eat chocolate or spicy or fatty or oily foods.Also take some antacid but if symptoms are severe then you may need drugs like proton pump inhibitors.3 Next possible reason may be pancreatitis . Get in blood examination for serum amylase and lipase.As this pain is radiating to the back so may be a pancreatic pain.In my opinion this is not a pain of appendix as appendix is always on the right side ( one to two exception in 1 million cases on left side).In my opinion consult another physician and get his opinion.Good luck.Dr. HET"},{"Patient":"I have diabetes, dark urine, leg cramps, rapid pulse at times, metallic taste, sometimes I feel weak, flank pain and hip pain.

But this will be associated with other acute symptoms. Your symptoms are not suggestive of bladder injury.Blood in urine needs to be evaluated for its cause. Renal infection, Stones or malignant lesions could result in blood in urine. If you are on blood thinning medication they can also cause blood in urine.As you have already got ultrasound done, better to get cystoscopy done for bladder lesions and biopsy from suspicious area.

Unfortunately many who have taken Lithium (Lithobid) for prolonged period can develop kidney problems and it is essential to withdraw the drug at that point.

I was recovering from a bout of whT was most likely viral  bronchitis as it was not improving with antibiotics, but with a nebulizer and prednisone ect.  I had litho in both kidneys and stent in the left that was removed at the end of procedure.  I awoke in agony only on the left side and my recovery has been very painful and slow with daily fever (usually in evening). Any where from 99.3 to 101.2.  My doctor showed no concern for the fever.  Finally after 2 1/2 weeks we insisted on a cat scan which showed my left kidney is twice the size of the right kidney and there is a large hematoma.  He still shows no concern for fever or this kidney.  He says it will resolve on its own.  I went to my primary doctor and she ordered chest X-ray and CBC looking for infection.  Every thing came back fine except my hemoglobin is low.  What could possibly be causing my fever?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. Fever indicates some kind of 'INFLAMMATION' somewhere in the body. Given your history and clinical condition, it most likely is emanating from the Kidney/ urinary tract. Not always is fever from infetion but it is the most common cause, so urinary infection or infection in the haematoma needs to be ruled out. I suggest you get repeat blood count (CBC), CRP, Kidney function tests (Sodium, Pottassium, BUN, Creatinine), urine routine and urine culture at the earliest. You might need to start emperical antibiotics (unless you are already on one) untill you get the results of the above. Haemoglobin is probably low since you have had bleeding and possible infection as well. Hope this helps. Regards.

Even if a stone is not in kidney and has passed down the urine tube which is the ureter, an ultrasound scan can pick up features of such a stone having gone down that passage by means of noting any swelling of the kidney. In combination with an X-ray KUB, we can be certain that to an extent of 90% that there is no stone, but if a CT scan says there is no stone, then you can be sure to the extent of 100%, in which case, the pain in your left side could be due to some other reason.Hope I have been able to reassure you."},{"Patient":"I am 16 years old girl and already a few days my heart palpitations.

I have systemic lupus (calm). I usually get lab work done 1-2 times a yr. to check my kidney, etc. due to the lupus.  Three yrs. ago, June 2010 I've been having occult blood (1) in my urine. I asked my Rheumatalogist and she said I probably took the urine test close to my period or near the end of my period and that's why it showed the occult blood, so I didn't worry anymore. This July I had my lab work done and again the occult blood (1) showed up (as it has been in the last 3 yrs.). This time however my Rheumatologist was concerned and told me to see a urologist. Because I couldn't see a urologist sooner, I went to see my family doctor. He ordered a urine test and an ultra sound of the kidney. He diagnosed me as microhematuria. When I finally saw the urologist, she ordered a urine cytology and rec'd that I get a cystoscopy esp. because my lab showed  occult blood (1) along with rbc 4-10 . She wanted to make sure that I don't have a bladder cancer or kidney disease so a cystoscopy needed to be done. When I did the urine test that day, I believe the cup was contaminated that's why it showed the rbc 4-10. When repeated, it didn't show rbc 4-10, but normal  rbc 0-2 (below)Results:   1. Urine---   no infection, occult blood (1), rbc 0-2   2. Ultra Sound of Kidney---   3 x 5 mm nonobstructing stone in the inferior pole of right kidney3. Urine cytology---   benignI recently talked to a 2nd urologist at a social gathering and he told me that I should get an x-ray, kub to see accurately the size of the kidney stones, etc.  He actually rec'd a ct scan but changed his mind when I told him that I was trying to get pregnant. So with that info., he rec'd me to get an x-ray instead. He also rec's that I get rid the stones asap even though I have no pain because if I get pregnant it would be bad.  QUESTIONS:1.  Should I get the x-ray done when the ultra sound already shows the amt. and size of the stones? I would think the ultra sound and x-ray both show the same size and amt. of stones even though they are two different tests.2.  Should I still get the cystoscopy even though I have benign in urine cytology and  that I have occult blood due to kidney stone (from ultra sound) ?3. Should I get rid of the stones since I'm trying to get pregnant even though I have no pain?4. The 2nd urologist rec'd I get lithotripsy done soon before I get pregnant even though I'm not in pain. Is this the correct or rec'd procedure?Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi there, sle can affect kidney best way to detect is RBC in urine examination> 4, urine spot protein creatinine ratio > 0.2 and high dsdna and low c3 levels . Then we call it lupus nephritis.  In your case stone is also present. So rbc can be because of stone also. It is important to rule out SLE nephritis as it is more dangerous. Xray msy not be helpful.  If you wantvimaging study to document stone size and number then ct kub plain should be done. It has no effect on future pregnancy.  If the stone is a single stone of 3 to 5 mm as in the ultrasound.  There is no need of anyvtreatment before pregnancy.  If a problem arises it can be tackled as such chances are very less as it is a very small stone. Chancesvof cancer are only there if your age is greater than 50 yr in that case also ct should be done before cystoscopy. And most likely cystoscopy will not be needed.

I am prescribed 2mg of hydromorphone every 6 hours. I am now experiencing a really bad pain in my lower left back that is radiating into my left leg.  The pain medication is not helping. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi,The pain may be due to kidney stone and since 2mg of hydromorphone every 6 hours is not helping in relieving the pain you need to discuss with your obstetrician in the further line of management. If the calculus does not pass, it may initiate premature labor, produce intractable pain, cause urosepsis in the setting of urinary tract infection, or interfere with the progression of normal labor. Since the size is too big to pass the best management will be surgical.  There are many options in the surgical management (stent placement, ureteroscopy with stone manipulation, percutaneous nephrostomy) and hence discuss with your doctor about the same. They will be the right person to decide further management.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi- My cholesterol total was 323...I went on a strict diet for 6 weeks. Now my total cholesterol is 281.

Urinary incontinence is not uncommon at your age, and if it is a question of mild urge incontinence, life style changes could help, such as avoiding caffeinated beverages, regular toilet habits, but if the problem gets worse, you could benefit from use of medication such as tolterodine which reduces urine leak.

He blamed my pain on gas and constipation ( which I know for sure is NOT true) and told me to get ahold of a kidney specialist, that he would put the number etc. on my paperwork. He did an abdominal cat scan, said there was a 3 mm kidney stone in my kidney and that my pain was caused from gas and constipation. I asked him about the PKD, because by then it had sunk in and he was very confused that I had no idea what he was talking about. He again said yes, you have PCOS and PKD. He wouldn't answer any questions I had about it after that. When I got home, I checked the paperwork, but it said nothing about my kidneys at all. No number to a doctor he recommends... nothing! He put on it that I was treated for constipation and gas! I went to get all of my records since I am tired of getting no answers and I want to take them to a specialist. Since the emergency room papers say nothing about PKD my doctor office won't refer me to a specialist. While I was reading cat scans and Ultrasounds, they said twice that I have medullary Sponge Kidney and mentions numerous times about Echogenic renal pyramids, lots of stones etc, but nothing about tumors on my kidney. I am still having left sided pain and occasionally the right side also. I see blood a few times a week and this been has been going for months! There is PKD in my family, the only one that we know of was my great grandmother, she died from complications at 37. My younger sister has kidney issues also. I am very confused as to what to do now!? I can't get recommended to a specialist for this, I need answers! What can I do?","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query,early diagnosis and appropriate management is important. A careful review by a nephrologist is required. PKD predisposes to chronic kidney disease. It is therefore important as of now for you to measure serum urea and creatinine levels, as well as serum Calcium and Potassium levels. This shall give a clear information about kidney function. I suggest you book an appointment with a nephrologist. An abdominal ultrasound is needed to exclude cysts in the liver since these two conditions usually go together. kind regards"},{"Patient":"Hello.  I am 46 years old.  When I was 5 years old I had reconstructive surgery on my ureters/bladder.  I think I had something called Reflux nephropathy.  Once in surgery they discovered I had no valve covers to keep the urine from coming back up my ureters into my kidneys.  They also discovered I have 2 ureters on each side.  They had to make valve covers out of my own tissue.  About 19 years ago I stopped drinking soda/pop because when I did my kidneys would ache.  Now I only drink water.  Is this something I need to get checked periodically?  I had severe pain in my left kidney two days ago and it still hurts.   I have had a bad headache since and my knees/joints have started hurting.  I have started taking Cranberry pills and drinking extra water. Since I have a history with my kidneys/bladder I'm thinking maybe I should get checked out, but dont want to if not necessary.  Any help would be appreciated.  (On a side note,  I eat an extremely healthy diet. Organic mostly. And I started drinking Zija (moringa) 2 months ago.  Thank you.","Doctor":"HiThanks for your query.Patients with past history of reflux disease are often at risk of developing UTIs.So even though your symptoms are not very classic I would recommend that you undergo a urine analysis and an ultrasound of the kidneys.This will tell us if you have an infection and based on the results we can proceed with the appropriate treatment.Hope this helpsGood luck."},{"Patient":"hi my mom is diabetic recently she is had this creatinine level 3.1 so we hospitalized her and that came down.She was prescribed wyslone during that time but the doctor still continued the medicine that has raised her sugar level to 350 which has never happened before.Can it be a side effect she is also experiencing weakness in legs and puffy face","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for the query to H.C.M. Forum.I would come up with these possibilities for this high level of serum creatinine & sugar level, these includes.1 Chronic renal failure, diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound of both KIDNEYS with M R I . Also confirmed by examination of blood urea level. As your mother is a diabetic patient and puffiness over face is an  indication of renal failure.2 Elevated level of blood sugar is not due to wysolone ( prednisolone) , however puffiness over face may be due to retention of water as a side effect of steroid.3 Weakness in the legs may be due to anemia or hypoproteinaemia . Diagnosis can be confirmed by examination of hemoglobin and protein level.In my opinion consult an urologist and get his opinion. Good luck for your mother.Dr. HET"},{"Patient":"My dad (60 years) has kidney failure for one year now (both kidneys damaged) due to wrong medication received from a doctor, he was on pd for a few mths after his catheter was infected, he has now began doing hemo once again after a surgery to get his fistula running.

The ortho said there was not anything he could do for me.

Assuming that you are 40 years, and have a body weight of 70 kg, your Creatinine levels are not too worrisome, but would need follow up.

In any case, there are certain other conditions like infections of the cervix or vagina, any tumors on the cervix or uterus may also cause intermittent bleeding and these need to be ruled out. When women with similar complaint walk into my clinic, I perform a vaginal examination to see for infections or tumors, do a pap smear to screen for any cancer and if needed get an ultrasound done for any causes in the uterus.

I know how concerned you can be having just a single kidney.The symptoms you have described are very very nonspecific and cannot be entirely attributed to the kidneys. It could be from the muscles of the back because the kidney wouldn't produce twitching and spasms. Muscles do this. if it were a kidney problem, pain is often inevitable in acute aggressions and either constant or intermittent. I don't really think that is the case right now.Because you have just a single kidney, if this problem should persist beyond 24hours, please consult a doctor and make sure all is okay especially with the remaining kidney.Excess alcohol consumption is not good for the body.

I would suggest doing a Urine culture since it is the most accurate examination to check confirm an infection and it also identifies the bacteria and tells us what antibiotics are appropriate to treat the infection.With the bulge on the right side of your abdomen may be a surgical hernia. You may need to see a general surgeon so he can properly assess the lump.

I would suggest seeing a Gynecologist so she can examine your vagina for any lesions or discharge.

Since upto now i don't have problem but may be in future it create. So please advise.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. The kidneys are two organs, each about the size of a fist, located in the upper part of a person's abdomen, toward the back. The kidneys filter wastes and extra fluid from the blood to form urine. They also regulate amounts of certain vital substances in the body. When cysts form in the kidneys, they are filled with fluid. PKD cysts can profoundly enlarge the kidneys while replacing much of the normal structure, resulting in reduced kidney function and leading to kidney failure.When PKD causes kidneys to fail-which usually happens after many years-the patient requires dialysis or kidney transplantation. About one-half of people with the most common type of PKD progress to kidney failure, also called end-stage renal disease (ESRD).Please do not worry as many patients live for years on dialysis.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I had a living donor kidney transplant in June 2012.

The pain usually radiates to the groin or even a leg. Such strong pain appears because a stone moves through the ureter and irritate it. Sometimes it can stuck. In such case, urine blockage can destroy the kidney. Morphine and Codeine are not a good medicines in case of smooth muscles spasm pain (like kidney pain). Its because morphine causes this muscles additional spasm. So she should rather be prescribed smooth muscles relaxing medicines and if it wont help, Pethidine instead of morphine.I suggest her to consult urologist instead of waiting for CT and consider urography.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"I'm on ocella BC for the fourth month..

He had his catheter moved last June as it was much too low.  Since then he has been retaining fluid in his abdomen.  He recently had a CAT scan and a ecocardiogram which showed a heart problem which his doctor said could be controlled with medication.  While in the hospital, his blood pressure dropped so low he was given a bag of saline solution which raised it but he was taken off this medication for his heart.  Now he is at home and has a physical therapist come to our home twice a week and he is doing light exercises but his biggest problem, which has been with him for about three months, is shortness of breath.  It is from all of the fluid in his abdomen pressing on his diaphram, etc.  He has increased his trouser size by two inches.  I called this to the attention of his nephrologist as his stomach is like a big bowl of jelly.  Nothing is being done to take care of this fluid except the doctor has put him back on hemodialysis with no reduction of fluid.  Is there a possibility that there is a leak inside from his catheter or could it be a buildup of fluids from the peritoneal dialysis which I understand does not always completely flush all the fluids out of his body?

However i think it may be cystitis . I have the implanon bar now in my arm 2 and a half years. It has only dawned on me recently that the implanon may be the cause of it. I suffer from these infections many times through the year and it seems to come more often when I get my period. What actually happens is I can feel the kidney infection/cystitis/ uti coming on and I get excrutiating severe pains. These pains would start inside the opening of my vagina, it would effect urinating as sometimes it would be sore, i would feel like i have to urinate often. But most of the pain is inside my vagina and i get very sharp pains coming from my lower abdomin and all around my vaginal area inside. Usually within the next day or two i would get my period. However this is not always the case. I am getting very worried as the pain i experience isnt natural. I cannot go anywhere or do anything only stay in my bed with howater bottle. I am very concerned as I am only 20 and I can get many of these infections throughout the year. Also, I think sexual intercourse may not be helping as sometimes when i get these infections I would have had sex a day or two before hand. I really want t fing a solution to my problem, I take anti-biotics for this and although it clears the infection up in about a week or so the problem is still there as these infections are reoccurring regularly.

Its not related to the arm implant. Since it is recurring frequently you need some investigations to find the cause. You need urine culture, vaginal swab culture, ultrasound of abdomen. Check your blood sugar. You may need an x-ray call voiding cystourethrogram to look for reflux of urine into the kidneys.

It feels like urine is moving around the stone but only in small amounts and that there is some resistance but not enough to cause colicky pain or kidney dilation. I've been drinking lots of water and lemon juice and the stone still hasn't come out. I wonder about proteinuria because there is a small amount of frothing (barely noticeable) when I urinate and the bubbles don't go away for some time. Also, there is occasionally blood as sometimes my urine is orange in coloration. What should I do? How long does it take for a stone to seriously impair my kidney?","Doctor":"HiThanks for your query.The clinical course of a kidney stone depends on its size, number and location. So if you have not already done it, I suggest that you get an ultrasound or a CT scan of the kidneys, ureter and bladder. I would also recommend a urine R&M.Based on the results of the above tests we will be able to determine the further treatment.Hope this helpsGood luck."},{"Patient":"Hi,  I am 74yrs old and have been told I have chronic kidney disease level four.

Two Surgerys last year to correct one lap and one open. Was pain free for approximately 10 months.  Two months ago my BP started going up I have always been around 120/70. In August I was getting bad HA BP was 150/90, three weeks ago my right kidney started hurting and hasnt stopped, went back to doctoe this past Monday BP 142/98, going back to Urologists tommorrow, took all I could do today not to go to ER.To much pain","Doctor":"hi,  Sorry about your predicament. I guess by kinked ureter to your right kidney you mean retrocaval ureter which means ureter goes behind the large blood vessel and it is compressed by it. You need to consult your urologist as you are still getting pain 10 months after surgery. There is a possibility that your ureter is still obstructed. You will need certain radiological investigation which your urologist will advise you.  Your increase in BP is most likely not related to your surgery. It is incidental and you will need physicians opinion for that. Your previous surgery will not cause hypertension unless your right kidney has become non-functioning."},{"Patient":"Hello I had/have PKD and had both kidneys removed about 8 yrs ago. Both were over 13lbs  & had to be removedMy nephro only has me on Phos-lo, sensipar and Prilosec.

I suggested testosterone he laughed at me and asked why I wanted erections? I have read it is better than epo? Can you help? what do you think?","Doctor":"hi,   As you said you are CKD stage 4 and you are not yet diaysis dependent. Itching is one of the symptom of CKD. It is called renal itch or uremic pruritis. Mechanism of renal itch is still not yet understood properly and hence treatment of this has been less than satisfactory. Various drugs are used with some benifit like naltrexone, ondancetron, oral acivated charcoal or ultraviolet-B irradiation. Dont take these drugs without nephrologists consultation.  EPO and iron injections are best for your Haemoglobin. Testosterone is not useful.

Kidney stone explains your pain, nausea and dark urine which means blood in your urine. The floating tissue in your urine is most likely blood clot.   3 mm stone usually pass spontaneously and only thing you need to do is take good quantity of water and symptomatic treatment for pain.

If going to rehab is not an option, then rather than quitting this abruptly, try reducing the dose of oxycodone gradually before quitting. Go very slow, not more than 5 mg per week, and even slower if you wish. Keep yourself hydrated. Use over the counter medicines if there are mild withdrawal symptoms.

The second trip was for extreme numbness and prickly sensation in the entire left side of my body.  I was concerned that I may be having a stroke.  A barium swallow test revealed that I have a hital hernia.  Interested in what my options for this malady might be.  Have trouble sleeping, low energy, depression and was gaining weight.   After last emergency trip the attending doctor found that my thyroid was low and I am now on 25 mcg of levothyroxine.

I think the vagus nerve is causing my heart palpitations and the breathing problems or mimicking the troubled heart systems.

I was given medication to use tablets and Noculi syrup and i took it for 1 month and later i got UTI again after 2 months and at that time the Urine culture showed negative but i was seeing some burning sensation during urine passage . After medication for 1 week , i was ok. Again now , i had the same sensation while passing urine and did my Urine culture and it showed Few gram positive cocci in pairs seen . My urine routine showed PUs cells 2-4 , Epithelial cells 2-4 , PH 5.5 and specific gravity 1.010 , rest of them are negative/Nil. I wanted to know why the UTI is repeating . I assume UTI is very rare in men and i would want suggestion if there are any problem with my kidneys / prostate . Once i pass urine and bend downwards , i see leakage of urine . I doubt if i have any issue wiht my prostate . What are the type of checks that i need to undergo to rule this out ? Pls advice .","Doctor":"Hi there,Thanks for your query. I appreciate your concerns.1.  Firstly, repeated UTI takes place in the presence of kidney stones. 2.  Commonest cause of failed response of antibiotics to UTI is that the culprit bacteria/organism's resistance to prescribed antibiotic.3. Third cause can be that UTI is due to fungal infection which requires anti-fungal drugs and NOT antibiotics.The next time you have UT, get your urine tested for fungi also; order for URINE CULTURE: the test will isolate the causative agent and also show the antibiotics to which the bacteria is sensitive to. Consult your doctor who will then prescribe the most sensitive antibiotic which SHOULD BE TAKEN FOR AT LEAST 10 DAYS.Please repeat your ultrasound to exclude the possibility of a small stone having flowed with urine from the kidney to urinary bladder. Your symptoms are suggestive of infection of urinary bladder and urethra.Hope I have addressed your query to your satisfaction. If you have any further questions, I will be more than happy to help you.However, if you do not have any further clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.Wish you a speedy recovery and good health.Fond regards and best wishes,Dr. (Col) R Karanwal"},{"Patient":"I have been experiencing UTI and had kidney stones removed from both kidneys. Since the surgeries I have had bouts of chills along with fever . I was diagnosed with a bacterial infection , and given an antibiotic . I got a clean bill of health from my urologist. I am having a hard time getting back to feeling like my normal self. The surgeries were on July 10, 2013 and the second on August 1, 2013. Each time I had a stent inserted for a couple of weeks. They have been removed. I am 71 years old. I wasn t feeling well today. I napped a bit. I took my temp when I got up and it was 95.9. I have not been very active. I feel like my nerves have been shot since my surgery. I also experience bouts of crying. Do you think this is normal??","Doctor":"Hi ! good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef , a general surgeon answering your query.Your bouts of chills along with fever may be due the persisting urinary tract infection post surgery and stenting. If I would have been your treating doctor, I would have advised you for a fresh urine routine and culture sensitivity test to know the best suitable antibiotic for your UTI. I would also go for a pre and post void ultrasound abdomen to rule see the amount of residual urine and the state of kidney , ureter,bladder and prostate. If the residual urine is significant, this could be a factor for your persisting urinary infection, and to cure this, the cause has to be treated most possible being an enlarged prostate at this age of yours. You have to discuss this with your urologist, who I suppose must have taken care to look for this.Today it seems you did not have any fever as stated in your temperature recording. It seems that you have got some kind of depression post surgery, which could be normal. You have to be brave enough to counter this depression to be active again.If the depression bothers you more for a longer duration, then you may have to consult a psychiatrist.Thanks for using healthcaremagic forum for your health query.

You have not mentioned how recently your surgery was done. If it is less than a week possibly it is post operative pain.

You can be on surveillance for as long as you want. Usually the benign tumor will not grow faster that 3-4mm/yr. However if there is any rapid growth you will need intervention.

Your mother is more prone for stone formation because of gout. In this condition she will have high blood level of uric acid which is excreted in the urine in high concentration. This leads to recurrent stone formation. If you have the stone with you, get it analysed for composition of stone. Few tips for preventing the stones are    1. Drink adequate water atleast 2-3ltr per day    2. low salt diet    3. She can take urinary alkalising agents like potassium citrate after consulting her doctor    4.
