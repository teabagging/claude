Determine the range of values for m.","solution":" Solution:# Part 1: Finding the function expression between y and xGiven the linear relationship between the selling price x and the weekly sales quantity y, we can express it as y = kx + b. From the table, we have two points that can help us determine k and b:1. When x = 60, y = 80, which gives us the equation 60k + b = 80.2. When x = 70, y = 60, which gives us the equation 70k + b = 60.Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:[70k + b - (60k + b) = 60 - 80][10k = -20][k = -2]Substituting k = -2 into the first equation:[60(-2) + b = 80][-120 + b = 80][b = 200]Thus, the function expression between y and x is y = -2x + 200. Therefore, we have:[boxed{y = -2x + 200}]# Part 2: Determining the selling price for maximum weekly profitLet the weekly profit be w yuan. The profit for selling each kilogram of fruit is the selling price minus the cost price, which is (x - 40) yuan. The total profit is this margin multiplied by the number of kilograms sold, which gives us:[w = (x - 40)(-2x + 200)][= -2x^2 + 280x - 8000][= -2(x^2 - 140x + 4000)][= -2(x - 70)^2 + 1800]Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 70. At this point, the maximum profit is 1800 yuan. Therefore, we have:[boxed{text{Selling price} = 70 text{ yuan/kg, Maximum profit} = 1800 text{ yuan}}]# Part 3: Determining the range of values for mGiven the new cost price increases by m yuan per kilogram, the profit function becomes:[w = (x - 40 - m)(-2x + 200)][= -2x^2 + 2(m + 140)x - 200(m + 40)]The axis of symmetry for this quadratic function is at:[x = frac{-b}{2a} = frac{2(m + 140)}{2(-2)} = frac{m + 140}{2}]For the profit to decrease as the selling price increases beyond 76 yuan per kilogram, the axis of symmetry must be less than or equal to 76, which gives us:[frac{m + 140}{2} leq 76][m + 140 leq 152][m leq 12]Since m > 0, the range of values for m is 0 < m leq 12.

Finding the Midpoint of BC: The midpoint formula gives us the midpoint M_{BC} as M_{BC} = left(frac{-1+4}{2}, frac{3+(-2)}{2}right) = left(frac{3}{2}, frac{1}{2}right).2. Determining the Slope of BC: The slope formula for line BC is frac{-2-3}{4-(-1)} = frac{-5}{5} = -1. Given that the Euler line of triangle ABC is the perpendicular bisector of BC and knowing the slope of BC is -1, the slope of the Euler line, being perpendicular, will be the negative reciprocal, which is 1.3. Equation of the Euler Line: The equation of the line with slope 1 passing through the midpoint of BC can be written as y - frac{1}{2} = 1 cdot (x - frac{3}{2}), simplifying to y - x = -1 or x - y - 1 = 0.4. Distance from Circle Center to Euler Line: The circle M is centered at (3,0), and the Euler line is x - y - 1 = 0. Using the distance formula, d = frac{|3 - 0 - 1|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}. Since d=r, we find r = sqrt{2}, leading to the equation of circle M being (x-3)^2+y^2=2.5. Distance from Circle Center to Line x - y + 1 = 0: For the line x - y + 1 = 0, the distance from the center of M, (3,0), is d_{1} = frac{|3 - 0 + 1|}{sqrt{2}} = 2sqrt{2}.6. Minimum and Maximum Distances to Line x - y + 1 = 0: The minimum distance from a point on circle M to the line is the distance from the center minus the radius, 2sqrt{2} - sqrt{2} = sqrt{2}, and the maximum distance is 2sqrt{2} + sqrt{2} = 3sqrt{2}.7. Locating Point A: Solving the system of equations for the circle centered at B with radius 5, (x+1)^2+(y-3)^2=25, and the Euler line x - y - 1 = 0, yields point A as either (4,3) or (-1,-2). Given that point A must lie outside circle M: (x-3)^2+y^2=2, we can disregard the other solution.8. Determining |PB| When angle PBA Is Minimized or Maximized: Noting that when point P lies on circle M, and line PB is tangent to the circle, angle PBA is minimized or maximized.

We start with the given condition that ( a! + (a+2)! ) divides ( (a+4)! ) for some nonnegative integer ( a ). We need to find all possible values of ( a ).2. First, express the factorials in a more manageable form:   [   (a+2)! = (a+2)(a+1)a!   ]   [   (a+4)! = (a+4)(a+3)(a+2)(a+1)a!   ]3. Substitute these into the given condition:   [   frac{(a+4)!}{a! + (a+2)!} = frac{(a+4)(a+3)(a+2)(a+1)a!}{a! + (a+2)(a+1)a!}   ]4. Factor out ( a! ) from the denominator:   [   frac{(a+4)(a+3)(a+2)(a+1)a!}{a!(1 + (a+2)(a+1))} = frac{(a+4)(a+3)(a+2)(a+1)}{1 + (a+2)(a+1)}   ]5.

Clearly, ( (a+1)(a+2) ) must divide ( k ). Let ( k = (a+1)(a+2)j ) for some integer ( j ). Substituting this into the equation, we get:   [   (a+3)(a+4) = j(1 + (a+1)(a+2))   ]7.

The solution is x in{-5} cup[1 ; a]. For the solution to include points that are 4 units apart, a must be such that a-1=4, i.e., a=5. However, since a<-5, this case does not provide valid solutions.2) -5 leqslant a < 1. The points are x=-5, x=1, and x=a. The solution is x in{-5} cup[a ; 1]. For the solution to include points that are 4 units apart, a must be such that 1-a=4, i.e., a=-3. This case provides valid solutions for a in[-5 ;-1].3) a=1. The inequality becomes (x-1)^2 sqrt{x+5} leqslant 0 and is satisfied only at x=-5 and x=1. This case does not provide valid solutions.4) a>1. The points are x=-5, x=1, and x=a. The solution is x in{-5} cup[1 ; a]. For the solution to include points that are 4 units apart, a must be such that a-1=4, i.e., a geqslant 5.Combining the results of all considered cases, we get a in(-infty ;-1] cup[5 ;+infty)."},{"problem":"72.

Solution","solution":": 82834. We assume a triangle is not allowed to be degenerate with zero area. Let t n be the number of incongruent triangles with perimeter n and integer sides. Calculating the first few terms, we find t 1 = t 2 = 0, t 3 = 1 (111), t 4 = 0, t 5 = 1 (122), t 6 = 1 (222), t 7 = 2 (133, 223), t 8 = 1 (233), t 9 = 3 (144, 234, 333). Suppose the triangle has sides a, b, c with a ≤ b ≤ c. The only restrictions are that a > 0 and a + b > c. Now consider a-1, b-1, c-1. This will be a triangle with perimeter 3 shorter unless a = 1 or a + b = c + 1. But if a = 1, then we must have b = c and hence a + b = c + 1. So a-1, b-1, c-1 is either a triangle or a degenerate triangle. Conversely, if a-1, b-1, c-1 is a triangle or a degenerate triangle, then a, b, c is a triangle. So if we put d n as the number of degenerate triangles with perimeter n (including those with shortest side zero), then t n+3 = t n + d n . Obviously d odd = 0. d 2n = the number of pairs a ≤ b with a + b = n, which is just [n/2] + 1 (for example 4 = 0 + 4 = 1 + 3 = 2 + 2). So we have t 1994 = t 1991 = t 1988 + 498 = t 1985 + 498 = t 1982 + 496 + 498 = t 1979 + 496 + 498 = t 1976 + 495 + 496 + 498 = ... = 1 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + ... + 496 + 498. There are 498 x 2/3 terms, which can be grouped into pairs with sum 499 (1 and 498, 3 and 496 etc), so the sum is 166 x 499. Alternative solution Assume a ≤ b ≤ c. We must have c < 1994/2, so the largest possible value of c is 996. Also c ≥ 1994/3, so c ≥ 665. If c = 665, then the only solution is a = 664, b = 665. If c = 666, then the solutions are a = 662, b = 666, or a = 663, b = 665, or a = b = 664. Evidently if c is odd, then the number of pairs (a, b) is one greater than for c - 1 (if the smallest and largest possible a for c-1 are h and k, then the largest and smallest for c are h-2 and k-1), but if c is even then the number of pairs is two greater than for c-1 (the largest and smallest are h-2 and k). Hence the total number of possibilities is 1 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + ... + 498 (for c = 996 the possibilities are a = 2 up to a = 499). 30th BMO 1994 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 14 Aug 2002"},{"problem":"Example 6 Let a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} be an increasing sequence of positive integers.

The formation cannot consist of only liars (in such a case, the 3-7th person would be telling the truth). Consider the tallest knight, let's call him P.

Therefore, from the 8th to the 20th place, only knights stand. The 3rd place cannot be occupied by a liar, as there is a liar L who is shorter than him. Therefore, the 3rd place is occupied by P.

Identify the Focus and Directrix: The focus of the parabola y^{2}=8x is at F(2,0), and its directrix is the line x=-2. The parameter p in this context is 2, representing the distance from the focus to the vertex of the parabola.2. Slope of Lines and Distance Calculation:   - Let the slope of line l_{1} be theta, where theta in (0, frac{pi}{2}). This implies that the slope of line l_{2}, being perpendicular to l_{1}, is theta + frac{pi}{2}.   - For line l_{1}, let the distance from point A to the directrix be d.

Finding the Minimum Area:   - The minimum area occurs when sin^{2}2theta is maximized, which happens at theta =frac{pi}{4}.

Suppose otherwise, that a = 3. Without loss of generality, say that Amy and Beth like songs 1, 2, and 3. Then because there is at least one song liked by each pair of girls, we require either b or c to be at least 1. In fact, we require either b or c to equal 1, otherwise there will be a song liked by all three. Suppose b = 1. Then we must have c=0 since no song is liked by all three girls, a contradiction.Case 1: How many ways are there for (a,b,c) to equal (1,1,1)? There are 4 choices for which song is liked by Amy and Beth, 3 choices for which song is liked by Beth and Jo, and 2 choices for which song is liked by Jo and Amy.

There remain 2 choices of songs for the next pair (who only like one song). The last song is given to the last pair of girls. But observe that we let any three pairs of the girls like two songs, so we multiply by 3.

However, there's overlap when the other song liked by the same pair of girl is counted as the 4th song at some point, in which case D would be counted as one of the first 3 songs liked by the same girls.Counting the overlaps, there are 3 ways to choose the pair with overlaps and 4cdot3=12 ways to choose what the other 2 pairs like independently. In total, there are 3cdot12=36 overlapped possibilities.Finally, there are binom{4}{3}cdot3!cdot(3+1+3)-36=132 ways for the songs to be likely by the girls. boxed{mathrm{(B)}}~ NaferSolution 4This is a bipartite graph problem, with the girls as left vertices and songs as right vertices. An edge connecting left vertex and right vertex means that a girl likes a song.Condition 1: \\"No song is liked by all three\\", means that the degree of right vertices is at most 2. Condition 2: \\"for each of the three pairs of the girls, there is at least one song liked by those two girls but disliked by the third\\", means that for any pair of left vertices, there is at least a right vertex connecting to them.To meet condition 2, there are at least 3 right vertices with 2 edges connecting to left vertices.  There are 2 cases:Case 1: there are only 3 such right vertices. There are binom{4}{3} such vertices, with 3! ways of connections to the left vertices, total arrangements are binom{4}{3}cdot3! = 24. The fourth right vertex either has no edge to the 3 left vertices, or 1 edge to 1 of the 3 left vertices.  So there are 24cdot(1+3) = 96 ways.Case 2: there are 4 such right vertices, 2 of them have edges to the same pair of left vertices.  There are binom{4}{2} such vertices, with 3! ways of connections.  So there are binom{4}{2}cdot3! = 36 ways.Total ways are 96+36=132.Another way is to overcount then subtract overlap ways.  Similar to previous case 1,  the fourth right vertex could have all possible connection to the left vertices except connecting to all 3, so it is 2^3-1=7 ways, so the total ways are binom{4}{3}cdot3!cdot7 = 24cdot7 = 168.  But this overcounts the case 2 with 36 ways.

The magic trick is: the magician first leaves the room, the audience arranges n face-up cards in a row on the table, the magician's assistant then flips n-1 of these cards over in their original positions, leaving only one card face-up, and then the magician enters the room, observes the cards on the table, and selects a face-down card, guessing its color.

When n=2018, the magician and the assistant can agree that for i=1,2, cdots, 2017, if the assistant keeps the i-th card face up, the magician will guess that the 2018-th card is of the i-th color. This way, the magic trick can be completed.Assume for some positive integer n leqslant 2017, the magic trick can be completed.For convenience, use (a, i) to denote that the a-th card is of the i-th color, where 1 leqslant a leqslant n, 1 leqslant i leqslant 2017.For n cards, note that the number of cards of each color is 1000000 (greater than n), so there are 2017^{n} different states (each position has 2017 possible colors).

If c neq a or (c, k)=(a, i), then a state containing (a, i), (b, j), (c, k) has two guesses (a, i) rightarrow(b, j) and (b, j) rightarrow(c, k), which is a contradiction.Thus, there must exist a k neq i such that(b, j) rightarrow(a, k).The lemma is proved.Assume without loss of generality that 1 and 2 are associated.Note that 3 must be associated with another number a. By the previous discussion, a in{1,2}, assume without loss of generality that a=1.At this point, for any b(4 leqslant b leqslant 2017), since b must be associated with another number c, and 1 and 2 are associated, 1 and 3 are associated, thus c in{1,2}, c in{1,3}.

We will say that a pair of marked cells in the same row covers a pair of columns in which these cells are located. A prohibited quartet arises when a pair of columns is covered twice. If in one row there are m marked cells, and in another n>m+1 marked cells, then by moving one marked cell from the second row to the first, the number of covered pairs in the first row will increase by m, and in the second row it will decrease by n-1>m, i.e., the total number of pairs will decrease. Thus, the minimum number of pairs for a given number of marked cells is achieved when the maximum number of cells in a row differs from the minimum by no more than 1. Let's consider two cases.1) There is a column in which no more than two cells are marked. Let's strike it out, in which case seven columns will remain, i.e., 21 pairs. One of the possible distributions of 23 cells is seven rows with three cells and one row with two cells, which gives 7 cdot 3+1=22 marked pairs. By the pigeonhole principle, there will be a pair of columns covered twice. As shown above, with a different distribution of marked pairs, there will be more.2) In each column, no fewer than three cells are marked. Since 8 cdot 3<25, there will be a row in which no fewer than four cells are marked. Let these be the first four cells in the bottom row.

So ( a^{2^{n-p}} equiv 1 pmod{2^n} ).    - If ( a, a^2, ldots, a^{2^{n-p}} ) have distinct values modulo ( 2^n ), then they take all values of the form ( 2^p m + 1 ), so ( a^k equiv b pmod{2^n} ) for some ( k ).    - Otherwise, the order of ( a ) modulo ( 2^n ) is less than ( 2^{n-p} ), thus we must have ( a^{2^{n-p-1}} equiv 1 pmod{2^n} ).    - But we have:      [      a^{2^{n-p-1}} - 1 = sum_{i=1}^{2^{n-p-1}} (2^p l)^i binom{2^{n-p-1}}{i}      ]    - For ( i ge 2 ), we have ( v((2^p l)^i binom{2^{n-p-1}}{i}) = pi + n - p - 1 - v(i) ge n ), and for ( i = 1 ), we have ( v((2^p l)^i binom{2^{n-p-1}}{i}) = v(2^p l 2^{n-p-1}) = n - 1 ). So ( 2^n nmid a^{2^{n-p-1}} - 1 ), a contradiction. Our lemma is proved.4. Parity Consideration:    - Since ( a^k + b ) is even, then ( a ) and ( b ) have the same parity.    - Suppose they are both even. For ( n > v(b) ), we have ( a^k equiv -b pmod{2^n} ). So we must have ( k v(a) = v(b) ), or ( k = frac{v(a)}{v(b)} ). Thus ( a^{frac{v(a)}{v(b)}} + b ) is divisible by ( 2^n ) for all ( n > v(b) ), which is impossible. Therefore ( a ) and ( b ) are both odd.5. Divisibility Consideration:    - For ( n = v(a^2 - 1) ), we have ( a^k equiv -b pmod{2^n} ). Note that either ( a^2 - 1 mid a^k - 1 ) or ( a^2 - 1 mid a^k - a ). Thus ( -b - 1 ) or ( -b - a ) is divisible by ( 2^{v(a^2 - 1)} ), equivalently, ( 2^{v(a^2 - 1)} ) divides ( b + 1 ) or ( a + b ).6. Case Analysis:    - Case (i): ( a equiv 1 pmod{4} )        - Let ( a = 2^k l + 1 ) where ( k ge 2 ) and ( l ) is odd. Then ( a^2 - 1 = 4^k l^2 + 2^{k+1} l ), so ( v(a^2 - 1) = k + 1 ).        - So ( b = 2^{k+1} m - 1 ) or ( b = 2^{k+1} m - 2^k l - 1 = 2^k (2m - l) - 1 = 2^k p - 1 ). Either way, we have ( b = 2^k q - 1 ) for some positive integer ( q ).        - From our lemma, we know that there exists ( x in mathbb{N} ) such that ( a^x equiv -b pmod{2^n} ), so ( (2^k l + 1, 2^k q - 1) ) is an interesting pair for any ( k ge 2 ) and odd ( l ).    - Case (ii): ( a equiv -1 pmod{4} )        - Let ( a = 2^k l - 1 ) where ( k ge 2 ) and ( l ) is odd. Then ( a^2 - 1 = 4^k l^2 - 2^{k+1} l ), so ( v(a^2 - 1) = k + 1 ).        - Then ( b = 2^{k+1} m - 1 ) or ( b = 2^{k+1} m - 2^k l + 1 = 2^k q + 1 ) where ( q ) is odd.        - Subcase (ii.i): ( b = 2^{k+1} m - 1 )            - Note that ( v(a^2 - 1) = v(4^k l^2 - 2^{k+1} l) = k + 1 ). Since ( -b equiv 1 pmod{2^{k+1}} ), then it follows from our lemma that there exists ( x ) such that ( (a^2)^x equiv -b pmod{2^n} ). So ( (2^k l - 1, 2^{k+1} m - 1) ) is interesting for ( k ge 2 ) and odd ( l ).        - Subcase (ii.ii): ( b = 2^k q + 1 )            - Consider a sufficiently large ( n ). It is easy to see that the inverse of ( a ) modulo ( 2^n ) is of the form ( a^* equiv 2^k r - 1 ) for odd ( r ). Since ( -b a^* equiv 1 pmod{2^{k+1}} ), from our lemma we know that there exists ( x ) such that ( (a^2)^x equiv -b a^* pmod{2^n} ), which gives ( a^{2x+1} equiv -b pmod{2^n} ). Therefore ( (2^k l - 1, 2^k q + 1) ) is interesting for ( k ge 2 ) and odd ( l, q ).The final answer is ( boxed{ (2^k l + 1, 2^k q - 1) } ) and ((2^k l - 1, 2^k q + 1)) for ( k ge 2 ) and odd ( l, q )."},{"problem":"5.

At x = 2, the slope of the tangent line is: m = 3 cdot 2^2 = 12. The equation of the tangent line at (2, 8) can then be expressed in point-slope form as: y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where (x_1, y_1) = (2, 8) and m = 12 is the slope.Thus, the equation becomes: y - 8 = 12(x - 2).

Integration of Expressions R(sin x, cos x)Problem Statement. Find the indefinite integralint R(sin x, cos x) d xwhere R is a rational function of two variables.PLAN OF SOLUTION.1. Using the substitutiont=operatorname{tg} frac{x}{2}integrals of functions R(sin x, cos x) are reduced to integrals of rational functions of the new variable t. Indeed, substituting into the integrandsin x=frac{2 t}{1+t^{2}}, quad cos x=frac{1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}, quad d x=frac{2}{1+t^{2}} d twe getR(sin x, cos x) d x=Rleft(frac{2 t}{1+t^{2}}, frac{1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}right) frac{2}{1+t^{2}} d t=R_{1}(t) d tThe substitution t=operatorname{tg}(x / 2) is called the universal substitution.2. Apply the formula for the change of variable in an indefinite integralint R(sin x, cos x) d x=int Rleft(frac{2 t}{1+t^{2}}, frac{1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}right) frac{2}{1+t^{2}} d t3. Compute the antiderivative of the rational function of t and return to the variable x by substituting t=operatorname{tg}(x / 2).Remark. If the integrand has a special form, it is better to use substitutions that require fewer calculations:a) ifR(sin x, cos x)=R_{1}left(sin x, cos ^{2} xright) cos xthen we use the substitution t=sin x. Indeed, the integrand becomesR_{1}left(sin x, cos ^{2} xright) cos x d x=R_{1}left(t, 1-t^{2}right) d tb) ifR(sin x, cos x)=R_{2}left(sin ^{2} x, cos xright) sin xthen we use the substitution t=cos x. Indeed, the integrand becomesR_{2}left(sin ^{2} x, cos xright) sin x d x=-R_{2}left(1-t^{2}, tright) d tc) ifR(sin x, cos x)=R_{3}(operatorname{tg} x)then we use the substitution t=operatorname{tg} x.

Add a_{n-1} to both sides:   a_n + a_{n-1} = 2a_{n-1} + 3a_{n-2} + a_{n-1}   a_n + a_{n-1} = 3(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}).   Note that with a_2 + a_1 = 2 + 5 = 7, the sequence {a_{n+1} + a_n} becomes a geometric progression with the first term 7 and the common ratio 3. So, we get:   a_{n+1} + a_n = 7 cdot 3^{n-1}.2. Now let's subtract 3a_{n-1} from both sides:   a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 2a_{n-1} + 3a_{n-2} - 3a_{n-1}   a_n - 3a_{n-1} = - (a_{n-1} - 3a_{n-2}).   Since a_2 - 3a_1 = 2 - 3 cdot 5 = -13, the sequence {a_{n+1} - 3a_n} forms a geometric progression with the first term -13 and the common ratio -1. Hence:   a_{n+1} - 3a_n =  -13 cdot (-1)^{n-1}.3. We can express a_n as a combination of these two sequences:   a_n = frac{(a_{n+1} + a_n) - (a_{n+1} - 3a_n)}{4}   a_n = frac{7 cdot 3^{n-1} + 13 cdot (-1)^{n-1}}{4}.Therefore, the general formula for the n-th term of the given sequence {a_n} is:a_n = boxed{frac{7 cdot 3^{n-1} + 13 cdot (-1)^{n-1}}{4}}."},{"problem":"Let (z in mathbb{C}) and (|z + 2 - 2i| = 1).

The first thing to notice is that n and m play symmetric roles, because if mn-1 divides n^3+1, it also divides m^3(n^3+1), but it also divides m^3n^3-1, so it divides the difference m^3+1. Therefore, we can assume that n leq m. The second important idea is that n^3+1 equiv 1 (mod n), mn-1 equiv -1 (mod n), so the quotient must be congruent to -1 modulo n, i.e., of the form kn-1. Since mn-1 geq n^2-1, we must have: (kn-1)(n^2-1) leq n^3+1, which factors into: (k-1)(n^3-n) leq n^2+n, or: (k-1)(n-1) leq 1. Therefore, either n=1, or k=1, or n=k=2.n=1 gives: (m-1) divides 2, so m=2 or m=3.k=1 gives: (n-1)(nm-1)=n^3+1 or: (n-1)m=n^2+1, or:m=n+1+frac{2}{n-1} which is an integer for n=2 and n=3. In both cases, m=5.n=k=2 gives nm-1=frac{n^3+1}{kn-1}=3, so m=2.Thus, we have nine solutions: (1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(3,1),(2,5),(3,5),(5,2),(5,3),(2,2).## Group D: Combinatorics## Saturday, 23rd morning: Guillaume Conchon-Kerjan## IntroductionHere we propose a number of rather difficult exercises (including combinatorial geometry, but not only) using relatively elementary tools.## Exercises## Appetizer"},{"problem":"In the Cartesian coordinate system xoy, the line l passes through point P(0,1) and has a slope of 1.

From the problem statement, it follows that the side length of each square is a natural number, and the side length of each square is a divisor of the side length of the previous one. Let the side length of the small square be a, the medium square be k a, and the large square be mka. Then (m k a)^{2}+(k a)^{2}+a^{2}=154 Leftrightarrow a^{2}left(m^{2} k^{2}+k^{2}+1right)=154.From the obtained equation, it follows that 154 is divisible by a^{2}. Since 154=2 cdot 7 cdot 11, it is divisible only by 1^{2}, so a=1. Then k^{2}left(m^{2}+1right)=153. Therefore, 153 is divisible by k^{2}. Considering that 153=3^{2} cdot 17 and k>1, we get: k=3.

Expressing f(x) in a Different Form:Given f(x)=sin omega x+cos omega x, we can rewrite this using the sine of a sum formula. Recall that sin A + cos A = sqrt{2}sin(A+frac{pi}{4}). Therefore, we have:[f(x) = sqrt{2}sin(omega x+frac{pi}{4})]2. Determining the Period of f(x) and |f(x)|:- The minimum positive period of f(x), based on its form, is frac{2pi}{omega} because it's a sine function with a frequency of omega.- For |f(x)|, the period is halved because the absolute value reflects the function across the x-axis for negative values, effectively doubling the frequency. Thus, the period of |f(x)| is frac{pi}{omega}.3. Finding the Period of y=f(x)+|f(x)|:Given that y=f(x)+|f(x)|, and knowing the periods of f(x) and |f(x)|, we understand that the period of y will be determined by the longer of the two, which is the period of f(x). Therefore, the minimum positive period of y is frac{2pi}{omega}.4. Solving for omega Using the Given Period of y:We are given that the minimum positive period of y is pi. Setting frac{2pi}{omega} = pi allows us to solve for omega:[frac{2pi}{omega} = pi implies omega = 2]5. Determining the Form of f(x) with omega:Substituting omega = 2 into f(x), we get:[f(x) = sqrt{2}sin(2x+frac{pi}{4})]6. Finding theta Where f(x) geqslant f(theta):Since f(x) attains its minimum value at x = theta, we set the argument of the sine function to equal a point where the sine function attains its minimum in its period, which is -frac{pi}{2} (or equivalently, an odd multiple of pi minus frac{pi}{2}):[2theta+frac{pi}{4} = 2kpi - frac{pi}{2}]Solving for theta gives:[theta = kpi - frac{3pi}{8}]7. Finding the Minimum Positive Value of theta:Given theta > 0, the smallest positive value of theta that satisfies the equation is when k=1, which gives:[theta = pi - frac{3pi}{8} = frac{5pi}{8}]Therefore, the minimum value of theta is boxed{frac{5pi}{8}}, which corresponds to option boxed{C}."},{"problem":"\\"x^{2}-x-6 gt 0\\" is (   ) of \\"x lt -5\\".A: necessary and sufficient conditionB: sufficient but not necessary conditionC: necessary but not sufficient conditionD: neither sufficient nor necessary condition","solution":"To solve the inequality x^{2}-x-6 gt 0, we first factor the quadratic equation:[x^{2}-x-6 = (x-3)(x+2) gt 0]The roots of the equation are x = 3 and x = -2.

Define Points and Setup:   - Let Z equiv AH cap odot (ABC).   - Let A' denote the antipode of A in odot (ABC).   - Let T denote the point on odot (ABC) such that AT parallel BC.   - Let H denote the orthocenter of triangle ABC.2. Claim and Proof of Collinearity:   - We claim that P, H, T are collinear. To prove this, we use complex numbers with odot (ABC) as the unit circle.   - First, note that h = a + b + c, t = frac{bc}{a}, z = -frac{bc}{a}, and d = left(frac{h + z}{2}right).   - Note that P is the center of spiral similarity mapping overline{DO} mapsto overline{ZA'}.

Isogonal Conjugation:   - Since P, H, T are collinear, overline{PA} and overline{PH} are isogonal in angle BPC.   - By DDIT (Double Desargues Involution Theorem) on BCEF with P, we have that {overline{PB}, overline{PC}}, {overline{PA}, overline{PH}}, {overline{PE}, overline{PF}} are swapped under some involution. Considering the first two pairs, we know that this involution is just isogonal conjugation in angle BPC. Hence overline{PE}, overline{PF} are isogonal in angle BPC.4.

Therefore, the tourist is farther from city A by 3x - x = 2x, that is, 2x = 40, x = 20.

Thus if q=frac{a}{b}(a, b in mathbb{N}), we have a mid 2 and b mid 2, i.e. q in left{frac{1}{2}, 1,2right}.It is clearly possible when q=1.We argue that q=frac{1}{2} is not possible. Assume that the ants diverge for the first time after the kth minute, for k geqslant 0.

Combining (1) and (2) with the triangle inequality, we obtain for any n geqslant k+1left|x_{B}^{(n)}-x_{A}^{(n)}right|+left|y_{B}^{(n)}-y_{A}^{(n)}right| geqslant 2 q^{k}-2left(q^{k+1}+q^{k+2}+ldots+q^{n-1}right),which is strictly positive for q=frac{1}{2}. So for any n geqslant k+1, the ants cannot meet after n minutes. Thus q neq frac{1}{2}.Finally, we show that q=2 is also not possible. Suppose to the contrary that there is a pair of routes for q=2, meeting after n minutes. Now consider rescaling the plane by a factor 2^{-n}, and looking at the routes in the opposite direction. This would then be an example for q=1 / 2 and we have just shown that this is not possible."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=frac{ax}{e^{x}+1}+be^{-x}, the point M(0,1) lies on the curve y=f(x), and the tangent to the curve at the point M is perpendicular to the line 2x-y=0.(1) Find the values of a and b.(2) If for all xneq 0, we have f(x) > frac{x}{e^{x}-1}+ke^{-x}, find the range of values for k.","solution":"(1) The derivative of f(x) = frac{ax}{e^{x}+1} + be^{-x} isf'(x) = frac{a(e^{x}+1)-axe^{x}}{(e^{x}+1)^{2}} - be^{-x}.Since the tangent line at point M is perpendicular to 2x-y=0, we have f(0) = 1 and f'(0) = -frac{1}{2}.

Given the hexadecimal number -20F, we break it down as follows:- The rightmost digit, F, represents 15 in decimal.- The next digit to the left, 0, represents 0 in decimal.- The leftmost digit, 2, represents 2 in decimal.Using the conversion formula, we calculate the decimal equivalent of -20F:[-(2 times 16^{2} + 0 times 16^{1} + 15 times 16^{0}) ][= -(2 times 256 + 0 times 16 + 15 times 1)][= -(512 + 0 + 15)][= -527]Therefore, the decimal number corresponding to -20F in hexadecimal is boxed{-527}, which corresponds to option boxed{C}."},{"problem":"32nd IMO 1991 shortlist Problem 8 Given a set A of n points in the plane, no three collinear, show that we can find a set B of 2n - 5 points such that a point of B lies in the interior of every triangle whose vertices belong to A.","solution":"Take a suitable x-axis so that the points all have different x-coordinates. Label the points P 1 , P 2 , ... , P n in order of increasing x-coordinates. For each point except P 1 and P n take the two points whose y- coordinate differs by d, where d is less than the smallest distance from one of the n points to the line joining another two. That gives a set of 2n-4 points. Given any triangle P i P j P k , one of the three vertices is not 1 or n. Suppose it is P i . If the line P j P k lies above P i , then the triangle P i P j P k must contain the point whose y-coordinate is d greater than that of P i . Similarly, if the line lies below, the triangle must contain the point with y-coordinate d less. So the set of 2n-4 points certainly has the required property. But the convex hull of the P i must have at least one of the points P 2 , ... , P n-1 as vertex. For that point one of the two flanking points lies outside the convex hull and so we can discard it, giving us a set of 2n-5 points. We cannot do better than 2n-5. ABC has 1 triangle, so we need at least 1 point. Then if we add D inside ABC we get 3 disjoint triangles ABD, BCD, CAD and so we need at least 3 points.

If a mother votes for her child, we will consider her dishonest. It is known that n honest mothers will vote for the best play, so it will not lose for sure (half of the votes are definitely for it). The only case when the best play does not win is a tie, when the worst play also gets half of the votes. This is only possible if all the children of dishonest mothers are in the worst play. Let's find the probability of this event.There are C_{2 n}^{n} cases of distributing n dishonest mothers among the total number of 2 n mothers. And only in one of these cases do all dishonest mothers vote for the worst play. Thus, the probability of a tie is p=frac{1}{C_{2 n}^{n}}=frac{(n!)^{2}}{(2 n)!}. Therefore, the probability of the event “the best play will get more votes” is 1-p=frac{(2 n)!-(n!)^{2}}{(2 n)!}.Remark. If we assume that n is large, then the factorial n! can be calculated using the approximate Stirling's formula: n!approx sqrt{2 pi n} cdot n^{n} e^{-n}.

We start by expressing f(x) in the form f(x) = x^{alpha}, where alpha is a constant we need to determine.Step 1: Finding the value of alpha.Given that f(9) = 9^{alpha} = 3, we solve for alpha:[9^{alpha} = 3]Since 9 = 3^2, we can write this as (3^2)^{alpha} = 3^1. Therefore, by equating the exponents, we get 2alpha = 1, leading to alpha = frac{1}{2}. Thus, the function is given by f(x) = x^{frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{x}.Step 2: Analyzing the function f(x) = sqrt{x}.- The domain of f(x) is [0, +infty), meaning it includes all non-negative real numbers. Hence, Option A claims that f(x) is a decreasing function, which is incorrect because as x increases, sqrt{x} also increases. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing.- An even function is symmetric about the y-axis, which means f(x) = f(-x) for all x in the domain. Since the domain of sqrt{x} does not include negative numbers, it cannot be an even function. Thus, Option B is incorrect.Step 3: Considering when x geqslant 4.Since f(x) is monotonically increasing, for any x geqslant 4, f(x) geqslant f(4) = sqrt{4} = 2. This confirms Option C as correct, showing that f(x) geqslant 2 for x geqslant 4.Step 4: Comparing averages with the function value at the average of inputs.For x_2 > x_1 > 0, we examine frac{f(x_{1}) + f(x_{2})}{2} and f(frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}).Calculating the square of the difference between these two expressions, we have:[left(frac{f(x_{1}) + f(x_{2})}{2}right)^2 - left(fleft(frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}right)right)^2 = frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + 2sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}}}{4} - frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}]This simplifies to [frac{2sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}} - x_{1} - x_{2}}{4} = -frac{(sqrt{x_{1}} - sqrt{x_{2}})^2}{4} < 0]Given that f(x) geqslant 0, this implies frac{f(x_{1}) + f(x_{2})}{2} < f(frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}).

We use the \\"folding\\" method. Reflect triangle P Q R symmetrically with respect to line P R, and triangle T S R with respect to line T R (see Fig. a). From the equality (*) and the equality R Q=R S, it follows that the images of points Q and S are the same point O.Note that triangle T O P is equilateral. Moreover, O R=O P=O T. Therefore, O is the center of the circumscribed circle of triangle P R T. Then angle P R T= 0.5 angle P O T=30^{circ}.Second method. We prove that QPTS is a parallelogram (see Fig. b).Indeed, using the equality of the angles at the bases of the isosceles triangles P Q R and R S T and the equality (*), we get: angle Q P T+angle P T S=angle Q P R+angle R P T+ angle R T P+angle S T R=angle P R Q+angle T R S+left(180^{circ}-angle P R Tright)=180^{circ}.Thus, P Q | S T and P Q=S T (by condition), that is, Q P T S is a parallelogram.

Congruency implies not just equal length but also that they can be superimposed one on the other, which is not always the case with arcs of equal length in different circles.  - Statement B: Arcs subtended by equal central angles are equal.  - This statement seems to imply a correct concept but is phrased in a way that might suggest it's universally true without the necessary condition of being in the same or congruent circles. In the context of the same circle or congruent circles, arcs subtended by equal central angles are indeed equal in length. However, the solution suggests this statement is incorrect, likely due to the missing condition in the statement's phrasing.  - Statement C: The diameter perpendicular to the chord bisects the chord.  - This statement is misunderstood in the solution provided. The correct interpretation is that if a diameter of a circle is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord (and also the arc subtended by the chord). This is a true proposition in circle geometry. The solution's critique seems to misinterpret the statement as suggesting a chord can be a diameter, which is not the claim. Therefore, the solution's dismissal of this statement seems to be based on a misunderstanding.  - Statement D: A circle is a figure with central symmetry.  - This statement is correct. A circle is defined as the set of all points in a plane that are a given distance (the radius) from a given point (the center). This definition inherently means a circle has central symmetry about its center. Every point on the circle can be paired with another point on the circle such that the center of the circle is the midpoint of the segment connecting the pair of points, which is the definition of central symmetry.Given the analysis above, and adhering to the format and rules specified:- The correct conclusion, based on the provided solution and the analysis, is that a circle is a figure with central symmetry.Therefore, the correct answer is encapsulated as: boxed{D}."},{"problem":"Given a sequence {a_n} whose sum of the first n terms is S_n, and it satisfies S_n = frac{1}{2}n^2 + frac{1}{2}n.

For this ellipse, 2a=2sqrt{9}=6.1. By the property of an ellipse, the sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci is constant and equal to the length of the major axis, which gives us |PF_{1}|+|PF_{2}|=6.2. Given |PF_{1}|=|PF_{2}|, we can infer |PF_{1}|=|PF_{2}|=3.3. The distance between the foci, |F_{1}F_{2}|, can be calculated using the formula 2sqrt{a^2-b^2}, where b^2 is the denominator of the x^2 term in the ellipse equation.

Since P is the midpoint of AD, and MN intersects AB at M and AC at N, we can express the vectors in terms of each other.1. We know that overrightarrow{AP}=lambda overrightarrow{AM}+mu overrightarrow{AN}, where lambda +mu =1. This is because P, M, and N are collinear, and lambda and mu represent the scalar multiples that relate overrightarrow{AM} and overrightarrow{AN} to overrightarrow{AP}.2. Given that P is the midpoint of AD, we can express overrightarrow{AP} as frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{AD}. Since D is a point that makes AD a line segment within the triangle, we can further decompose overrightarrow{AD} into overrightarrow{AB}+overrightarrow{AC}, leading to overrightarrow{AP}=frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{AD}=frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{AB}+frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{AC}.3.

Identify the properties of the isosceles triangle:   - An isosceles triangle has two equal angles.   - The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180^circ.2. Set up the equations based on the given angles:   - Let the angles of the isosceles triangle be 50^circ, x^circ, and y^circ.   - Since it is an isosceles triangle, two of these angles must be equal.3. Consider the possible cases for the angles:   - Case 1: 50^circ is one of the equal angles.     - If 50^circ is one of the equal angles, then the other equal angle must also be 50^circ.     - Therefore, the third angle must be 180^circ - 50^circ - 50^circ = 80^circ.     - This gives us the angle sets (50^circ, 50^circ, 80^circ).   - Case 2: 50^circ is the unique angle.     - If 50^circ is the unique angle, then the other two angles must be equal.     - Let these equal angles be x^circ.     - Therefore, 50^circ + x^circ + x^circ = 180^circ.     - Solving for x, we get 2x = 130^circ implies x = 65^circ.     - This gives us the angle sets (50^circ, 65^circ, 65^circ).4. Calculate x - y for each case:   - For the angle set (50^circ, 50^circ, 80^circ):     - If x = 80^circ and y = 50^circ, then x - y = 80^circ - 50^circ = 30^circ.     - If x = 50^circ and y = 80^circ, then x - y = 50^circ - 80^circ = -30^circ.   - For the angle set (50^circ, 65^circ, 65^circ):     - If x = 65^circ and y = 65^circ, then x - y = 65^circ - 65^circ = 0^circ.5.

Solution: More generally, we will show that among the cuboid-shaped bodies, the cube has the largest volume when the sum of the edges meeting at a vertex is given.Let a, b, c denote the edges meeting at a vertex. According to the condition, their sum is given. The volume of the cuboid is a b c. Our statement follows from the fact that the arithmetic mean of three positive numbers (or any number of numbers) is greater than or equal to the geometric mean, with equality only if the three numbers are equal. In our case, the arithmetic mean is frac{a+b+c}{3}=s, which is constant by the condition. sqrt[3]{a b c} leq s, or a b c leq s^{3}, according to the statement, so the maximum volume is s^{3}, and this is only achieved by the cuboid when a=b=c=s, i.e., the cube is the sought cuboid.The inequality used can be proven as follows: if not all three numbers are equal, then there must be one smaller than s and one larger than s. Let a=s-alpha<0, b=s+beta>0, and c=s+alpha-beta>0. Then[begin{gathered}a b c=(s-alpha)(s+beta)(s+alpha-beta)=[s(s-alpha+beta)-alpha beta](s+alpha-beta)< <s(s-alpha+beta)(s+alpha-beta)=s^{3}-(alpha-beta)^{2} s<s^{3}end{gathered}]This proves our statement.II.

We are given that ( d ) and ( n ) are positive integers such that ( d ) divides ( n ), ( n > 1000 ), and ( n ) is not a perfect square. We need to minimize ( leftlvert d - sqrt{n} rightrvert ).2. To minimize ( leftlvert d - sqrt{n} rightrvert ), we want ( sqrt{n} ) to be as close to ( d ) as possible. This implies that ( n ) should be close to ( d^2 ).3. Consider ( n = d^2 + k ) where ( k ) is a small integer. Since ( n ) is not a perfect square, ( k neq 0 ).4. We need ( n ) to be greater than 1000. Therefore, we need ( d^2 + k > 1000 ).5. Let's first consider ( k = 1 ). Then ( n = d^2 + 1 ). We need ( d^2 + 1 > 1000 ), which implies ( d^2 > 999 ). Thus, ( d > sqrt{999} approx 31.6 ). The smallest integer ( d ) is 32.6. For ( d = 32 ), ( n = 32^2 + 1 = 1025 ). We need to check if ( d = 32 ) divides ( n = 1025 ). Since ( 1025 div 32 ) is not an integer, ( d = 32 ) does not work.7. Next, consider ( k = -1 ). Then ( n = d^2 - 1 ). We need ( d^2 - 1 > 1000 ), which implies ( d^2 > 1001 ). Thus, ( d > sqrt{1001} approx 31.6 ). The smallest integer ( d ) is 32.8. For ( d = 32 ), ( n = 32^2 - 1 = 1023 ). We need to check if ( d = 32 ) divides ( n = 1023 ). Since ( 1023 div 32 ) is not an integer, ( d = 32 ) does not work.9. Next, consider ( k = d ). Then ( n = d^2 + d ).

Now, we calculate ( leftlvert d - sqrt{n} rightrvert ):   [   leftlvert 32 - sqrt{1056} rightrvert = leftlvert 32 - sqrt{32^2 + 32} rightrvert = leftlvert 32 - sqrt{1024 + 32} rightrvert = leftlvert 32 - sqrt{1056} rightrvert   ]13.

Thus, the triangle C B D is also equilateral, and since angle C D B = 60^{circ}, and A lies on the other arc of the chord C B (since A D always passes through the interior of the triangle), it follows that angle C A B = 120^{circ}."},{"problem":"A teacher wants to divide the 2010 questions she asked in the exams during the school year into three folders of 670 questions and give each folder to a student who solved all 670 questions in that folder.

Consider the case when (b geq 3):   - For (b geq 3), we have (p_b geq 5).   - Since two primes cannot be consecutive, the difference between any two primes (p_a) and (p_b) must be at least 2. Therefore, (p_a - p_b geq 2k).3. Divisibility condition:   - We need (p_a - p_b) to divide (2(a - b) = 2k).   - This implies (p_a - p_b leq 2k) because (p_a - p_b) must be a divisor of (2k).4.

The coefficient of (x) in the sine function, which is 2, indicates that the period is frac{2pi}{2}=pi, not (2pi). Therefore, option A is incorrect.Looking at option B, if we substitute (x=frac{pi}{4}) into (f(x)), we get f(frac{pi}{4})=sin(pi) = 0, not frac{sqrt{2}}{2} as suggested by the initial solution. Additionally, the function is periodic and not symmetrical about specific points unless they correspond to peaks, troughs, or line intersections of the sine curve; hence, the function is not symmetrical about the point ((frac{pi}{4}, 0)), making option B incorrect.For option C, if we shift the graph of the function f(x) to the right by frac{pi}{8}, we get the function y=sin(2(x - frac{pi}{8}) + frac{pi}{4}) = sin(2x).

Solving for x, we get: x = log_{2}{frac{1}{6}} However, it's important to note that the original domain M does not include any value of x that satisfies this equation.

We call such a tournament [i]balanced [/i] if any four participating teams play exactly three matches between themselves. So, not all teams play against one another.Determine the largest value of n for which a balanced tournament with n teams exists.","solution":"1. Lemma Statement and Proof:   We start by proving the lemma: If ( n geq 5 ), there can't exist any triangle (three teams having met each other) or any antitriangle (three teams none of which faced any other).   - Proof of Lemma:     Assume, for contradiction, that there exists a triangle involving teams ( A, B, ) and ( C ). This means ( A ) has played against ( B ), ( B ) has played against ( C ), and ( C ) has played against ( A ). Now consider two other teams ( D ) and ( E ). By the hypothesis of the balanced tournament, neither ( D ) nor ( E ) has played against any of ( A, B, ) or ( C ). This leads to a contradiction because considering the four teams ( A, B, D, E ), there can be at most two matches among them, which violates the condition of having exactly three matches among any four teams. Therefore, no triangle can exist.     Similarly, assume there exists an antitriangle involving teams ( A, B, ) and ( C ). This means none of ( A, B, ) and ( C ) have played against each other. Now consider two other teams ( D ) and ( E ). By the hypothesis, ( D ) and ( E ) must have played against each of ( A, B, ) and ( C ). This again leads to a contradiction because considering the four teams ( A, B, D, E ), there can be at most two matches among them, which violates the condition of having exactly three matches among any four teams. Therefore, no antitriangle can exist.2. Structure of the Tournament:   Given the lemma, we know that any four teams must be connected in a way such that they form a path (e.g., ( AB, BC, CD )). Now consider five teams ( A, B, C, D, ) and ( E ). We can arrange them such that ( A, B, C, D ) form a path (in this order). Considering the teams ( B, C, D, E ), they must also be connected in that order to avoid creating a triangle or an antitriangle. Similarly, ( E ) must be connected to ( A ), creating a pentagon.3. Verification for ( n = 5 ):   The pentagon structure indeed works for ( n = 5 ). In a pentagon, each team plays against exactly two other teams, and any four teams among the five will have exactly three matches among them, satisfying the balanced tournament condition.4. Contradiction for ( n = 6 ):   Now assume there is a sixth team ( F ). By considering the teams ( A, B, C, ) and ( F ), there must be at least one edge of the form ( FA, FB, ) or ( FC ). This creates a contradiction because it would either form a triangle or an antitriangle, violating the balanced tournament condition.Therefore, the maximum number of teams ( n ) for which a balanced tournament exists is ( n = 5 ).The final answer is ( boxed{5} )."},{"problem":"5-1.

In 1955, he was appointed as a member (academician) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, making outstanding contributions to the development, construction, and production of China's chemical industry. In the 1920s, under the technical blockade of the Solvay process by foreign countries, he led his staff through long-term arduous efforts, solving a series of technical problems, and produced high-quality \\"Red Triangle\\" brand soda ash in 1926. In August of the same year, at the World's Fair in Philadelphia, USA, it was awarded a gold medal. He also published the secrets of the \\"Solvay process\\" to the world, allowing people from all countries to share this scientific achievement, breaking the foreign technical monopoly. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, he came to Sichuan. When he encountered the situation where the \\"Solvay process\\" was not suitable for local conditions, he worked hard to research a new alkali production method, combining the Solvay process with the synthetic ammonia process. In 1941, he developed the integrated Cha'an method, which combined the alkali production process with the synthetic ammonia process, producing soda ash and ammonium chloride fertilizer simultaneously. This new method significantly increased the utilization rate of salt from 70% to 96%. At the same time, the by-product was no longer polluting the environment with tantalum chloride but could be used as fertilizer for soil. This opened a new era in the world's alkali industry. On March 15, 1941, Yongli Company held a factory meeting, and all colleagues unanimously agreed to name the new alkali process as the \\"Hou's Alkali Process.\\" In 1953, the \\"Hou's Alkali Process\\" received the first invention certificate of the new China."},{"problem":"4. [15] Let a, b, and c be complex numbers such that |a|=|b|=|c|=|a+b+c|=1. If |a-b|=|a-c| and b neq c, prove that |a+b||a+c|=2.","solution":"Solution:First Solution. Since |a|=1, a cannot be 0 . Let u=frac{b}{a} and v=frac{c}{a}. Dividing the given equations by |a|=1 gives |u|=|v|=|1+u+v|=1 and |1-u|=|1-v|. The goal is to prove that |1+u||1+v|=2. By squaring |1-u|=|1-v|, we get (1-u) overline{(1-u)}=(1-v) overline{(1-v)}, and thus 1-u-bar{u}+|u|^{2}= 1-v-bar{v}+|v|^{2}, or u+bar{u}=v+bar{v}. This implies operatorname{Re}(u)=operatorname{Re}(v). Since u and v are on the unit circle in the complex plane, u is equal to either v or bar{v}. However, b neq c implies u neq v, so u=bar{v}.Therefore, 1=|1+u+bar{u}|=|1+2 operatorname{Re}(u)|. Since operatorname{Re}(u) is real, we either have operatorname{Re}(u)=0 or operatorname{Re}(u)=-1. The first case gives u= pm i and |1+u||1+v|=|1+i | 1-i|=2, as desired. It remains only to note that operatorname{Re}(u)=-1 is in fact impossible because u is of norm 1 and u=-1 would imply u=bar{u}=v.Remark: by the rotational symmetry of the circle, it is acceptable to skip the first step of this solution and assume a=1 without loss of generality.Second Solution. Let a, b, and c, be the vertices of a triangle inscribed in the unit circle in the complex plane. Since the complex coordinate of the circumcenter is 0 and the complex coordinate of the centroid is frac{a+b+c}{3}, it follows from well-known facts about the Euler line that the complex coordinate of the orthocenter is a+b+c. Hence the orthocenter lies on the unit circle as well. Is it not possible for the orthocenter not to be among the three vertices of the triangle, for, if it were, two opposite angles of the convex cyclic quadrilateral formed by the three vertices and the orthocenter would each measure greater than 90 degrees. It follows that the triangle is right. However, since |a-b|=|a-c|, the right angle cannot occur at b or c, so it must occur at a, and the desired conclusion follows immediately."},{"problem":"Let n be a positive integer. A frog starts on the number line at 0 . Suppose it makes a finite sequence of hops, subject to two conditions:- The frog visits only points in left{1,2, ldots, 2^{n}-1right}, each at most once.- The length of each hop is in left{2^{0}, 2^{1}, 2^{2}, ldotsright}. (The hops may be either direction, left or right.)Let S be the sum of the (positive) lengths of all hops in the sequence. What is the maximum possible value of S ?","solution":"We claim the answer is frac{4^{n}-1}{3}.We first prove the bound. First notice that the hop sizes are in left{2^{0}, 2^{1}, ldots, 2^{n-1}right}, since the frog must stay within bounds the whole time. Let a_{i} be the number of hops of size 2^{i} the frog makes, for 0 leq i leq n-1.Claim - For any k=1, ldots, n we havea_{n-1}+cdots+a_{n-k} leq 2^{n}-2^{n-k} .Proof. Let m=n-k and look modulo 2^{m}. Call a jump small if its length is at most 2^{m-1}, and large if it is at least 2^{m}; the former changes the residue class of the frog modulo 2^{m} while the latter does not.Within each fixed residue modulo 2^{m}, the frog can make at most frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1 large jumps.(As an example, when n=3 this means there are at most four hops of length 4 , at most six hops of length 2 or 4 , and at most seven hops total. Of course, if we want to max the length of the hops, we see that we want a_{2}=4, a_{1}=2, a_{0}=1, and in general equality is achieved when a_{m}=2^{m} for any m.)Now, the total distance the frog travels isS=a_{0}+2 a_{1}+4 a_{2}+cdots+2^{n-1} a_{n-1} .We rewrite using the so-called \\"summation by parts\\":begin{array}{l}S=a_{0}+a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+ldots+quad a_{n-1} +a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+ldots+quad a_{n-1} +quad 2 a_{2}+2 a_{3}+ldots+2 a_{n-1} +quad 4 a_{3}+ldots+quad 4 a_{n-1} vdots quad ddots +quad 2^{n-2} a_{n-1} text {. } end{array}Hencebegin{aligned}S & leqleft(2^{n}-2^{0}right)+left(2^{n}-2^{1}right)+2left(2^{n}-2^{2}right)+cdots+2^{n-2}left(2^{n}-2^{n-1}right) & =frac{4^{n}-1}{3} .end{aligned}It remains to show that equality can hold. There are many such constructions but most are inductive. Here is one approach. We will construct two family of paths such that there are 2^{k} hops of size 2^{k}, for every 0 leq k leq n-1, and we visit each of left{0, ldots, 2^{n}-1right} once, starting on 0 and ending on x, for the two values x inleft{1,2^{n}-1right}.The base case n=1 is clear. To take a path from 0 to 2^{n+1}-1.- Take a path on left{0,2,4, ldots, 2^{n+1}-2right} starting from 0 and ending on 2 (by inductive hypothesis).- Take a path on left{1,3,5, ldots, 2^{n+1}-1right} starting from 1 and ending on 2^{n+1}-1 (by inductive hypothesis).- Link them together by adding a single jump 2 rightarrow 1.The other case is similar, but we route 0 rightarrowleft(2^{n+1}-2right) rightarrowleft(2^{n+1}-1right) rightarrow 1 instead. (This can also be visualized as hopping along a hypercube of binary strings; each inductive step takes two copies of the hypercube and links them together by a single edge.)Remark (Ashwin Sah). The problem can also be altered to ask for the minimum value of the sum of the reciprocals of the hop sizes, where further we stipulate that the frog must hit every point precisely once (to avoid triviality). With a nearly identical proof that also exploits the added condition a_{0}+cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1, the answer is n. This yields a nicer form for the generalization. The natural generalization changes the above problem by replacing 2^{k} with a_{k} where a_{k} mid a_{k+1}, so that the interval covered by hops is of size a_{n} and the hop sizes are restricted to the a_{i}, where a_{0}=1. In this case, similar bounding yieldssum_{i=1}^{2^{n}-1} frac{1}{b_{k}} geq sum_{i=0}^{n-1}left(frac{a_{k+1}}{a_{k}}-1right)Bounds for the total distance traveled happen in the same way as the solution above, and equality for both can be constructed in an analogous fashion."},{"problem":"5.

Problem 1:   To find the sum of the digits in the binary representation of (2023), we first convert (2023) to binary.   [   2023_{10} = 11111100111_2   ]   Next, we sum the digits of the binary number:   [   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9   ]   Therefore, the sum of the digits in the binary representation of (2023) is (boxed{9}).2. Problem 2:   Let the cost of an apple be (a) dollars and the cost of a banana be (b) dollars. We are given the following system of equations:   [   3a + 2b = 11   ]   [   5a + 4b = 19   ]   To eliminate (b), we multiply the first equation by (-2) and add it to the second equation:   [   -2(3a + 2b) + (5a + 4b) = -2(11) + 19   ]   [   -6a - 4b + 5a + 4b = -22 + 19   ]   [   -a = -3 implies a = 3   ]   Substituting (a = 3) back into the first equation:   [   3(3) + 2b = 11   ]   [   9 + 2b = 11   ]   [   2b = 2 implies b = 1   ]   Therefore, an apple costs (3) dollars and a banana costs (1) dollar. The difference in cost is:   [   3 - 1 = 2 text{ dollars} = 200 text{ cents}   ]   Hence, an apple costs (boxed{200}) cents more than a banana.3. Problem 3:   Define (a sim b) as (a! - ab). We need to find ((4 sim 5) sim (5 sim (3 sim 1))).   First, calculate (3 sim 1):   [   3 sim 1 = 3! - 3 cdot 1 = 6 - 3 = 3   ]   Next, calculate (5 sim 3):   [   5 sim 3 = 5! - 5 cdot 3 = 120 - 15 = 105   ]   Then, calculate (4 sim 5):   [   4 sim 5 = 4! - 4 cdot 5 = 24 - 20 = 4   ]   Finally, calculate (4 sim 105):   [   4 sim 105 = 4! - 4 cdot 105 = 24 - 420 = -396   ]   Therefore, ((4 sim 5) sim (5 sim (3 sim 1)) = boxed{-396}).4. Problem 4:   Alan has 24 socks: 4 red, 8 blue, and 12 green. To guarantee that the number of green socks is at least twice the number of red socks, we consider the worst-case scenario where Alan picks all the non-green socks first.   He could pick all 4 red and all 8 blue socks first:   [   4 + 8 = 12 text{ socks}   ]   After picking 12 socks, he must pick additional green socks. To ensure the number of green socks is at least twice the number of red socks (4 red socks), he needs at least:   [   2 times 4 = 8 text{ green socks}   ]   Therefore, he needs to pick at least:   [   12 + 8 = 20 text{ socks}   ]   Hence, the minimum number of socks he must pull out is (boxed{20}).5. Problem 5:   The 24th smallest prime number is 89. We need to find the remainder when (89^2) is divided by 24.   First, calculate (89 mod 24):   [   89 div 24 = 3 text{ remainder } 17 implies 89 equiv 17 pmod{24}   ]   Next, calculate (17^2 mod 24):   [   17^2 = 289   ]   [   289 div 24 = 12 text{ remainder } 1 implies 289 equiv 1 pmod{24}   ]   Therefore, the remainder when (89^2) is divided by 24 is (boxed{1}).6. Problem 6:   Let the side length of the cube be (s) and the radius of the sphere be (r). The volume of the cube and the sphere are equal:   [   s^3 = frac{4}{3} pi r^3   ]   Solving for (s):   [   s = sqrt[3]{frac{4 pi}{3}} r   ]   The diameter of the sphere is (2r). The longest diagonal of the cube is:   [   ssqrt{3}   ]   The ratio (k) of the length of the longest diagonal of the cube to the diameter of the sphere is:   [   k = frac{ssqrt{3}}{2r} = frac{sqrt[3]{frac{4 pi}{3}} r sqrt{3}}{2r} = frac{sqrt{3} cdot sqrt[3]{frac{4 pi}{3}}}{2}   ]   We need to find (k^6):   [   k^6 = left( frac{sqrt{3} cdot sqrt[3]{frac{4 pi}{3}}}{2} right)^6 = frac{3^3 cdot left( frac{4 pi}{3} right)^2}{2^6} = frac{27 cdot frac{16 pi^2}{9}}{64} = frac{48 pi^2}{64} = frac{3 pi^2}{4}   ]   Therefore, (k^6 = boxed{frac{3 pi^2}{4}}).7. Problem 7:   Let (O) be the circumcenter of triangle (ABC). The circumradius (R) of an equilateral triangle with side length (a) is given by:   [   R = frac{a}{sqrt{3}}   ]   For (a = 3sqrt{3}):   [   R = frac{3sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} = 3   ]   Since (BD) is tangent to the circumcircle at (B) and (BD = 4), we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from (O) to (D):   [   OD = sqrt{OB^2 + BD^2} = sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = sqrt{9 + 16} = sqrt{25} = 5   ]   Therefore, the distance from the circumcenter of triangle (ABC) to (D) is (boxed{5}).8. Problem 8:   We need to find the largest (k) such that (frac{2023!}{2^k}) is an odd integer. This is equivalent to finding the highest power of 2 that divides (2023!).   Using Legendre's formula:   [   nu_2(2023!) = leftlfloor frac{2023}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2023}{4} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2023}{8} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2023}{16} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2023}{32} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2023}{64} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2023}{128} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2023}{256} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2023}{512} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2023}{1024} rightrfloor   ]   Calculating each term:   [   leftlfloor frac{2023}{2} rightrfloor = 1011   ]   [   leftlfloor frac{2023}{4} rightrfloor = 505   ]   [   leftlfloor frac{2023}{8} rightrfloor = 252   ]   [   leftlfloor frac{2023}{16} rightrfloor = 126   ]   [   leftlfloor frac{2023}{32} rightrfloor = 63   ]   [   leftlfloor frac{2023}{64} rightrfloor = 31   ]   [   leftlfloor frac{2023}{128} rightrfloor = 15   ]   [   leftlfloor frac{2023}{256} rightrfloor = 7   ]   [   leftlfloor frac{2023}{512} rightrfloor = 3   ]   [   leftlfloor frac{2023}{1024} rightrfloor = 1   ]   Summing these values:   [   nu_2(2023!) = 1011 + 505 + 252 + 126 + 63 + 31 + 15 + 7 + 3 + 1 = 2014   ]   Therefore, the value of (k) is (boxed{2014}).9. Problem 9:   Let (S) be a set of 6 distinct positive integers. The sum of the three smallest elements is 8, and the sum of the three largest elements is 19. We need to find the product of the elements in (S).   Let the elements of (S) be (a, b, c, d, e, f) such that (a < b < c < d < e < f). Given:   [   a + b + c = 8   ]   [   d + e + f = 19   ]   The smallest possible values for (a, b, c) are 1, 3, and 4 (since they must be distinct and positive):   [   1 + 3 + 4 = 8   ]   The largest possible values for (d, e, f) are 5, 6, and 8:   [   5 + 6 + 8 = 19   ]   Therefore, the set (S) is ({1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}). The product of the elements is:   [   1 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot 6 cdot 8 = 2880   ]   Hence, the product of the elements in (S) is (boxed{2880}).10. Problem 10:    We need to find the largest integer (b) such that (1 + 2b + 3b^2 + 4b^3 + 5b^4) is divisible by (b + 1).    Using the Remainder Theorem, if (P(b) = 1 + 2b + 3b^2 + 4b^3 + 5b^4) is divisible by (b + 1), then (P(-1) = 0):    [    P(-1) = 1 + 2(-1) + 3(-1)^2 + 4(-1)^3 + 5(-1)^4    ]    [    P(-1) = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 = 3    ]    Since (P(-1) = 3), (b + 1) must be a divisor of 3. The possible values of (b) are:    [    b + 1 = pm 1, pm 3 implies b = 0, -2, 2    ]    The largest possible value of (b) is (boxed{2}).11. Problem 11:    Let (a, b, c) be the roots of the cubic equation (x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 1 = 0). We need to find (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c}).    Using Vieta's formulas:    [    a + b + c = -7    ]    [    ab + bc + ca = 8    ]    [    abc = -1    ]    We can express (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) as:    [    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)    ]    [    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (-7)^2 - 2(8) = 49 - 16 = 33    ]    Next, we find (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c}):    [    frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = frac{ab + bc + ca}{abc} = frac{8}{-1} = -8    ]    Therefore:    [    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = 33 - 8 = 25    ]    Hence, the value is (boxed{25}).12. Problem 12:    Let (c) be a real number such that there are exactly two integers (n) satisfying (2c < n < 3c). Let these integers be (k) and (k+1). We have:    [    k - 1 < 2c < k quad text{and} quad k + 1 < 3c < k + 2    ]    Solving for (c):    [    frac{k}{2} - frac{1}{2} < c < frac{k}{2}    ]    [    frac{k + 1}{3} < c < frac{k + 2}{3}    ]    For these intervals to overlap, we must have:    [    frac{k + 2}{3} > frac{k}{2} - frac{1}{2} quad text{and} quad frac{k}{2} > frac{k + 1}{3}    ]    Solving these inequalities:    [    frac{k + 2}{3} > frac{k}{2} - frac{1}{2} implies 2(k + 2) > 3k - 3 implies 2k + 4 > 3k - 3 implies k < 7    ]    [    frac{k}{2} > frac{k + 1}{3} implies 3k > 2(k + 1) implies 3k > 2k + 2 implies k > 2    ]    Therefore, (k) can be 3, 4, 5, or 6. For each (k):    [    k = 3 implies frac{4}{3} < c < frac{3}{2}    ]    [    k = 4 implies frac{5}{3} < c < 2    ]    [    k = 5 implies 2 < c < frac{7}{3}    ]    [    k = 6 implies frac{5}{2} < c < frac{8}{3}    ]    The expected value of (c) is the average of the midpoints of these intervals:    [    frac{1}{6} left( frac{frac{4}{3} + frac{3}{2}}{2} right) + frac{1}{3} left( frac{frac{5}{3} + 2}{2} right) + frac{1}{3} left( frac{2 + frac{7}{3}}{2} right) + frac{1}{6} left( frac{frac{5}{2} + frac{8}{3}}{2} right)    ]    Calculating each term:    [    frac{frac{4}{3} + "},{"problem":"Given a quadratic function y=ax^{2}+bx+2 (a and b are real numbers).(1) If the function passes through the point (1,1) and y gt 0 for all xin R, find the range of real number a; (2) If the function passes through the point (1,1) and y gt 0 for all ain left[-2,-1right], find the range of real number x; (3) For all xin R, when b gt 0, ygeqslant 0 always holds, find the minimum value of frac{{a+2}}{b}.","solution":"(1) To determine the range of a, we first substitute the point (1,1) into the given quadratic function, obtaining a(1)^{2}+b(1)+2=1.

If a geq 0 and(a+1)+(a+2)+ldots+(a+b)=1000then(-a)+(-a+1)+ldots+a+(a+1)+ldots+(a+b)=1000also holds. In the two decompositions, a total of 2 a+2 b+1, that is, an odd number of numbers appear, so one sum has an even number of terms, and the other has an odd number of terms. Therefore, it is sufficient to find the number of decompositions that consist of an odd number of terms, and the number of all decompositions will be twice this number. (Or one less if we do not consider the single-term decomposition.)So let a decomposition consist of 2 k+1 numbers. Then the numbers before the middle - the (k+1)-th - are 1, 2, ..., k smaller, and the ones after the middle are 1, 2, ..., k larger than the number in the middle, so the sum is exactly the middle number multiplied by 2 k+1. This means that (2 k+1) is a divisor of 1000.Conversely, if (2 k+1) is an odd divisor of 1000, that is, 1000=(2 k+1) m, then in the decomposition 1000=m+m+ldots+m, if we decrease the terms before the middle by 1, 2, ..., k and increase the terms after the middle by 1, 2, ..., k, the sum does not change, and on the right side, we get the sum of consecutive integers.Since the number of terms in different decompositions cannot be the same, by matching the number of terms in the odd-term decompositions, we have established a one-to-one correspondence between the odd-term decompositions of 1000 and the odd divisors of 1000. The number 1000 has 4 odd divisors, so it can be decomposed into the sum of consecutive integers in four ways with an odd number of terms. Accordingly, it can be written as the sum of consecutive integers in eight or seven ways.Remarks. 1. In the first solution, we do not necessarily have to solve 8 systems of equations, especially since the question is only about the number of solutions. The steps in writing equation (1) are reversible, so we get twice as many - and different - solutions as the number of ways 2000 can be decomposed into the product of an odd and an even number. One factor is the number of terms in the decomposition, and the other is the sum of the first and last terms. 2000 can be decomposed into the product of an odd and an even number in as many ways as it has odd divisors, since it is even. The number 2000 has as many odd divisors as the number 1000.2. If we exclude decompositions with a single term, then with any of the above lines of reasoning, we get that if a number has k odd divisors, then it can be written as the sum of consecutive integers in (2 k-1) ways. (If a number's prime factorization is 2^{kappa} cdot p_{1}{ }^{beta_{1}} cdot p_{2}{ }^{beta_{2}} ldots p_{n}{ }^{beta_{n}}, then the number of its odd divisors is k=left(beta_{1}+1right)left(beta_{2}+1right) ldotsleft(beta_{n}+1right).3. If only positive terms are allowed in the decomposition, then using the fact that in the second solution, we not only divided the decompositions into two equal groups according to the parity of the number of terms they contain, but also according to whether the first term in each sum is positive or not, it follows that a number can be written as the sum of consecutive positive integers in exactly one less way than the number of its odd divisors. Specifically, if a number has only one odd divisor, then it cannot be written in this way. Since 1 is a divisor of every integer, these are the numbers that have no other odd divisors besides 1. These are precisely the powers of 2. We have thus also learned that the powers of 2 - and only these - cannot be written as the sum of consecutive positive integers."},{"problem":"Simplify the expression (a-frac{2a-1}{a})÷frac{{a}^{2}-1}{a}, then choose a non-negative integer solution from the inequality 2x-3leqslant 1 to substitute into the expression for evaluation.","solution":"To simplify the expression (a-frac{2a-1}{a})÷frac{{a}^{2}-1}{a}, we follow these steps:1.

What is the greatest number of rays in space that form pairwise obtuse angles?","solution":"35. It is easy to see that it is possible to draw four rays, each pair of which forms obtuse angles: for example, it is sufficient to connect the center O of a regular tetrahedron ABCD with all its vertices (it is clear, for example, that angle AOB > angle AO_1B = 90^circ, where O_1 is the center of the face BCD of the tetrahedron). Now let's prove that it is impossible to specify more than four rays in space, each pair of which forms obtuse angles.Let l_1, l_2, l_3, and l_4 be four rays emanating from a point O and forming obtuse angles with each other, and let pi_1, pi_2, pi_3, and pi_4 be planes passing through the point O and perpendicular to the rays l_1, l_2, l_3, and l_4, respectively. All rays forming obtuse angles with the ray l_1 must lie on the other side of the plane pi_1 from the ray l_1. All rays forming obtuse angles with both rays l_1 and l_2 must lie within the dihedral angle formed by the half-planes pi_1 and pi_2; this dihedral angle (Fig. 83a) is acute, since the angle between the rays perpendicular to its faces is obtuse. All rays forming obtuse angles with each of the three rays l_1, l_2, l_3 must lie within the intersection of the dihedral angles pi_1pi_2 and pi_1pi_3. This intersection is a trihedral angle pi_1pi_2pi_3, or OABC (Fig. 83b), which, as proven above, has all dihedral angles acute. The ray l_4 must lie within it; we will show that it forms acute angles with all other rays lying inside this angle.Let the plane passing through OA and the ray l_4 intersect the face BOC along the ray OA'. One of the dihedral angles with edge OA' is acute; let this be the angle AOA'C. Then all dihedral angles of the trihedral angle OAA'C are acute; hence, all plane angles of this trihedral angle are also acute (see, for example, the solution to problem 28 in the book by D. O. Sharygin et al., cited in the footnote on page 151). But angle AOL_4 is only a part of the angle AOA'; therefore, the angle between the rays OA and l_4 is acute. Similarly, the ray l_4 forms acute angles with OB and OC. Therefore, all1) Consider how this reasoning changes if we are talking about points in space (although the case where all points lie in the same plane does not contradict the condition of problem b).three rays OA, OB, OC lie on the same side of the plane pi_4 as the ray l_4, and thus all internal points of the trihedral angle OABC lie on the same side of pi_4 as the ray l_4.

It turns out that point S, symmetric to point C with respect to the line D L, lies on side A B and does not coincide with its endpoints. What values can angle A B C take?(B. Obukhov, zhori)","solution":"Answer: 60^{circ}.First solution. From the symmetry, triangles C L D and S L D are equal, so D S = D C, angle C D L = angle S D L, and angle D L C = angle D L S. Since the quadrilateral A L D B is inscribed in a circle, we have angle B A L = angle L D C (see Fig. 1). The chords A L and D L of this circle subtend equal angles, so A L = D L.We mark off a segment A S^{prime} = D S = D C on the ray A B. Then triangles S^{prime} L A and S L D are equal by two sides (A S^{prime} = D S, A L = D L) and the angle between them. Therefore, L S^{prime} = L S and angle A S^{prime} L = angle D S L. If points S^{prime} and S do not coincide, then in the isosceles triangle L S S^{prime}, the angles at the base S S^{prime} are equal, so angle A S^{prime} L = angle B S L. Thus, angle D S L = angle B S L, which means D lies on A B; this is impossible.Therefore, S^{prime} = S, and angle A L S = angle D L S = angle D L C. The sum of these three angles is 180^{circ}, so they are each 60^{circ}. Hence, angle A B C = 180^{circ} - angle A L D = 60^{circ}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_e8607f50b48dc7c8d053g-08.jpg?height=444&width=489&top_left_y=442&top_left_x=224)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_e8607f50b48dc7c8d053g-08.jpg?height=402&width=521&top_left_y=437&top_left_x=743)Fig. 2Second solution. Let Omega be the circumcircle of triangle B C S (see Fig. 2). In this triangle, the line B L is the angle bisector of angle B, and the line L D is the perpendicular bisector of side C S. These lines are distinct; both pass through the midpoint of the arc C S of circle Omega that does not contain B. Therefore, their intersection point L is this midpoint, i.e., L in Omega.Since the quadrilateral A L D B is inscribed, we have angle A B C = angle D L C = beta. From symmetry, angle D L C = angle D L S = beta. Now from circle Omega, we get 180^{circ} = angle C B S + angle S L C = beta + angle D L S + angle D L C = 3 beta, from which beta = 60^{circ}.Remark. There are other solutions. For example, one can notice that point L is the excenter of triangle B D S (since B L is the angle bisector of the internal angle of this triangle, and D L is the angle bisector of its external angle). This leads to the calculation angle A B C = angle D L C = angle D L S = 90^{circ} - angle A B C / 2, from which the answer follows.One can also consider the point T, symmetric to point C with respect to L B, as well as the projections S^{prime} and T^{prime} of point C onto L D and L B respectively. From the inscribed quadrilaterals A B D L and L T^{prime} S^{prime} C, we have angle A B C = angle D L C = angle S^{prime} T^{prime} C = angle S T C = angle B T C. But triangle B T C is isosceles, so angle B T C = 90^{circ} - angle A B C / 2.Comment.

Inductive Step:   - We need to show that for ( k+1 ) sticks with a total length of ( (k+1)^2 - (k+1) + 1 = k^2 + k + 1 ), we can split them to obtain sticks of lengths ( 1, 2, ldots, k+1 ).4. Case Analysis:   - If there is a stick of length exactly ( k+1 ), we can use it directly. The remaining ( k ) sticks must have a total length of ( k^2 ), which by the inductive hypothesis can be split into lengths ( 1, 2, ldots, k ).   - If no stick has length exactly ( k+1 ), by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be a stick of length ( ell > k+1 ). Let this stick be the longest one.5. Splitting the Longest Stick:   - Remove a section of length ( k+1 ) from the stick of length ( ell ). This leaves a stick of length ( ell - (k+1) ).   - The total length of the remaining ( k ) sticks is ( k^2 + k + 1 - (k+1) = k^2 ).6.

Expansion Process: The term x^2 in the expansion of left(1-xright)left(1+xright)^{4} can come from two scenarios:   - Taking the x^2 term from (1+x)^4 and the constant term from (1-x).   - Taking the x term from (1-x) and the x term from (1+x)^4.   2. Calculating Coefficients:    - The coefficient of x^2 in (1+x)^4 is given by {C}_{4}^{2} since it's the binomial coefficient for choosing 2 out of 4 (the general formula for the coefficient in a binomial expansion is {C}_{n}^{k} for x^k in (1+x)^n).   - The coefficient of x in (1-x) is -1, and in (1+x)^4 is given by {C}_{4}^{1}.   3. Summing Up Coefficients: The total coefficient b is the sum of coefficients from these two scenarios, hence:   b = {C}_{4}^{2} - {C}_{4}^{1} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} - frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!} = 6 - 4 = 2.

Here, a^2 = 4 and b^2 = m^2, so we have: c_1 = sqrt{4 - m^2} The foci of the ellipse are at the coordinates (pm c_1, 0), which equates to (pm sqrt{4 - m^2}, 0).For the hyperbola frac{x^2}{m} - frac{y^2}{2} = 1, the distance between the center of the hyperbola and its foci, denoted as c_2, is calculated using the formula c_2^2 = a^2 + b^2, with a^2 = m and b^2 = 2.

Understanding the Condition:   Let ( A = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n} ) with ( 1 leq a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_n ). For any subset ( {a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, ldots, a_{i_k}} ) of ( A ), the arithmetic mean (frac{1}{k}(a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + cdots + a_{i_k})) must be an integer. This implies that the sum ( a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + cdots + a_{i_k} ) must be divisible by ( k ).2. Divisibility Condition:   Consider any ( k ) distinct elements ( a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, ldots, a_{i_k} ) from ( A ). We need ( k ) to divide the sum of these ( k ) elements. This implies that for any ( k leq n ), the sum of any ( k ) elements of ( A ) must be divisible by ( k ).3. Modular Arithmetic:   Let ( A ) be the sum of ( k-1 ) elements other than ( a_i ) and ( a_j ). We have:   [   k mid (a_i + A) quad text{and} quad k mid (a_j + A)   ]   This implies:   [   a_i equiv a_j pmod{k}   ]   Hence, all elements ( a_i ) must be congruent modulo ( k ).4. Least Common Multiple:   To satisfy the condition for all ( k leq n-1 ), we need:   [   T = text{lcm}(1, 2, ldots, n-1)   ]   Let ( a_i = c + b_i cdot T ) for some integer ( c ) and distinct integers ( b_i ). The sum of the elements of ( A ) is:   [   sum_{i=1}^n a_i = sum_{i=1}^n (c + b_i cdot T) = nc + T sum_{i=1}^n b_i   ]5. Minimizing the Sum:   To minimize the sum, we can choose ( c = 1 ) and ( b_i = i-1 ). Thus:   [   a_i = 1 + (i-1)T   ]   The sum of the elements is:   [   sum_{i=1}^n a_i = sum_{i=1}^n (1 + (i-1)T) = n + T sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i = n + T cdot frac{n(n-1)}{2}   ]6.

The function sqrt{3-x}-sqrt{x+1} is meaningful in the interval -1 leqq x leqq 3. The function decreases as x increases. Indeed, the square root of a larger number is larger, and that of a smaller number is smaller, so if x increases, 3-x and thus sqrt{3-x} decrease, while x+1 and sqrt{x+1} increase, and therefore -sqrt{x+1} decreases. Consequently,sqrt{3-x}-sqrt{x+1}=sqrt{3-x}+(-sqrt{x+1})the function, being the sum of two decreasing terms, also decreases.At x = -1, the function value is 2, which is greater than 1/2, so we can answer the problem by finding the number x_{0} for which the function takes the value 1 / 2. Then (1) holds for the values where -1 leqq x<x_{0}. Thesqrt{3-x}-sqrt{x+1}=frac{1}{2}equation, after squaring twice and rearranging, yields:begin{gathered}4-2 sqrt{(3-x)(x+1)}=frac{1}{4}, quad 225=64left(3+2 x-x^{2}right) 64 x^{2}-128 x+33=0end{gathered}The equation (5) can only be satisfied by the roots of this equation, namely 1+sqrt{31} / 8 and 1-sqrt{31} / 8. For the former, the left side of (5) is negative, since at x=1 it is 0, and we have seen that it decreases with increasing x. For the latter,begin{gathered}sqrt{3-left(1-frac{sqrt{31}}{8}right)}=frac{sqrt{32+2 sqrt{31}}}{4}=frac{sqrt{31+2 sqrt{31}+1}}{4}=frac{sqrt{31}+1}{4}, text { and } sqrt{left(1-frac{sqrt{31}}{8}right)+1}=frac{sqrt{31-2 sqrt{31}+1}}{4}=frac{sqrt{31}-1}{4} .end{gathered}Thus, the equation (5) can only be satisfied by x_{0}=1-frac{sqrt{31}}{8}, and it is indeed satisfied by this value.

Understanding the given equation: We start with the given equation f(2-x) + f(x) = 0. By substituting x with -x, we get f(2+x) + f(-x) = 0. Since f(x) is an odd function, f(-x) = -f(x). Substituting this into our equation gives us f(2+x) - f(x) = 0, which simplifies to f(2+x) = f(x).2. Identifying the period: The equation f(2+x) = f(x) suggests that the function f(x) has a period of 2. This means that for any x in mathbb{R}, f(x+2) = f(x).3. Using properties of odd functions: We know that for any odd function, f(0) = 0. Additionally, since f(x) has a period of 2, f(1) = f(1+2) = f(3) = f(3+2) = cdots = f(2023).

Finding f(2022) + f(2023): Since f(x) has a period of 2, we can conclude that f(2022) = f(0) and f(2023) = f(1). We already established that f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 0.

This implies that f(x)=frac{1}{1+{2}^{x}} is monotonically decreasing on mathbb{R} because as x increases, 1+2^{x} increases, making the value of f(x) decrease.Additionally, we can prove that f(x)+f(-x)=1 by calculating:[f(x)+f(-x)=frac{1}{1+{2}^{x}}+frac{1}{1+{2}^{-x}}=frac{1+2^{-x}+1+2^{x}}{1+2^{x}+2^{-x}+2^{x}2^{-x}}=frac{2+2^{x}+2^{-x}}{2+2^{x}+2^{-x}}=1.]Given the inequality f(ae^{x})leqslant 1-fleft(ln a-ln xright), and using the property f(x)+f(-x)=1, we can rewrite the inequality as:[f(ae^{x}) leqslant f(ln x-ln a) = f(lnfrac{x}{a}) quad text{for} quad x > 0.]By the monotonicity of f(x), this implies:[ae^{x} geqslant lnfrac{x}{a}.]Rearranging, we get:[xe^{x} geqslant frac{x}{a}lnfrac{x}{a} = frac{x}{a}e^{lnfrac{x}{a}}.]Let g(x)=xe^{x} for x>0. The derivative of g(x) is:[g'(x)=e^{x}+xe^{x}=(x+1)e^{x}.]Since g'(x)>0 for x>0, g(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,+infty). This implies:[x geqslant lnfrac{x}{a} = ln x - ln a,]which further implies:[ln a geqslant ln x - x.]Let's define another function h(x)=ln x - x for x>0. The derivative of h(x) is:[h'(x)=frac{1}{x}-1=frac{1-x}{x}.]Analyzing h'(x), we find that h'(x)>0 for 01.

Claim and Initial Consideration:   We claim that the minimal distance ( d ) such that there always exists a point ( A ) with integer coordinates and the distance from ( A ) to the line ( l ) is ( leq d ) is ( frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ).2. Lower Bound:   To show that ( d geq frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ), consider the line ( x + y = frac{1}{2} ). The distance from a point ( (x_0, y_0) ) to this line is given by the formula:   [   frac{|x_0 + y_0 - frac{1}{2}|}{sqrt{2}}   ]   Since ( x_0 ) and ( y_0 ) are integers, the numerator ( |x_0 + y_0 - frac{1}{2}| ) is minimized when ( x_0 + y_0 ) is as close to ( frac{1}{2} ) as possible. The minimum value of the numerator is ( frac{1}{2} ), thus:   [   frac{frac{1}{2}}{sqrt{2}} = frac{1}{2sqrt{2}}   ]   Therefore, ( d geq frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ).3. General Case:   Consider a general line given by the equation ( Ax + By - C = 0 ). The distance from a point ( (x_0, y_0) ) to this line is:   [   frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 - C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}   ]4. Rational and Irrational Slopes:   - If ( frac{A}{B} notin mathbb{Q} ) and ( A, B neq 0 ), the numerator ( |Ax_0 + By_0 - C| ) can take any value, so the distance can be arbitrarily small.   - If ( frac{A}{B} in mathbb{Q} ), we can scale ( A ) and ( B ) by a constant ( lambda in mathbb{R} ) such that ( A ) and ( B ) are integers. Without loss of generality, assume ( A ) and ( B ) are integers with ( gcd(A, B) = d ).5. Integer Lattice and Pigeonhole Principle:   The set ( {Ax_0 + By_0 mid x_0, y_0 in mathbb{Z}} = dmathbb{Z} ). By the pigeonhole principle, we can find ( x_0, y_0 in mathbb{Z} ) such that:   [   min frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 - C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} leq frac{1}{2} left( frac{|d cdot lfloor frac{C}{d} rfloor - C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} + frac{|d cdot lceil frac{C}{d} rceil - C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} right)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   frac{d}{2sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} leq frac{d}{2sqrt{d^2 + d^2}} = frac{1}{2sqrt{2}}   ]6.

Find all quadratic functions f(x)=x^{2}-a x+b with integer coefficients such that there exist distinct integer numbers m, n, p in the interval [1,9] for which |f(m)|=|f(n)|=|f(p)|=7.","solution":"Solution: Let f(x) be a function satisfying the conditions of the problem. Such a function cannot take one and the same value for three different arguments (otherwise we would have a quadratic equation having three distinct roots). Therefore two of the numbers f(m), f(n) and f(p) equal 7 (or -7 ) and the third one equals -7 (or 7 ).Case 1. f(m)=f(n)=7, f(p)=-7. Without loss of generality we may assume that m>n. Since m, n are roots of x^{2}-a x+b-7=0, we obtain that a=m+n, b=m n+7.Subtracting the two equalitiesbegin{array}{ccc}m^{2}-a m+b & = & 7 p^{2}-a p+b & = & -7end{array}we find14=m^{2}-p^{2}-a(m-p)=(m-p)(m+p-a)=(m-p)(p-n)Thus the numbers m-p and p-n are either both positive or both negative and since m>n, they are positive. Moreover they are integer and therefore are equal to 1 and 14 or to 2 and 7. But since m, n, p in[1,9] it follows that neither m-p nor p-n is 14 . There are two cases to consider: m-p=2, p-n=7 and m-p=7, p-n=2, i. e., either m=p+2, n=p-7 or m=p+7, n=p-2. It is obvious that in both cases at least one of m, n, p lies outside the interval [1,9].Case 2. f(m)=f(n)=-7, f(p)=7. As in Case 1 we get a=m+n, b=m n-7 and (m-p)(p-n)=-14. Using similar arguments we obtain that either m-p=2, p-n=-7 or m- p=-2, p-n=7. (Without loss of generality we suppose that |m-p|<|p-n|.) Therefore the two options are m=p+2, n=p+7 and m=p-2, n=p-7.

Suppose the counters are set to all powers of two from 1 to 1024 and some 17 other numbers. Since the order of moves does not matter, we can arrange them in descending order of the numbers being subtracted. We will show by induction that after the k-th move, there is a number on the board that is not less than 2^{10-k}. The base case - 0 moves - is obvious. Suppose after k moves, there is a number on the board that is not less than 2^{10-k}. If we subtract a number greater than 2^{10-k-1} on the k-th move, then this and the previous moves have not affected the number 2^{10-k-1}, and the proof is complete. Otherwise, after the subtraction, there will be a number not less than 2^{10-k-1}, which is not less than 2^{10-k}. From the proven statement, it follows that after 10 moves, there will still be a number on the board that is not less than 2^{0}=1, meaning that at least 11 moves are required.Example. By subtracting 2^{10} from all numbers not less than 2^{10}, we will make all numbers less than 2^{10}. The next step will similarly make all numbers less than 2^{9}, and so on.

Initial Claim and Verification:   We claim that the only solutions are ( f(x) = pm x^a ) for ( a = 0, 1, ldots, k ). To verify that these work, note that ( n mid n! ) for all positive integers ( n ). Therefore, ( n^a mid (n!)^k ) for ( a leq k ).2. Constant Polynomial Case:   If ( f ) is a constant polynomial, it must be ( pm 1 ). This is because any constant ( c ) must divide ( (n!)^k ) for all ( n ). The only integers that divide all factorials are ( pm 1 ).3. Non-constant Polynomial Case:   Assume ( f ) is not constant. We claim that only prime factors of ( n ) may divide ( f(n) ). 4. Modulo Argument:   Note that for integer polynomials, ( a equiv b pmod{c} implies f(a) equiv f(b) pmod{c} ). Let ( d ) be equivalent to ( n ) modulo some prime ( p ) such that ( 1 leq d < p ). Thus, ( f(n) equiv f(d) pmod{p} ). Since ( f(d) mid (d!)^k ), it is not divisible by ( p ) (as ( d < p )), so ( f(n) ) is not divisible by any prime ( p ) that does not divide ( n ).5. Prime Evaluation:   Now, consider ( f(p) ) for a prime ( p ). We have ( f(p) = pm p^l ) for some ( 0 leq l leq k ). Since ( f ) is non-constant, ( l geq 1 ) for infinitely many primes ( p ). 6. Constant Term Analysis:   Since ( p ) divides all the non-constant terms of ( f(p) ), the constant term of ( f ) must be divisible by infinitely many primes. Therefore, the constant term of ( f ) is zero.7. Inductive Argument:   Since the constant term is zero, we can factor out an ( x ) from ( f(x) ). By induction, we conclude that ( f(x) = pm x^a ) for some ( a ).8.

We start with the equation (a^2 + p^3 = b^4). We can rewrite this as:   [   p^3 = b^4 - a^2 = (b^2 + a)(b^2 - a)   ]   Since (p) is a prime number, the factors (b^2 + a) and (b^2 - a) must be powers of (p).2. We consider two cases:   - Case 1: (b^2 + a = p^2) and (b^2 - a = p)   - Case 2: (b^2 + a = p^3) and (b^2 - a = 1)3. For Case 1:   - Adding and subtracting the equations, we get:     [     2b^2 = p^2 + p quad text{and} quad 2a = p^2 - p     ]     [     b^2 = frac{p^2 + p}{2} quad text{and} quad a = frac{p^2 - p}{2}     ]   - We need (b^2) to be a perfect square.

If (3 nmid p+1), then (gcdleft(frac{p+1}{2}, p^2 - p + 1right) = 1), which implies that both (frac{p+1}{2}) and (p^2 - p + 1) are perfect squares. This is a contradiction because there cannot exist any integer (n) such that (p(p-1) = (n-1)(n+1)).6. Therefore, we must have (p equiv 2 pmod{3}) and (gcdleft(frac{p+1}{2}, p^2 - p + 1right) = 3).

Understanding the Problem:   We need to color the integers from (1) to (2007) such that if three distinct integers (a), (b), and (c) are the same color, then (a nmid b) or (b nmid c). This means that no three integers in the same color class can form a chain of divisibility.2. Using the Pigeonhole Principle:   To show that five colors are not enough, consider the set ({1, 2, 4, ldots, 2^{10} = 1024}). This set contains 11 numbers. By the Pigeonhole Principle, if we use only five colors, at least three of these numbers must be the same color. However, these numbers form a chain of divisibility: (1 mid 2 mid 4 mid ldots mid 1024). Therefore, five colors are insufficient.3. Proving Six Colors are Sufficient:   We need to show that six colors are enough to color the integers from (1) to (2007) such that no three integers in the same color class form a chain of divisibility.   - For any integer (n), express it in its prime factorization form: (n = prod_{k=1}^{m} p_k^{alpha_k}).   - Define (Omega(n) = sum_{k=1}^{m} alpha_k), which is the total number of prime factors of (n) (counting multiplicities).4. Bounding (Omega(n)):   - Since (2^{11} = 2048 > 2007), any integer (n) in the range ({1, 2, ldots, 2007}) has (Omega(n) leq 10).5. Coloring Scheme:   - Color each integer (n) with the color (leftlfloor frac{1}{2} left(1 + Omega(n)right) rightrfloor).   - This coloring scheme ensures that (Omega(n)) values are distributed among six colors: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).6. Verifying the Coloring Scheme:   - Suppose (a < b < c) are three integers of the same color, and (a mid b) and (b mid c).   - This implies (Omega(a) < Omega(b) < Omega(c)).   - Since the integers are of the same color, (leftlfloor frac{1}{2} left(1 + Omega(a)right) rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{1}{2} left(1 + Omega(b)right) rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{1}{2} left(1 + Omega(c)right) rightrfloor).   - This implies (Omega(c) - Omega(a) geq 2), which is a contradiction because they should be within the same color class.Therefore, six colors are sufficient to color the integers from (1) to (2007) such that no three integers in the same color class form a chain of divisibility.The final answer is ( boxed{ 6 } )."},{"problem":"31.

Let the equation of the tangent line be y=kx, which rearranges to kx - y = 0.Using the property of a tangent line to a circle, we find that the distance from the center of the circle (3,3) to the tangent line must be equal to the radius:frac {|3k-3|}{sqrt{k^{2}+1}} = sqrt{6}.Solving this equation, we obtain two possible values for k: k = 3-2sqrt{2} and k = 3+2sqrt{2}.Since we are looking for the maximum value, we pick the larger value of k, which is k = 3+2sqrt{2}.Therefore, the maximum value of frac {y}{x} is boxed{3+2sqrt{2}}.Hence, the correct choice is B.*Note*: This problem primarily tests the understanding of the relationship between a line and a circle, the formula for the distance from a point to a line, and the application of the slope formula for a line.

The parabola C is defined by the equation y^{2}=2px, where p > 0. The vertex of this parabola is at the origin O.2. The parabola passes through the point A(x_{0}, 2), which means when y=2, we can substitute into the parabola's equation to find a relationship involving x_{0} and p.3. The focus of the parabola C, denoted as F, has a property that |AF|=3|OF|. The distance from the focus to the vertex (i.e., OF) in a parabola defined as y^{2}=2px is frac{p}{2}. 4. Given |AF|=3|OF|, we can express this in terms of x_{0} and p. The distance AF can be thought of as the distance from A to the focus F, which is along the x-axis for this parabola. Thus, the x-coordinate of F is frac{p}{2} (since the focus of a parabola y^2 = 2px is (frac{p}{2}, 0)), and the x-coordinate of A is x_0. Therefore, the distance AF is |x_0 - (-frac{p}{2})| = |x_0 + frac{p}{2}|.5. Substituting |AF|=3|OF| into the equation, we get |x_0 + frac{p}{2}| = 3|frac{p}{2}|. Since both x_0 and p are positive (as the parabola opens to the right and passes through a point with a positive x-coordinate), we can remove the absolute value to get x_0 + frac{p}{2} = frac{3p}{2}.6. Solving for x_0 gives us x_0 = frac{3p}{2} - frac{p}{2} = p.7. We know the parabola passes through the point A(x_{0}, 2), so substituting y=2 into the parabola's equation y^{2}=2px gives us 4=2px_0. Substituting x_0 = p into this equation gives 4=2p^2.8. Solving the equation 4=2p^2 for p gives p^2 = frac{4}{2} = 2, so p = sqrt{2}.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C}, which corresponds to p = sqrt{2}."},{"problem":"4.

Is N divisible by 3?","solution":"Let the number of permutations of 1, 2, ... , n with 1 fixed and each number differing from its neighbours by at most 2 be p(n). The first number must be 1, so the second number must be 2 or 3. If the second number is 2, then the number of permutations of 2, 3, ... , n with 2 fixed and each number differing from its neighbours by at most 2 is p(n-1). If the second number is 3, then the third number is 2, 4 or 5. If it is 2, then the fourth number must be 4. In that case, the number of permutations of 4, 5, ... , n with 4 fixed etc is p(n-3). So suppose it is not 2. If we get two adjacent numbers (m m+1 or m m-1) then either all following numbers are greater or all following numbers are less. In the sequence 1, 3, ... we have missed out a smaller number, namely 2, so after the first even number we must go back to it. Hence after the first even number we cannot have any larger numbers. In other words, the only possibility for 1, 3, (not 2), ... is all the odd numbers in increasing sequence followed by all the even numbers in decreasing sequence, eg 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 2. Thus we have established that p(n) = p(n-1) + p(n-3) + 1. Checking the first few values, we find p(1) = 1, p(2) = 1, p(3) = 2, p(4) = 4, p(5) = 6, p(6) = 9.

Determine the sum of all pretty numbers.","solution":"## Solution.First, let's prove the following statement: a natural number n is pretty if and only if it is of the form 360-d, where d is a divisor of 360 less than 360.First, let n be pretty. Then there exists a divisor d of n such that n+d=360. Since d divides n and itself, it divides the left side of the equation, and thus it divides the right side as well. Therefore, n can indeed be written as 360-d, where d is a divisor of 360. Clearly, d<360, otherwise n would not be a natural number.Now, assume that n can be written as 360 - d, where d is a divisor of 360 less than that number. Then from the equation n=360-d, similarly as before, we see that d divides the expressions on the right side, so it must divide the expression on the left side as well. Therefore, d is a divisor of n, and n+d=360, making n a pretty number.Since every pretty number is the difference between 360 and a divisor of 360, we conclude that360-d_{1}, 360-d_{2}, ldots, 360-d_{N}are all pretty numbers, where d_{1}, d_{2}, ldots, d_{N} are all divisors of 360 less than 360 itself.Therefore, the desired sum can be written asI:=left(360-d_{1}right)+cdots+left(360-d_{N}right)=360 cdot N-left(d_{1}+cdots+d_{N}right)=360 cdot N-Swhere N and S are the number and the sum of divisors of 360 less than 360.In general, for a natural number n with a unique prime factorization in the formn=p_{1}^{alpha_{1}} cdot ldots cdot p_{k}^{alpha_{k}}the formulas for the number of divisors tau(n) and the sum of divisors sigma(n) (including n itself as a divisor) are respectively:begin{aligned}tau(n) & =left(alpha_{1}+1right) cdot ldots cdotleft(alpha_{k}+1right) sigma(n) & =frac{p_{1}^{alpha_{1}+1}-1}{p_{1}-1} cdot ldots cdot frac{p_{k}^{alpha_{k}+1}-1}{p_{k}-1}end{aligned}Applying these formulas, we getbegin{aligned}tau(360) & =(3+1)(2+1)(1+1)=24 sigma(360) & =frac{2^{4}-1}{2-1} cdot frac{3^{3}-1}{3-1} cdot frac{5^{2}-1}{5-1}=1170end{aligned}so N=24-1=23, and S=1170-360=810.Therefore, the final result isI=360 cdot N-S=23 cdot 360-810=74701 pointNote: The number N and the sum S of the divisors of 360 can also be determined by directly listing all divisors.
