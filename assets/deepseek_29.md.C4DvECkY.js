But if the vitiligo patch is stable, that is no change in the size of the patch over six months, then surgery can be done to re-pigment the vitiligo patch. Suction blister, nonculture melanocyte transfer or phototherapy can be done. Clinical examination of the patch is important before considering any therapy.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent.

I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning.

For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

Nonetheless, I would suggest you confirm the presence or absence of pregnancy by doing a blood test namely the serum beta hCG and share the reports. If it is negative, then repeat the test after a week, if it is still negative, then no need to do anything. Use protection during sexual intercourse in the meantime, your periods will start eventually, and then your menstrual cycle will become regular.

I also suffer from migraines, anxiety and insomnia. I am on topamax 100 mg twice a day, clonapin 0.5 thrice a day as needed, Paxil 10 mg in the morning (recently started) also for the insomnia I was started on elavil 25 mg on friday but I have not taken it yet because I noticed one of the side effects could cause QT prolongation which I do not know, but I am wondering if it is the same or very similar to the side effect of seroquel (arrthythmia as a side effect). I used to take seroquel for bipolar and insomnia, it worked well for about 6 months but then I started having instances every night where I went extremely tachycardic, could not breathe, turned blue and had to be rushed to the hospital. They were calling it a panic attack for several days before they figured out if it was the seroquel and my EKG was abnormal and it was too dangerous for me to be on and I could have died. Anyhow, I do not respond to any of the sleeping pills (the benzo ones) nor the highly sedating ones like the antipsychotics or even trazadone or benadryl or vistoryl or such. I am working on getting a sleep study, so this is my last option till then. Also, I cannot see my doctor until Thursday, and I feel like part of my insomnia is because my body has become dependent on the clonapin. I am trying not to take it at all, but my chest is starting to hurt, I am getting more anxiety and more headaches. How can I start to taper down before Thursday? What is the best way? I need to get better sleep. I am starting to really suffer. It has been 3 weeks of about 10 hours of sleep each week. Also, could Paxil give me more headaches? Sorry about all the questions. I notice I have more headaches now and the topamax was recently increased to 200/day. I feel so angry, I just need a break. Please help me with some answers if you could.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your concerns. I feel that Topamax 200mg which works well for migraine has a little role in bipolar disorders. Studies show that monotherapy with topamax is not recommended but instead of taking topamax, you can try sodium valproate (Depakote xr 750mg at night) which will be helpful to you in both your migraine and bipolarity. Divalpoex sodium (depakote) has sedative property as a side effect. So it will be helpful to you in your insomnia. If you take 750 mg of Dep. at night then you can reduce the night dosage of clonapin and gradually increase the dosage of depakote to 1000 mg and reduce the clonapin. You can also take 500mg in morning and 1000mg at night. And I feel that if you are feeling depressed then only you should take paxil, otherwise there is no role of it in bipolar disorder. If your migraine is severe then you should take propranolol 10mg twice a day. But you have to take care about your heart, because you complained about side effects of seroquel. Propranolol is beta blocker, It is used in prophylaxis for migraine. And I feel that if you use it you finally will get relief from your migraine. I do not know whether you have ever tried non benzos like zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone. You should try that also for your sleep. I feel that, these will satisfy some of your concerns.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

Here, persistent anxiety in social situations like talking with a person or a group of people, in group presentations, in talking with the opposite sex, etc., are found. Avoiding social gathering and social situations are most commonly seen. Accepting that one has social anxiety is one of the most important things to deal with. The sufferer should be made comfortable that this is a disorder like any other disorder. With proper medicines and behavior therapy, most of the individuals show improvement. The patient should be educated properly regarding this illness. Social anxiety is one of the disabling conditions, and early treatment helps in the early response to therapy. The patient should be given proper support and should be made aware that others are not judging him. This is the most important step in the management. Relaxing prior to any anxiety provoking situation helps to yield best results. There is no need to make any specific preparations. Once the provisional diagnosis of social anxiety is made, then the patient is encouraged to speak without hesitation. Building up a rapport takes time in such situations, but once it is built, then the interview goes easy.

I cannot figure out how it first started, but just suddenly one day, I started to feel strange when I am facing people. I could be talking to them in a normal way, and then suddenly I would feel like I am looking at them in a strange way. The strangest thing is, this is not just my feeling, the other person can see the strange way of me looking at them. I do not know exactly how my looking at them makes them feel, but I could notice a sudden change in their reaction towards me. They would look at me in a strange way as well, and then quickly finish the conversation and walk away. When I am facing customer service people, it is the same. I feel like I cannot look at people in a normal way. I have received very bad service many times just because of my weird eye contact. And because this has happened so many times, I am getting more nervous when I have to face people now. I would be afraid that my way of looking at people would make them feel bad. But the more I am afraid that would happen, the worse I would be. I am not sure what is the reason for this happening to me. Maybe it a lack of confidence or nervousness, but I am not sure. This is a terrible condition that I am having, and it feels terrible that my strange way of looking at people make them feel bad. And it also makes me feel so awful because people are treating me badly. And I am driving people away from me. I am suffering from depression and schizophrenia. I am taking Aripiprazole, and all the symptoms are under control. Could this be part of schizophrenia? Can a higher dose of medication help? I do not want to increase the dose of medication if possible. I am taking 10 mg of Aripiprazole every day at the moment. Before I go to sleep, I could imagine the way that I want myself to be. And if I continue to do this, after a while I would become how I want myself to be. I think this method might help me with this issue of eye contact. But I am not sure how I should do it. Should I just repeat the affirmation to myself? Affirmations like 'I am a friendly person,' 'people are nice to me,' etc. I am a friendly person inside, and it is just my strange way of looking at people which I cannot control. Or should I imagine in my mind a scenario that I am facing a customer service person, and imagine that I am looking at him or her in a natural and normal way?

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects.

I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

A few weeks later, she got ill with vomiting which lasted for approximately two weeks, so we made three visits to the urgent care, where she was treated for gastritis and dehydration. One month later, the same thing occurred, so this time I took her to another doctor who ran blood tests, stool culture, tested for H.pylori and did an ultrasound. The blood tests were normal with the exception of a high CPK and bilirubin reading. The ultrasound results were also normal. And this happened again a couple of months back. This time a CT scan was ordered and some additional blood tests were done, all of which were normal. The only thing that appears consistent with these episodes is that they always occur approximately two weeks before her period is due, except for an episode that occurred this weekend when she did not eat on time.

I did a patch test on my arm (as instructed in the product instructions) and had no reactions after 24 hours, so I proceeded to use it on my face. It tells you to leave it on for 3 to 10 minutes (not exceeding 10 minutes). I checked after three minutes and decided to leave it on for a further 30 seconds, as I could not see that it was doing anything. My face started to feel like it was burning, and I could see small red dots forming on my face. I carefully removed the product and saw that the red dots were bleeding. The product was actually removing smalls chunks of my skin. The areas where I applied the cream were left red raw. I made sure my face was completely rid of the product and applied ice, soothing creams, and coconut oil.

Can you please suggest any process for it?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, there are two treatment options. 1. Ortho (braces) treatment. 2. Tooth-colored fillings. Gap closure by braces is a permanent solution. Your teeth will be aligned and the gap can be closed naturally. This option is suggested when the gap is very wide and this helps correct other tooth alignment issues if present. Whereas in the second option, the gap is closed with a tooth-colored filling material. This is not a permanent solution. This filling can last anywhere between three to seven years. If this filling fractures in the future, you may require a new filling in its place. However, the longevity of this filling depends on our maintenance. This will best suit if the gap between the two teeth is less than 4 mm. The option that best suits you is determined by the amount of gap present, general oral hygiene, and your gum health. A clear picture of the gap will help suggest. If you want to close your tooth gap naturally without any filling, please visit an orthodontist to start a braces treatment. But if the gap is minimal and you want a filling to close the gap, this procedure is best done by a cosmetic dentist.

After consulting many experts, we got three views, first is to carry out a biopsy and D and C, in the absence of malignant cancer, then we do not need to opt for hysterectomy (even with the endometrial thickness of 9 mm). Second, is to remove the uterus and the cervix, but keep the ovaries, as ovaries still produce 20 to 30% of the required hormones even after menopause. Third, is to remove the uterus and ovaries altogether and carry out the biopsy through frozen section at the time of TLH. Which is the best option, and why? What happens to hormone productions (even if it is 20 to 30%) after removal of ovaries? If ovaries are removed, do we have to get HRT?

I have seen all the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). First, D and C (dilation and curettage) with cervical biopsy with acetic acid or Lugol's iodine should be done as you have postmenopausal spotting with thickened endometrium of 9 mm, with associated risk factor that is diabetes. This is required to rule out malignancy. Also, an antibiotic course should be given. Once this test is normal, then serial ultrasound every three months can be done to check for the endometrium thickness. Or if symptoms continue then you can opt for a hysterectomy. Removal of ovaries after menopause can be done as hormone reduces significantly, the only problem with that may be postmenopausal symptoms like hot flushes, recurrent vaginitis, and osteoporosis, which we can deal symptomatically.

I do not have any structural or plumbing heart issues. I have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and I am waiting for an ablation in 17 days. I am mostly asymptomatic, and I never had any extremely rapid heart rates. My resting heart rate is actually in the 40's. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row. The EP I saw in the hospital prescribed me Flecainide 50 mg, twice daily. I saw another EP, who was a much older guy, as a second opinion. He seems to think I do not need the Flecainide, and maybe not even the ablation. I do not agree with him on the ablation due to recent medical studies on WPW and how ablation is recommended even for asymptomatic patients, especially athletes. My question is regarding Flecainide. I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm. Reading case studies and medical journals, it seems there is some risk. I have not been known to go into AF, and besides palpitations, I am asymptomatic with WPW. Do you think Flecainide at this dosage is safe and reasonable for the next two weeks, until my ablation?","Doctor":"Hi. In WPW (Wolff-Parkinson-White) syndrome, there is a chance of rhythm disturbance, cardiac rate , and it is episodic in nature. I can present as palpitation, but the timing cannot be predicted. Regarding Flecainide, I do not think you need to continue for next two weeks. But, your cardiologist who will perform this surgery, is the best judge to advise you whether he wants to continue it prophylactically or not.

Board exams are indeed stressful for every student and especially with this huge coronavirus scare thats going on, it is even worse I am sure. Although, now that your board exams have been suspended for the next 10 days, you may breathe a sigh of relief. I can still give you some tips on handling exam pressure. 1. Study in small clusters of time, like study for 50 minutes then take a 10 minutes break and then restart. 2. Have a proper three square homecooked meals a day with two small snacks in between. No junk food, aerated drinks, tea or coffee. 3. Spend one hour every day in engaging in your hobby even during exam time. This will recharge your mind and you will feel more concentrated and productive in studies. 4. Keep your phone and other gadgets at bay. Switching them off until exams get over is the best thing to do. 5. Catch up on good sleep at night and keep sleep timings fixed.

I do not have any symptoms. Should I get investigated to rule out secondary hypertension?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes certainly, you being a young hypertensive first need an evaluation to know the cause of blood pressure. You should undergo a few tests like kidney function test, renal artery Doppler, serum cortisol and 24-hour urinary metanephrines. Also get lipid profile and sugars tested. You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week and then once or twice a week. If BP is persistently more than 140/90 mmHg, then you should be on medicines for it. High blood pressure is a silent killer. It rarely causes symptoms, but keep on damaging your organs. Do regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according your capacity for at least 30 minutes a day and 5 days a week. Eat lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, and fish once or twice a week. Avoid meat, smoking, and alcohol if any. There should not be abdominal fat deposition or obesity.

She is hypertensive (150-100) and having all over body pain, fatigue and morning stiffness. We consulted a neurologist and she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. She was going about daily activities by using painkiller every day (Innova-MR, Diclofenac, Paracetamol, Chlorzoxazone) before the diagnosis. The prescription for fibromyalgia was Formylin (Methylcobalamin, Pyridoxine H, Folic acid) one tablet in the noon, Duloxetine (gastro-resistant Duloren) 20mg, (Duloxetine 5 mg (0.25 tablet) for first 5 days, 10 mg for the next five days and 20 mg there after). Our main concern is Duloxetine. She has started 5 mg per day dose for a week but is scared to take this medicine as we have come across online references where Duloxetine, Cymbalta actually aggravated the problem, like Duloxetine changes a person's behavior for worse like the person taking it does not remain the same anymore after taking it for few months, becomes emotionally vulnerable and may have suicidal tendencies, etc also. Duloxetine has severe withdrawal problem, the dose has to be tapered very slowly. Changing to different medication becomes very difficult. Is it true? Duloxetine damages critical organs like liver also can cause serotonin syndrome (she is not on any other SSRI, SNRI, psychotropic medicine) For how long she has to take Duloxetine? Will she be ever off on it once she feels better? If the medicine is to be continued, do we have any other safe pharmaceutical alternatives to Duloxetine? Would you recommend any supplements for fibromyalgia? Since it is SNRI, will it adversely affect her blood pressure? She is taking Atenolol 50 mg per day, currently and her BP under control with it. Please advise regarding the safety and efficacy of this drug as there are countless negative reviews about it on youtube and social media.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  Regarding your concern, I would explain that morning stiffness is not a typical sign of fibromyalgia, but it could indicate a rheumatological disorder. Coming to this point, considering her slightly elevated erythrosedimentation, I would recommend performing other tests before concluding about fibromyalgia. In this regard, I would recommend performing rheumatoid factor plasma levels, ANA (anti-nuclear antibody) and ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) titer. A nerve conduction study is also necessary to exclude possible neuropathy, although she does not have diabetes. If these tests result normal, she can continue taking Duloxetine and gradually increase the dose up to 60 mg daily (which is the maintenance therapeutic dose). You should not worry so much about this drug. It can be stopped gradually (like the way she is starting it). If it is started slowly, it does not lead to serotonin syndrome, as long as she is not taking any other SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). After stopping this drug, other drugs may be tried like Pregabaline, etc. Anyway, the internet is not the best doctor to ask, because the information is very wide and nonspecific. Every drug has adverse effects, but they usually occur in a low percentage of patients, especially when high doses are used without starting slowly.

But in spite of that, I would like to advise few things. Stop thinking that you would fail or lose money. Instead, think positive and focus on how you could perform better. Do not try to stop thinking negative, instead whenever some negative thought comes in your mind divert your thoughts in a positive direction by thinking about good things in your life because everyone has some good and bad things in life. Start doing 25 minutes of brisk walking or exercise daily, it will lead to the release of anti-stress hormone endorphins. Use perfumes, it also leads to release of serotonin and increase dopamine level which will decrease your anxiety or stress level. If possible indulge yourself in learning something new that you are interested in, as it also leads to elevation of mood and release of epinephrine and norepinephrine. If your blood pressure is normal or in normal lower range, eat more of salty things it also leads to raised epinephrine levels.

But now, I feel a small cluster on my breast. Can fibroadenoma recur? Someone said that I am infected with a sexual disease. I have regular periods, do I have any sexually transmitted disease? I am not sexually active.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, I would like to tell you that fibroadenoma is a non-cancerous breast problem which occurs in young women. These are usually hormone related and frequently regress after menopause. It is always recommended to increase vegetables and fruit intake, and exercise regularly. Get regular breast examination to make sure that the size is not increasing. Also, fibroadenomas are affected by hormones and tend to fluctuate in size during menstrual cycle or if using oral contraceptives, and these may even shrink after menopause. Local reoccurrence of fibroadenoma is common. Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are due to organisms that hide in vaginal secretions, semen, blood, and sometimes saliva. Many of these are spread through contact with infected body fluids or semen. Having unprotected (without condom) vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has STD is the usual mode through which it can be acquired. It is difficult to tell if someone has STD, as there can be no symptoms or signs. Genital touching can also transmit some of these diseases like syphilis or herpes.

If one parent has schizophrenia, there is about a 10 or 12 percent chance for the child to develop the same. (90 percent chance of normal child).

If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this?","Doctor":"Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM.

For further information consult a dietician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, First of all, let me thank you for this platform. It is just wonderful that you make professional opinion available for people who have nowhere else to turn. My mother has been showing weird behavior ever since I can remember. The issue is that anytime someone (from our family or otherwise) brings up the fact that she is acting unusual, she denies it. Everyone is wrong, and she is always right. I am wondering if maybe I describe her behavior here, I could get some opinion on whether or not she is indeed in need of help, and whether or not she can care of her children. She has a lot of mood swings, she is incredibly happy some days, and she has a small idea which she believes can turn her life around. And she would not let anyone's opinion deter her. She makes rash decisions and shops a lot, spends all the money she has. Other days, you can just see how down she is. She has difficulty getting out of bed and is extremely irritable and generally in a bad mood. She will yell and get overly angry for seemingly small reasons. Also, she lies a lot, but it is strange because it is like she does not realize she is lying. It is like she changes the facts in her head, she believes that whatever she is saying really happened, even if multiple people who witnessed the same thing say otherwise. And she will get angry if contradicted. She is also very manipulative, especially concerning her children and money. She regularly uses her kids to get money from the family and brainwashes the kids (through repetition, yelling, and psychological abuse) against any member of the family that they seem to like more than her, or that refuses to cave to her manipulation. She has no friends. Her mood swings alone are enough to drive anyone away. Also, she has a surprisingly cold attitude towards her kids. She is not warm or affectionate (I sincerely cannot remember the last time she gave any of us a hug), and she will easily put us aside if bigger interest is at stake, for example, she overlooked the fact that my step-father abused me because he gave her money. Recently, seven years after the fact, she wants to defend me, since he stopped paying up. She was prepared to do it without my consent too. She just casually mentioned it in conversation, in the same way, she would tell me about how it has been raining a lot recently. The fact that I was suffering visibly for years never seemed to bother her. Well, I think that may be enough of a description. There are a lot more details, but I believe these are the main factors that always strike me as odd. I am fine now and out of her life, but I am worried about my brothers, and whether or not they are safe with her. Please help, your opinion is greatly appreciated. I would like to have some sort of professional feedback before taking any action concerning the safety and well-being of my brothers. They mean the world to me, and if they are to be removed from the care of my mother, I need to be sure that this is indeed not normal. Because she will never admit it to herself.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for the query. I can understand your concern regarding your mother and your brothers. You have given a beautifully elaborated history, clearly showing your mom is suffering from bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) and needs clinical assistance. She cannot take care of her children with this illness. BPAD is a mental illness, but it is treatable with mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications. Medicines like Lithium or Valproate with Risperidone will help in early recovery. Without treatment, she cannot take decisions properly. She can even harm your siblings. Presently she is not having any insight of her illness and requires urgent treatment. I suggest you visit a nearby psychiatrist as soon as possible for her treatment.  Hope my answer helped you.

Since it is due to recent exposure to loud sounds, there is a good chance that the tinnitus will resolve.

One morning I woke up with it locked and it never unlocked, I went four months unable to open my jaw before treatment started. I was in massive amounts of pain, and it gave me terrible headaches.

Although there was no full penetration, I took Unwanted 72 the next day. On 11th of this month, I had little bleeding with a lot of clots that lasted for three days. I normally have a 27 days menstrual cycle which is very regular and have a good flow. I was feeling dizzy and nausea sometimes, so on 18th and 25th of this month, I took a home pregnancy test which was negative. Can there be any chance of pregnancy? Or can those be the side effects of Unwanted 72? When should I take a home pregnancy test again? Please help as I am very tensed.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me put you at ease by saying that you will not be pregnant. Let me tell you how. For a young lady with 27 days cycle, ovulation will be on day 13th, and the egg will stay alive for 24 hours. So you are at a risk of pregnancy on 29th to 31st. But your sexual exposure was much before that, so no way your egg was exposed to sperms. The chances are further reduced as there was no ejaculation into the vagina. But if pre-seminal fluid comes in contact with genitals or thigh there is a slight chance of pregnancy. As you took an emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours, the chances of you getting pregnant are very slim. Unwanted 72 will suddenly increase the thickness of the inner lining of the uterus, which will come out in the form of clots or rather fleshy masses, with mild lower abdomen pain. Even though you felt the bleeding was less, clots means bleeding was more than normal.

I am slowly trying to stop. I have about seven months left of my pregnancy. If I was to cut way back and stop completely at five months of my pregnancy would I and the baby be clean when I deliver?","Doctor":"Hi. We need to worry about what the baby is facing now and not about what will happen after you stop. All the components of smoke, the bad air (carbon dioxide), tar, the chemicals in the smoke, which may vary with what you are smoking are all powerful vasoconstrictors. I mean they narrow the blood vessels, so they reduce the blood flow to the baby. If we could go back I would have advised you to stop it the moment you got pregnant. Late better than never. Every​day baby is growing, so the requirement of blood flow is increasing as the baby's vital organs are growing and getting blood for that. So if the flow is compromised even a day, we do not know if any damage has occurred. This may not be visible on any scan, but it would be safe to immediately stop smoking and start having lots of highly nutritious food with lots of sugars, juices. Do yoga or breathing exercises, in short, improve the supply of nutrition and oxygen to the baby as these two are the secrets of a healthy and active baby. Hope I have made it clear. Baby will not have any of it in its body, but the damage caused by the smoke will be seen in the baby's body.

Psychiatrist said that a plain CT scan and another CT scan should be taken with contrast, but after four attempts they could not create channel in his veins, so contrast CT scan of the brain was not done. Plain CT scan of the brain showed: Cortical sulci, Sylvian fissure, basal cisterns at places and supratentorial ventricles are mildly prominent. Lacunar infarct in right claustrum. Mild bilateral cerebral cortical atrophy (age-related). Background: He was unnecessarily fearing that my relatives, neighbors, and municipality will search and steal his clothes, newspapers. Only one day, he had a delusion about dead relatives making a phone call. After taking prescribed medicine Olanzapine 5 mg, one tablet per night, he is behaving properly. He is under medication for one and a half months. Previously he used to sleep for two hours, now he sleeps for four hours.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. The symptoms you have described, of paranoid ideation, suspiciousness, restlessness, decreased sleep are all indicative of a psychotic type of illness, most probably schizophrenia. It will require treatment from a psychiatrist with antipsychotic medicines. Olanzapine is one such medicine. This happens because due to elevated levels of certain neurotransmitters such as Dopamine in the brain which leads to reduced stress handling capacity of the brain. The medicine will get the levels to normal and help with the problem. For the first episode of this illness, treatment is recommended to be continued for one year and then medicines are stopped, for the second recurrence for three years and for the third time of recurrence it is lifelong. That is why please complete the course of the medicine as per the doctor's advice. The lacunar infarct in the brain also is one contributory region for this problem and for that I am sure the other general physician or neurologists must have given medicines to take care of the infarct and anti-clotting medicines. If the size is small, please continue those and it will reduce. Along with Olanzapine 5 mg, you can add Phenergan 25 mg (Promethazine). It will help him sleep better.

Until 20 years of age, I never experienced any issue with erections or sexual health. When I turned 20, I had an episode with my girlfriend where over two consecutive nights, we had no sex, but rather very prolonged foreplay. Due to the prolonged arousal, my erection stayed for most of the night, without ejaculation. This episode of two prolonged erections and arousal obviously hurt my penis as it went through some visible changes back then, both in shape and feeling. While it was not painful, it lost some thickness and the side erectile tissue eventually lost some elasticity, becoming somewhat hardened in a flaccid state. Since a slight curvature initially appeared, I can only guess this was Peyronie’s. Eventually, in the course of some years, it did recover partially and as of now, there is practically no curvature at all. However, the erectile tissue is still not as it used to be, somewhat hardened and when I have an erection, the blood seems to get trapped in a way in both sides of the penis, while the glans have difficulties getting sufficient blood and arousal and often remains softer. I have no problems getting and maintaining an erection myself, but when being with a partner, it tends to be more difficult and the erection often goes away quickly if not actively stimulated. The softer glans often leads to less control and premature ejaculation. I assume I may have gotten some degree of penile fibrosis, which was triggered by the episode of prolonged erection when I was 20. My question is, would there be a (natural) way to help reduce this tissue hardening and enhance regular blood flow, particularly to the glans. Since this is not a serious issue and it seems the damage was not that substantial (I still have morning erections for example, and the feeling is often close to normal), I would be looking to some natural therapy with as little side effects as possible. I read about some allegedly very good results of combining L-arginine and pine bark extract when it comes to enhancing erection quality overall. Would you happen to know about this or could you recommend some other natural treatment options, which would not cause any other health issues? My main concern would be getting priapism due to some medicine like Viagra, as it was exactly the prolonged erection that caused my problems. If Arginine and pine bark extract are overall safe, I would be glad to opt for this.","Doctor":"Hi. From the events you described, you had normal erection and ejaculation but over the years it has reduced. You have difficulty in maintaining erection and premature ejaculation. Have you recently changed the partner or stress in relationship? How much time do you take before ejaculation (intravaginal)? Natural extracts are effective but the effect may not be titrated as per the dose and excessive may lead to possible priapism. With progressive exposure to more sexual experience, the quality of erection goes down, but a person becomes more confident to satisfy a female. For a female, the way of doing sex and getting her to orgasm is more important than the penis solely. For you, I would suggest Tadaflo 5 mg (low dose Tadalafil used in BPH patients) as you do not have erectile dysfunction but need to support erection for a few days. Premature ejaculation if persistent problem, I may treat that later. Tablet Tadalafil 5 mg on alternate days evening."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 17 year old male.

The type of sadness that gets more energy in the evening is called bipolar depression. Also, it is important to check thyroid when it comes to fatigue.

I have been experiencing worsening symptoms over the past three months.

My symptoms are: frequent headaches and shock-like pain below the right temple, migraines that last for days, dizziness even when resting in bed, weight gain, fatigue and sleep for 14 hours straight, change in taste i.e. toothpaste taste like hairspray and Kombucha tastes like hairspray, smelling burning plastic and no one else can smell it, losing balance when trying to do yoga and work, seeing shiny flex of light, pain in back, stiffness in shoulders and neck, numbness in the foot for a week, tingling in arms and fingers, painful electric shocks in the leg, mood changes crying and laughing for no reason. Menstrual changes show shorter cycles and never before pregnant but nipples have left yellow streaks in the bra, fumbling with tools at work. My current medications are Effexor 37.5 mg, Smarty Pants multivitamin, Vitamin B complex. I also consume daily probiotics.","Doctor":"Hi. Your symptoms apart from migraines are due to nerve involvement causing parosmia (altered taste sensation) most probably due to Vitamin B12 deficiency. Methylcobalamine (or vitamin B12) supplement 1500 mcg per day for a few weeks is usually advised and you are already taking it. For migraines you can try, Aspirin, Ibuprofen 400 mg to 800 mg every six to eight hours, Naproxen initially 500 mg then 250 mg every six hours, Ketoprofen 25 to 50 mg every six to eight hours. One of these can be tried, should be available over the counter. If one of these is not effective then you may need one of the prescription medications mentioned below specific for migraines e.g. Sumatriptan, Zolmitriptan, Eletriptan, Naratriptan."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I just got one side of my wisdom teeth removed both upper and lower six days ago, and I have another one scheduled after two days for the left side.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

With the treatment, the prognosis is good in secondary polycythemia. But, polycythemia can occur as primary polycythemia as well, and in that case, the prognosis will not be good as it is considered under myeloproliferative neoplasm. Primary polycythemia called polycythemia vera and for that JAK2 mutation study done by a molecular method to confirm it. For polycythemia, the treatment is therapeutic phlebotomy in which 250 to 400 mL of blood is removed as per needed frequency. Our aim is to maintain HCT - hematocrit of less than 45% in polycythemia male patient. Initially, phlebotomy can be somewhat aggressive with more frequency and then maintained as less frequency.

I get a loud noise or ringing in my left ear, although it also happens in the right ear. One fine day the tinnitus actually went to the other ear (my right ear), my tinnitus since then has not been focused in a single ear, but seems to alternate. I had to leave work three days back, as I had a sudden nauseous feeling. Since then, I have experienced random rushes of sensation that go throughout my body, which most of the time are accompanied by temporary nausea. This feeling I can only describe as a ‘wave’ passing throughout my body. In my past, I have taken MDMA (ecstasy) and would experience the same sensation then. I have heard people, remark about how this could be vertigo, but after reading descriptions I do not think it is. I do not feel like I lose control and balance, at least not significantly. I went to an urgent care physician to discuss my symptoms. The doctor listened to my ideas on what it was, but did not seem very knowledgeable on ototoxicity and assessed the situation saying I may now have tinnitus and this is something I will learn to deal with. He did remove severely impacted ear wax from my left ear and was unable to finally remove all from the right ear. Upon removing the left ear wax I did feel a relief in the volume of the ringing. Since then, I have noticed that the tinnitus feeling seems to feel more internal than external. My doctor prescribed me Acetic acid drops for my left ear since there was slight bleeding during micro-suction. He also prescribed me Meclizine for vertigo and Ondansetron for nausea that could accompany that. I went to a dermatologist and had a mole removal with local anesthesia. During this time I was also taking AZO, which is over-the-counter bladder calmer. Throughout the past four years or so, I have taken AZO over periods of time. I had issues with urinary incontinence and I took this without input from a physician. There were periods where I took it for five days of the week, for maybe three months total. I originally took two pills at once, and then later took a pill at a time. It has been some time since I have taken AZO before I took it again. I was completely unaware that AZO (Pyridium) can be ototoxic as it was near impossible to find this listed as a potential ototoxic medication. I never before exhibited any symptoms like this, and although while I began getting tinnitus that weekend, I did not stop taking it every day as I was completely unaware this was related in any way. In my past, I have also taken ecstasy (MDMA) on a regular basis or in large amounts. I have not ever experienced any negative long-term effects from this but that does not mean that damage was not done because of it. I have also smoked marijuana, drank heavily, tried cocaine a handful of times, as well as mushrooms, and ketamine a handful of times. I know it is dangerous to self-diagnose because you can create problems out of nothing. My fear is that I will put additional harmful substances in my body exacerbating the symptoms of what I am experiencing. I took one Meclizine to help with the uneasiness and I believe that the tinnitus has changed, it now moves in a cascading change in pitch. I now hear a constant noise, but it changes in sound (high pitched always, sometimes slowly rising and falling in pitch in the higher frequencies or it subsides quickly while another high pitch replaces it). I still experience the waves of tingling sensation that move throughout my body, and it seems more random and the frequency alternates (which could be a balance related issue or something else entirely).","Doctor":"Hello. While you have elaborated on your symptoms very meticulously, I still require some more details. It is true that MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) can cause tinnitus and worsen noise-induced hearing loss. However, it will be related to an episode of taking the drug. It is possible that regular use of the drug could have made the inner hair cells more susceptible to noise-induced trauma and would have manifested on someday when you subjected yourself to some noise (acoustic trauma). AZO (Phenazopyridine hydrochloride) is not a proven ototoxic drug. But since you are saying you have been using it, I suggest you stop that and consult a physician for the urinary symptoms. I suspect Meniere's disease, which is an inner ear problem and also ototoxicity. So, get the following tests done. In your next query, please attach the reports of the above. The above tests are necessary to find the cause of the problem and also arrive at the right diagnosis. Only after that, we can give a definitive treatment for you. Ear wax can cause tinnitus and aural fullness manifesting as imbalance, but the same will not be as severe as described by you. If the abrasion inside the ear has healed, you use some wax dissolvent to remove the wax. It will make it more soluble, and an ENT can remove it easier. Also, continue the medicine Meclizine, till we get the diagnosis right. I suggest you refrain from party drugs, alcohol, smoke, and dope.

Whenever my right testicle swells up, I feel a tension in my lower abdomen, and it becomes difficult to perform any physical activities. Whenever my testicle is not swollen, it feels as if it is being held up by an extra muscle that flows from my lower abdomen to my testicle area. My left testicle hangs freely, while my right testicle is higher up and feels like it is being held up. When I flex my abdomen, my right testicle goes up by about an inch or so. This swollen testicle occurs a couple of times a month but is completely random with no patterns that I have observed. About a year ago my right testicle swelled up bigger than it had ever happened before, about three times the size of my left testicle. I went to the hospital that night, and the doctor performed an ultrasound on my testicle. He said that my epididymis was filled with fluid and that it was most likely a hydrocele. He put some pressure of my right testicle(which was swollen at that moment) with his hand, and I began to tear up because it was so painful. But I had no pain before or after he put the pressure. He then checked my left testicle, which was completely fine. He concluded that I had no hernia, they performed nothing on me and just put an ice pack on my testicle and slept. When I woke up my testicle was no longer swollen. About a month or so later I went to a urologist, and she told me nothing other than my issue was going to stop by only waiting. I still have the same issue as before. I have done some research and never found anything about a reoccurring hydrocele. Mostly, I just read about guys who dealt with a swollen testicle and simply got surgery for it, but their hydroceles were not reoccurring. They were permanent. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi.

I did an ultrasound, but it was normal, and no renal stones were found. After few days, I started having pain from the back till the bladder, vomiting, and weakness. So, I got admitted, and they gave me painkiller injections, IV fluids, tablet Levofloxacin 500, tablet Flavoxate, tablet Pantop, and tablet Voveran. I am not discharged still, and I have pain. The doctor diagnosed it as urinary tract infection. Is it really UTI?","Doctor":"Hi. I saw your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), and from what you say, it may be a urinary tract infection. To rule out urinary tract infection, I would suggest urine culture. Left sided pain can occur if the left kidney and ureter is infected, with obstruction. From your ultrasound report, there seems to be no obstruction to urine flow from left kidney. But, ultrasonogram is prone to errors. I would suggest CT KUB (computed tomography of kidneys, ureter, and bladder) for better decision making.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter has been diagnosed with posterior idiopathic uveitis, and she also has type 1 diabetes.

She is scheduled to go in a week from today to discuss other options, among them, injections directly into the eye.

Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

I wore a tampon for nearly eight hours while going in and out of the river water. The water was flowing so I hoped there would not be much dangerous bacteria, but I am worried about how much might have been soaked into the tampon. After few days, I got a cold with a fever, that has relocated to a painful chest cough. But, I am now beginning to be concerned that it could be toxic shock syndrome. I stopped taking birth control pills for the first time in three years about a week ago, so I have been experiencing some period like symptoms, like lower back pain, slight vaginal pain, etc. Should I seek medical attention? I prefer to avoid it as I am in a foreign country, but if it seems necessary, I will. Also, I am not sexually active.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me get few facts straight, toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a complication of using tampons, but it is not the commonest complication. So you have to rule out other common causes. You have a risk of TSS if you do not change tampons for days, or have unhygienic methods of using them or if you left any cotton or pad in and forgot to take it out. Just because it got wet with river water, you will not get TSS. Maybe the climate changes or exposure to someone with a respiratory infection has caused these symptoms. I would suggest you do the following. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. I feel you will be okay within few days. TSS is a major infection and will make you entirely bedridden. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if you have any more queries.

How do you identify people on the bipolar spectrum? What are the biggest misconceptions about Bipolar II? Is it the same thing as bipolar depression? Kindly explain me.","Doctor":"Hi. Alike any psychiatric disorders, diagnosis of bipolar disorder is completely based on the history. This is elaborated from the patient, family members, colleagues and significant others. There are set of symptoms and the history need to suggest the presence of a certain number of symptoms for some duration (two weeks for depression and one week for mania and hypomania) conclude bipolar disorder. The examination part is called mental state examination. Alike blood investigations in other branches of medicine mental status examination is integral part of diagnosis formation and generally used to confirm the symptoms elicited by detailed history. The above description is correct for both bipolar I and bipolar II disorder. There are certain symptoms which are present in bipolar I but not in bipolar II. To clarify, bipolar I is characterised by depression and mania while bipolar II is marked by depression and hypomania. Hypomania is a less severe form of mania where the severity is much less than the mania. The identification of individuals on the bipolar spectrum is made by the persistent presence of mood symptoms. The mood can be depressed, euphoric, elated or mixture of them. People think that bipolar II is less severe, but if you consider the morbidity, it causes more loss of DALY (disability-adjusted life year) across the world. Also, contrary to popular belief, it is hard to treat. It is not equal to bipolar depression. Bipolar depression is a part of bipolar I and bipolar II although it will be right to say that bipolar depression often misdiagnosed as unipolar depression.

Hereby I am giving opinion regarding your case. First, let me know do you have any stress or anxiety issues? As severe stress can lead to hyperventilation and dizziness. Stress can change bowel habits as well and it can lead to headaches as well. If stress is present consult a psychiatrist for counseling and anti-anxiety drugs. If stress is not present, then the causes for weakness are overexertion, lack of exercise, depression, kidney problems (for that urea, creatinine investigation done), myositis, etc. As for three weeks you are not improving you can be investigated with EMG (electromyography), EKG (electrocardiography) investigation for further workup. Answers to your questions are as follows:  I do not think this blood report is abnormal. It should be repeated as two weeks passed. In stroke vision problem, half part weakness, slurred speech like problem present. So the stroke chance is very less. But EKG investigation can be done here as dizziness present since many times. Your Hb and HCT are not much high that needs immediate concern. I do not think it is polycythemia vera case. Repeat CBC to check HCT and RBC value now.

It is because of IL 6 release and activation of thrombopoietin in certain conditions like post hemorrhage, inflammatory disorder, infections, in iron deficiency anemia, etc. Your anemia should be treated with blood transfusion as this hemoglobin level is very low.

The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects.

Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

I am currently taking Fluvoxamine 200 mg at night, Risperidone 2 mg at night, and Modafinil 100 mg in the morning. It has been well controlled for more than four months now. (90% reduction in symptoms). For the past two days, I have not been able to sleep because I have been seeing shadows moving at the periphery of my vision. It scares me so much and when I try to close my eyes I can hear certain noises like laughter or someone moving around. This only happens when it is mostly dark at night. For this reason, I have not slept the first night and somehow fall asleep very late (3 AM) the second night. Can you tell me what is causing this?","Doctor":"Hello. What you are experiencing is called hypnogogic hallucinations which occur normally when sleeping sometimes, but in your case, it is due to the Modafinil. It is known to interfere with sleep and also cause hallucinations. Also, the metabolism will be slowed by Fluvoxamine and it lasts longer. You should not take it. It does not affect OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and I would just advise you to stick to Fluvoxamine and Risperidone and if possible, do some sessions of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) from a clinical psychologist. Also, it is advisable to not suddenly reduce the Modafinil, but taper it slowly. Take 150 mg for three or four days. Then 100 mg for a week and then 50 mg and then stop. Also, with 90 percent improvement, you can consider either reducing the dose of Fluvoxamine or also try taking 50 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night, instead of 200 mg all at once.

I even drank 1 liter of Pedialyte yesterday and felt better momentarily.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me start on a reassuring note that you and your baby are fine. For the initial 12 weeks of pregnancy, there is no placenta (the connection between mother and baby). The embryo is just lying deep within the layers of the uterus. At 12 weeks, the first trophoblastic wave occurs. It is a wave of cells opening up the small vessels so that the narrow blood vessels which existed till then will be converted to wide loose vessels. So, the net effect is that blood flow to the baby is significantly increased. It is a welcome sign, and it means you will not develop hypertension in pregnancy. Had the vessels not given way so, your body will have to force more blood to keep the baby's growth adequate, which can be done only by increasing BP. You will have a similar wave at 20 weeks. These two phases have effects like BP falls, a sudden improvement in baby blood volume and growth. So, your blood sugar reduces.

What are the chances that an ectopic pregnancy miscarries spontaneously? In case of rupture to the fallopian tube in the ectopic pregnancy, does the pregnancy ends on its own? Or does it keep growing? I read that in an ectopic pregnancy HCG levels grow at a lower rate than they would in case of normal pregnancy. I got a positive HCG urine test a full week after my missed period. Is it possible that the pregnancy is ectopic? (I kept testing on the day of the missed period and two days later but it came up negative). What are the chances of the success of Methotrexate injection in ending an ectopic pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi. Transvaginal ultrasound can detect ectopic as early as two weeks, much before TAS (transabdominal sonography). Ectopic pregnancy always terminates as miscarriage, but inside the abdomen with profuse bleeding intraabdominally that can be life threatening. Pregnancy ends on its own in case of ruptured ectopic along with it, it can end life too. HCG levels are low in ectopic, but they are enough to turn a urinary pregnancy test positive. In fact UPT (urine pregnancy test) cannot decide if pregnancy is ectopic or intrauterine. Methotrexate can manage an ectopic pregnancy, but chance are that it can also deplete ovarian follicle reserve which may lead to infertility."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I just got one side of my wisdom teeth removed both upper and lower six days ago, and I have another one scheduled after two days for the left side.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

Do you think I have polycythemia or polycythemia vera? Do you want me to consult hematologists? Please give your opinion.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to the icliniq.com. I have gone through your history and reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  You had a complaint of left side abdominal pain with a headache. Hence gastritis can be the possibility and for that antibiotic and antacid course are prescribed. Sometimes upper gastrointestinal infection can lead to poor absorption of vitamin B12 and so deficiency can occur but here your B12 value is borderline in the report. So further work up can be done at that time by measuring homocysteine and methylmalonic acid measurement for confirming B12 deficiency. Anyhow you completed the course of B12 injection so no need for measurement of homocysteine. Your stool frequency is increased and it seems to be stress-related irritable bowel syndrome (stress, anxiety lead headache as well). Yoga, meditation, and exercise will be beneficial in reducing stress. Consume more fruits and green leafy vegetables. If needed psychiatrist help can be taken. If stress and anxiety are not related then USG (ultrasound) abdomen or endoscopy like workup can be planned only if gastrointestinal symptoms worsening. In your attached CBC report values are within limits. In polycythemia (which you are suspecting) Hb is greater than 17.5, WBC count and platelets also can be high, RBC values are high and HCT is more than 55% usually. So here polycythemia is not the possibility. Repeat CBC after completing your antibiotic course. Lack of sleep, hypoglycemia, smoking, stress, irregular meal habit, migraine, etc., are some other causes for headache. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had a cesarean delivery just two months back. From when can I resume my sex life with my husband? Could you please advice on that?","Doctor":"Hi. We usually advise our patients to be active immediately. You can have sex from six weeks onwards, but avoid a pregnancy till 2 years. After the cesarean delivery, your superficial wounds and deep wounds heal fast. But, the healing of uterine wound will take some time. You are now breast feeding. So, have any of the contraceptives like condom or Copper-T or Cerazette (Desogestrel) tablets daily or Depo MPA (Medroxyprogesterone acetate) injections once in three months. The last two are the best as they increase milk production and no periods. When you are breast feeding, the periods may not occur at all or irregular. So, do not use these dates to calculate safe periods to have sex. The time of 2 years is needed to replace your lost iron, proteins, and energy. All the best.

I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have POF with FSH 101. I am taking Progyluton from three months but I still feel hot flashes and breast pain after starting brown tablets and these become worse in pill-free days. Am I taking right dose of hormones?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) you mentioned it is clear that you have premature ovarian failure and you have been prescribed the drug Progyluton as a hormone replacement therapy. You have mentioned that you experience some symptoms such as hot flashes and breast pain in spite of taking hormone replacement therapy and they get worse during the pill-free period. Well, the hot flashes are common in premature menopause as in your case and the breast pain occurs because of progesterone component in your Progyluton. It will decrease with time sometimes up to a year and a half. Your dose is right. All I suggest is that you need to take these pills to prevent other problems from occurring such as decrease in bone density, cardiac problems, endometrial problems so on and so forth and also to prevent overt symptoms of menopause. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My nephew, who is 5.6 years old, has got a skin infection in the right midfoot. My sister noticed it a week ago.

So, she got a sonography done, and the sonography reports showed a large, and ill-defined heterogeneous mass lesion with moderate internal vascularity in cervix extending into the lower uterine region and upper one-third of the vagina (parametrial extension). The doctor said that there is a cyst on the mouth of the uterus and it could be cancerous. My mother does not have any symptoms, no pain and no loss of appetite, but she feels little tired all the time. Is it cancerous or non-cancerous? And what is the best treatment for removing this cyst? She just had the sonography done and has not started taking any medication yet. She had heavy bleeding a year back and sometimes fibroid like things used to come out. She took Mensu syrup for 21 days, which made the bleeding normal. But the menstruation problem returned after stopping the medicine. So she got an ultrasound done. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. From the history, I do not think you have to worry. Let me explain why. It mostly appears to be a fibroid arising from the lower uterine segment, just above the cervix and extending to the vagina. Never diagnose any disease by just an investigation report. Most important things in diagnosis are history and examination. In history, the duration of complaint, type of the previous cycle, associated bladder or bowel symptoms, watery discharge, etc. has to be noted.

Yes, you can give coffee to him. There is no specific bad food for Parkinson's disease. He can eat as per his choices. But, if the doctor started on tablet Selegiline then avoid cheese, smoked fish, and broad beans. Take treatment as per neurologist prescription. No specific lifestyle change is needed.

I do not feel joy after ejaculations. My head feels heavy, and I have vertigo problem, I feel as if I will fall while walking. Kindly help me get rid of these problems.","Doctor":"Hi. The symptoms like shortness of breath, poor sleep and loss of sexual pleasure are all the side effects of the medicines that you take for bipolar disorder. I will not suggest stopping these medications, but it will be better to take few medications with effective doses. Divalproex sodium 500 mg twice daily, will be better molecule than Sodium valproate as a mood stabiliser. If you are having palpitations, Propranolol or mouth dissolving Clonazepam will be a better substitute. Counselling with a good psychologist will help you along with medications.

When I was 32 years old, I had my first atrial fibrillation, for which cardioversion was done in the hospital. Five years after that, I had a second attack, with the same result. I have never taken any medicines, just started taking CoQ10 and Magnesium, and have not had a problem. I still have PVC and feel those skips, I have had treadmill tests, stress echocardiogram, EP study, coronary calcium scoring, and EKG done, all tests showing the heart to be structurally normal. Recently, I had a severe pain in my right ribs and I went to the doctor, and he found a liver hemangioma and cysts in the ultrasound, it was benign in nature. That day, my doctor told me to put Nitro under my tongue, and the pain went away immediately. He then did another EKG and blood tests and said he does not feel it was my heart. Because they saw spots on my liver and my pain was in the upper right quadrant, where the liver is located. However, I have looked at three of the EKG sheets, and they say abnormal on them. Also, I have been having bouts of shortness of breath and central chest pain, but I was putting that off as anxiety from this liver mass, and acid reflux that I have had in the past. My CRP levels were fine in the blood workup, and my BP has been fine. Cholesterol has always been high. The most recent coronary calcium score was 0. My question is, looking at all this could the right side pain in lower rib area be due to the heart?

Is the length of time on a ventilator depend more on the cause i.e. longer if lung infection rather than neurological, etc? Can you have severe illness complications and still be in ICU for a short while? When I was 21, I had severe uncontrolled tonic-clonic seizures (constant on and off for a day then last over an hour and a half) apparently I had every medication could have if the last drug did not work then there was nothing else I could have. Apparently, I then had a cardiac arrest where the doctor had said it was very difficult to get me back tried for a long time my heart was struggling and was not breathing. I was anesthetised and on a ventilator. I had blood gases showing acidosis, high lactate, also ECG showed ST changes and right axis deviation. Echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy and right ventricular dilatation (this was not there just weeks before), no urine output apparent renal insufficiency, blood glucose in the 30's mmol. EEG showed non-reactive background alpha. Cat scan showed low attenuation temporal lobe. MRI showed matter changes. My family were told to come in immediately in the middle of the night as doctors felt I might not make it and if I had another seizure would not be able to stop it. I had a do not resuscitate order put on. Why did they put do not resuscitate order on me at 21? I hear of people who were in critical care for much longer. I have memory flashbacks and cannot figure out why the length of stay does not relate to severity. I was on a ventilator for 12 hours and sedation coma reduced over two days. I was in for three to four days. I feel it was rushed and if it had not been then I may have not got the lasting problems I have now. The word anoxic brain injury has been mentioned. After in ICU I have had many problems seizures, ataxia, very brisk hyper reflex is reflexes more in legs than arms, Babinski reflex, tremor, myoclonus, altered sensation, numbness of arms down to feet especially back of hands. I have memory problems and a different personality, I find it hard to learn new things, etc. Are these common symptoms of anoxic brain injury?","Doctor":"Hi. I am so sorry that you went through so much and I am glad to know that you have made it. You are extremely lucky to have survived all this. It seems like after persistent seizure you developed acidosis that pushed you in cardiogenic shock. Very few people come out of it. You are the second case in my 12 years of experience that I have seen communicating. Ventilators has its own complications and they can lead to mortality and morbidity which are more difficult to battle than the real problem, therefore it is always recommended to wean as soon as possible. Anoxic brain injury occurs right there an then when the event occurs. Ventilators could only prevent part of it and not the entire process. I was curious to know what brought it on in the first place? Why did you had the seizures like did you had the seizure disorder or an infection process? Anoxic brain injury can have various consequences and yes it can cause different psychological, motor, and cognitive deficits depending upon which part of the brain was involved.

What are a few things you should not do or say when trying to support someone with anxiety? Kindly share your advice about how to recognize when someone close to you has anxiety.","Doctor":"Hello. To become a supportive ally to a family member or friend or partner who has anxiety one has to accept that he or she has the illness. Anxiety is a psychiatric illness like any other disease or ailment. It should be clear in mind, and this helps to empathize with the patient. Patients feeling should be in one's mind to be a supportive ally. Anxiety is a significant term and can manifest in a lot of ways. Anticipating things, worrying about minor things, developing a rapid heartbeat, trembling or body, chocking sensation in the throat, dizziness, butterfly feeling in stomach, etc., are the common presenting signs of an individual with anxiety. Most commonly anxiety manifest as rapid heartbeat, tremors in the body, sweating, chocking sensation in the throat, slurred voice, dizziness, feeling of impending doom, etc. Worrying about minor things, anticipating bad in everything, avoiding situations that provoke anxiety, withdrawing from social situations, avoiding work, etc., are common symptoms one might show while having an anxiety disorder. The first thing that I have already mentioned is to accept one's illness. Should try to follow behavioral model during anxiety. Ask the affected individual to breath deep and slowly. A glass of cold water also helps in relaxing the person. Minimize the anxiety-provoking stimulus psychologically and disqualify its serious nature. Try to cut the anticipatory thoughts of the affected individual during anxiety. One should never lose its cool with a patient of anxiety. Never lose temper. Do not say anything negative while a person is in anxiety.

I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

But, for the last two weeks, I have been spotting every day. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi. It is one of the complications of LNG-IUD (Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device) or Mirena. The Levonorgestrel being released by the IUD makes the inner lining of the uterus or the endometrium so thin that it will just give way. Let me give you a few facts. By 50 or 52 every lady reaches menopause. After this age, there is no significant healthy follicle in the ovary, and so the estrogen level is extremely low. It will not allow the inner lining of the uterus to increase. To add on to this, the progesterone or LNG makes the lining even thinner, and it will spontaneously tear causing fresh spots every day or intermittently. I wonder what the indication was to have Mirena at age of 54 years. I hope they had ruled out any surprises by taking PAP smear or liquid base cytology, the ultrasound scan of the pelvis and necessary blood tests. If all the above mentioned tests were normal, then spotting is due to hormone deficiency. Reconsider whether the IUD has to be continued. Once removed you may enter menopause and will not have periods anymore. Otherwise, meet your gynecologist, and you will be started on the hormone estrogen cyclically to improve the thickness and bleeding, so the spotting will not occur.

The side effects I noticed were vivid dreams and becoming more withdrawn. Two months back, my girlfriend and I got into a domestic dispute. My honest memory of this incident is that she started verbally abusing me from the bedroom while I was in the kitchen. She then came out and started pulling my hair. I tried to leave, but she kept physically blocking me from the door. We argued for hours until she finally got out of the way and let me go. Her story is wildly different and I had heard that she was blaming Chantix for my behavior. I scoffed at that idea, but for days I was sure she was trying to set me up. But today, I started off-handedly doing some online research on the drug, and a lot of the stories hit home. I am so confused and scared right now. What I wanted to know is, is it possible that the memories of that night are not real at all? My Chantix ran out a month back, and I did not get more. I have been so stressed out and want to smoke. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. For further queries consult a psychiatrist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an 18 year old male. I am having a mild constant chest pain. Sometimes I feel shortness in breathing, little bit of headache and heaviness in throat. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. As per the short history, it is difficult to make a diagnosis. But, I will try to explain the symptoms and related causes. It would have been more helpful if you had given your weight and body mass index (BMI). The chest pain can be related to diseases involving the stomach, heart, lungs and the chest wall. The diagnosis depends on the type of chest pain pricking or vague and changes while breathing has to be noted. Shortness of breath has to be rated for the amount of work causing the shortness of breath. A headache may arise due to sinusitis or stress (tension). Heaviness in the throat may be caused by infection, regurgitation, etc.  Considering the symptoms put together, I presume that it could be regurgitation. Regurgitation is partially or undigested food felt in the throat from food pipe after swallowing. It may be due to any one of the following:  1. A lax sphincter in the lower end of the esophagus. 2. Tight non-relaxing sphincter not letting food pass through (achalasia). 3. Increased abdominal pressure. 4. Esophageal diverticula. 5. Helicobacter pylori infection.  The recurrent regurgitation will disturb the flora in the throats leading to repeated infection, sore throats and hoarseness. If severe may result in upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and headache.  Chest pain is described mild and constant seem to be heartburn due to regurgitation. There could be other possibilities which require detailed history and basic examination. To follow preventive measures and if symptoms persist, get an upper GI endoscopy to determine the cause and to arrive at a diagnosis. 1. Do not lie down flat after taking food. Lie down 2 hours after taking food. 2. Make sure to eat half stomach. Split up the meals (six half stomach food is better than three full stomach food). 3. Cut down on spicy food and eat healthy and freshly prepared food. Have a balanced diet and take fruits and vegetables. Maintain a body mass index between 18.5 and 24.9.  Try these measures. If symptoms persist, then you may consult a doctor in person to get the necessary medications to reduce the acidity, reflux, and treatment for a throat infection.  The history is very minimal to arrive at a diagnosis and start a treatment plan. I advise you to follow the preventive measures and consult a doctor when symptoms prevail or worsen.

A year ago, I was prescribed Zoloft 100 mg (Sertraline). But after three months I have transferred to Prozac 40 mg (Fluoxetine) together with Risperdal 0.5 mg (Risperidone). This has been going for the last nine months. I also take Micardis 80 mg (Telmisartan) and Lipitor 10 mg (Atorvastatin). I am less anxious, but I lately started sleeping too much and losing concentration and focus. It is affecting my studies a lot. I came back to university after 20 years. When I am awake, I will come up with any excuse to procrastinate my studies, and usually, end up spending hours on my OCD-related day dreaming and rituals. A friend, who is a health professional, recommended Adderall to help me concentrate and fight the obsessive thoughts. I halved my Prozac dose to sleep less than my regular 9 to 10 hours hopefully. I took an appointment with my psychiatrist two weeks from now, but I have midterms next week.My GP trusts my judgment. I could probably see her sooner than my psychiatrist. Should I ask her about Adderall?","Doctor":"Hi. Since your Obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD symptoms are under control using a combination of Risperidone and Fluoxetine, it is not an excellent choice to change it. Fluoxetine usually causes insomnia rather than sleepiness, and it is often taken as a morning or afternoon dosage to prevent insomnia. Risperidone can cause sedation, but you are using only a small dosage, and it is in the night I believe. Here, using Amphetamine to counteract sleepiness is not recommended instead you can try using a drug called as Modafinil, which is available at a dose of 100 mg. Try it in the morning to prevent sleepiness and to concentrate better. If you are experiencing worsening of OCD symptoms after reducing Fluoxetine to half, then it is advisable to bring it to therapeutic dosage range in OCD, which is 60 to 80 mg. Consult your treating doctor, discuss my opinion with him or her and take treatment with consent.

This time my WBC is 3.2 Absolute neutrophils 1.54 (reference 1.8 - 7.7). Absolute lymphocytes 1.05 (reference 1.2-3.2). Eosinophil 10.8 (reference 0-3). Monocytes 8.4 (reference 0-8). My nRBC's were 0, immature neutrophils and absolute neutrophils low end of normal. For the past eight years, my WBC's were fine but 9-10 years ago they were 3.9 and 3.5. Your advice is appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to the icliniq.com. I can understand your concern. Absolute neutrophil count is slightly low as per the provided report. Temporary associated viral infection along with allergic inflammation can lead to low neutrophil count. Here main concern is high eosinophil count. Normally, if allergic inflammation is under control then eosinophil count is not high. You are taking steroid nasal spray and Salmeterol plus steroid combination inhaler. But as eosinophils are high you can be prescribed Montelukast plus Fexofenedine combination drug as an antiallergic medication for seven to ten days. Asthma confirmation and severity can be assessed by spirometry investigation. You can investigate with allergy testing to know the allergen that leads provocation of an asthma attack. Repeat CBC after one week of taking antiallergic medication. Consult a pulmonologist for examination and spirometry and discuss my answer with him. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I just got one side of my wisdom teeth removed both upper and lower six days ago, and I have another one scheduled after two days for the left side.

I had suffered a lot during the initial years as there was no solution and doctors had to control using anti-depressants. I am on a regular low dose of Escitalopram even now. My tinnitus is a very shrill sound and has no trigger or cause and is constant. I had done audiometry and there was a slight loss of hearing in one ear. Lately, I chanced to read up on some forums and have found that there are various medications that are being tried for tinnitus. Tinnicar, Ginko Biloba, Complamina Retard SR, etc. Can you suggest in your opinion what I should take to reduce or end the tinnitus? What dosage and for how long? And for Ginko Biloba which is the best brand? My other problem is, I have a sinus problem. Due to cold exposure such as sleeping under an A/C, I get stuffed sinus congestion. I can feel some liquid behind my cheeks when I jump up and down and my nose and my ears are blocked. This is not very troubling. However, this causes a loud buzzing sound in my left ear which is what gets me terrified because of my already existing sinus problem.

To rule out that we need to get audiometry and tympanometry done. Also, let me know if you are on any medication or if you are exposed to loud sounds. I do not support multivitamin supplements for tinnitus. But you can take any of them for a month and see if symptom improves then you can take for a longer time.

After the surgery, her speech has improved, and no solid food or water is coming out from her nose anymore. Rarely, just a single drop of milk comes out of her nose. Recently, I noticed a small gap at the end of the soft palate on the left side. We do not remember whether this was already present or got formed after the surgery. Even though the gap is tiny, I am anxious that my daughter might need surgery again. Why is this small gap still seen? Does she need surgery again? I am not able to click a photo of her mouth, but I am attaching a picture from the internet that I modified.

It mainly focuses on times I have been paranoid, or times I have visualized things as something else. Examples: when slacking off at work thinking, what if there are cameras in the office or internet tracking software. When having a bad intrusive thought thinking, what if someone around me can read my thoughts and thinks I am crazy. Seeing the silhouette of something really far away and imagining it is something else like a door stopper from very far away looks like the shape of a bird or a sandbag propped in the shape of a cat. These are just a couple of examples that make me fear I am paranoid/delusional or on the edge of hallucinating things. There are other ones along those same lines that pop up on random occasions that I do not necessarily believe 100% but the possibility still causes me anxiety. Then the fact that they cause me anxiety causes me even more anxious after the fact wondering if these are paranoid or delusional thoughts. I have talked to my therapist about these fears in the past but I may have left something out or not brought up these examples in clear enough detail. She does not believe I have schizophrenia. I also have talked to a psychiatrist and she told me these types of paranoid ideas may occur in anxiety or depression. I am just terrified that paranoia is not a symptom of OCD and my poor vision cannot explain the minor visual imaginings (not even hallucinations just premature constructions of shapes/outlines) and that I am not taking appropriate action to combat a much deeper mental illness. My only issue with my thoughts is that they did not occur after I started fearing schizophrenia. I have always had general anxiety. They all have happened throughout my past. After I started fearing schizophrenia I combed through my memories to try to find evidence that I am developing it. And in that rumination process, I picked out all the times I have had paranoid thoughts. Though I usually do not believe the thoughts or hold them to be true, I still get anxious at 'what if'. I am hoping that is the defining characteristic that proves they are products of anxiety and OCD versus schizophrenia. Am I schizophrenic? Could it be just anxiety? I also have an uncle who is schizophrenic and that always scares me. Does it mean I am too?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for such a detailed history. It makes things very clear. I will sum up the main clinching reason why you do not have schizophrenia. You have insight. Means you know what is wrong with you and you can attribute a reasonable logical cause to this and know where to seek help. This is not the case with schizophrenics. They do not have insight into the paranoia. They will believe it is real. This is an anxiety spectrum disorder and this over inclusive repetitive thinking can also happen in OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) as well as a generalized anxiety disorder. Treatment for both essentially remains the same, only the dosages differ a little. Do not worry. This is not schizophrenia. Also, do not keep in mind that schizophrenia has a higher chance of transmission from parents. Having an uncle with schizophrenia means you just share some genetic component. Keep in mind that the same gene is responsible for schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, and depression/anxiety. So if your uncle has schizophrenia, that means you can have some sort of mental illness, either something as mild as anxiety, or as severe as schizophrenia. Please get started on SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) type of medicines in addition to your therapy. If you have not undergone some sessions of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), please do that with a clinical psychologist since it will help you manage the symptoms of anxiety. Also, please do deep breathing exercises daily four to five times a day. When you are anxious, you can do some more sessions of deep breathing until you calm down. It will reduce the panicked feeling that you have."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I just got one side of my wisdom teeth removed both upper and lower six days ago, and I have another one scheduled after two days for the left side.

The doctor put me on crutches and a splint, which I only used for a day. It has been a week since I sprained it, there is still the pain in the top part of the ankle. The swelling went from none, to swollen to little swelling. I can play on it, but sometimes I feel pain. I have gone to my chiropractor twice, and it is still very tender around the top part of the ankle and the side of the leg, where those ligaments go upward. There is still slight pain while pointing my foot and turning it outward. My main concern is when I am sitting with my legs on the table, and when I try turning my ankle inward, I feel as though something in my ankle is shifting (like something is dislocated). My chiropractor tried adjusting the ankle, and it popped, but it did not affect the dislocated feeling. I have asked other people who I know have sprained their ankle, but they said they have never felt that. Should I be concerned? I am currently taking Advil.","Doctor":"Hello.

I had my period on the 2nd of last month and it lasted till 6th. I had sex with my partner on the 12th via withdrawal method. And this month I have been expecting my period since 3rd and till today I have not seen my period. I am scared. Am I pregnant? I took multivitamin and grape for two days for stomach disorder and nausea. Could this also affect my period? Because right now I am having a headache and I always feel as if my period is there and once I check it nothing was there. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Possibility of pregnancy cannot be ruled out at this moment since you had sex during your fertile period, you did not take any i-pill and withdrawal method has a significant failure rate. Multivitamins and grapes usually will not affect the periods and regarding symptoms, these can be due to gastritis but the possibility of pregnancy is there. So you should get a urine pregnancy test (UPT) done now and repeat it after 12 hours. Although, somewhat delay up to seven days in periods is normal as well, but do not worry and get UPT done. If it is negative then no need to worry and positive termination by medicine can be done as it is early. Next time take all precautions especially I-pill, or condom."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I just got one side of my wisdom teeth removed both upper and lower six days ago, and I have another one scheduled after two days for the left side.

It happens when a blood vessel bursts and gives some blood out, under the superficial layer of the eye called conjunctiva. It happens because of high pressure in the vessel like high blood pressure or coughing or constipation or holding heavy objects. The treatment usually is only by lubricant eye drops if it happens for the first time. But if it is recurrent every week or so, you should go for blood tests: PT (prothrombin time), PTT (partial thromboplastin time), INR (international normalized ratio) for blood coagulation tests. Finally, since you are coughing, so there is an obvious cause for the bleeding. I recommend to treat it with installing any lubricant eyedrops a few times a day. The eye should go back to normal in about ten days to two weeks. If not or if it happens again go to your doctor for blood tests. I hope this helps.

He was diagnosed to have dry eyes, by a cornea specialist, but he did not perform a tear production test. Another cornea specialists without doing a tear test said that his eyes have only slightly less tear production. But, retina specialist said that everything is normal and it is a cornea problem. With six months of Restasis, Besivance and Lotemax, there is no improvement. He cannot drive, cook, read, watch television, work, play with our son or pour himself a glass of soda. He has tried pressure patches. The doctors advised to get an AMG on his left eye under a new BCL. Currently, there is no active infection in the left eye. The right eye is much worse with a large visible ulcer and looks very whitish and yellowish. Dry eyes seem absurd at this point. What other treatments are available? What are the other possible diagnosis? I know you cannot say for sure, but an idea would be great. He feel taking the trash out tonight as he could not see. He lacerated his nose, lips, both his shins and has a bruise on his entire inside arm. He is depressed and I am at a loss. He needs help walking down the street as he cannot see. He is just 39 years old. His health is generally good. The most worrisome part is that his left eye is catching up with the right.

The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects.

I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

I have been having intermittent episodes of moderate dizziness preceded by pain in the neck or head. It happens almost four times a year and some of these symptoms are also preceded with chest tightness and heart palpitations. On one of such occasion, I thought I would black out, so I went to the local hospital. Unfortunately, they made mistakes which led to the various ECG readings and Holter monitor readings to go missing due to faulty equipment. I do not have any congenital heart issues, so I am wondering why am I experiencing some strange pinging sensations at times which cause no pain. I also visited a neurologist whom I believe did not take me seriously and a head MRI showed no issues. After a couple of years of this, I went to a clinical laboratory to have an allergy test done, concentrating on metals as I have titanium screw from a tooth implant. The tests showed no allergy reaction to metals, but it did show an antibody response to myelin basic protein, which could indicate an autoimmune problem affecting nerves. The first test showed below 2 (which is the baseline between reactive and non-reactive indication) and the second test sample was also 2, but the third test was 3, which is above the baseline. The report for this MELISA test explained that this could indicate that my immune system was attacking the myelin protein. I am concerned as I am at an early stage of an autoimmune disease. I am not sure what the next step should be. Also, several years ago I had an MRI on my back L5 area due to an old injury, and they noted a perineural cyst. It seems like my back injury to this area has improved with treatment but other symptoms as mentioned above have replaced them. Can you please provide some clue regarding the meaning of the MELISA test results and what my next step should be?

One week after sexual intercourse, I started taking Cerazette as I do not want to get pregnant, and on the same day, as it was due, I got my periods. But now am worried if that could have been an implantation bleeding. The bleeding lasted for around a week and was pretty light which is unusual. I do not know if this is because of the mini pill that I took. My next period is due in a week.

Is Cerazette a reliable source of contraception? I have had protected sex ever since then.

Implantation bleeding is usually light blood or pink in color, but you had proper bleeding, just lesser in quantity if I am right. Till now you have not got a positive pregnancy test too. If you think you got pregnant that day, your pregnancy would have grown all these days, and now the test would have been strongly positive. Cerazette (Desogestrel) is good but not the most efficient of the oral contraceptives. And, it does not affect the results of a pregnancy test.

In the event of things given to her to play with, I wanted to give only silicon teether or BPA-free toys and avoid plastic toys, but plastic toys are more appealing to her. She often keeps them in her mouth. Should we sterilize the teether or toys every time we give it to her? A doctor advised against pacifier, as we cannot keep cleaning it every time the baby uses it. Which is better? Shall I let her keep fingers in the mouth instead or to pacify her with teether or toys? Also, will toys improve her skills?

As it is progressive, it is likely due to an embolus (clot) getting dislodged and landing in your hand or may be due to local clot formation. I suggest you visit your specialist doctor and get the following tests done. Oral birth control pill could have a role to play, as it makes blood thicker. Limb ischemia is an emergency, and it is crucial that we rule out this possibility as the consequences may not be good. So, visit ER (emergency room) and get yourself examined as soon as possible.

A day before my expected date of the period (27th day of the cycle) I did a pregnancy strip test, and it turned out to be negative. On the 28th day, I got my period and had a large number of blood clots than the normal bleeding. I feel like I was pregnant despite the fact that my period came on the expected date. Is it possible that it could be a miscarriage?","Doctor":"Hi. The symptoms you mentioned could be due to pregnancy which may not have been healthy, and we cannot predict. If it had been healthy, you would have had a weak positive urine pregnancy test. So, most probably you were not pregnant. We have other possibilities like pelvic infection and polyps or fibroids. Regarding pelvic infection, sexually transmitted infection around uterus will cause discharge from the vagina, yellow or white or grayish, with or without itching or foul smell, more after sex or after periods. Throbbing pain in the lower abdomen before periods, bleeding is reduced, dark red or brownish color, with fleshy masses or clots, pain at the end of sex. It This would need an evaluation by gynecologist and treatment with antibiotics and antifungals to both you and your partner. The less common cause at this age would be polyps or fibroids, and it needs a scan. If you have been trying for around one year to get pregnant, then you can plan to get investigated for a cause. Kindly see if the following checklist of investigations is done. It is a must to confirm tubal patency. The tube is the connection between uterus and ovaries. It is a bridge where sperm meets the egg and forms a baby. It is in size of a hair follicle and cannot be seen on scans. Being such a small opening, the tube can get blocked easily. So, check with HSG (hysterosalpingography - x-ray with dye) or SSG (sonosalpingography with dye) or laparoscopy. If all the above are found to be normal, then nothing can stop you getting pregnant.

I also have a headache, stomachache, and tiredness. I am a little overweight, so I have been starving myself. Is this clear liquid discharge normal?","Doctor":"Hi. Once ovulation occurs, the remaining follicle, called the corpus luteum, will keep producing hormone progesterone, for a possible pregnancy to get implanted in the uterus. There is nothing to worry as the watery discharge is because of this. Other symptoms include depression, getting short tempered, bloated feeling, pins and needles in breasts, toes, and fingertips. These symptoms are aggravated by pregnancy, sudden increase or decrease in weight or any recent mental or physical stress. I suggest you try reducing your weight. According to your height, your expected weight should be between 52 to 58 kg. The excess cholesterol will form hormones and cause the above symptoms. Once you reduce weight to normal range, you would not need any medicines to get periods or to get pregnant. To reduce weight, I suggest you try the following. Try to reduce 2 to 4 kg per month.

The pathology report stated that I had marked acute and chronic inflammation with severe reactive epithelial changes including villus blunting and gastric metaplasia. I was negative for H. pylori as I was treated for that approximately four years ago. My GI mentioned that the pathology report did not specifically say celiac disease as many he gets back to do. Why did they not name celiac specifically? I have read that gastric metaplasia is considered as a precancerous lesion. Is this true? I had a CT scan in before four months, and that revealed extensive mesenteric adenopathy. I was referred to an oncologist, and he ordered for an endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration biopsy. It was negative and showed some shrinking of lymph nodes, but they were still enlarged. My symptoms leading up to CT were several months of nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss. In the last few weeks, I noticed a small lump on my neck and my GI doctor confirmed in a physical examination this week that I have two swollen lymph nodes in my neck. He wants to see me again in a month or sooner if they get larger. I have attached a copy of my CT scan report. The duodenum biopsy report showed active duodenitis with gastric metaplasia in duodenum bulb in duodenum biopsy.","Doctor":"Hi.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.","Doctor":"Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem.

I want to become fair as my marriage is going to get fixed by next year. Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

I had nuclear medicine a few years ago and had been going for regular checkups but recently due to some reasons, my TSH level had increased. So I was given a dosage of 150 mcg of Thyronorm. My check-up was due four months but due to some circumstances I could not go and I went two months late. The doctor told me I had an overdose of it. So he asked me to continue only with 100 mcg. I was wondering if I would feel better if I skip the medicines for two days because it is making me feel tired a lot and weak, too.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you mentioned it appears you had hyperthyroidism which was treated with radioactive iodine and now you are hypothyroid. Well, it is perfectly normal phenomena, after radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid gland we usually expect patients to be hypothyroid. In your case, it just took so long to develop. You should have gotten your thyroid function test done at that time but nonetheless your dose has been reduced so it is perfectly fine. You feel tired because of the excess 50 mcg which you had been taking until now. Anyways give it some time and it will settle down. No, it is not going to be dangerous. Just regularly do your thyroid function test every three months until it stabilizes. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Before five years, I had surgery for a spontaneous pneumothorax.

There is a sharp pain in the abdomen, and I am feeling tired. I did not notice any spotting. Is there anything to worry?","Doctor":"Hello. First, let me say do not get so tensed about the result. We always hope to be within that 40% to 45 % positive cases, but always be ready for the remaining 55% to 60% negative too. After embryo transfer, the best method to confirm is serum beta-hCG on day 13 or 14 after transfer. Even if the smallest of pregnancy, you will have values above 10-20 mIU/mL. Higher the value is the better. If below 10 mIU/ml, then it is mostly negative. If you are still on those progesterone medicines, you will not get periods. You will have cramps and discharge. I would advise checking beta hCG tomorrow. If you get a negative value, then stop all medications and you will have periods may be heavy with clots and painful for a few days. If positive, then continue medications for another two to three weeks and have a scan to see the baby. Get back to routine activities. Latest studies say that no rest is needed after embryo transfer. It will make you feel more sick. Even if negative do not worry. It is not the end of the road; you can transfer any more frozen embryo left. Never lose hope. You will get pregnant for sure.

According to WHO (World Health Organization), all results are considered conclusive at 12 weeks after the last high-risk exposure.

But, as your test results are negative and well beyond the window period, you can be assured that you have not acquired the infection.

Spend time with your friends and family members. Maintain a diary each time you visit betting sites and record your emotions and thoughts just before and after visiting these sites. This will help you to realize what is the urge or emotion that leads you to go to betting site and then you can alter them.

Yes, I know that I am overweight and I am addressing the issue. I recently performed some blood work on myself, so I could have a baseline as I have started a new ketogenic diet. Before 15 days, I ordered a CBC with differential, TSH, lipids panel, CMP, and A1c. The results are as follows (please note that the number in parentheses are the reference range from the laboratory). Hemoglobin A1c - 5.3 (4.8-5.6), TSH - 2.070 (0.450 - 4.500), serum testosterone - 239 (348 - 1197), CBC normal, SED rate - 3 (0-15), Cholesterol total - 214 (100-199), triglycerides - 126 (0-149), HDL - 36 (>39), VLDL - 25 (5-40), LDL - 153 (0-99), CMP normal and serum glucose - 90 (65-99). After I had got these results, I noticed the testosterone was low. I do not have any trouble with erections, though I am not sexually active.

I have reviewed your reports. Your free testosterone is on the lower side and lipids are not much abnormal. Your problem is excessive fat in the body that converts testosterone to estrogen. You also may have fatty liver causing low SHBG (sex hormone-binding globulin). You may do an ultrasound of liver to see if it is fatty or not. The course of action for you is to lose weight by exercise, not vigorous but moderate. The activities like walking, cycling, and swimming are the best to reduce weight. Please do not take any nutritional supplements to increase testosterone.

About a year ago, I started experiencing palpitations, near syncopal episodes, and chest pain. I have seen three cardiologists. I have had a bicycle stress test, limited echocardiogram looking at just the thickness of my heart, and also multiple EKGs. Before four months, I had a cardiac loop recorder implanted. All the tests have been normal. I have also had a workup in many other systems of my body including, endocrine, neurology, pheochromocytoma, kidney circulation and multiple blood tests. All came back normal. I am experiencing that my toes were becoming either white or purple, numb and very cold. My heart rate increases with minimal activity. I also have a past medical history of Goldenhar syndrome. Before two years, my second cousin passed away at the age of 13 due to an anomaly of his left coronary artery.

I have back pain problem (stiffness) for more than three years, and everyone gives the feedback that my posture was not proper while walking. Two years before I consulted a doctor.

He recommended a few vitamin tablets for a few months and asked to do continuous exercise. I started swimming, but l am not able to continue for the last six months because of my location transfer. In the last two years, the condition did not make worse, but the stiffness remains the same.

Pregnancy changes are due to the progesterone hormone produced from the remaining of the ruptured follicle, also due to the hormonal imbalance caused by the hormones. When you do not have periods, it means you had an anovulatory period. It means no ovulation, This would also alter the normal hormonal balance and you get the pregnancy symptoms. After the age of around 35 years, you may not have ovulation every month. This problem of anovulation can be seen earlier if you have any of the following reasons. Weight gain, especially around your mid-segment of the body, thighs, waist and breast. Try to reduce weight by regular exercise, aerobics, yoga, swimming, etc. Follow a strict diet with low calories and no fasting. Avoid junk foods and red meat. Try to reduce 2 to 4 kg per month. Target weight should be weight (in kg) = Height (in cm) - 100. You had any surgery or radiation treatment in the abdomen. Another common cause could be thyroid disorder, So, have a thyroid profile and serum prolactin level early morning in the empty stomach. You can meet a gynecologist who can give you a course of oral hormone pills to have withdrawal bleeding.

After a month, it grows like a small ball, and I felt hard to walk. Before a while, it accidentally bursts out, and some dripped from it. Since then, I do not have a regular period. What to do? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You have two problems, and they are the lump in labia and irregular periods. Your expected weight for height of 121.92 cm is 22 kg to 26 kg. So, the common cause for both the problem is obesity. Your lump is most probably a sebaceous cyst. It is a gland in the layers of skin, which produces oily discharge and keeps skin moist. It is seen at the base of the hair follicles. When you put on fat, there is a lot of fat deposits on the thigh and the labia. Due to fat, the gland mouth which is very narrow may get blocked due to dirt or sweat or periods blood or tight undergarment. But, the secretions from gland do not stop. They keep forming, and gland gradually swells up. Slowly the secretions become harder like a ball. One point on the surface may give way, and discharge or blood may come out. The solution is to reduce weight, wear a loose undergarment, keep the labial area as dry as possible, do not use powder, oil or lotion to labia. All this will prevent further blocking of any other glands. When you put on an extra pad of fat around the mid-segment of the body, the fat gets converted to hormones, which alter the hormonal balance of the body. Fat around thighs, breast and waist form female hormones, but in larger quantity. You would have seen fat males with breast and it is the female hormone in them. Due to hormonal imbalance ovulation will not occur on time. So, periods will not happen. If you suddenly put on or lose weight, the hormone imbalance can occur. Incidentally, you had that lump bursting with no periods. Solution to both the problems is trying to lose weight. I know it is easy to say, but tough to do. Give it a try and see the difference. Avoid red meat, high calories diet and junk food. Have a lot of proteins, fruits and vegetables. Do aerobic exercise, yoga and brisk walking. Tyr to lose 2 kg to 4 kg per month. If you lose 5 kg, then your periods will regularize, and over time such lumps will not appear. If the present lump is very bothering, you can meet a gynecologist or a surgeon who can just remove it. It is not a major procedure.

I have not had my period since then, and I was wondering if this is a cause for concern or a regular thing. Also, before taking pills, my periods were irregular.","Doctor":"Hi. I feel the culprit here is your weight. At this young age of 28 years, you BMI (body mass index) is in obesity range. Increase in body fat especially in the mid-segment of the body, around waist, thighs and breasts is not a healthy sign. This fat gets converted to estrogen, the female hormone, thus causing a very high level interfering with the normal hormonal control. You would have seen fat male developing breast is due to the same female hormone. When estrogen is out of control, the brain loses control of hormones from ovaries. Then, ovulation will not occur on time, that is around day 13 or 14 of periods. Later, the second hormone progesterone will not get released and so periods do not occur. All these years you have been gradually putting on weight and the periods you had were due to the hormone in the birth control pills, same estrogen and progesterone pills. Now, when you stopped the birth control pills, your body is not able to continue the cyclical production. It will not allow you to have next pregnancy too as ovulation is needed for pregnancy. You are 152 cm, and your expected weight is 52 kg to 56 kg. It is easy to say, but tough to lose 20 kg, but with strong willpower, you can do it. For completion, have thyroid profile and serum prolactin done in the early morning and an empty stomach. Do not worry about periods. They will indirectly get back to the track.

I think your neurologist is right. One episode of syncope is not a big problem. However, my further recommendation is to make an appointment with a cardiologist also.

The cut healed as some hard white thing. I tried cutting it away with a scalpel, but it just grows right back. Four months ago, I went to a urologist, and he said it was probably a wart and proceeded to cut it out. When it healed, it I ended up with the white stuff covering the whole area the doctor cut. I have not had sex in the last three years and would like to know what is this (picture attached). Is there anything I can do now? I want your opinion before I go to a doctor again.

Currently, on 300 mg of Bupropion (Wellbutrin) and 150 mg of Venlafaxine (Effexor), each once daily, taken in the mornings. I have experienced antidepressant discontinuation syndrome twice in the past. Once after missing three days of Cymbalta and once after missing one day of Effexor. The antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is not widely discussed by doctors with patients taking this kind of medication. It presented me with severe nausea, vomiting, vertigo, sweating, shaking, weakness, mood change, cognitive, and sleep disturbances, as well as something commonly known as brain zaps by those who experience it. These brain zaps are not unlike Lhermitte's phenomenon. For the past two weeks, I have been experiencing brain zaps multiple times a day, despite having no changes in medication within the last six months or any history of recent head trauma. While I have had back problems before (two bilateral discectomies at L5-S1), it is quite low on the spine and unlikely to be related to or causing these newer brain zaps. Brain zaps can also be caused by increased stress, depression or anxiety, which would also be likely a culprit. Except that, I actually consider myself to be in recovery and overall experience very minimal depression or anxiety symptoms. I do not experience anything certainly new or increased over the past two months.","Doctor":"Hello.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM.

Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning.

For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

Your expected weight is around 55 kg to 60 kg. It is easy to say just to reduce. But, it is quite impossible to reduce so much. Please put some effort to do it for at least 2 to 5 kg per month. It is a start. Reduce all high calories diet and junk bakery food. But, you should not fast. Have regular exercise, especially for the middle segment of the body like aerobics or brisk walk. All the fat in the body gets converted to hormones. You would have seen big men having breast as their fat is producing the female hormone. This hormone will affect the normal cycle of ovulation, and you will not get the periods regularly. Your fat distribution will be mainly around mid-segment such as thighs, breast, back and hip, but not below knees and elbows. Also, there will be black discoloration behind the neck, side of breast and inner aspect of thighs. Kindly get a scan to check polycystic ovaries.

The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent.

I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

It causes nausea and vomiting within minutes after eating or drinking anything, including water sometimes. I have had several CAT scans, barium x-ray, two endoscopies, an EKG, a CAT scan of my brain and tons of blood work including endoscopy biopsy. Everything is apparently fine besides random high blood pressure and it is controlled with blood pressure medicines and an instance of higher, but not extremely high liver enzymes. They also found a small sliding hiatal hernia, which they say is not inflamed and would not cause this.This started after excess vomiting during my pregnancy. I ended up being diagnosed with pre-eclampsia that turned into HELLP syndrome. I had really high blood pressure, protein in urine and high liver enzymes. I delivered my baby through emergency C-section before two months. Before leaving the hospital, I ate a meal again and ended up with vomiting. They said that it was due to gas bubble. After going home, my symptoms got worse each day causing me to go to the ER. I eventually ended up getting my gallbladder removed three weeks ago and was great for three days on Oxycodine. I have since been hospitalized four times where each time they did testing, gave morphine for pain and never find anything in the ER. They discharge me without solving the issue. I am currently admitted by my gallbladder surgeon and going home tomorrow after four days because they say there are no other tests at the time. I am scared and really want some help. Morphine or any pain medicine for that matter is the only thing that helps once it kicks in. If I go home, I will be back in the ER within three days with dehydration because without IV my symptoms get worse each day to the point of extreme dehydration. I must also state that since the four days in the hospital I have extremely improved, but this has happened before. The only reason I think I am improving here is because the pain medicines allow me to eat small portions (liquid diet). Without the pain medicines, the pain will never go away. I also threw up blood that looked like coffee grounds about three times or so, but they said it is normal because of the amount of vomiting I am having. If I am not in the hospital, the pain and nausea become so bad and I vomit every 15 minutes and end up going to the ER from the pain and fear of dehydration. I have a history of GERD and was on Nexium for a whole year and still on it. I am currently prescribed Klonopin for anxiety from all the stress, BP medicine as needed and Oxycodine as needed for when I do try to eat or drink while in the hospital. I was recently removed from Morphine, which I was on for 3 days. Sometimes eating anything will immediately return my symptoms while other times, I can eat a few bites and feel fine. The pain is in my upper middle abdomen and middle chest. It radiates directly to my back, between my shoulder blades and behind my stomach.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have substantial focal hair loss.

In spite of these, she is prediabetic. Her fasting blood glucose is typically around 105 mg/dL. Her A1C is normally in the range of 5.7% to 6%. She takes Metformin to manage the prediabetes. Her blood pressure is checked regularly and is always good. Last time, her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. Her eGFR has been tested several times and is always above 90. Recently, she had a medical checkup in her office, and the report was obesity and protein in the urine. So, she went to She went to her GP who performed a 24-hour protein in the urine test. 520 mg per 24 hours was the result of this test. She was referred to an endocrinologist and a nephrologist. The nephrologist did perform an ultrasound. Neither the endocrinologist or the nephrologist were terribly concerned. My girlfriend discussed using ACE inhibitors with the nephrologist, but he did not think they were necessary as her blood pressure was normal. He recommended diet, exercise, weight loss and monitoring. The nephrologist did not tell her that she has phase 1 CKD. But, it sounds like she has. Is this correct? Both the endocrinologist and the nephrologist felt that it would not impact her ability to live a healthy life. Is this correct? If she has CKD, how long will it take to progress? What is the long-term prognosis? Is healthy pregnancy possible? Apart from diet, exercise and weight loss, are there other things you would like to recommend?","Doctor":"Hi. Welcome to icliniq.com. We are here to help you. Considering her prediabetes a cause of her proteinuria, yes, she would be categorized in stage 1 CKD (chronic kidney disease). However, that is very unlikely that such a prediabetes at this age is going to cause proteinuria. Yes, this is not going to impact if does not worsen further. It will not progress much as her diabetes is well controlled. The prognosis of her condition is good, and a healthy pregnancy without any complication is possible. I want to mention that she needs a repeat 24 hours protein test done after a month to reach a conclusion as a single time urine protein can occur due to many causes like heavy exercises and fever. I would recommend ACE inhibitors, ANA (anti-nuclear antibody), C3, C4 level test and ultrasound kidneys in case her urine protein persists even after one month.

I have an irregular period of 30 to 41 days cycle. I am trying desperately for baby from the last nine months, but there is no success.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

I am a smoker and not on any medication. Over the past seven months or so, I have been experiencing on and off severe upper abdominal pain (center), and that radiates through to my back. At times, the pain may just be some discomfort, and at other time it is completely unbearable whereas I cannot sit still, lie down or do anything even to get brief relief of pain. It feels almost like a gas bubble one receives before they belch. I would try to belch and rarely will get success.

This issue would come on progressively from discomfort to unbearable burning or knot feeling in my upper abdomen within an hour and last 6 to 8 hours and suddenly go away. As of currently, I have had these issues from the moment I awake till I fall asleep. I can feel something wrong with a range of pain levels.

On the top of pretty moderate to severe inattentive ADHD and general learning or processing issues, I smoked way too much weed from ages 16 to 20.

I eat small portions and include periods of intermittent fasting. I am currently on a ketogenic diet (no sugar or carbohydrate, high fat, protein and greens) and I exercise high-intensity cardio and weightlifting for three to five times a week.

If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this?","Doctor":"Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects.

I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning.

For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

My doctor, who is listed as a hematologist or oncologist, said that I must undergo chemotherapy asap. His diagnosis was based solely on bloodwork and a full skeletal x-ray. There was no MRI or PET scan or bone marrow biopsy or urinalysis. The x-ray revealed some tiny pinholes in my jaw and skull but was too small to be definitive. I should mention that I was an alcoholic and drink 24 to 30 regular beers per week. I have done some research and found that the bloodwork of a chronic alcoholic is similar to the bloodwork of someone with myeloma. Among other things, alcohol can cause damage to bone marrow and cause bone loss. I have since completely stopped drinking and have been off the alcohol for four weeks. I am now feeling well with no physical symptoms of myeloma such as no fatigue or weakness, appetite is good, no significant weight loss, no skin lesions and no bone or back pain. No bloodwork has been done since I stopped drinking. Can multiple myeloma be misdiagnosed over chronic alcoholism? Could I have been misdiagnosed?

If I get up, it does not or is less pain. The pain is in one point upper abdomen, center, directly below or behind the sternum. It is helped by drinking cold water. Sometimes, it goes away after I eat. Made worse if I eat fatty food, even moderate amounts of fat. The pain is very close to the surface of the abdomen, and it does not go to my back. I have had sore throats as well. I would imagine that it is from acid reflux. I did have acid reflux for 8 to 10 years, off and on, and I did not do a good job of controlling it at first.

You seem to be very distressed by the problem. As I can see in the picture it is Tinea. Since it is extensive it is important to start proper treatment with oral antifungals for a good length of time to clear the infection. You have been using steroid creams which is going to worsen the infection and make it spread further. So you should stop using dipsalic and other steroid applications and start proper treatment. You should get your LFT and KFT done and you can follow up with dermatologist. Usually itraconazole or terbinafine are given orally along with some creams like luliconazole or sertaconazole, etc. Itching can be controlled with antiallergics.

For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am beta thalassemia minor.

He had a heart attack before 15 days. Doctors are confused whether to go in for angioplasty or bypass considering his age and diabetic history. He had congestion in the lungs and had breathlessness and sleeplessness when admitted to the hospital. Herewith I have attached his laboratory reports. Please suggest a suitable procedure.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through all your grandfather's details (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Angioplasty above the age of 80 is not a good option. The patient is a subject for CABG (coronary artery bypass graft). Ejection fraction of the patient is 35% only, and the lesion is very complex to cross. It is better to go for a planned CABG than to try angioplasty and to abort the procedure at that time due to inability to cross lesion. However, the option to go for minimally invasive by pass surgery should be considered rather than open heart bypass. MICS stands for minimally invasive coronary artery surgery. It is a new technique of performing coronary bypass for CAD (coronary artery disease). In this technique, the heart is approached through the side of the left chest with a small 4 cm incision. The chest is entered between the ribs without cutting any bones and by splitting the muscle. Advantages of MICS are no bones get cut, blood loss is almost negligible, infections are reduced, and the procedure lasts only 4 hours, unlike the conventional heart surgery that takes 14 hours. It is very good for old age patients. For further information consult a cardiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a small pimple like mark near one of my eyes.

Brain tumor headache will be on both sides, more in forehead and you will also have vomiting in that case.

I have a lot of fluid continuing to seep from my ear. How long does that usually last? Also, I have dull pain and tenderness in my head behind the infected ear. Should I be concerned about that? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. It appears with your history that you are suffering from an upper respiratory tract infection that has complicated into an ear infection. Usually, once the antibiotic course starts, the problem should resolve within three to four days and completely by five to seven days. It is normal to have mild, dull ache behind the ear during the acute course. If you have diabetes, then the healing may get delayed. It is advisable to check your sugar levels and visit your doctor if they are high. Pain and tenderness behind the ear may worsen, resulting in a swelling or bulge behind the ear. It may be accompanied by pushing out of the said ear. This is a case of acute mastoiditis, which means the antibiotic is not working and pus is continuously forming. In such a case you must visit the doctor soon as it may require a surgical drainage. The techniques for tympanoplasty vary and this is what we do in my setup.

Some years ago, I went to see a neurologist. He took an EEG, and found \\"epileptiform activity\\", I think in temporal lobes. So he said I have epilepsy and prescribed Valproate. He said my depersonalisation and anxiety were caused by my epilepsy. However, I never had a physical seizure nor an absence and neither have my family noticed any. Also, my symptoms did not improve after one year of Valproate. To make matters worse, some months after quitting Valproate, I developed a psychosis. I have also tried other antiepileptics as part of my treatment following this episode. These include Gabapentin, Carbamazepine and Phenytoin. My symptoms have not improved. Generally, I am feeling malaise and psychotic-like thought patterns after sunset, with anxiety, social anxiety, etc. Could all of this be caused by some underlying neurological problem? Why did the EEG show epileptiform activity? If I do have epilepsy, in spite of not having seizures, why have not the antiepileptics done any good? Are there epilepsies that do not cause physical seizures and also one is not aware of absences because they are very short? Can this type of epilepsy also cause psychiatric symptoms? What would be the best medication for my case? I took a SPECT/PET which showed reduced blood flow to the right frontotemporal lobe. The MRI scans were normal. I also have enlarged liver, rapid heartbeat with palpitations, Epstein-Barr virus infection, history of high eosinophils, history of allergies or bronchitis, history of folliculitis, childhood meningitis and chronic diarrhea (10 years, diagnosed as IBS). Recent results showed elevated GGT, low blood chloride, elevated morning cortisol and ACTH. After the psychotic episode results showed low blood potassium. Currently, I am taking Aripiprazole, Phenytoin, Gabapentin, Amoxapine and high dose of vitamin B3 and B6.","Doctor":"Hi. EEG (electroencephalogram)is not a diagnostic tool in itself. EEG can show abnormality in a normal person and also can be normal in epilepsy patients. Few EEG changes can be seen in normal and abnormal conditions.

Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 36 year old female. I am overweight. I have BP problem since a year.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

During the day I find many people staring at me directly or indirectly, and this creates tension or pressure on my mind.

When it is strapped, it is a little better, but still painful. When it is unstrapped it is worse, and I can hardly walk on it. What do you think my injury is? Could it be related to my back and nerve injury? What treatment is available and what should I do now?","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, there is no attachment and hence I could not see the clinical picture. Injury around a week ago. 1. MRI scan. 2. Blood investigations as advised. 3. Ultrasound report and images (if possible). 1. Hyperuricemia. 2. Infection. As advised.

I have no known heart conditions except for many PVCs and PACs. I was recently diagnosed and picked up on a 48-hour Holter with atrial flutter. My doctor did not say that I had aFib. Doctor wants me to have a chemical stress test for what I have been experiencing now for about a year. Once in every four to seven days, tachycardia wakes me up and it only happens at night time and never during the daytime. In the middle of the night when I am sleeping I feel very hot. And, when this is happening my heart rate shoots up from 120 to 170 BPM and will last anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes and slowly starts to come down. Yes, I do feel anxious when this is happening and I have had panic attacks. Before, they do not feel like panic attacks, but it is still uncomfortable and worrisome. This is driving me crazy. There is no shortness of breath or dizziness. My TSH and T3 are normal. I went to the gynecologist and had a full workup for hormones and all tests were normal. My bloodwork was normal with my cardiologist. My HbA1C was normal. I lost my son before 1.5 years. I cried every day for one full year and I am still heartbroken. Now, I do not want to use that as my reason for tachycardia, because this wakes me up out of a dead sleep. I feel very hot and my skin is red when this is happening. I have to get up and walk around because it is bothersome. Any of your answers and ideas would be very helpful. My gynecologist does not think that has anything to do with my hormones. I do not know if adrenalin rises in the middle of the night with postmenopausal women. And, my cardiologist has no idea of what this could be.","Doctor":"Hello. Episodic tachycardia in the setting of PAC and PVC (premature atrial and ventricular contractions) is suggestive of arrhythmia, may be atrial fibrillation or flutter. We should try to find the cause for it. Do you smoke or have alcohol or any other stimulant drugs? Do you suffer from snoring, interrupted and unrefreshed sleep, daytime sleepiness, headaches, etc? Is there any history of exertional chest pain? I guess, echo must be normal before starting Flecainide. Regarding treatment, I would suggest beta blockers like Metoprolol 25 mg to 50 mg according to heart rate and Flecainide should be pill in pocket approach, that is as and when needed.

From then before two years I was seizure-free having been put on Lamotrigine. Before two years I had another TC seizure and my dosage was raised (cannot remember the dose precisely), and I was seizure-free for almost a year when I had another TC seizure. At this point, my dosage was raised again to 125 mg twice a day. Despite this, I have had a number of absence seizures. This seizure was followed by a 24-36 hour period of not just extreme tiredness but very strange mental sensations, including what felt like a rush of intelligence as well as frequently repeating thoughts and unexplainable strange thoughts (not distressing - more like feelings of another time as well as what I guess are best defined as nonsense, thought trains about advanced concepts such as genetics or psychology). Following this, I had an MRI which reported nothing abnormal, say for a small number of tiny foci of T2 hyper-intensity within the all white matter of both hemispheres, non-specific. The areas of the left frontal lobe where there has been previous EEG evidence of epileptogenic focus were normal. All of the above paragraphs is directly quoted from the radiologist's letter to my GP. Since then, I have had two absence seizures with similar post-seizure symptoms. My Lamotrigine dosage has increased to 200 mg twice a day. Now I am having regular nocturnal seizures (two to four weeks), which leave me similarly confused and with the same weird thought patterns. I had one about three days ago where these symptoms were particularly acute, and have worried me greatly. In all cases, I recovered quickly and found sleep to be a major contributing factor to my recovery. Now, just over 48 hours since my last seizure, these symptoms have again subsided. They have occasionally appeared prior to seizures, making me think they are auras, but they do not seem to be anything like the aura descriptions I have read about. During a recent appointment with a clinical nurse, I was put on a new prescription of Brivaracetam (2x 25 mg) alongside the current Lamotrigine dose. I have yet to begin this. The fact that there is a little reference online to these symptoms is quite distressing to me, particularly given how bizarre they are. Are these potentially a result of the point of epileptogenic focus? Might they be a reaction to the Lamotrigine? My current medications are Fluoxetine 40 mg per day, Atorvastatin 40 mg per day, Metformin 2 x 1000 mg, 10 units insulin Glargine, Lamotrigine 2x 200 mg, Brivaracetam 2x 25 mg (yet to commence).","Doctor":"Hi. As per the given information, I can understand that these symptoms are the effects of seizure, and unlikely to be due to Lamotrigine. The primary goal of the therapy is to control seizure episodes for which you have been prescribed Brivaracetam, you must start the new medicine along with the old one, with which the symptoms must go. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan may not reveal epileptogenic focus other than hippocampal sclerosis and some volume loss. The best way to find epileptogenic focus would be EEG (electroencephalogram), if possible can be done later if seizures are not controlled with the prescribed medicines."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 5 year old daughter is suffering from a cough and mild fever for the last four days.

I am very worried as he refuses to visit a doctor. The symptoms are the following: Right-hand tremors, seizures sometimes when he is on the couch and relatively minor ones and mumbling nonsense during night-time when he was laid down like he is sleep talking and only hears me after I talk three or four times. Last night after he was napping on the couch, he woke up to take his bath and the water was heating. He stayed still for 5 minutes on the heating system staring blankly at the wall. I tried to communicate, but he was wholly unresponsive. I tried to shook him and he stared at me with glassy eyes. He would not answer anything I said. I started slapping him slightly on the face and shooked him to make him responsive. He raised his hand to hit me back, but he seemed that he had no control over his muscles and the slap was so weak that I barely felt it. Then I turned the lights on. He started being more responsive. He became mad and requested to put out the lights. I refused and he kept repeating the words to turn off the lights. He did not move, but seemed mad about the lights and started raising his voice. So, I turned it off. He became unresponsive again. Then, he began pacing around the house mumbling about the television set that was not working. I tried to calm him down but failed. He became a little more responsive by that time and responded with a few words to a few things I asked, but he seemed that he was completely lost in another world or something. After an hour or so, he had his bath and even started to joke. I asked him what was the last thing he remembered and with a little persistence, it seemed that he remembered what had happened in that hour. He had two glasses of wine before that happened. I do not know if alcohol is significant here. I am very scared. I scared that I do not want to lose him. He is the only person I have in this world. Thank you for taking the time to read it.

For examples, I see things in black and white, low self-esteem, feeling evil, substance abuse (weed and alcohol), feeling empty, not sure how to react to emotional or social situations and unhealthy relationships. I have never tried to harm or kill myself, but I put myself in risk or high endurance situations, depression, anxiety. I was binged and purged between ages 13 and 20. I have controlling impulses such as pulling out hair, over picking skin and masturbation. All that started back between the ages of 5 and 11. I also believe it could have something to do with genetics or upbringing because my mother and grandmother show these signs as well.I visited a psychologist for the first time last year and he diagnosed me with depression and severe social anxiety. I did not get In detail about my past or present problems other than hair pulling and anxiety. He asked me about my history with drugs. At first, I did not mind, but then I started to get embarrassed and had a panic attack. Then, he made his diagnosis. I stopped treatment after a couple of months. I find it is often hard for me to follow through with plans, but I would like to try moving forward again.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. Some of the symptoms you have mentioned suggest depression and anxiety. Low self-esteem, feeling low, etc., are classical depression symptoms. Hair pulling is one of the anxiety symptoms. Under unconscious anxiety, individuals develop a habit of pulling hair. You have never developed an idea of self-harm, but there is a practice of putting into a risky situation. This could be a feature of bipolar but should be evaluated. History of abuse of weed also increases such risk-taking behavior. If your day-to-day functioning is impaired, then I would advise you to please get yourself evaluated by a psychiatrist. A proper evaluation will help in making a diagnosis. Mood stabilisers can be used for treatment and will treat the symptoms. Avoid using weed because this might cause the development of acute psychotic symptoms.

After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had my gallbladder removed almost six months back. However, I am still having the same sharp stabbing pain in my chest and back. I also have fatigue and nausea. I went to the ER two nights ago. They advised me to undergo an EKG, stress test, liver and kidney function tests and other blood tests. The results of all the tests were normal. Initially, I thought I had a pancreatic problem, but the doctors said it was normal. So, I think it may be due to blocked bile ducts. Please give your expert opinion regarding the same. I am currently taking medicines for the heart problem and diabetes.","Doctor":"Hi.

I have consulted so many doctors, but it was not cured. However, I came to know from one of my friends that drinking less water cause these type of problems. After hearing this, I noticed that I am drinking hardly one or two glasses of water daily and this may be the reason for my symptoms. How to recover from this? Now, I have started to drink 4 liters of water per day.","Doctor":"Hi. For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 20 year old female. For the past three months, I have been experiencing daily headaches, intermittent dizziness and vertigo, tinnitus and light sensitivity. I have received a diagnosis of a vestibular migraine and my neurologist reports down beating nystagmus while using Frenzel goggles and performing the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. My MRI is clear aside from sinusitis and all vestibular testing came back normal. I have just picked up on a very significant symptom that my neurologist is not aware of. In certain lights like fluorescent lights, if I close my eyes about 10-15 seconds, then my eyes begin jerking uncontrollably and my eyelids flutter or open and close uncontrollably. My eyes also move upwards and into my head during this. This lasts for about 10 seconds at a time, whereby it will calm down and start again at some point if my eyes remain closed. This does not happen when I am in a dark room (such as when going to sleep). I had never experienced this before the above symptoms started. I am wondering if this is a form of nystagmus or some seizure.","Doctor":"Hi. We are here to help you.
