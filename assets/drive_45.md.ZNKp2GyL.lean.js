Use the distance from a point to a line to establish an equation in terms of k. Solve for k to find the answer.Step-by-step solution:1. The center of the circle x^{2}+y^{2}=5 is O(0,0), and its radius is r=sqrt{5}.2. According to the given conditions, the slope of the tangent line passing through P(-1,2) exists. Let the equation of this line be y-2=k(x+1), which can be rewritten as kx-y+(2+k)=0.3. Since the line is tangent to the circle x^{2}+y^{2}=5, the distance d from the circle's center O to the line is equal to the radius r. Therefore, d=frac{|2+k|}{sqrt{1+k^{2}}}=sqrt{5}.4.

Moreover, the angles angle K L N and angle L K A are equal as alternate interior angles when the lines L N and A C are parallel. Thus, angle K L N = angle L K A, which means that the ray K L is the bisector of angle A K B. Therefore, the point L lying on it is equidistant from the lines K A and K B. Additionally, it is equidistant from the lines C A = K A and C B, as it lies on the bisector of angle A C B. This means that the point L is equidistant from the lines C B and K B, and therefore must lie on the bisector of one of the angles formed by these lines, in which it is contained. This is the angle K B C_{1}, where C_{1} is a point on the extension of the segment C B beyond point B, and its bisector must be the ray B L = B A. From this, we get that angle A B C_{1} = angle A B K = angle C B K.

Solving these, we get ( c = 1 ) or ( c = -1 ).5. Checking the solutions:   - If ( c = 1 ), then ( f(x) = x ). Substituting ( f(x) = x ) into the functional equation:     [     f(x - 1 - x) = x - 1 - x     ]     [     f(-1) = -1     ]     This is consistent.   - If ( c = -1 ), then ( f(x) = -x ).

Assume the set ( X ) has at least two positive integers. Let ( X ) be a set such that for every two elements ( m ) and ( n ) in ( X ) with ( n > m ), there exists an element ( k ) in ( X ) such that ( n = mk^2 ). This implies that for every ( m, n in X ) with ( n > m ), the ratio ( frac{n}{m} ) is the square of an element in ( X ).2. Consider the smallest two elements ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) of ( X ). Write ( X ) in the form ( {a_1, a_2, ldots} ) where ( a_1 < a_2 < ldots ). Since ( X ) has at least two elements, we can consider ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ).3. Show that 1 is not an element of ( X ). If 1 were an element of ( X ), it would be the smallest element, so ( a_1 = 1 ). Since ( a_2 > 1 ), the ratio ( frac{a_2}{1} = a_2 ) must be the square of an element in ( X ). This element must be greater than 1 and less than ( a_2 ), which contradicts the assumption that ( a_1 < a_2 ). Hence, 1 is not an element of ( X ).4. Since ( a_2 > a_1 ), the ratio ( frac{a_2}{a_1} ) is the square of an element in ( X ). This element can only be ( a_1 ) because ( sqrt{frac{a_2}{a_1}} leq frac{a_2}{a_1} < a_2 ) and ( a_1 ) is the only element less than ( a_2 ). Therefore, ( frac{a_2}{a_1} = a_1^2 ) and ( a_2 = a_1^3 ).5. If ( X ) has only two elements, then ( X = {a, a^3} ) where ( a ) is an integer greater than 1. This already provides a family of solutions.6. Consider the case when ( X ) has at least three elements, i.e., there is an element ( a_3 ). Since ( a_3 > a_1 ), the ratio ( frac{a_3}{a_1} ) is the square of an element in ( X ). This element must be either ( a_1 ) or ( a_2 ) because ( sqrt{frac{a_3}{a_1}} leq frac{a_3}{a_1} < a_3 ).7. If ( frac{a_3}{a_1} = a_1^2 ), then ( a_3 = a_1^3 ), so ( a_3 = a_2 ), which contradicts ( a_2 < a_3 ). Hence, only the case ( frac{a_3}{a_1} = a_2^2 ) remains possible. Since ( a_2 = a_1^3 ), we have ( a_3 = a_1 a_2^2 = a_1 (a_1^3)^2 = a_1^7 ).8. Since ( a_3 > a_2 ), the ratio ( frac{a_3}{a_2} ) is the square of an element in ( X ). But ( frac{a_3}{a_2} = frac{a_1^7}{a_1^3} = a_1^4 = (a_1^2)^2 ). Since ( a_1^2 ) is not an element of ( X ) (it would lie between ( a_1 ) and ( a_3 = a_1^7 ), so it would be equal to ( a_2 ), but ( a_2 = a_1^3 neq a_1^2 )), we get a contradiction.9.

It rewrites as mathrm{q}^{r} equiv -1[mathrm{p}] and thus implies, in particular, mathrm{q}^{2 r} equiv 1[mathrm{p}]. Therefore, the order of mathrm{q} modulo p is a divisor of 2 r. Since r is assumed to be prime, it is thus an element of the set {1,2, r, 2 r}. If we further assume that p neq 2, we have q^{r} not equiv 1[p], and thus the order of q modulo p is necessarily 2 or 2 r. In the first case, p divides q^{2}-1=(q-1)(q+1), but cannot divide q-1 (since q^{r} equiv -1[p]) and by Gauss's lemma we get q equiv -1[p]. In the second case, by Fermat's theorem we get that 2 r divides p-1. By permuting the numbers p, q and r, we of course get analogous consequences from the other two conditions \\" mathrm{q} divides 1+mathrm{r}^{mathrm{p}} \\", and \\" r divides 1+p^{q} \\".Now suppose that p, q and r are all odd, and to begin with that we are in the case where q equiv -1[p]. The prime number p cannot therefore divide q-1 (since it already divides q+1 and it is not 2). According to the results of the first paragraph, the condition \\" mathrm{q} divides 1+mathrm{r}^{mathrm{p}} \\" implies that mathrm{r} equiv -1[mathrm{q}]. By applying the same argument again, we find that p equiv -1[r]. However, the three previous congruences are not compatible. For example, they imply q geqslant p-1, r geqslant q-1 and p geqslant r-1, but two of our primes cannot be equal, due to our condition \\" q equiv -1[p] \\", and if we assume that p is maximal, necessarily q=p-1, which is impossible since p and q are odd. We deduce that, always in the case where p, q and r are assumed to be odd, 2 r divides p-1. By cyclically permuting the variables, we similarly prove that 2 p divides q-1 and 2 q divides r-1. Thus 8 p q r divides (p-1)(q-1)(r-1), which is clearly not possible given that 8 p q r>(p-1)(q-1)(r-1). Finally, there is no solution when p, q and r are all odd.We now come to the case where one of these three numbers is equal to 2. By cyclically permuting p, q and r again, we can assume that it is p. The conditions of the statement then say that q is odd, that r^{2} equiv -1[q] and that 2^{q} equiv -1[r]. By what was done in the first paragraph, this last congruence implies that r=3 or that 2 q divides r-1. The first case leads to 9 equiv -1[q], which only occurs if q=5 since we have already ruled out the case q=2. We also verify that the triplet (2,5,3) is indeed a solution. In the second case, now, the product 2 q divides r-1, but also 2left(r^{2}+1right) since we know that r^{2} equiv -1[q]. Thus 2 q divides 2left(r^{2}+1right)-2(r+1)(r-1)=4, which cannot happen.In conclusion, there are exactly three solutions which are the triplets (2,5,3),(5,3,2) and (3,2,5).## V.

Volume of the Pyramid P-ABCD:   The volume of the pyramid is given by V = frac{1}{3} cdot text{base area} cdot text{height}. The base of the pyramid is a trapezoid with bases AD and BC, and height AB. The area of the trapezoid is frac{1}{2} cdot (AD + BC) cdot AB. Since AD perp plane PAB, PA is the height of the pyramid.

Mark 180 points on a circle, dividing it into 180 equal arcs, each 2^{circ}. The measure of any arc with endpoints at two of the marked points is expressed as an even number of degrees, so the measure of any inscribed angle in the circle, formed by three marked points, is a natural number of degrees. Therefore, 180 marked points satisfy the condition of the problem.Estimate. It remains to prove that N leqslant 180. Any three marked points form a triangle, so they cannot lie on the same line. Assuming the marked points are located on a coordinate plane, let A be any of them with the maximum ordinate. Among the remaining points, choose points B and C such that the angle B A C is maximized.From the condition of the problem, it follows that in triangle A B C, the measures of angles A B C and A C B are at least 1^{circ}, so the measure of angle B A C is at most 178^{circ}. Due to the choice of points B and C, the remaining N-3 marked points lie strictly inside angle B A C, and each ray starting from point A contains no more than one of them. By drawing a ray through each marked point inside angle B A C with the origin at point A, we obtain N-3 distinct rays, dividing angle B A C into N-2 angles. If N-2>178, then at least one of these angles has a measure less than 1^{circ} and is an angle of some triangle with vertices at three marked points, which contradicts the condition of the problem.

Each brought some gift: the 60 poorest brought only a handmade wooden figurine, the richer ones either 2 gold coins or 3 silver coins. The number of silver coins given was more than 40 but less than 100. The minister received all the figurines and also one-seventh of all the gold coins and one-third of all the silver coins. The king and his minister received the same number of items.Determine how many subjects there could have been, how many gold coins could have been given, and how many silver coins. (M. Volfová)","solution":"Let the number of gold coins be z and the number of silver coins be s. The gold coins were given in pairs, so z is an even number, and the silver coins were given in threes, so s is divisible by three. Additionally, s is between 40 and 100. The minister received 60 figurines and frac{1}{7} z + frac{1}{3} s coins, while the king received frac{6}{7} z + frac{2}{3} s coins. This implies that z must be divisible by 7, which, combined with the previous condition, means that z must be divisible by 14. Both the king and his minister received the same number of items, which in our notation gives the equation60 + frac{z}{7} + frac{s}{3} = frac{6z}{7} + frac{2s}{3}After simplification,begin{aligned}frac{5z}{7} + frac{s}{3} & = 60 15z + 7s & = 7 cdot 3 cdot 60.end{aligned}We are looking for all integer solutions to equation (2) that satisfy the conditions mentioned above. If we express the unknown z,z = 84 - frac{7s}{15}we see that s must be divisible by 15. Since z must be even, the value of the expression frac{7}{15} s must also be even, which means that s must be an even number. Therefore, s must be divisible by 30, which, considering the condition 40 < s < 100, means that s can only be 60 and 90. For both these possibilities, we can calculate z using (3), and the number of subjects can be determined as 60 + frac{1}{3} s + frac{1}{2} z. The problem has the following two solutions (note that all the conditions mentioned above are satisfied):| silver coins | gold coins | subjects || :---: | :---: | :---: || 60 | 56 | 108 || 90 | 42 | 111 |Another solution. Equation (2) can also be solved by expressing the unknown s:s = 180 - frac{15z}{7}.From the beginning, we know that z must be divisible by 14, so we substitute multiples of 14 for z and check if 40 < s < 100. If so, we calculate the number of subjects as 60 + frac{1}{3} s + frac{1}{2} z (note that the other conditions mentioned above are satisfied):| gold coins | silver coins | subjects || :---: | :---: | :---: || 14 | 150 |  || 28 | 120 |  || mathbf{42} | mathbf{90} | mathbf{111} || mathbf{56} | mathbf{60} | mathbf{108} || 70 | 30 |  |We do not continue further because s is less than 40; the problem has two solutions.Evaluation. 2 points for setting up equation (1) and its subsequent simplification; 2 points for finding one possibility; 1 point for finding the second possibility; 1 point for justifying that there are no more solutions."},{"problem":"## Task 2Add the number 60 to the difference between the numbers 583876 and 97645.","solution":"583876-97645=486231 ; 486231+60=486291"},{"problem":"Given A=-3a^{2}+ab-3a-1, B=-a^{2}-2ab+1,(1) Find A-3B;(2) If the value of A-3B is independent of a, find the value of b.","solution":"To solve the given problem, we proceed as follows: Part (1): Find A-3BGiven:- A = -3a^{2} + ab - 3a - 1- B = -a^{2} - 2ab + 1We need to calculate A - 3B.

Taking x=2^{2} and a=24 in the above equality, we establish that x-1=2^{2}-1=3 is a divisor of left(2^{2}right)^{24}-1=2^{48}-1=N. Similarly, taking x=2^{3} and a=18, we establish that x-1=2^{3}-1=7 is another divisor of left(2^{3}right)^{18}-1=2^{48}-1=N. Proceeding in this manner, we verify that for any divisor d of 48, the number 2^{d}-1 is a divisor of N.

We aim to find the coordinates of overrightarrow{OC}. Step 1: Determine the Lengths of overrightarrow{OA} and overrightarrow{OB}Given that A(0,1) and B(-3,4), we can find the lengths of overrightarrow{OA} and overrightarrow{OB} using the distance formula:- |overrightarrow{OA}|=sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (1-0)^2}=1- |overrightarrow{OB}|=sqrt{(-3-0)^2 + (4-1)^2}=sqrt{9+9}=sqrt{18}=3sqrt{2}approx5 Step 2: Calculate the Position of D on ABLet D(x,y) be the intersection point of OC and AB. Since C lies on the bisector of angle AOB, the ratio AD:BD should reflect the ratio of the lengths of overrightarrow{OA} and overrightarrow{OB}, which is 1:5. Therefore, D divides the directed line segment AB in the ratio of frac{1}{5}, leading us to:- x=frac{-3×frac{1}{5}}{1+frac{1}{5}}=frac{-3/5}{6/5}=-frac{1}{2}- y=frac{1+4×frac{1}{5}}{1+frac{1}{5}}=frac{1+4/5}{6/5}=frac{3}{2}So, overrightarrow{OD}=(-frac{1}{2},frac{3}{2}). Step 3: Calculate overrightarrow{OC} Using the Given MagnitudeGiven |overrightarrow{OC}|=2 and overrightarrow{OD}=(-frac{1}{2},frac{3}{2}), we normalize overrightarrow{OD} and scale it to get overrightarrow{OC}:- |overrightarrow{OD}|=sqrt{(-frac{1}{2})^2+(frac{3}{2})^2}=sqrt{frac{1}{4}+frac{9}{4}}=sqrt{frac{10}{4}}=frac{sqrt{10}}{2}- To get overrightarrow{OC} with a magnitude of 2, we scale overrightarrow{OD}: overrightarrow{OC}=frac{2overrightarrow{OD}}{|overrightarrow{OD}|}=left(frac{2(-frac{1}{2})}{frac{sqrt{10}}{2}},frac{2(frac{3}{2})}{frac{sqrt{10}}{2}}right)=left(-frac{sqrt{10}}{5},frac{3sqrt{10}}{5}right).Therefore, the coordinates of overrightarrow{OC} are boxed{left(-frac{sqrt{10}}{5},frac{3sqrt{10}}{5}right)}."},{"problem":"13.

This is directly observed from the expression, where the number 2 is the exponent of the base -3. Thus, left(-3right)^{2} means -3 is to be multiplied by itself once, indicating that the exponent is correctly identified as 2. Therefore, Statement A is correct.- Statement B: The base of the expression left(-3right)^{2} is -3. This is clear from the structure of the expression, where -3 is the number being raised to the power of 2. The base in any expression of the form a^n is a, which in this case is -3. Therefore, Statement B is correct.- Statement C: To evaluate the power left(-3right)^{2}, we multiply -3 by itself: -3 times -3 = 9. This calculation shows that the power, or the result of raising -3 to the exponent 2, is 9, not -9. Therefore, the statement that the power is -9 is incorrect. This makes Statement C the incorrect statement among the options provided.- Statement D: The expression left(-3right)^{2} indeed represents multiplying 2 -3s together. This is the definition of raising a number to the power of 2; it means to multiply the number by itself. Therefore, -3 multiplied by -3 is exactly what is represented by left(-3right)^{2}.

Suppose that among the colorings of the first table, exactly a have the cell A colored, and exactly b have the cell B colored. Clearly, a=b due to symmetry.Notice that the number of colorings of the second table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where the cell A is not colored. The number of colorings of the third table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where neither A nor B is colored.

To count the number of such colorings, we add a and b, and then subtract what has been counted twice - the ways where both A and B are colored.All colorings of the first table can be divided into two types: those in which the cell A is colored, and those in which it is not. This leads to the equation 120=a+96, i.e., a=24. Then b=24 as well.The number of colorings where both A and B are colored is the same as the number of ways to color the central 3 times 3 square. It is easy to see that there are exactly 3!=6 such ways (to choose the colored cell in its top row, there are 3 ways, in the middle row - 2 ways, and in the bottom row - 1 way).Thus, the answer to the problem is the number 120-(24+24-6)=78.## 7th grade"},{"problem":"1.

We start from the inequality to be shown:left|x_{n}-aright|=frac{x_{n-1}+1}{x_{n-2}+4}-aFor x_{n} > a, we have:frac{a+c lambda^{n-1}+1}{a-c lambda^{n-2}+4}-a stackrel{?}{<} c lambda^{n}This can be simplified to:frac{1}{4}left(frac{1}{4}+4right)-frac{3}{2^{n}}-frac{3}{8}-frac{1}{2}>frac{1}{16}+1-frac{3}{16}-frac{3}{8}-frac{1}{2}=0for n geq 4, which verifies the claimed inequality.For x_{n} leq a, similarly:a-frac{a-c lambda^{n-1}+1}{a+c lambda^{n-2}+4} stackrel{?}{<} c lambda^{n}This can be simplified to:frac{1}{4}left(frac{1}{4}+4right)-frac{3}{2^{n}}-frac{3}{8}-frac{1}{2}>frac{1}{16}+1-frac{3}{16}-frac{3}{8}-frac{1}{2}=0for n geq 4, which verifies the claimed inequality.Overall, we have for every n geq 2 the estimate left|x_{n}-aright|<c lambda^{n} with lambda=frac{1}{2} and c=3, which shows convergence because c lambda^{n} rightarrow 0 as n rightarrow infty.

The information given can be translated into the equation based on the sales amount and the increase in price:- The equation is derived from the fact that the total sales amount in July (22,500 yuan) at a price of x-100 yuan per bike equals the total sales amount in August (25,000 yuan) at a price of x yuan per bike, assuming the quantity sold remains constant.Thus, we have:[frac{22,500}{x-100} = frac{25,000}{x}]Solving this equation for x, we proceed as follows:[22,500x = 25,000(x - 100)][22,500x = 25,000x - 2,500,000][2,500,000 = 2,500x][x = 1,000]After solving, we find that x = 1000 yuan is indeed a solution that satisfies the original equation.Therefore, the selling price per bike in August is boxed{1000 text{ yuan}}.# Part (2): Find the cost price of each mountain bike.Let's denote the cost price of each mountain bike as y yuan.

This gives us the equation:[frac{850 - y}{y} times 100% = 25%]Solving this equation for y, we proceed as follows:[frac{850 - y}{y} = frac{25}{100}][850 - y = frac{1}{4}y][850 = frac{5}{4}y][y = 680]After solving, we find that y = 680 yuan is indeed a solution that satisfies the original equation.Therefore, the cost price of each mountain bike is boxed{680 text{ yuan}}."},{"problem":"Example 3.

First of all, note that due to the axial symmetry with respect to the line A B, it does not matter which of the two intersections of the circles k_{1} and k_{2} we choose as point L.The area of the triangle K L M will be expressed not by the lengths of its legs K L and L M, but by the lengths of its hypotenuse K M and the corresponding height L D (Fig. 3 on the left), using the formula { }^{3}S_{K L M}=frac{|K M| cdot|L D|}{2} .To determine the distances of point D from points B and L, consider the midpoint S of the segment B L (Fig. 3 on the right). Triangles A S B and L D B are both right-angled with a common acute angle at vertex B. Therefore, they are similar by the AA similarity criterion, so the ratio of their sides is (we are calculating with lengths without units, so according to the problem, |A B|=4,|B L|=2, and thus |B S|=|B L| / 2=1)frac{|B D|}{|B S|}=frac{|B L|}{|B A|}=frac{2}{4}, quad text { hence } quad|B D|=frac{1}{2}|B S|=frac{1}{2}[^1]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_222317d063c1e447ab0bg-8.jpg?height=742&width=1330&top_left_y=237&top_left_x=364)Fig. 3From the Pythagorean theorem for triangle L D B, we get { }^{4}|L D|=sqrt{|B L|^{2}-|B D|^{2}}=sqrt{4-frac{1}{4}}=frac{sqrt{15}}{2} .From the equality |B D|=1 / 2, we also derive the length of the segment K D of the hypotenuse K M of the right-angled triangle K L M, namely |K D|=|A B|-|A K|-|B D|=4-1-1 / 2=5 / 2. The length of the other segment D M is now determined from the Euclidean theorem of the height, according to which |L D|^{2}=|K D| cdot|D M|.

Define Euler's Totient Function: For any natural number ( m ), Euler's totient function ( phi(m) ) counts the number of integers ( k ) that are relatively prime to ( m ) and satisfy ( 1 le k le m ).2. Identify the Problem: We need to determine all positive integers ( n ) such that for every integer ( k > n^2 ), ( n ) divides ( phi(nk + 1) ).3. Choose a Prime ( p ): Let ( p ) be the smallest prime that does not divide ( n ). This choice is crucial because it allows us to construct large values of ( k ) such that ( nk + 1 ) has a specific form.4. Construct ( k ): Consider ( k = frac{p^x - 1}{n} ) for some large ( x ). This ensures ( k ) is an integer because ( p^x - 1 ) is divisible by ( n ).5. Evaluate ( phi(nk + 1) ): We have ( nk + 1 = p^x ). Therefore, ( phi(nk + 1) = phi(p^x) = p^x - p^{x-1} = p^{x-1}(p - 1) ).6. Divisibility Condition: Since ( n mid phi(nk + 1) ), we must have ( n mid p^{x-1}(p - 1) ).

This implies:   [   b^{42} equiv 1 pmod{43}   ]   Raising both sides of the given congruence ( a^9 equiv b^7 pmod{43} ) to the sixth power, we get:   [   (a^9)^6 equiv (b^7)^6 pmod{43} implies a^{54} equiv b^{42} pmod{43}   ]   Since ( b^{42} equiv 1 pmod{43} ), we have:   [   a^{54} equiv 1 pmod{43}   ]3.

Since the polynomial a^{2}+2 a+2 has no roots, the only solution to the equation is a=1, so the system is satisfied by the triplet of numbers a=1, b=1, c=2. Cases (19) and (20) are considered similarly; from them we get that either a=2, b=1, c=1, or a=1, b=2, c=1. Now, for each of the obtained triplets of numbers (a ; b ; c), we will find x.If b=2, then 5 x-26=2 x-8, that is, x=6. This value fits: a=log _{sqrt{4}} 2=1, c=log _{2^{2}} 4=1.If b=1, then sqrt{5 x-26}=2 x-8.

Given the vast number of middle school students across the country, conducting a survey on each individual would be impractical. Therefore, this scenario is typically suited for a sample survey where a representative group is selected for study. Thus, option A is not the most suitable for a comprehensive survey.- Option B focuses on understanding the water quality of a river. Water quality can vary significantly along different parts of the river and over time, making it more efficient to conduct sample surveys at various points and times rather than a comprehensive survey of every possible point and moment. Hence, option B is not the most suitable for a comprehensive survey.- Option C is about surveying the vision of all classmates. In this scenario, the population size (classmates) is relatively small and manageable, making it feasible to conduct a survey on each individual. This makes option C suitable for a comprehensive survey, where every member of the population is included in the study.- Option D involves understanding the service life of a batch of light bulbs. Since this could involve a large number of light bulbs and potentially varying conditions affecting their service life, a sample survey would typically be more appropriate to estimate the average service life.

The slope of the line OP is calculated by using the coordinates of point P and the center O as:k_{OP} = frac{(-2) - (-4x)}{3 - x} = frac{2 - 4x}{3 - x}. Since the given line x + y - 1 = 0 has a slope k_L = -1 and the circle is tangent to this line at point P, the product of the slopes of OP and the given line should be -1 because tangency implies that OP is perpendicular to the tangent line at point P. Therefore, we set up the equation:k_{OP} cdot k_{L} = -1.Substituting the slopes, we get:frac{2 - 4x}{3 - x} cdot (-1) = -1.Solving the equation yields x = 1. Thus, the center of the circle O is (1, -4).Next, we calculate the radius r by using the distance between the center and the tangent point P(3, -2). The radius r is:r = sqrt{(1 - 3)^2 + (-4 + 2)^2} = sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2)^2} = 2sqrt{2}.Finally, the standard equation of the circle with center (h, k) and radius r is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.

Unfortunately, the economist-cryptographer decrypted the cryptogram with an error - the digits in the amount of tax revenue were determined in the wrong order. Based on the incorrect data, a decision was made to introduce a per-unit tax on the producer in the amount of 90 monetary units per unit of the product. It is known that the market demand is given by Q d=688-4 P, and the market supply is linear. In the situation where there are no taxes, the price elasticity of market supply at the equilibrium point is 1.5 times higher than the absolute value of the price elasticity of the market demand function.

The minimum steps required is 4.","solution":"To determine the minimum number of times the operation must be performed to get our original string of length (2n) back, we need to analyze the transformation in detail.1. Define the Operation:   The operation involves placing all characters at even indices first, followed by characters at odd indices. For a string (S) of length (2n), the transformation can be described as:   [   S = s_0 s_1 s_2 ldots s_{2n-1} rightarrow s_0 s_2 s_4 ldots s_{2n-2} s_1 s_3 s_5 ldots s_{2n-1}   ]2.

Specifically, the character at index (j) moves to:   [   f(j) equiv 2j mod (2n-1)   ]   This is because the operation effectively doubles the index and wraps around modulo (2n-1).3. Finding the Minimum (k):   We need to find the smallest (k) such that applying the operation (k) times returns the string to its original order. Mathematically, this means finding (k) such that:   [   f^k(j) = j quad text{for all } j   ]   This implies:   [   2^k j equiv j mod (2n-1)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   (2^k - 1)j equiv 0 mod (2n-1)   ]   Since this must hold for all (j), the smallest (k) is the order of 2 modulo (2n-1), denoted as (text{ord}_2(2n-1)).4.

The mean number of values that show is frac{m}{n} , where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m + n.","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of distinct values that appear when rolling four six-sided dice. We will use the concept of expected value in probability.1. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:   Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes when rolling four dice is:   [   6^4 = 1296   ]2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each possible number of distinct values:   - 1 distinct value:     There are 6 possible outcomes where all four dice show the same value (e.g., 1111, 2222, ..., 6666):     [     binom{6}{1} = 6     ]   - 2 distinct values:     We choose 2 values from the 6 possible values, and then we need to subtract the cases where all dice show the same value. The number of ways to choose 2 values from 6 is:     [     binom{6}{2} = 15     ]     For each pair of values, there are (2^4 = 16) ways to assign the values to the four dice, but we need to subtract the 2 cases where all dice show the same value:     [     16 - 2 = 14     ]     Therefore, the total number of outcomes with exactly 2 distinct values is:     [     15 times 14 = 210     ]   - 3 distinct values:     We choose 3 values from the 6 possible values, and then we need to decide which one of the three values appears twice. The number of ways to choose 3 values from 6 is:     [     binom{6}{3} = 20     ]     For each set of 3 values, we choose one value to appear twice (3 choices), and then we arrange the four dice, considering the repetition:     [     frac{4!}{2!} = 12     ]     Therefore, the total number of outcomes with exactly 3 distinct values is:     [     20 times 3 times 12 = 720     ]   - 4 distinct values:     We choose 4 values from the 6 possible values, and then we arrange the four dice:     [     binom{6}{4} = 15     ]     For each set of 4 values, there are (4!) ways to arrange the four dice:     [     4! = 24     ]     Therefore, the total number of outcomes with exactly 4 distinct values is:     [     15 times 24 = 360     ]3.

Reflecting Point ( D ) in ( T ):   - Let ( X ) be the reflection of ( D ) in ( T ). Since ( AT ) is the median, ( T ) is the midpoint of ( AD ). Therefore, reflecting ( D ) in ( T ) gives us point ( X ) such that ( T ) is the midpoint of ( DX ).2. Using the A-HM Point:   - The A-HM point is a special point in triangle geometry, often related to reflections and symmetries. Here, reflecting ( D ) in ( T ) to get ( X ) implies that ( X ) lies on the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ).3. Cyclic Quadrilateral ( ALKX ):   - Let ( L ) be the foot of the A-external angle bisector. By a well-known lemma in triangle geometry, the quadrilateral ( ALKX ) is cyclic. This means that the opposite angles of this quadrilateral sum to ( 180^circ ).4. Angle Relationships:   - Since ( ALKX ) is cyclic, we have:     [     angle ALK + angle AXK = 180^circ     ]   - Also, since ( K ) is the reflection of ( F ) about ( T ), we have:     [     angle KXT = angle FDA     ]5.

Therefore, we will divide the solution into five parts and work with a different assumption for mathrm{s} in each. For the number of seats mathrm{v} in one fifth of the hall, we use the unknown p.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_c7e802ccb04b770c89dfg-2.jpg?height=483&width=802&top_left_y=1472&top_left_x=661)a) We assume that 150 free tickets constituted frac{1}{5} of the hall or less. By moving the free tickets to the back of the hall, 150 * 40 = 6000 (CZK) would be earned, which does not match the problem statement.b) We assume that the segment with free tickets ends in the second fifth of the hall, i.e., that p < 150 leqq 2p. By moving the free tickets from the first fifth to the fifth, 40p CZK would be earned. In the second fifth of the hall, there are 150 - p free tickets, and their move to the fourth fifth would earn 20 cdot (150 - p) CZK. We calculate p:begin{aligned}40p + 20 cdot (150 - p) & = 4320 20p + 3000 & = 4320 p & = 66.end{aligned}We see that the assumed inequality 150 leqq 2p does not hold, so the segment with free tickets cannot end in the second fifth of the hall.c) We assume that the segment with free tickets ends in the third fifth of the hall, i.e., that 2p < 150 leqq 3p. By moving the free tickets from the first fifth to the fifth, 40p CZK would be earned, from the second fifth to the fourth, 20p CZK. The remaining 150 - 2p free tickets are in the third fifth of the hall and would be moved without profit back to the third fifth. We calculate p:begin{aligned}40p + 20p + 0 cdot (150 - 2p) & = 4320, 60p & = 4320, p & = 72.end{aligned}We see that the assumed inequality 2p < 150 leqq 3p holds. Therefore, the segment with free tickets could end in the third fifth of the hall, and the total number of seats in the hall would then be 5p = 5 cdot 72 = 360.d) We assume that the segment with free tickets ends in the fourth fifth of the hall, i.e., that 3p < 150 leqq 4p. We can set up an equation similarly to the previous paragraphs or use another approach: 180p CZK was earned from tickets in the fifth fifth of the hall, and 4p - 150 tickets were sold in the fourth fifth, earning 200 cdot (4p - 150) CZK. If the free tickets were distributed from the back rows, 5p - 150 tickets would be sold, all at 220 CZK. The difference between these two revenues is 4320 CZK, leading to the following equation:begin{aligned}220 cdot (5p - 150) - 180p - 200 cdot (4p - 150) & = 4320 120p - 3000 & = 4320, p & = 61.end{aligned}We see that the assumed inequality 3p < 150 does not hold, so the segment with free tickets cannot end in the fourth fifth of the hall.e) We assume that the segment with free tickets ended in the fifth fifth of the hall. We can proceed as in paragraphs b), c), and d) or use a simpler approach: money was earned only from seats in the fifth fifth, and if they were sold in the first fifth instead, 40 CZK more would be earned per ticket. The number of sold seats would then be 4320 : 40 = 108, and the total number of seats would be 150 + 108 = 258. However, the segment with 150 free tickets would not end in the last fifth of the hall, so the assumption at the beginning of this part of the solution cannot be fulfilled.There were 360 seats in the hall."},{"problem":"4.

In the second minute, twelve segments of length (frac{1}{9}) are added, which is also a total of (frac{4}{3}).Each minute, each vertical line segment is split into three, causing three times as many squares to grow in each subsequent minute. Thus, in each minute, three times as many segments are added compared to the previous minute, but they are also (frac{1}{3}) the length of the previous segments.

This possibility thus leads to a contradiction with the requirements of the problem.In total, the only solution is: Majčina's numbers are 945 and 672, and their product is 635040.Note. If we had worked with the product written in reverse after the initial derivation of ( c = 5 ) and ( F = 2 ), we would have noticed that regardless of the value of ( e ), the following results:[begin{aligned}& D e 2 & begin{array}{r}cdot a B 5 hline * 60end{array} & * * * xend{aligned}]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_3858df03904f0991bae5g-6.jpg?height=92&width=251&top_left_y=545&top_left_x=908)(The digit 6 on the first line of the intermediate result follows from the oddness of ( e ) and the carry over the tens place.) For the last two digits of the product to be 40, ( x ) must be 8, and thus ( B = 4 ).

Then the hour hand is 10 + x units away from the 12, and the minute hand is 12x units away.If after 6 o'clock the hour hand has moved y units to reach the same position with the hands swapped, then in the second position the hour hand is 30 + y units away from the 12, and the minute hand is 12y units away. According to the condition,begin{aligned}10 + x & = 12y 12x & = 30 + yend{aligned}must hold. From this,x = frac{370}{143} = 2 frac{84}{143}, quad y = frac{150}{143} = 1 frac{7}{143}Thus, the sought time is2 text{ o'clock } 31 frac{7}{143} text{ minutes} (approx 31 text{ min } 2.9 text{ sec}).The corresponding time between 6 and 7 o'clock is6 text{ o'clock } 12 frac{84}{143} text{ minutes} (approx 12 text{ min } 35.2 text{ sec}).II. solution: We can also derive equations for the unknowns from the fact that at any time, the hour hand divides the arc between two adjacent hour marks in the same ratio as the arcs from the 12 in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions to the minute hand.Let the unit be the 12th part of a full circle, and let one of the hands be x units after the 2 and the other y units after the 6 at the desired hand position. Then, for the time between 2 and 3 o'clock,frac{x}{1-x} = frac{6+y}{6-y}and for the hand position between 6 and 7 o'clock,frac{y}{1-y} = frac{2+x}{10-x}From these,12x = 6 + y, quad 12y = 2 + xIf we also take into account that the units here are fifths of the x and y values in the first solution, we can see that we essentially got back the system of equations in the first solution.III. solution: The problem can also be solved with one unknown. Using the notation of the first solution, the positions of the hour and minute hands between 2 and 3 o'clock are now given by the rotations 10 + x and 12x. If the hour hand is now at 12x between 6 and 7, then the position of the minute hand is indicated by the rotation 12(12x - 30), so10 + x = 12(12x - 30)Here, we essentially eliminated the unknown y(=12x - 30) from the system of equations in the first solution through reasoning.Note: Many chose the following method to determine the position of the hands (again, measuring the rotations in 12th parts of a full circle): At the hand position between 2 and 3 o'clock, the minute hand is between 6 and 7. This means that the hour hand can be at least frac{6}{12} and at most frac{7}{12} away from the 2. Then, between 6 and 7 o'clock, the minute hand is between frac{30}{12} and frac{31}{12} from the 12, so the hour hand must be at least frac{30}{144} and at most frac{31}{144} after the 6. This means the minute hand is also between frac{894}{144} and frac{895}{144} from the 12, or at least frac{894}{12^3} and at most frac{895}{12^3} from the 2. The positions of the hands can be narrowed down further in this manner. For example, frac{1}{12^3} = frac{1}{1728} of a unit (or a part of 5 minutes) is less than 0.2 seconds, so the obtained values already provide a good approximation. This step-by-step approximation method can also be used to determine the exact value, but its thorough exploration would require clarifying significant new concepts, which would not be proportional to the difficulty of the problem.Remark: Many contestants shied away from the common fractions that provide the exact result and instead used decimal fractions to calculate imprecisely."},{"problem":"Find all pairs of strictly positive integers such that a^{b}=b^{left(a^{2}right)}.","solution":"Lemme 4.14.

In fact, ( f''(x) > 0 ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ) because the sum of non-negative terms is positive unless all terms are zero, which is not the case here. Therefore, ( f(x) ) is strictly convex, implying that ( f(x) ) has a unique minimum.2. Uniqueness of Minima:   Since ( f''(x) > 0 ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ), ( f(x) ) is strictly convex. A strictly convex function has at most one critical point, and this critical point is where the minimum occurs. Thus, ( f(x) ) has a unique minimum.3.

We are given the expression (frac{a^b + b^a}{a^a - b^b}) and need to find all positive integers (a) and (b) such that this expression is an integer.2. Clearly, (a neq b) because if (a = b), the denominator (a^a - b^b) would be zero, making the expression undefined.3. Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume (a > b). This implies (a geq 2) since both (a) and (b) are positive integers.4. We need to ensure that (frac{a^b + b^a}{a^a - b^b}) is an integer. This requires that (a^b + b^a) is divisible by (a^a - b^b).5. Since (a > b), we have (a^a > b^b). Therefore, (a^a - b^b) is a positive integer.6. Consider the inequality (a^b + b^a geq a^a - b^b). Since (b leq a - 1), we can write:   [   a^{a-1} + (a-1)^a geq a^a - (a-1)^{a-1}   ]7.

For (a geq 3), the term (left(frac{a-1}{a}right)^a) and (left(frac{a-1}{a}right)^{a-1}) are both less than 1, making the left-hand side less than (a^2), which contradicts the inequality.

If m is odd, then each term is odd and so the total is odd, but (m+1) a-1 is even (note that a > 1). Contradicton, so m is even. We have m b = (m+1) a - 1.

The two factors have difference 2, so their gcd divides 2, but both factors are even, so their gcd is exactly 2.

Understanding Odd Functions: For any odd function g(x), it holds that g(-x) = -g(x). Since f(x) is given as an odd function, we have f(-x) = -f(x).2. Evaluating F(-x): To determine if F(x) is odd, even, or neither, we evaluate F(-x):   [   F(-x) = ((-x)^3 - 2(-x))f(-x) = (-x^3 + 2x)(-f(x)) = (x^3 - 2x)f(x).   ]   This simplifies to F(-x) = F(x), indicating that F(x) is an even function.3. Checking for Odd Function Criteria: To further confirm, we check if F(x) could also be odd by evaluating F(-1) and F(1):   - F(-1) = ((-1)^3 - 2(-1))f(-1) = (-1 + 2)f(-1) = f(-1),   - F(1) = (1^3 - 2 cdot 1)f(1) = (1 - 2)f(1) = -f(1).

Find all integers k for which sqrt{k^2 -pk} is a positive integer.","solution":"1. We start with the equation (sqrt{k^2 - pk} = n), where (n) is a positive integer. Squaring both sides, we get:   [   k^2 - pk = n^2   ]   Rearranging, we have:   [   k^2 - pk - n^2 = 0   ]2. We need (k^2 - pk) to be a perfect square. Let's denote (k^2 - pk = m^2) for some integer (m). Thus, we have:   [   k^2 - pk = m^2   ]   Rearranging, we get:   [   k^2 - pk - m^2 = 0   ]3. We now consider the factorization of the quadratic equation:   [   k^2 - pk - m^2 = 0   ]   This can be factored as:   [   (k - frac{p}{2})^2 - (frac{p^2}{4} + m^2) = 0   ]   However, this approach does not simplify the problem directly. Instead, we will analyze the divisibility properties.4. Claim: (p nmid k). Proof: Suppose (p mid k). Then let (k = pn). Substituting (k = pn) into the equation, we get:   [   (pn)^2 - p(pn) = m^2   ]   Simplifying, we have:   [   p^2n^2 - p^2n = m^2   ]   Dividing both sides by (p^2), we get:   [   n^2 - n = left(frac{m}{p}right)^2   ]   Since (n^2 - n) is an integer, (left(frac{m}{p}right)^2) must also be an integer, implying (p mid m). Let (m = pq). Then:   [   n^2 - n = q^2   ]   However, (n^2 - n = q^2) implies (q^2 < n^2), which is impossible for all (n > 1). Therefore, (p nmid k). (blacksquare)5. Since (gcd(p, k) = 1), we also have (gcd(k - p, k) = 1). Therefore, (k) and (k - p) must both be squares or both be the negations of squares.6. If both (k) and (k - p) are positive squares, let (k = m^2). Then:   [   m^2 - p = x^2   ]   for some integer (x). This can be rewritten as:   [   m^2 - x^2 = p   ]   Factoring, we get:   [   (m - x)(m + x) = p   ]   Since (p) is a prime, the factors must be ((m - x, m + x) = (1, p)) or ((p, 1)). Solving these, we get:   [   m - x = 1 quad text{and} quad m + x = p   ]   Adding these equations, we get:   [   2m = p + 1 implies m = frac{p + 1}{2}   ]   Subtracting these equations, we get:   [   2x = p - 1 implies x = frac{p - 1}{2}   ]   Therefore, (k = m^2 = left(frac{p + 1}{2}right)^2).7. If both (k) and (k - p) are the negations of squares, let (k = -m^2). Then:   [   -m^2 - p = -x^2 implies m^2 = x^2 + p   ]   This implies:   [   m^2 - x^2 = p   ]   which is the same equation as before, leading to the same solutions.8. For (p = 2), the equation becomes:   [   k^2 - 2k = n^2   ]   which does not yield any integer solutions for (k).Conclusion:The desired solutions are:[k = left(frac{p + 1}{2}right)^2 quad text{and} quad k = -left(frac{p - 1}{2}right)^2]for odd primes (p), and no solutions exist for (p = 2).The final answer is ( boxed{ k = left(frac{p + 1}{2}right)^2 quad text{and} quad k = -left(frac{p - 1}{2}right)^2 } ) for odd primes (p), and no solutions exist for (p = 2)."},{"problem":"4.

Definition of Vector Coordinates:  Let overrightarrow{i} and overrightarrow{j} be unit vectors on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. This means |overrightarrow{i}| = |overrightarrow{j}| = 1. By definition, overrightarrow{a} = x_1overrightarrow{i} + y_1overrightarrow{j} and overrightarrow{b} = x_2overrightarrow{i} + y_2overrightarrow{j}.2. Definition of Vector Dot Product and Commutative Property:  The dot product overrightarrow{i} cdot overrightarrow{j} = |overrightarrow{i}||overrightarrow{j}|cos(overrightarrow{i}, overrightarrow{j}) = 0 because the angle between overrightarrow{i} and overrightarrow{j} is 90^circ, and cos(90^circ) = 0. This step also implicitly uses the commutative property of the dot product since overrightarrow{i} cdot overrightarrow{j} = overrightarrow{j} cdot overrightarrow{i}.3. Associative Property of Vector Dot Product with Scalar Multiplication and Distributive Property:  Expanding the dot product overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} using the distributive property, we have:[begin{align*}overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} &= (x_1overrightarrow{i} + y_1overrightarrow{j}) cdot (x_2overrightarrow{i} + y_2overrightarrow{j}) &= x_1x_2(overrightarrow{i} cdot overrightarrow{i}) + x_1y_2(overrightarrow{i} cdot overrightarrow{j}) + y_1x_2(overrightarrow{j} cdot overrightarrow{i}) + y_1y_2(overrightarrow{j} cdot overrightarrow{j}) &= x_1x_2 + y_1y_2.end{align*}]This step uses the associative property of vector dot product with scalar multiplication (e.g., x_1x_2(overrightarrow{i} cdot overrightarrow{i})) and the distributive property of vector dot product with addition.In this derivation, we utilized:- The definition of vector coordinates (①),- The definition of vector dot product (②),- The commutative property of vector dot product (③),- The associative property of vector dot product with scalar multiplication (④),- The distributive property of vector dot product with addition (⑤).Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"58.

The coefficient of ( x^{2023} ) in ( P(x) + P(1-x) ) is ( a_{2023} + (-1)^{2023} a_{2023} = 2a_{2023} ).

If we can find a path of adjacent squares from 1 to 64 with at most 6 squares in between, then the difference between the numbers on these squares must be at least 9.   - To see why, note that if there are 6 squares between 1 and 64, then the sequence of numbers could be something like 1, 2, 3, ldots, 7, 64. The difference between 1 and 64 is 63, and if we distribute this difference among 7 steps (including 1 and 64), the average difference per step is frac{63}{7} = 9.   - Therefore, there must be at least one step where the difference is at least 9.2.

To do this, we need to solve the system of equations simultaneously:begin{cases}kx - y = k - 1, ky - x = 2k.end{cases}1.

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate y: (k^2 - 1)x = k^2 - k - 2k, which simplifies to: x = frac{k}{k - 1}. 3. Now substitute the expression for x back into either of the original equations to solve for y. We'll use the first equation: kleft(frac{k}{k - 1}right) - y = k - 1, which simplifies to: y = frac{2k^2 + k - 1}{k^2 - 1}. For the intersection point to be in the second quadrant, both x must be less than 0 (x  0).4. Solve inequalities for k:Since x = frac{k}{k - 1} must be negative, the numerator and denominator must have opposite signs. Since the numerator k is always positive, the denominator must be negative, which means k - 1  1 or when k is between the roots of the numerator. The denominator k^2 - 1 will be positive when k > 1 or k < -1. Because we're only considering the interval (0, 1) based on the x-restriction, we focus on when the numerator is positive within this interval.5. To find the roots of the quadratic equation 2k^2 + k - 1 = 0, apply the quadratic formula: k = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 4 cdot 2}}{4} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{9}}{4} = frac{-1 pm 3}{4}. We have two roots k = frac{1}{2} and k = -1. Since k = -1 is outside our interval of interest, we consider k = frac{1}{2}. 6. For y to be positive, k must be between 0 and frac{1}{2}.

Initialization and Base Case:   - We start by placing (1) in set (A). This is given by condition (i).   - Next, we need to ensure that no two distinct members of (A) or (B) have a sum of the form (2^k + 2) for (k = 0, 1, 2, ldots).2. Constructing the Sets:   - Place (2) and (3) in set (B) because (1 + 2 = 3) and (1 + 3 = 4) are not of the form (2^k + 2).   - Place (4) in set (A) because (4) does not form a sum (2^k + 2) with (1).3. Inductive Step:   - Assume that up to (n-1), we have successfully partitioned the numbers into sets (A) and (B) such that the conditions are satisfied.   - Consider the number (n). We need to determine whether (n) should be placed in (A) or (B).4. Prohibition Check:   - Suppose (A) and (B) contain numbers (a) and (b) respectively such that (n + a) and (n + b) are prohibited sums.   - Without loss of generality, assume (a > b). Then (n + a = 2^k + 2) for some (k).   - Since (a < n), we have (n geq 2^{k-1} + 2).   - Similarly, (n + b = 2^m + 2) for some (m < k). This implies (m leq k-1).5. Contradiction and Placement:   - Given (n geq 2^{k-1} + 2) and (b > 0), it leads to a contradiction if both (n + a) and (n + b) are prohibited.   - Therefore, we can always place (n) in one of the sets (A) or (B) without violating the conditions.6. Uniqueness:   - To ensure uniqueness, consider the smallest number larger than (n) of the form (2^k + 2).   - If (n geq 2^{k-1} + 2), then (2^k + 2 - n < n) has already been placed.   - Thus, (n) must be placed in the opposite set of (2^k + 2 - n).7. Determining the Subsets for 1987, 1988, and 1989:   - Find the smallest (2^k + 2) larger than 1987, 1988, and 1989. This is (2048 + 2 = 2050).   - Calculate the opposites:     - For 1987: (2050 - 1987 = 63)     - For 1988: (2050 - 1988 = 62)     - For 1989: (2050 - 1989 = 61)   - Determine the subsets of 63, 62, and 61:     - 63 is in (B) (since 64 is in (A))     - 62 is in (A)     - 61 is in (B)8.

At most how many k-element subsets can we select from {1,2,dots,n} such that for any two selected subsets, one of the subsets consists of the k smallest elements of their union?","solution":"1. Initial Observation:   We start by noting that the set { { 1,2,...,k-1,i} mid i=k,k+1,dotsc ,n} consists of n-k+1 k-element subsets that satisfy the given condition. We need to show that there cannot be more than n-k+1 such subsets.2. Assumption for Contradiction:   Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that we can select t > n-k+1 such subsets. Let these t subsets be S_i = { a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, dotsc, a_{i,k} } for i = 1, 2, dotsc, t, where a_{i,1} < a_{i,2} < cdots < a_{i,k} and sum_{j=1}^{k} a_{p,j} leq sum_{j=1}^{k} a_{q,j} when p < q in { 1, 2, dotsc, t }. This implies that S_p contains the k smallest elements of S_p cup S_q for all p < q in { 1, 2, dotsc, t }.3. Distinctness of Elements:   For any p < q in { 1, 2, dotsc, t }, we have a_{p,k} neq a_{q,k} (otherwise { a_{p,1}, a_{p,2}, dotsc, a_{p,k} } = { a_{q,1}, a_{q,2}, dotsc, a_{q,k} }). Also, we have a_{p,k} leq a_{q,k} (otherwise a_{p,k} is not in the k smallest elements of S_p cup S_q). Therefore, a_{1,k} < a_{2,k} < cdots < a_{t,k}.4. Bounding the Largest Element:   From the above, we get a_{t,k} geq t-1 + a_{1,k}. Combining this with the fact that a_{1,1} < a_{1,2} < cdots < a_{1,k}, we get a_{1,k} geq a_{1,1} + k - 1 geq 1 + k - 1 = k. Thus, a_{t,k} geq t-1 + k > (n-k+1) - 1 + k = n.5. Contradiction:   The inequality a_{t,k} geq n contradicts the fact that a_{t,k} should be an element of the set {1, 2, dotsc, n}. Hence, our assumption that t > n-k+1 is false.Therefore, the maximum number of k-element subsets that can be selected from {1, 2, dotsc, n} such that for any two selected subsets, one of the subsets consists of the k smallest elements of their union, is n-k+1.The final answer is boxed{n-k+1}"},{"problem":"Convert the decimal number 521 into its octal equivalent.","solution":"Step 1: Divide 521 by 8, which gives a quotient of 65 and a remainder of 1.Step 2: Next, divide 65 by 8, resulting in a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 1.Step 3: Then, divide 8 by 8, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 0.Therefore, when converted to octal, 521 is represented as 1011_{(8)}.Hence, the answer is boxed{1011}.To convert the decimal number 521 into an octal number, we use the division-by-8 method, taking remainders at each step to directly calculate the expression and arrive at the conclusion.This problem tests the understanding of division with remainder and the conversion between number systems, specifically from decimal to octal, using the division-by-8 method.

The largest two-digit number is n^{2}-1, in which the sum of the digits is (n-1)+(n-1)=2 n-2. It can be seen from a simple transformation that its value is at most n^{2}-1 (since n^{2}-1-(2 n-2)=n^{2}-2 n+1=(n-1)^{2} geq 0), so it is certainly not a three-digit number.The number of points that are on or above the line y=n-x is 1+2+ldots+(n-2)+(n-1), and the number of other points is (n-1)+(n-2)+ldots+2+1. Therefore, exactly half of the points meet the condition.

Many calculated the number of two-digit numbers this way: The smallest two-digit number is n, and the largest is n^{2}-1. The number of two-digit numbers is thus left(n^{2}-1right)-n+1=n^{2}-n.2. The fact that exactly half of the two-digit numbers are good can also be justified this way: The figures are symmetric about the point Pleft(frac{n}{2} ; frac{n-1}{2}right), and the n(n-1) two-digit numbers can be paired according to the symmetry such that one member of each pair is two-digit, and the other is not.3.

Two ants are initially at the same point X in the plane. In the n-th minute (n = 1,2,...) each of them chooses whether to walk due north, east, south or west and then walks the distance of q^n metres. After a whole number of minutes, they are at the same point in the plane (not necessarily X), but have not taken exactly the same route within that time. Determine all possible values of q.Proposed by Jeremy King, UK","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Assumptions:   Let ( q ) be a positive rational number. Two ants start at the same point ( X ) in the plane. In the ( n )-th minute (( n = 1, 2, ldots )), each ant chooses to walk due north, east, south, or west, covering a distance of ( q^n ) meters. After a certain number of minutes, they meet at the same point in the plane but have not taken exactly the same route.2. Representation in the Complex Plane:   Consider the ants' movements in the complex plane. Let the ( i )-th move of ant 1 be denoted by ( varepsilon_i ) and the ( i )-th move of ant 2 be denoted by ( varepsilon'_i ). Clearly, ( varepsilon_i, varepsilon'_i in {pm 1, pm i} ).3. Equating the Paths:   If the ants meet at the ( n )-th minute, we have:   [   sum_{i=1}^n varepsilon_i q^i = sum_{i=1}^n varepsilon_i' q^i   ]   Dividing both sides by ( q ), we get:   [   sum_{i=1}^n varepsilon_i q^{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^n varepsilon_i' q^{i-1}   ]   Rearranging, we obtain:   [   sum_{i=1}^n (varepsilon_i - varepsilon_i') q^{i-1} = 0   ]4. Conjugation and Coefficients:   Conjugating the equation, we note that for every ( varepsilon_i ), ( 1 ) and ( -1 ) remain unchanged, while ( i mapsto -i ) and ( -i mapsto i ). Adding the conjugated equation to the original, we find that every coefficient of ( q^k ) is either ( 0, pm 2 ), or ( pm 4 ).5. Application of the Rational Root Theorem:   Since ( q ) is a positive rational number, by the Rational Root Theorem, the possible values of ( q ) are ( {1, 2, 2^{-1}} ).6. Verification of ( q = 1 ):   Clearly, ( q = 1 ) works because the ants can take different paths and still meet at the same point after any number of minutes.7. Verification of ( q = 2 ):   For ( q = 2 ), consider the left-right moves as ( i ) moves and the up-down moves as ( j ) moves. Since their paths are not exactly the same, at least one of the ( i ) or ( j ) moves must be different for the two ants. Suppose the ( i ) moves are different. We must then have:   [   pm 2^{x_1} pm cdots pm 2^{x_r} = pm 2^{y_1} pm cdots pm 2^{y_s}   ]   for some ( r, s ) with ( {x_i} ne {y_i} ) and ( x_1 < cdots < x_r ) and ( y_1 < cdots < y_s ). Taking the positive terms on one side and the negative on the other, we get a contradiction as two different binary numbers cannot be equal.8. Verification of ( q = 2^{-1} ):   For ( q = 2^{-1} ), we move in the reverse direction, i.e., start at the endpoint and move towards the starting point. This case reduces to the case ( q = 2 ), which we have shown is not possible.Therefore, the only possible value for ( q ) is ( 1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ q = 1 } )."},{"problem":"9.

Proof of the Claim. Apply induction on k. For k=1 the claim is trivial, leftlfloorfrac{b_{1}}{1}rightrfloor geqslant 1. Suppose the Claim holds true for some positive integer k, and consider k+1.  If there exists an index j such that 2^{k}<j leqslant 2^{k+1} and b_{j} geqslant j then   sum_{i=1}^{2^{k+1}}leftlfloorfrac{b_{i}}{i}rightrfloor geqslant sum_{i=1}^{2^{k}}leftlfloorfrac{b_{i}}{i}rightrfloor+leftlfloorfrac{b_{j}}{j}rightrfloor geqslant(k+1)+1   by the induction hypothesis, so the Claim is satisfied. Otherwise we have b_{j}<j leqslant 2^{k+1} for every 2^{k}<j leqslant 2^{k+1}. Among the 2^{k+1} distinct numbers b_{1}, ldots, b_{2^{k+1}} there is some b_{m} which is at least 2^{k+1}; that number must be among b_{1} ldots, b_{2^{k}}. Hence, 1 leqslant m leqslant 2^{k} and b_{m} geqslant 2^{k+1}.  We will apply the induction hypothesis to the numbers   c_{1}=b_{1}, ldots, c_{m-1}=b_{m-1}, quad c_{m}=b_{2^{k}+1}, quad c_{m+1}=b_{m+1}, ldots, c_{2^{k}}=b_{2^{k}}   so take the first 2^{k} numbers but replace b_{m} with b_{2^{k}+1}.

On the other hand, since b is bounded by 5 < b < 12, the greatest value of b is slightly less than 12. Hence, the smallest value for 2a - b occurs when 2a is minimal, and b is maximal. Approximating these values, we get a little more than 2 minus a little less than 12, which is a little more than -10. Therefore, the lowest value for 2a - b is slightly greater than -10.Next, we look for the highest possible value for 2a - b. With 1 < a < 5, the greatest value of a is slightly less than 5, and consequently, the greatest value of 2a is slightly less than 10. Also, considering 5 < b < 12, the smallest value of b is slightly more than 5. The highest value for 2a - b is achieved when 2a is maximal, and b is minimal. Approximating these, we get slightly less than 10 minus slightly more than 5, which results in a value slightly less than 5.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180^circ, we have:[x + 2x + 3x = 180^circ][6x = 180^circ][x = 30^circ]Thus, the largest angle is 3x = 90^circ. This confirms that the triangle is a right triangle. So, statement ① is correct.② If an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the adjacent interior angle, it implies that the interior angle is 90^circ because an exterior angle and its adjacent interior angle are supplementary, and they sum up to 180^circ. If they are equal, each must be 90^circ. Therefore, statement ② is correct.③ The intersection point of the three altitudes of a triangle coinciding with one of the vertices of the triangle indicates that it is a right triangle. This is because only in a right triangle does the altitude from the right angle vertex to the hypotenuse (which is also a side of the triangle) coincide with the vertex itself. Hence, statement ③ is correct.④ If angle A=angle B=frac{1}{2}angle C, then we can express this as:[angle A + angle B + angle C = 180^circ]Substituting angle A and angle B with frac{1}{2}angle C gives:[frac{1}{2}angle C + frac{1}{2}angle C + angle C = 180^circ][2angle C = 180^circ][angle C = 90^circ]This shows that triangle ABC is a right triangle, making statement ④ correct.⑤ If angle A + angle B = angle C, then considering the sum of angles in a triangle, we have:[angle A + angle B + angle C = 180^circ]Given angle A + angle B = angle C, we substitute to get:[2angle C = 180^circ][angle C = 90^circ]This confirms that the triangle is a right triangle, making statement ⑤ correct.Since all statements from ① to ⑤ are correct, the number of correct statements is 5.Therefore, the answer is: boxed{D}."},{"problem":"If a^2-2a=1, beta^2-2beta-1=0 and a neq beta, then a+beta= ?","solution":"Given a^2-2a=1, beta^2-2beta-1=0 and a neq beta,Therefore, a and beta are the two roots of the equation x^2-2x-1=0,Thus, a+beta=2.Hence, the answer is boxed{2}."},{"problem":"If the ratio of the degrees of the three interior angles of a triangle is 1:2:3, and the shortest side is 5 cm, then the length of the longest side is.","solution":"Since the ratio of the degrees of the three interior angles of a triangle is 1:2:3,  the degrees of the three angles are respectively 30°, 60°, and 90°.

We know that f'(x) has a unique zero and is an even function. This leads us to several conclusions step by step:1. Since f'(x) is even and has a unique zero, we must have f'(0)=0.

It is a good fact to know that every positive integer N gives the same remainder when divided by 9 as the sum of its digits.

If the merchant paid x coins at 2 crowns each, y coins at 3 crowns each, and z ducats (i.e., z times 5 crowns), we get the system: 2 x+3 y+5 z=50, x in[0 ; 20], y in[0 ; 15], z in[0 ; 3].a) When z=0, we get the equation 2 x+3 y=50, which has suitable solutions under the condition for y=4,6,8,10,12,14 - a total of 6 solutions.b) When z=1, we get the equation 2 x+3 y=45, which has suitable solutions under the condition for x=0,3,6,9,12,15,18 - a total of 7 solutions.When z=2, there are 7 solutions, and when z=3, there are 6 solutions. These two cases could be analyzed similarly to the previous one. However, this is not necessary, using the fact that the amount to be paid is exactly half of all the merchant's money.

What is the maximum possible value of b^2?","solution":"1. We are given that (a + b) is a root of the quadratic equation (x^2 + ax + b = 0). Therefore, we can substitute (x = a + b) into the equation:   [   (a + b)^2 + a(a + b) + b = 0   ]   Expanding and simplifying, we get:   [   a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + a^2 + ab + b = 0   ]   [   2a^2 + 3ab + b^2 + b = 0   ]2. This is a quadratic equation in terms of (a). For this equation to have integer solutions, its discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant (Delta) of the quadratic equation (2a^2 + 3ab + b^2 + b = 0) is given by:   [   Delta = (3b)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot (b^2 + b)   ]   [   Delta = 9b^2 - 8(b^2 + b)   ]   [   Delta = 9b^2 - 8b^2 - 8b   ]   [   Delta = b^2 - 8b   ]3. For the discriminant to be a perfect square, we set:   [   b^2 - 8b = k^2   ]   for some nonnegative integer (k). Rearranging, we get:   [   (b - 4)^2 - k^2 = 16   ]   This can be factored as:   [   (b - 4 - k)(b - 4 + k) = 16   ]4. We now solve for (b) and (k) by considering the factor pairs of 16:   [   begin{cases}   b - 4 - k = -16    b - 4 + k = -1   end{cases}   ]   [   begin{cases}   b - 4 - k = -8    b - 4 + k = -2   end{cases}   ]   [   begin{cases}   b - 4 - k = -4    b - 4 + k = -4   end{cases}   ]   [   begin{cases}   b - 4 - k = 1    b - 4 + k = 16   end{cases}   ]   [   begin{cases}   b - 4 - k = 2    b - 4 + k = 8   end{cases}   ]   [   begin{cases}   b - 4 - k = 4    b - 4 + k = 4   end{cases}   ]5.

This is because adding the same positive number z to both x and y maintains the inequality.- Similarly, because y > z, it implies x + y > x + z. Adding x to both y and z maintains the inequality due to the transitivity of inequality.- Combining these, we have x + y > x + z > y + z.- Given x, y, z are positive integers and x > y > z, we can deduce the relationship between the fractions A = frac{x}{y+z}, B = frac{y}{x+z}, and C = frac{z}{x+y}. Since the denominators of A, B, and C follow the inequality x + y > x + z > y + z, and the numerators are respectively x, y, and z (with x > y > z), it follows that A > B > C.- Therefore, the relationship between A, B, and C is boxed{A > B > C}.Part (2):Given x = y = 1, we substitute these values into A, B, and C:- For A, we have A = frac{1}{1+z}.- For B, similarly, B = frac{1}{1+z}.- For C, C = frac{z}{1+1} = frac{z}{2}.Given z is a real root of the equation m^2 - 2023m + 1 = 0, we can express this as z^2 - 2023z + 1 = 0.

Therefore, we will check the product-to-sum identities once more and also the sum-to-product identities this time:begin{align*}sin 6^circ sin 42^circ sin 66^circ sin 78^circ &= sin 6^circ sin 78^circ sin 42^circ sin 66^circ &= (sin 6^circ sin 78^circ) (sin 42^circ sin 66^circ) &= frac{1}{2}[cos(72^circ) - cos(84^circ)] frac{1}{2}[cos(24^circ) - cos(108^circ)] &= frac{1}{4}[cos(72^circ)cos(24^circ) - cos(72^circ)cos(108^circ) & quad - cos(84^circ)cos(24^circ) + cos(84^circ)cos(108^circ)] &= frac{1}{4}[cos(72^circ)cos(24^circ) + cos(72^circ)(-cos(72^circ)) & quad - cos(84^circ)cos(24^circ) - cos(84^circ)(-cos(72^circ))] &= frac{1}{4}[cos(72^circ)cos(24^circ) - (cos(72^circ))^2 - cos(84^circ)cos(24^circ) + cos(84^circ)cos(72^circ)] &= frac{1}{4}[cos(72^circ)(cos(24^circ) - cos(72^circ)) - cos(84^circ)(cos(24^circ) - cos(72^circ))] &= frac{1}{4}[(cos(72^circ) - cos(84^circ))(cos(24^circ) - cos(72^circ))].end{align*}Finally, using the double and triple angle formulas, we obtain:begin{align*}sin 6^circ sin 42^circ sin 66^circ sin 78^circ &= frac{1}{4}[sin 12^circsin 48^circ] &= frac{1}{8}[cos(36^circ) - cos(60^circ)] &= frac{1}{8}[frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{4} - frac{1}{2}] &= frac{1}{8}[frac{sqrt{5} + 1 - 2}{4}] &= frac{1}{32}[sqrt{5} - 1].end{align*}So the final simplified form of the given product is:boxed{frac{1}{32}[sqrt{5} - 1]}(2) Since alpha is an angle in the second quadrant and sin alpha = frac{sqrt{15}}{4}, we find the corresponding cos alpha:begin{align*}sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha &= 1 left(frac{sqrt{15}}{4}right)^2 + cos^2 alpha &= 1 frac{15}{16} + cos^2 alpha &= 1 cos^2 alpha &= frac{1}{16} cos alpha &= pm frac{1}{4}.end{align*} Since alpha is in the second quadrant, cos alpha must be negative:cos alpha = -frac{1}{4}.Now we calculate the expression:begin{align*}frac{sin(alpha + frac{pi}{4})}{sin 2alpha + cos 2alpha + 1} &= frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(sin alpha + cos alpha)}{2sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha + 1} &= frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}left(frac{sqrt{15}}{4} - frac{1}{4}right)}{2left(frac{sqrt{15}}{4}right)left(-frac{1}{4}right) - frac{15}{16} + frac{1}{16} + 1} &= frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}left(frac{sqrt{15} - 1}{4}right)}{-frac{sqrt{15}}{8} - frac{14}{16} + frac{16}{16}} &= frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}left(frac{sqrt{15} - 1}{4}right)}{-frac{sqrt{15}}{8} + frac{2}{16}} &= frac{sqrt{2}(sqrt{15} - 1)}{-sqrt{15} + 1}.end{align*}Multiplying by the conjugate, we simplify further:begin{align*}frac{sqrt{2}(sqrt{15} - 1)}{-sqrt{15} + 1} cdot frac{-sqrt{15} - 1}{-sqrt{15} - 1} &= frac{sqrt{2}((sqrt{15})^2 - 1)}{(sqrt{15} + 1)(-sqrt{15} + 1)} &=frac{sqrt{2}(15 - 1)}{-15 + 1} &=frac{sqrt{2}(14)}{-14} &= -sqrt{2}.end{align*}Therefore, the value of the given expression is:boxed{-sqrt{2}}."},{"problem":"The remainder of 53^{10} divided by 8 is ______.","solution":"By expressing 53^{10} as (56-3)^{10}, we can expand it using the binomial theorem as follows: C_{10}^{0} cdot 56^{10} - C_{10}^{1} cdot 56^{9} cdot 3 + ldots + C_{10}^{10} cdot 3^{10}.The last term is 3^{10}, and all other terms contain the factor 8.Since 3^{10} = 9^{5} = (8+1)^{5} = C_{5}^{0} cdot 8^{5} + C_{5}^{1} cdot 8^{4} + ldots + C_{5}^{5},the last term is 1, and all other terms contain the factor 8.Therefore, the remainder of 53^{10} divided by 8 is 1.Hence, the answer is boxed{1}.By transforming 53^{10} = (56-3)^{10} into a binomial theorem problem, we can easily reach the conclusion.This question mainly tests the application of the binomial theorem and the computational ability of students, and it is considered a basic question."},{"problem":"Test mathbf{A} Find the smallest positive integer n (where n>1) such that the average of the squares of the first n natural numbers is a perfect square.","solution":"Let[begin{aligned}frac{1^{2}+2^{2}+cdots+n^{2}}{n} & =m^{2}(m in mathbf{N}) Rightarrow frac{1}{6}(n+1)(2 n+1) & =m^{2} Rightarrow(n+1)(2 n+1)=6 m^{2} .end{aligned}]Since (6 m^{2}) is even and (2 n+1) is odd, (n+1) must be even, hence (n) is odd.We classify (n) modulo 6, setting (n=6 p pm 1) or (n=6 p+3).(1) When (n=6 p+3)[6 m^{2}=(6 p+4)(12 p+7)=72 p^{2}+90 p+28,]Since (6 mid 72), (6 mid 90), and (6 times 28), there is no solution in this case.(2) When (n=6 p-1)[6 m^{2}=6 p(12 p-1) .]Since ((p, 12 p-1)=1), for the equation to hold, both (p) and (12 p-1) must be perfect squares.

Although other analytical methods can be used to find (n), they do not make finding the next (n) much easier. Another approach is:From (4 u^{2}-3 v^{2}=1), we know (v) is odd. Let (v=2 q+1), then the equation becomes (u^{2}-3 q(q+1)-1=0).Since (q(q+1)) is even, (u) must be odd. Let (u=2 j+1), then the equation becomes (4 j(j+1)=3 q(q+1)). The left side is a multiple of 8. To make the right side a multiple of 8 and find the smallest (n), we can set (q+1=8), giving (q=7), (j=6), and (j+1=7). Thus, (u=2 j+1=13) and (v=2 q+1=15), so (n=337)."},{"problem":"Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y=e^{x} that passes through the origin.","solution":"We first find the derivative of the given curve, which is y'=e^{x}.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to count the number of non-decreasing tuples of integers ((a_1, a_2, dots, a_{16})) such that (0 leq a_i leq 16) for all (i), and the sum of all (a_i) is even.2. Reformulating the Problem:   We can visualize the problem using lattice paths. Mark a dot at points ((i, a_i)) for each (1 leq i leq 16). If (a_{16} < 16), draw a vertical line from ((16, a_{16})) to ((16, 16)). This gives us an up-and-right lattice path from ((0,0)) to ((16,16)). The height of column (i) under this path is (a_i), so the sum of (a_i) is the area under the path.3. Analyzing the Parity of the Sum:   Consider the first (odd, odd) point in the path. To reach this point, the path must have either:   - (1) a vertical segment followed by a horizontal segment, or   - (2) a horizontal segment followed by a vertical segment.      Flipping between (1) and (2) changes the area under the path by exactly 1. Therefore, one configuration has an even area, and the other has an odd area. This bijection shows that exactly half of the paths with at least one (odd, odd) point have an even area.4. Paths with No (Odd, Odd) Points:   If there is no (odd, odd) point, every column must have an even height. If (i) is odd, then (a_i) must be even. If (i) is even, even columns cannot have odd height, as this would create an (odd, odd) point in the next column. Thus, every path with no (odd, odd) point has an even area.5. Counting the Paths:   Let (A) be the number of paths with no (odd, odd) point. The total number of paths from ((0,0)) to ((16,16)) is (binom{32}{16}). The number of paths with no (odd, odd) point is (binom{16}{8}).6.

Definition and Initial Assumption:   We start by defining a perfect number ( n ) as a number for which the sum of its positive divisors (including ( 1 ) and ( n )) equals ( 2n ). We need to determine all perfect numbers ( n ) such that both ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) are prime numbers.2. Verification for ( n = 6 ):   The first perfect number is ( n = 6 ). We check if ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) are prime:   [   n-1 = 5 quad text{(prime)}, quad n+1 = 7 quad text{(prime)}   ]   Thus, ( n = 6 ) satisfies the conditions.3. Assumption for ( n > 6 ):   Assume ( n > 6 ) and suppose ( n ) is a perfect number such that ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) are prime.4. Divisibility by 3:   Since ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) are prime, they cannot be multiples of 3. Therefore, ( n ) must be a multiple of 3. This is because if ( n ) were not a multiple of 3, one of ( n-1 ), ( n ), or ( n+1 ) would be a multiple of 3, contradicting the primality of ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ).5. Evenness of ( n ):   Since ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) are both odd (primes greater than 2), ( n ) must be even. Therefore, ( n ) is a multiple of 6 (since it is both even and a multiple of 3).6. Sum of Divisors:   For ( n ) to be perfect, the sum of its divisors must equal ( 2n ).

Analyzing the conditions: The condition (29 mid y^2 - x^p - 26) can be rewritten as:   [   y^2 equiv x^p + 26 pmod{29}   ]   This means that for each ( y ), ( y^2 - 26 ) must be a ( p )-th power residue modulo 29.3. Using properties of prime numbers: Since 29 is a prime number, we can use properties of residues and non-residues. Specifically, if ( p nmid 28 ) (since ( 28 = 29 - 1 )), then for each ( a in mathbb{Z}_{29} ), the equation ( x^p equiv a pmod{29} ) has a unique solution in ( mathbb{Z}_{29} ).

Using the Legendre symbol:   [   left( frac{-26}{29} right) = left( frac{3}{29} right) = left( frac{29}{3} right) = -1   ]   Since (left( frac{3}{29} right) = -1), (-26) is not a quadratic residue modulo 29. This means there are no solutions for ( y^2 equiv -26 pmod{29} ), and thus the number of pairs ((x, y)) is not 29.5. Checking ( p = 7 ): For ( p = 7 ), we need to check the set of all elements of ( mathbb{Z}_{29} ) expressible as ( x^7 pmod{29} ).

The equations transform toy^{3}+z^{3}=134 quad text { and } quad y^{2} z+y z^{2}=126Combining these two equations in a handy way, we find(y+z)^{3}=left(y^{3}+z^{3}right)+3left(y^{2} z+y z^{2}right)=134+3 cdot 126=512=8^{3} .This immediately implies that y+z=8.Rewrite the first equation as follows: (y+z) y z=y^{2} z+y z^{2}=126. Since y+z=8, we see that y z=frac{126}{8}=frac{63}{4}.From y+z=8 and y z=frac{63}{4}, we can determine y and z by solving a quadratic equation: y and z are precisely the roots of the equation x^{2}-8 x+frac{63}{4}=0. The two solutions are frac{8 pm sqrt{64-4 cdot frac{63}{4}}}{2}, that is frac{9}{2} and frac{7}{2}.Since a>b, also y>z holds. Hence y=frac{9}{2} and z=frac{7}{2}.

Verification:   - Suppose ( n < a + b - 1 ).   - Considering all the moves in total, we have ( ax = by ) for some ( x, y in mathbb{Z} ), implying that we move down at least ( a ) times and similarly move up at least ( b ) times.   - Since ( gcd(a, b) = 1 ), ( b cdot k ) (for ( k in {0, 1, dots, a-1} )) forms a complete residue system modulo ( a ), so we would necessarily have the height be ( b - 1 pmod{a} ) at some point.   - But since ( n < a + b - 1 ), we have no legal move at this point, which is a contradiction.4.

(a) In Figure 1, frac{A E}{A C}=frac{D E}{B C}.Since E C=3 and A E=x, then A C=A E+E C=3+x.Thus, frac{x}{3+x}=frac{6}{10}.Therefore, 10 x=6(3+x) or 10 x=18+6 x and so 4 x=18 which gives x=frac{9}{2}.(b) Since frac{W M}{M Z}=frac{2}{3}, then W M=2 r and M Z=3 r for some real number r>0.Extend Z W and Y X to meet at point P above W X. (We know that we can do this because W X0.Note that each of W X=3 k and Z Y=4 k is an integer.Since k=Z Y-W X, then k itself is an integer.Since frac{M Z}{W M}=frac{N Y}{X N} and this ratio is an integer, then we can set frac{M Z}{W M}=t for some positive integer t.If W M=p for some real number p>0, then M Z=p t.As in (b), we extend Z W and Y X to meet at P above W XWe have again created a new version of the configuration in Figure 1.Since W X is parallel to Z Y, then triangle P W X and triangle P Z Y are similar, which means that frac{P W}{P Z}=frac{W X}{Z Y}.Using the information determined so far,begin{aligned}frac{P W}{P Z} & =frac{W X}{Z Y} frac{P W}{P W+W+M Z} & =frac{3}{4} frac{P W}{P W+p+p t} & =frac{3}{4} 4 times P W & =3(P W+p(t+1)) 4 times P W & =3 times P W+3 p(t+1) P W & =3 p(t+1)end{aligned}We can also note that since W X is parallel to M N, then triangle P W X and triangle P M N are similar, which means that frac{P W}{P M}=frac{W X}{M N}.Since p neq 0, thenfrac{W X}{M N}=frac{P W}{P W+W M}=frac{3 p(t+1)}{3 p(t+1)+p}=frac{p(3 t+3)}{p(3 t+4)}=frac{3 t+3}{3 t+4}Since W X=3 k, then frac{3 k}{M N}=frac{3 t+3}{3 t+4} and so M N=frac{(3 t+4) 3 k}{3 t+3}=frac{(3 t+4) k}{t+1}.Now M N=frac{(3 t+4) k}{t+1}=frac{3(t+1) k+k}{t+1}=3 k+frac{k}{t+1}.Since M N is an integer and k is an integer, then frac{k}{t+1} is an integer, which means that the integer k is a multiple of the integer t+1, say k=q(t+1) for some positive integer q. We are given that W X+M N+Z Y=2541.Substituting, we obtain successively the equivalent equationsbegin{aligned}3 k+left(3 k+frac{k}{t+1}right)+4 k & =2541 10 k+frac{k}{t+1} & =2541 10 q(t+1)+q & =2541 q(10 t+10+1) & =2541 q(10 t+11) & =2541end{aligned}Now q and t are positive integers.Since t geq 1, then 10 t+11 geq 21 and 10 t+11 has units digit 1 .So q and 10 t+11 form a positive integer factor pair of 2541 with each factor having units digit 1. (Since 2541 and 10 t+11 have units digit 1 , then q must also have units digit 1.) Factoring 2541, we obtain2541=3 times 847=3 times 7 times 121=3 times 7 times 11^{2}The positive divisors of 2541 are1,3,7,11,21,33,77,121,231,363,847,2541The divisor pairs consisting of two integers each with units digit 1 are2541=1 times 2541=11 times 231=21 times 121Since 10 t+1 geq 21, then we can have- q=1 and 10 t+11=2541, which gives t=253- q=11 and 10 t+11=231, which gives t=22- q=21 and 10 t+11=121, which gives t=11- q=121 and 10 t+11=21, which gives t=1We are asked for the possible lengths ofM N=3 k+frac{k}{t+1}=3 q(t+1)+q=q(3 t+3+1)=q(3 t+4)Using the values of q and t above, we obtainbegin{aligned}text { - } q=1 text { and } t=253: M N=763 text { - } q=11 text { and } t=22: M N=770 text { - } q=21 text { and } t=11: M N=777 text { - } q=121 text { and } t=1: M N=847end{aligned}Therefore, the possible lengths for M N are 763,770,777,847,It is indeed possible to construct a trapezoid in each of these cases.

Assume that only k<2 n cells are marked, and there exists a partition P satisfying the requirement. It suffices to show there exists another desirable partition distinct from P. Let d be the main diagonal of the board. Construct the following graph with edges of two colours. Its vertices are the cells of the board. Connect two vertices with a red edge if they belong to the same domino of P. Connect two vertices with a blue edge if their reflections in d are connected by a red edge. It is possible that two vertices are connected by edges of both colours. Clearly, each vertex has both red and blue degrees equal to 1. Thus the graph splits into cycles where the colours of edges in each cycle alternate (a cycle may have length 2). Consider any cell c lying on the diagonal d. Its two edges are symmetrical with respect to d. Thus they connect c to different cells. This shows c belongs to a cycle C(c) of length at least 4. Consider a part of this cycle c_{0}, c_{1}, ldots, c_{m} where c_{0}=c and m is the least positive integer such that c_{m} lies on d. Clearly, c_{m} is distinct from c. From the construction, the path symmetrical to this with respect to d also lies in the graph, and so these paths together form C(c). Hence, C(c) contains exactly two cells from d. Then all 2 n cells in d belong to n cycles C_{1}, C_{2}, ldots, C_{n}, each has length at least 4. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists a cycle C_{i} containing at most one of the k marked cells. We modify P as follows. We remove all dominoes containing the vertices of C_{i}, which correspond to the red edges of C_{i}. Then we put the dominoes corresponding to the blue edges of C_{i}. Since C_{i} has at least 4 vertices, the resultant partition P^{prime} is different from P. Clearly, no domino in P^{prime} contains two marked cells as C_{i} contains at most one marked cell.

Start with the point ((x, y)) on the parabola (C), where (y = x^2 - x + k).2. The image of ((x, y)) under the mapping is ((ap + bq, cp + dq)). Substituting (p = x) and (q = y), we get:   [   (ap + bq, cp + dq) = (ax + b(x^2 - x + k), cx + d(x^2 - x + k))   ]3. For the image to lie on the same parabola (C), we must have:   [   cp + dq = (ap + bq)^2 - (ap + bq) + k   ]   Substituting (p = x) and (q = x^2 - x + k), we get:   [   c x + d (x^2 - x + k) = (a x + b (x^2 - x + k))^2 - (a x + b (x^2 - x + k)) + k   ]4.

For the tangents to be perpendicular at the origin, their slopes must multiply to (-1):   [   (2a - 1)(-2a - 1) = -1   ]   Solving, we get:   [   -4a^2 - 2a + 2a + 1 = -1 implies -4a^2 + 1 = -1 implies -4a^2 = -2 implies a^2 = frac{1}{2}   ]   Thus:   [   a = pm frac{1}{sqrt{2}}   ]4.

When Amayak places the black disc over two adjacent digits, there are ( N-1 ) possible positions for the disc.

What is the probability of exactly 50 hits in the first 100 trials? Solution","solution":": 1/99. We start by exploring n trials for small n. For n = 2, we have p(1 hit) = 1. For n = 3, we have p(1 hit) = p(2 hits) = 1/2. For n = 4, we have p(HMHH) = (1/2)(2/3), p(HMHM) = (1/2)(1/3), p(HMMH) = (1/2) (1/3), p(HMMM) = (1/2)(2/3), so p(1 hit) = 1/3, p(2 hits) = 1/3, p(3 hits) = 1/3. For n = 5, we have p(1 hit) = (1/3)(3/4) = 1/4, and p(2 hits) = (1/3)(1/4) + (1/3)(2/4) = 1/4. Similarly, p(3 hits) = (1/3)(2/4) + (1/3)(1/4) = 1/4 and hence p(4 hits) = 1/4. Thus we are led to conjecture that the probability of k hits in n trials is 1/(n-1) for k = 1, 2, ... , n-1. We use induction on n. We have just shown that it is true for n = 2, 3, 4, 5. Suppose it is true for n-1. Then for n, we have p(1 hit) = (1/(n-2) )( (n- 2)/(n-1) ) = 1/(n-1). For k > 1, we have p(k hits) = (1/(n-2) ) ( (n-1-k)/(n-1) + (k-1)/(n-1) ) = 1/(n-1).

Why or why not? If it exists, give an example.b) What is the smallest special number with four digits?c) What is the largest special number?d) What is the largest special number that has all distinct digits?","solution":"Solutiona) They exist. For example, the number 51112 is special, as zero does not appear among its digits, and, moreover, the double of its first digit is 2 times 5=10, equal to the sum of its digits, given by 5+1+1+1+2=10.b) The largest special number is 9111111111. No other number larger than it can be special, let's see why. If we have another special number also with 10 digits (9111111111 has 10 digits) larger than 9111111111, this number would have some different digit. The first digit 9 cannot be, because 9 is the largest digit. If any other is different, the sum of its digits would be greater than 18. Therefore, there is no 10-digit number larger than 9111111111.If a number has more than 10 digits, all different from zero, then the sum of its digits is greater than 10. Therefore, the sum of its digits cannot be double any digit. Thus, we conclude that 9111111111 is the largest special number.c) The smallest special number of four digits is 3111. No other number ABCD of four digits, smaller than it, could be special, because the sum of its last digits, A+B+C+D would be greater than or equal to 4. Therefore, the first digit A is greater than or equal to 2. If we had A=2, then we would have 2+B+C+D=4, and therefore B+C+D=2, which is impossible, as no digit is zero.d) Note that if two numbers have different quantities of digits, then the larger of them is always the one with more digits. Therefore, we will start by looking for the largest possible quantity of digits.Saying that double the first digit is equal to the sum of all the digits is the same as saying that the first digit is equal to the sum of the remaining digits. Since 1+2+3+4=10, no special number with all distinct digits can have five digits, as the sum of the last four would be greater than 9, the largest possible digit. Therefore, we can only look for special numbers with fewer than five digits.We will choose the first digit as the largest possible. Therefore, it must be 9. The three remaining digits must be distinct and sum to 9. Therefore, the number will be of the form 9BCD, with B+C+D=9. To make B as large as possible, we choose B=6 (if B is larger than this, there is no way to find C and D). Therefore, we will have C+D=3. Choosing C as the largest possible, we will have C=2 and thus D=1.

Applying the Erdos-Mordell Inequality: The Erdos-Mordell inequality states that for any point ( P ) inside or on the boundary of triangle ( ABC ), the following inequality holds:   [   AP + BP + CP ge 2(d_a + d_b + d_c)   ]   where ( d_a ), ( d_b ), and ( d_c ) are the perpendicular distances from ( P ) to the sides ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ) respectively.2. Rewriting the Problem Statement: We need to prove that:   [   max{AP, BP, CP} ge sqrt{d_a^2 + d_b^2 + d_c^2}   ]3. Using the Erdos-Mordell Inequality: From the Erdos-Mordell inequality, we have:   [   AP + BP + CP ge 2(d_a + d_b + d_c)   ]4. Bounding the Sum of Distances: We need to show that:   [   2(d_a + d_b + d_c) ge sqrt{d_a^2 + d_b^2 + d_c^2}   ]5. Analyzing the Maximum Distance: Let ( M = max{AP, BP, CP} ). Since ( AP + BP + CP ge 3M ), we have:   [   3M ge AP + BP + CP ge 2(d_a + d_b + d_c)   ]   Therefore:   [   M ge frac{2}{3}(d_a + d_b + d_c)   ]6. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality: To further bound ( d_a + d_b + d_c ), we apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form:   [   (d_a + d_b + d_c)^2 le 3(d_a^2 + d_b^2 + d_c^2)   ]   Taking the square root of both sides, we get:   [   d_a + d_b + d_c le sqrt{3(d_a^2 + d_b^2 + d_c^2)}   ]7.

(Different ants need not be moving in opposite directions when they collide, since a faster ant may catch up with a slower one that is moving in the same direction.) The ants keep walking indefinitely.Assuming that the total number of collisions is finite, determine the largest possible number of collisions in terms of n.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We have ( n ) ants walking along a line at constant nonzero speeds. They can walk in either direction and change direction upon collision. We need to determine the maximum number of collisions that can occur, assuming the total number of collisions is finite.2. Key Insight:   The order of the ants along the line does not change. Denote by ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n ) the respective speeds of ants ( 1, 2, ldots, n ) in this order. If ( v_{i-1} < v_i > v_{i+1} ) for some ( i in {2, ldots, n-1} ), then ant ( i ) can catch up with ants ( i-1 ) or ( i+1 ) irrespective of their directions of motion, leading to an infinite number of collisions. Hence, for the number of collisions to be finite, the speeds must be ordered such that:   - ( v_1 geq v_2 geq cdots geq v_n ) (all ants are moving in the same direction with non-increasing speeds), or   - ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_{k-1} > v_k leq cdots leq v_n ) for some ( k in {2, ldots, n-1} ).3. Claim:   If ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_m ), then ants ( m-1 ) and ( m ) collide at most ( m-1 ) times.4. Proof of the Claim:   - Base Case: For ( m = 1 ), the statement is trivial as there are no collisions.   - Inductive Step: Assume the statement holds for ( m-1 ). Consider ( m ) ants with ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_m ). Ants ( m-1 ) and ( m ) can only collide if ( v_{m-1} geq v_m ). Between successive collisions with ant ( m ), ant ( m-1 ) must reverse direction by colliding with ant ( m-2 ). By the inductive hypothesis, ants ( m-1 ) and ( m-2 ) collide at most ( m-2 ) times. Therefore, ants ( m ) and ( m-1 ) collide at most ( (m-2) + 1 = m-1 ) times. (blacksquare)5. Case Analysis:   - Case (i): If ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_n ), the total number of collisions is at most:     [     0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + (n-1) = frac{n(n-1)}{2}     ]   - Case (ii): If ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_{k-1} > v_k leq cdots leq v_n ), applying the claim to ants ( 1, 2, ldots, k ) and also to ants ( n, n-1, ldots, k ) by switching their order, the number of collisions is at most:     [     frac{k(k-1)}{2} + frac{(n-k+1)(n-k)}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} - (k-1)(n-k)     ]     which is less than ( frac{n(n-1)}{2} ).6. Constructing an Example:   Place ants at ( x = 1, 2, ldots, n ) with positive initial velocities and speeds ( v_1 = cdots = v_{n-1} = 1 ) and ( v_n = varepsilon ) for some small ( varepsilon ). For ( varepsilon = 0 ), collisions occur such that ants ( m ) and ( m+1 ) collide exactly ( m ) times for ( m = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ).

Then A is divisible by p (see fact 8), which means that in the right product there is a factor a^{k_{j}}+1 that is divisible by p (see fact 9).

Therefore, 2 is divisible by p, hence p=2. Thus, 2 is the only prime divisor of the number a^{gamma}-1, meaning that a^{gamma}-1 is a power of two (see fact 10), i.e., there exists some K such that 2^{K}=a^{gamma}-1=left(a^{gamma-1}+ldots+a+1right)(a-1).

Therefore, any common divisor of the numbers a_{i} and a_{j} is also a divisor of the number2=left(a^{2^{i}}+1right)-left(a^{2^{i}}-1right) .To complete the proof, it remains to note that the numbers a_{i} and a_{j} are odd. The lemma is proved.Multiplying the representations (2) for a^{2^{m_{i}}}-1, we obtain that A is represented as A=2^{N}left(a_{0}right)^{N_{0}} ldotsleft(a_{q}right)^{N_{q}}, where N>N_{0}+ldots+N_{q}. Since each of the numbers a^{k_{j}}+1 gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, then l=N (see (1)). But each of a^{k_{j}}+1 is divisible by one of the numbers a_{i} (indeed, if k_{j}=2^{r} s, where s is odd, then a^{k_{j}}+1 is divisible by a_{r}). Then, since l>N_{0}+ldots+N_{q}, more than N_{i} numbers a^{k_{j}}+1 are divisible by some a_{i}, and therefore, A is divisible by a_{i}^{N_{i}+1}. This contradicts the fact that a_{i} are odd and pairwise coprime."},{"problem":"13.320. Impurities constitute 20 % of the total volume of the solution.

Let the region Pi_{3} be the half-plane (excluding the line P_{1} P_{2}) on the side of the line P_{1} P_{2} that is opposite to triangle P_{1} P_{2} P_{3}.

Considering the parity of the coordinates of the vertices, there are only 4 cases: (odd, even), (even, odd), (odd, odd), (even, even). Thus, among the vertices of the pentagon A B C D E, there must be two vertices with the same parity for both coordinates. Therefore, the midpoint P of the line segment connecting these two vertices is also an integer point. Since P is not in the interior of the convex pentagon A B C D E, P must lie on one of the sides of the pentagon. Without loss of generality, assume P lies on side A B, then P is the midpoint of A B.

Initial Setup and Assumptions:   Let ( n geq 3 ) be an integer and ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) be positive real numbers such that ( m ) is the smallest and ( M ) is the largest of these numbers. We are given that for any distinct integers ( 1 leq i, j, k leq n ), if ( a_i leq a_j leq a_k ), then ( a_i a_k leq a_j^2 ).2. Reordering and Scaling:   Without loss of generality, assume ( a_1 leq a_2 leq cdots leq a_n ). Let ( a_1 = m ) and ( a_n = M ). We need to show that:   [   a_1 a_2 cdots a_n geq m^2 M^{n-2}   ]3. Base Case for Induction:   For ( n = 3 ), we need to show:   [   a_1 a_2 a_3 geq m^2 M   ]   Given ( a_1 leq a_2 leq a_3 ), we have ( a_1 a_3 leq a_2^2 ). Therefore:   [   a_1 a_2 a_3 geq a_1 a_2^2 / a_2 = a_1 a_2 geq m^2 M   ]   This satisfies the base case.4. Inductive Step:   Assume the statement holds for ( n = k ), i.e.,   [   a_1 a_2 cdots a_k geq m^2 M^{k-2}   ]   We need to show it holds for ( n = k+1 ). Consider ( a_1 leq a_2 leq cdots leq a_{k+1} ). By the given condition, for any ( 1 leq i < j < k+1 ), we have ( a_i a_{k+1} leq a_j^2 ). Specifically, ( a_1 a_{k+1} leq a_j^2 ) for ( j = 2, 3, ldots, k ).5. Combining the Inequalities:   Using the inductive hypothesis:   [   a_1 a_2 cdots a_k geq m^2 M^{k-2}   ]   and considering ( a_{k+1} = M ), we get:   [   a_1 a_2 cdots a_k a_{k+1} geq m^2 M^{k-2} M = m^2 M^{k-1}   ]   This completes the inductive step.6. Equality Condition:   Equality holds if and only if ( a_i = a_j ) for all ( i, j ). This implies ( a_1 = a_2 = cdots = a_n = c ) for some positive real number ( c ). In this case:   [   a_1 a_2 cdots a_n = c^n quad text{and} quad m = M = c   ]   Thus:   [   c^n = c^2 c^{n-2} = m^2 M^{n-2}   ]   Hence, equality holds when all ( a_i ) are equal.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ a_1 a_2 cdots a_n geq m^2 M^{n-2} } )"},{"problem":"The focal distance of an ellipse is 8, and the sum of distances from a point on the ellipse to the two foci is 10.

We need to check all divisors of 5: 1 and 5. Therefore, n = 2 or n = 6. For each of them, we find m and k by solving the corresponding system of linear equations. If n = 2, then k = 8 and m = 13. If n = 6, then k = 4 and m = 5. The number of paths connecting cities A and B is n + km. In the first case, n + km = 2 + 8 cdot 13 = 106, and in the second case, -n + km = 6 + 4 cdot 5 = 26.

The smallest excluded element must be at most 6 . If we exclude 2 and 44, then the difference between them is 7.6 and so the other 6 excluded elements are fixed. But if we exclude 3 and 44, for example, then there are several possible choices for the other elements.There are 5 ways of choosing the smallest and largest excluded element to get a difference of 7. 6 between them ( 2 and 44, 3 and 45, 4 and 46, 5 and 47,6 and 48).

It is clear that any two numbers in the triplet are distinct (if p=q, then p^{4}-1 does not divide q). Let p be the smallest of the numbers in the triplet. We know that the number p^{4}-1=(p-1)(p+1)left(p^{2}+1right) is divisible by q r. Note that p-1 is less than any of the prime numbers q and r, and therefore is coprime with them. Furthermore, the number p^{2}+1 cannot be divisible by both q and r, since p^{2}+1 < p, which is only possible if q=p+1. Then one of the numbers p and q is even, and since it is prime, p=2, q=3.

Linear Differential Equations of the First Order and Bernoulli Equations1^{circ}. A linear differential equation of the first order is an equation that is linear in the unknown function and its derivative. It has the formy^{prime}+p(x) cdot y=q(x)An equation of the formy^{prime}+p(x) cdot y=q(x) cdot y^{alpha}is called a Bernoulli equation with exponent alpha. When alpha=0, the Bernoulli equation becomes linear.A linear equation and a Bernoulli equation can be solved using a unified method, specifically by the substitutiony=u cdot v, quad y^{prime}=u^{prime} v+v^{prime} uHere, u and v are two unknown functions that must satisfy the equationu^{prime} v+v^{prime} u+p(x) cdot u v=q(x) cdot u^{alpha} cdot v^{alpha}An additional condition is imposed on the new unknown functions u and v (in addition to the fact that they must satisfy the previous equation):v^{prime} u+p(x) u v=0, quad text { i.e. } quad v^{prime}+p(x) v=0If this equality holds, then the equation automatically impliesu^{prime} v=q(x) cdot u^{alpha} cdot v^{alpha}The previous equation is with separable variables. Solving it and substituting the obtained v into the last equation, we determine the function u. Thus, since y=u v, the general solution of the original equation is found (in explicit form).Note. From the above, it follows that the substitution y=u v reduces a linear equation or a Bernoulli equation to an equivalent system of equations:y^{prime}+p(x) y=q(x) y^{alpha} Leftrightarrowleft{begin{array}{c}v^{prime}+p(x) v=0 u^{prime} cdot v=q(x) u^{alpha} cdot v^{alpha}end{array}right.2^{circ}. A linear equation can also be solved by another method.1) If q(x) equiv 0, then the equation y^{prime}+p(x) cdot y=0 is called a linear homogeneous equation. It is an equation with separable variables and has the general solutiony=C cdot e^{-int p(x) d x}2) The general solution of a non-homogeneous equation (i.e., when q(x) not equiv 0) can be found using the method of variation of the arbitrary constant, which involves seeking it in the formy=C(x) cdot e^{-int p(x) d x}This expression, along with its derivative, is substituted into the original equation, resulting in a new differential equation for the unknown function C(x). Finding this function and substituting it into the last equality, we obtain the solution.Below, we will only use the first method for solving linear equations and Bernoulli equations.## Examples with Solutions"},{"problem":"Regarding the functions f(x) = log_3(-x) and g(x) = 3^{-x}, which of the following statements is correct?

The selling price of type A ice cream is x yuan. When x = 20, the sales volume is 40 boxes.2. For each increase of 1 yuan in x, the sales volume decreases by 2 boxes.3. Therefore, the sales volume of type A ice cream can be expressed as 40 - 2(x - 20) = 80 - 2x boxes.4. The profit per box of type A ice cream is (x - 15) yuan, since the cost is 15 yuan.5. Thus, the total profit from selling type A ice cream is y = (x - 15)(80 - 2x) = -2x^2 + 110x - 1200.6. Given the constraints, 20 leqslant x leqslant 40 and x is an integer.Therefore, the profit obtained from selling type A ice cream is boxed{y = -2x^2 + 110x - 1200} for 20 leqslant x leqslant 40 and x is an integer.# For Type B Ice Cream:1. The selling price of type B ice cream is always 30 yuan.2. The profit per box of type B ice cream is (30 - 15) = 15 yuan.3. The sales volume of type B ice cream is 50 - (80 - 2x) = 2x - 30 boxes.4. Therefore, the total profit from selling type B ice cream is s = 15(2x - 30) = 30x - 450.Thus, the profit obtained from selling type B ice cream is boxed{s = 30x - 450} for 20 leqslant x leqslant 40 and x is an integer. Part 2: Finding the Maximum Total Profit1. The total profit w from selling both types of ice cream is w = y + s = (-2x^2 + 110x - 1200) + (30x - 450).2. Simplifying, we get w = -2x^2 + 140x - 1650.3. The function w(x) = -2x^2 + 140x - 1650 is a quadratic function with the axis of symmetry at x = frac{-b}{2a} = frac{-140}{2(-2)} = 35.4. Since the parabola opens downwards (a = -2 < 0), the maximum value of w occurs at x = 35.5. Substituting x = 35 into the equation for w, we find the maximum value of w = -2(35)^2 + 140(35) - 1650 = 800.Therefore, when x = 35, the total profit w has the maximum value of boxed{800} yuan. Part 3: Determining the Donation Amount per Box of Type B Ice Cream1. Let the actual profit after donation be m = w - (2x - 30)a.2. Substituting the expression for w, we get m = -2x^2 + 140x - 1650 - (2x - 30)a.3. Simplifying, m = -2x^2 + (140 - 2a)x - 1650 + 30a.4. Given that the maximum value of the total profit is 722 yuan, we set m = 722.5. Solving -2(35)^2 + (140 - 2a)(35) - 1650 + 30a = 722 for a, we find a = 2 and a = 78.6. Since 0 < a < 10, the valid solution is a = 2.Therefore, the value of a is boxed{2} yuan per box of type B ice cream sold."},{"problem":"39.

Therefore k leq 7.We prove that for any group of 6 which satisfy the condition 1 ) it is possible to choose a group of k geq 1 every two of which are not friends such that among remaining 6-k a group of three every two of which are friends does not exist.Denote the people by A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots A_{6}. If some of them is friend with the other 5 (wlog suppose this is A_{1} ) it is clear that there are no three among A_{2}, A_{3}, ldots A_{5} every two of which are friends. Therefore the choice of A_{1} solves the problem.Suppose one of then is friend with exactly four others (wlog assume A_{1} is friend with A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4} and A_{5} ) Then the choice of A_{1} and A_{6} solves the problem.Therefore each person has 0,1,2 or 3 friends. It is obviuos that there exists a group of three any two of which are friends (otherwise the problem is trivial). Assume that the group A_{1}, A_{2} and A_{3} has this property. Wlog A_{1} and A_{4} are not friends. Therefore among A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{5} and A_{6} there is a group of three any two of which arefriends. If this is A_{5} and A_{6} together with one of A_{2} or A_{3} then there exists a person who is friend with at least four others, a contradiction. Therefore wlog suppose that this group is A_{2}, A_{3} and A_{5}. Since A_{1} and A_{5} are not friends and since among the others there is a group of three friends we obtain that either A_{2} or A_{3} has at least four friends which is a contradiction.Therefore k=7."},{"problem":"The equation of a line with a slope angle of 135° and a y-intercept of 3 is.","solution":"Since the slope angle of the line is 135°,  the slope of the line is equal to -1.

A public welfare team plans to contact the Winter Olympics Organizing Committee to hold a one-month online commemorative product exhibition and sale, with all profits used for the construction of community sports facilities. According to market research, the daily sales volume y (unit: pieces) of a certain commemorative product is a linear function of the selling price x (unit: yuan/piece), and the higher the price, the lower the sales volume. When the price is equal to or higher than 110 yuan/piece, the sales volume is 0.

Establish the Linear Relationship:   Given that the sales volume y is a linear function of the selling price x and decreases with an increase in price, we can express this relationship as y = kx + b, where k < 0 because the slope is negative (higher price, lower sales).2. Substitute Known Values:   When x = 110 yuan/piece, y = 0. Substituting these values into the linear equation gives us 0 = 110k + b, leading to b = -110k.3. Refine the Linear Model:   With b = -110k, the equation becomes y = k(x - 110). This model is valid for 10 < x < 110 since the price must be higher than the cost price (10 yuan/piece) and less than or equal to 110 yuan/piece for sales to occur.4. Determine the Daily Profit Function:   The daily profit w can be expressed as w = (x - 10)y. Substituting the refined linear model into this equation gives w = k(x - 10)(x - 110) = k(x^2 - 120x + 1100). This simplifies further to w = k[(x - 60)^2 - 2500].5. Maximize the Profit:   Since k < 0, the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 60. Thus, to maximize daily profit, the price per piece should be boxed{60 , text{yuan}}.# Part (2): Achieving 84% of Maximum Daily Profit1. Set Up the Equation for 84% of Maximum Profit:   To achieve 84% of the maximum daily profit, we set the equation k(x - 10)(x - 110) = -2500k times 84%. This simplifies to x^2 - 120x + 3200 = 0.2. Solve the Quadratic Equation:   Solving the quadratic equation x^2 - 120x + 3200 = 0 yields two possible values for x: x = 40 or x = 80.3.
